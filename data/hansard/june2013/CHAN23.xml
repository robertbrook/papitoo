an issue—let us be honest, there has been an issue since
2008-09—with the contraction of bank lending to businesses in
our communities. That is why we are taking further steps in two
respects. First, with the Bank of England, we are extending the scope
of the funding for lending scheme. It has proved very effective at
getting mortgage rates down, and now we need to reduce the rates for
small businesses. Secondly, we are sorting out the Royal Bank of

Friend’s experience. A powerful argument has been made that we
should completely separate and split up retail banks from investment
banks. We asked John Vickers to convene a commission to look at this
specific subject, and he came forward with proposals to ring-fence
retail banking, as he thought that that would be a better approach. We
also set up a cross-party parliamentary commission to consider the ring
fence, and it thinks that the ring fence is the best approach. It made
a specific recommendation that we should give the regulator the power
to split up a bank that had refused to comply with the ring fence, and
we are giving the
regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:39:12"></hs_TimeCode>—<I>[Interruption.]
</I>The shadow Chancellor shakes his head, but again not one of these
things was done when he was City Minister. Let me say to him again,

Opposition Members support the triple lock, but they did not introduce
it when they were in office. The shadow Chancellor wishes to include
the basic state pension in his short-term cap of welfare spending. Let
me tell the Labour party what that might mean. Last year, the welfare
forecast increased by £2.3 billion; if the pension had been
included in the welfare cap, as the shadow Chancellor suggests, it
would have meant freezing the basic state pension this year, not
increasing it as planned. That is what Labour really means on pensions.

wealthy pensioners; I am sure it will be a matter to discuss at the

rates. If we had not had a credible policy to deal with the record
budget deficit that the previous Government left behind, interest rates
would be a lot higher. In fact, in the last Budget delivered by them,
interest payments on Government debt would have been £30 billion
higher in this Parliament. If interest rates were just 1% higher,

deficit down, but it is rising, and that month-on-month rise in bonuses
is the highest since records began in 2000. There is a simple reason
why that happened: thousands of very highly paid people deferred their
bonuses into the new tax year to take advantage of the
Chancellor’s top rate tax cut, which has cost the Exchequer
millions of pounds in lost tax revenue. How can the Chancellor still
say, “We’re all in this together,” when living
standards are falling for everyone else and the economy has flatlined
for three years? Is not this economic failure the reason why the
Chancellor will not balance the books in 2015 and why he will be coming
back to the House tomorrow to ask for more cuts to public services? He
is unfair and out of touch, and he is now revealed as totally
incompetent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T12:19:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0001.htm#13062570000155"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr George Osborne" PimsId="2219" UID="13062570002071" xid="458" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0001.htm#13062570002071">Mr

how to balance the books is like getting a lesson from Dracula on how
to look after a blood bank. He finds himself in a most extraordinary
situation. On Saturday, the Labour leader
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T12:19:20"></hs_TimeCode> that Labour

“Yes, yes, of course,” and then, on Monday, the Labour
party committed itself to higher welfare spending—it is a
complete shambles. On the eve of the spending review, Labour finds
itself in the extraordinary situation in which it has completely
abandoned the economic argument that it has been making for the past
three years, but kept the disastrous economic policy. That is a
hopeless position. The shadow Chancellor has led Labour Members up a

in effect, be at least doubled in length. The hon. Gentleman has made
his point. I have no idea whether the Minister in any way feels that
his reply to him requires revision or reconsideration in the light of
the verdict of the bank. It has to be said that the expression
“looked into” is a commonly deployed term that has about
it a certain vagueness, and it therefore lends itself to a number of
different interpretations. It would be inappropriate for me to suggest
that anyone has misled the House, and I am certainly not doing so. If

tobacco packaging was mentioned and done so once more when alcohol
pricing was discussed. I do not know. But his company failed to

Trickett:</Member></B> That brings me to my next point. The Prime
Minister said that sunlight is the best disinfectant and I agree, but I
do not believe that the proposals mentioned in the amendment match up
to the requirements. Let me explain why. There are three reasons.
First, it was drawn in such a way as to cover only the narrowest
section of third-party lobbyists, which is less than a quarter of the
whole industry. What is the point of having a register of professional
lobbyists that will not register all professional lobbyists? Secondly,
there is no sign of the Government including in the Bill—it is
certainly not in the White Paper—a code of conduct that would
regulate the register. Even the voluntary code that covers the more
ethical part of the industry already has a code of conduct. Why would
we want to have a lower statutory threshold than that which the more
ethical section of the industry already imposes on itself and its own
members?</hs_Para>

objection to the consultation, as the Government call it, is this:
given that the Government are not proposing a code of conduct, there
can be no sanctions applied against lobbyists who breach the code.
Again, this is a lower standard than the industry’s existing
codes. At the moment, any lobbyist working within the current ethical
voluntary register is forbidden to engage in any improper financial
relationship with any parliamentarian, which brings us to the bones of
the issue.</hs_Para>

voluntary register and someone breaches the code by having such a
relationship with a parliamentarian, they will be removed from the
register and will be unable to practise as a lobbyist. That should be
written into legislation, but it is not envisaged in the White
Paper.</hs_Para>

articulation of those interests is necessary to enable the political
system to be effective. What is required is that the representation of
interests to decision makers is made transparently, fairly, accountably
and free of improper influence. The Nolan principles provide a
high-level framework, as amplified by the code of conduct for Members
here and by the ministerial code. If, in all  
<?notus-xml column=178?>cases, Members and lobbyists lived with the letter and the spirit of
those principles and codes, our system could command greater

register of lobbyists in the context of seeking to make absolutely
clear where a third-party influence is being exercised in relation to
Ministers. I used to be Secretary of State for Health, as Members will
recall. We published our diaries of meetings and when the British
Medical Association came to see me, nobody was under any illusions
about why they did so. That applies, too, to the Royal
College of Nurses, other royal colleges, the Patients Association, the
NHS Federation—the list is endless. There was no doubt about the
nature of the representations from people associated with many of these
organisations. Where a lobbying company is seeking to influence
Ministers, the permanent secretary or whomever it might be, the issue
is knowing who their clients are. That is where the gap lies, and that
is what we are focusing on. <I>[Interruption.] </I>I do not know about

right hon. Gentleman on this point. All the groups he mentioned lobbied
him, quite legitimately, when he was Secretary of State for Health, but
the key issue is whether this lobbying register will go right across
the sort of people that lobbied him, including the lawyers, the
accountants and the big companies, so that everybody is included in the

missed the point, which I have already made. The gap lies where
Ministers, permanent secretaries and—I hope his hon. Friends
will take the matter up—shadow Ministers need to set out who
they meet and for what purpose and on whose behalf they are being met.
When I met members of the BMA and the RCN, we were under no illusions
about that. If I were to meet representatives of a lobbying company
that had a client in an industry and we did not know who the client
was, we would not have the necessary degree of transparency. That is

not because the rules were unclear—although, in the case of the

Parliament and our political system set out to behave well and do
behave well, but, human nature being what it is, the minority who are
tempted to do otherwise need to know that they cannot engage in
sustained, concealed efforts to peddle influence. Their activity will
be brought into the open, and they must expect to be held to account

Let us not forget that it is the Government who control Parliament,

it suits Governments—not just the present Government, but many
Governments in the past—they throw up their hands in mock horror

been complicit, having either not legislated in a timely fashion, or
formed a corrupted relationship with Members of Parliament and others.
The most obvious recent example is the failure to tackle Members of
Parliament’ salaries, the introduction and promotion of a
culture in which the provision of allowances and expenses was
substituted for such action, and the failure, over 20 years, to answer
the question.</hs_Para>

Allen:</Member></B> I think there are many ways to skin this particular
cat. If the Government are serious about creating an effective lobbying
Bill—as many Back-Bench Members and my Select Committee
are—then where there is a will, there is a way. We can find a
way to do that, but the measure in its current form is a reactive and
short-term measure, and it is not part of a serious, well-thought-out
reform package, either by the media, who are keen to nail individual
Members of Parliament, or, more seriously, by the Government, and,
indeed, previous Governments of different political colours.</hs_Para>

hope we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Lobbying is a
very important part of our democracy. I imagine most Members of this 
<?notus-xml column=184?>enfeebled Parliament use lobbying ourselves very directly with Ministers
to try to make our points, and many of us create all-party groups. Some
of us lobby effectively, although, speaking as someone who is lobbying
for the Government to keep their promise on bringing forward proposals
for a House business committee, which was in the coalition agreement,
some of us are also obviously failing in getting the Government to
fulfil their own promises. Government Front-Bench Members will not be

Select Committee has looked at the lobbying question very seriously. We
spent a long time interviewing witnesses. We have eminent Committee
members from different parties—some of whom are present in the
Chamber—and they might not in the normal shape of things be soul
mates or agree on all matters, but they produced a report that the
Government have had in their possession for the best part of a year. It
is a measure of how seriously the Government take this matter that,
first, the Leader of the House is chatting away and not listening to
the Chairman of the Select Committee, who is asking him to do something
he should have done nine months ago, and, secondly, he does not respond
to this House, let alone to me or to my Committee members. That
Ministers just do not bother answering is regarded by many as rather
cavalier.</hs_Para>

if a scandal is revealed by Fleet street and Ministers feel they need
to show how tough they are by taking action and doing something,
suddenly a Bill appears, or the promise of a Bill is made, even before
they respond to a Select Committee of this House. I hope the Leader of
the House will take these matters a little more seriously, because if
he does, and he dares to allow Parliament to be a partner in the
process of making the law—rather than finding something off the

kindly came to our Select Committee last week. They may wish to speak
for themselves, but there has certainly been a lot of correspondence in

practice—and I do not know whether I should raise the matter
with the Chair. However, I would hope that Select Committees of this

usually responded to in a proper way, because that will help us to make
better law, instead of having a knee-jerk response because of one
person being entrapped by the media—I am not expressing any view
on that, as this is still under study—that seems to me to put
the cart before the horse. On an issue where there should be support
across the House, it seems that there is almost a

first fatal flaw we asked the Government to look at was the fact that
so much of the lobbying industry would not be covered by a statutory
register. Just covering third-party lobbyists does not do the job.
There are lots of different figures available, but we found 100
organisations that were third-party lobbyists. Spinwatch, at one end of
the spectrum in this debate, says there are between 3,500 and 4,000
full-time lobbyists. This proposal does not do the job, therefore,
because it is one-eighth of a lobbying Bill, rather than a Bill that
covers lobbyists in their entirety.</hs_Para>

second flaw is that we do not have an effective definition of lobbying,
so that we all know what we are talking about—and so that
lobbyists know what we are talking about, and that Members of
Parliament talking to someone in either a private or public meeting,
perhaps with a tape recorder or video camera concealed and recording
them, know exactly where the lines are. That will enable us to produce
something that is sustainable and that people can live with for many
years to come.

which they can be fed into our law-making process. There needs to be
that starting point—that foundation or bedrock—that we
can build on in future years. Let us put this in place. Some may regard

a fact of political life. The reality is that lobbying is an important
part of our political environment and process. It is a legitimate
activity that is a significant contributor to our political system and
political activity. It brings to our system a number of important
benefits that we would be the poorer for if they were not available: it
allows MPs to hear different sides of an argument and different
prospectuses. MPs themselves lobby on a variety of issues when we hold
passionate beliefs or on matters that relate to our constituencies.
Indeed, we participate in and set up all-party groups, many of which
are involved with lobbying. Arguably, lobbying allows us to become
better informed and more aware of the issues, and, on occasions, we can
even have our minds changed by the evidence put before us by lobbying
groups. I therefore fully support the right of businesses, charities
and other organisations to
lobby.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000392">However,
what is important is that lobbying or campaigning groups supporting a
particular cause should carry out such activities in an open and
transparent way. What we all clearly want to avoid is undue pressure
being exerted or inappropriate activities being carried out. It is
equally important that an individual’s position 
<?notus-xml column=187?>is not compromised, such as through payments being made that are
incompatible with that person’s office.

of criteria for the funding of campaigns by third-party groups during

was spent by third-party groups on campaigning, and it is right that
that should be regulated in the proper way. Any reasonable person would
consider these reforms to be absolutely appropriate. They are all part
of rebuilding the public’s confidence in our politics and a way

Cryer</B> (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab):</Member> I echo earlier comments
made about lobbying. I have always supported a lobbying Bill to create
a register of lobbyists in a transparent and properly regulated way,
but I have no objection to lobbying per se. It is part of everyday
life—or it should be if we are doing our jobs properly. We get
lobbied on a weekly basis, on all sorts of issues, by church groups,
mosques, gurdwaras, temples, community groups and all sorts of
individuals. A woman came to see me a couple of weeks ago and said,
“You are opposed to the sell-off of the Royal Mail,
aren’t you?” When I said that I was, she said,
“Well, on that basis you should also be opposed to gay
marriage.” I did not quite follow the logic of that argument
either, but she had the right to lobby me, and she did so, albeit in a
novel way.</hs_Para>

me is when large concentrations of unaccountable wealth and power are
brought to bear in the lobbying industry. Funnily enough, Jonathan
Aitken said something similar when he was an MP and large business
consortiums were lobbying for the contract to build the Channel tunnel.
At that time lobbying was in full swing, and he—surprisingly in
the light of subsequent
events—said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13062570001899" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570001899">“What
worries me most is that usually lobbying is genuine in the sense that
it stems from little interest groups and concerned citizens. Here we
see the Panzer divisions of big business, their heavy artillery and

of us would probably want to see those interests better defended and
certainly the Prime Minister seemed to want to see that three years ago

before that, too.</hs_Para>

also saw a Government consultation followed by countless commitments
from various Ministers that a Bill would be produced, as we are always

promised what he called “head to toe” political reform,

and 1940s up until the 1970s was Commander Christopher Powell. His name
is probably not familiar now, but years ago he was very well known and

days when MPs never went near their constituencies and did not regard
themselves as constituency Members are long gone. There was once a
national MP for Blackpool called Walter de Frece who, despite the fact
that he was the Member for Blackpool, never went near the place. In
fact, he could not find it on a map. He struggled to find Britain on a
map, because he lived in Monte Carlo. He came to Britain twice a year
for the Budget debate and for Ascot, yet he was elected for years and
years and was regarded as a successful constituency MP. While he was
here, he would get a pile of House of Commons notepaper and sign the
bottom, and then his secretary would fill in the rest. It sounds
extraordinary, but because he managed to reply to a few
letters—this shows how things have changed—he was
regarded as a particularly brilliant constituency MP. Nowadays, that

said when I intervened on the Leader of the House, should include

a lobbyist is as well as who is in and who is out? The Committee has
suggested that anyone who is in a paid, professional role of lobbying
should be covered. That would include in-house lobbyists, of course, as

anyone who lobbied “for commercial gain”, which is

reasonable and would, I suspect, cover all the relevant companies,
associations, trade associations and trade unions, as well as the big
NGOs and people who hire third-party lobbyists or who have in-house

considerable amount of evidence from a wide range of bodies. It is
sometimes difficult to distinguish whether they are giving me evidence

the tendency to dismiss lobbyists and lobbying as a wrong process is to
misunderstand how Parliament should work.</hs_Para>

is pretty straightforward. If I go and lobby the Secretary of State for
Energy about what is happening at Dounreay, it is pretty clear why I
have gone to see him. If Babcock does the same, it is also pretty clear
what is happening. The problem is when people have access to those in
power in a way that is not revealed. An example was given this morning
when Sir Mervyn King made his last appearance before the Treasury
Select Committee. The Chairman asked him a question about lessons
learned. He said that one of the most important things was that the
Prudential Regulation Authority, the body that will control the banks,
had the support of Ministers and Parliament such that the kind of
lobbying that took place in the past—when bankers went to their
supervisors to ask for a lighter judgment on supervision and the
telephone calls he mentioned to No. 11 and sometimes No.

a moment for a simple reason. In relation to visiting a Minister, the
key is not in the Bill or in any legislation that we might pass. The
key is the ministerial code; the key is the fact that the visits by
that company or any other company will be published. I agree with hon.
Members who said that there should be more information; wider detail
should be published about meetings. At the moment, the quarterly
register often just says “general discussion”, and that
is not good enough. I urge those who are responsible for the
ministerial

code a little more often than quarterly. Such things could be done

second point is the difference between in-house and third-party

to me that one has to start somewhere. To me, the third-party lobbyists

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:13:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

to go for perfection. If Oxfam turns up to see the Secretary of State
for International Development, it is pretty obvious what is going to be
talked about. It is far more important that when Messrs Grabit and
Nickit turn up to lobby on behalf of an unknown firm, we have a
registration of who they are and what they do. That is far more

In the recent scandals involving a Member of this House and three
Members of the other place, nothing in this Bill or any other Bill on
lobbying would have changed anything. What they did is already against
the rules. My advice to any Member of this House is that the day
someone comes to them and says, “Would you like
£24,000?”, they are being offered a sting. None of us is
worth that amount.</hs_Para>

fairly shabby little proposal before us is a reaction to a particular
story, rather than an attempt to get things right. It is important that
we have proposals that command cross-party support in the House and
that, if possible, they are subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny. In
my time in the House, a lot of bad legislation has been passed in a
hurry, but a lot of legislation has been made better as a result of
pre-legislative scrutiny, so I do not understand why the Government are
shying away from that process. We need to get the proposals right for
not just this Parliament, but future Parliaments, and we need a clear
definition of “professional lobbying”, a clear code of

Baldwin</B> (West Worcestershire) (Con):</Member> I support the
amendment tabled by the Prime Minister and his right hon. Friends. From
my point of view, lobbying is entirely healthy and integral to our
democracy. This is a point that we have heard from a range of speakers
this afternoon. I like to point out to my constituents that lobbying is
named after Central Lobby. Central Lobby has given its name to this
activity because any constituent can come to Central Lobby while
Parliament is sitting, fill out a green card and summon their MP to the
Lobby so that they can bend their MP’s ear on the issue that
matters particularly to them. We should be looking to encourage and
support lobbying and try to remove from it the taint that has suddenly
emerged, as though it were intrinsically bad and liable to
corruption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:31:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000463" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000463">One
of the things that is so effective in our democracy is that most MPs
are available to their constituents, to listen to them lobbying on a
wide range of concerns. Every Friday I have an open surgery where
people can come to raise issues with me. We should be proud of lobbying
in our democracy. It enriches all our activities as

am pleased to hear the progress that the Government have made on
transparency. I welcome the fact that all Conservative Cabinet
Ministers list the details of the meetings they hold with a wide range
of organisations, and in particular the fact that they name the private
companies which employ public affairs representatives to come and lobby
on behalf of their organisations. That is an advance in terms of
transparency and I should have thought that the shadow Cabinet would
welcome the opportunity to show that level of transparency as
well.</hs_Para>

the first month that I did that, I highlighted the fact that I had had
meetings with, for example, the National Farmers Union. NFU
representatives are extremely effective lobbyists on behalf of farmers
in my constituency. They are extremely knowledgeable in a specialised
area, and it is very important that an MP in an agricultural
constituency such as mine listens to what they have to say on a wide
range of agricultural
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:34:16"></hs_TimeCode>. I agree

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:34:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Nottingham North (Mr Allen), the Chair of the Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee, there is much that we as
parliamentarians can do to ensure that the public are aware of what we
do, know when we meet with lobbyists and understand that lobbying is an
inherent part of our democracy. That transparency could be emphasised
in some of the other things that Parliament does. For example, not
everybody knows that all-party parliamentary groups must publish who is
sponsoring that group. They also have to publish when they work with an
MP to take a room—the House of Commons accounts must show who
hired the
room<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:35:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000468" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000468">Transparency
in relation to early-day motions would also be healthy. I wonder
whether colleagues will support me on this. I can honestly say that I
have so far resisted signing a single early-day motion. We have seen
how they are sometimes used by lobbyists as a way of showing that they
have done something in Parliament, when in reality it is not a
particularly effective tool. Some colleagues are more enthusiastic
about early-day motions than others. That is another area where we as a
Parliament and as MPs could do more to show
transparency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000469" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000469">What
do we say about organisations such as 38 Degrees? That organisation has
done a wonderful job in bringing to our democratic attention a wide
range of views held across the e-mail communication channel. Given that
it plays such an active role in encouraging our constituents to lobby
us on a wide range of issues, it would be interesting and informative
to know how such an organisation is able to pay public affairs
professionals and others to encourage constituents to write to their
MPs. That is the level of transparency for which we as parliamentarians

Members, I am lobbied every day, by my electorate and by people who

a perfectly honourable process. Provided that it is carried out in an

substance of Parliament and does not detract from
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000479" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000479"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:40:54"></hs_TimeCode>However,
there is rather more to the issue than simply whether lobbying is
carried out in a transparent way. It is a question not just of whether
sunlight is the best disinfectant, but whether in addition to sunlight
we need Sunlight soap in order to scrub the process clean. That is what
the public remain concerned about. As hon. Members have said, it is not
just about the transparency of lobbying, but about the way in which it
is carried out,  
<?notus-xml column=200?>the secrecy of substantial elements of it and the influence that is
brought to bear as a result of certain arrangements that lobbyists can
make regarding resources, access and various other things. Those
concerns relate not only to third-party lobbyists but are across the
board.</hs_Para>

we ought to apply a comparative principle in devising what we want to
achieve by having a register of lobbyists. If we think about it for a
moment, we realise that what we—the parties set up in this
House—do in seeking votes is lobby the electorate, and we must
do so in a reasonable, bounded and temperate way. A number of sanctions
have been laid down in law for a very long time to ensure that lobbying
of the electorate is restrained and that we do not go beyond those
bounds. They are known as the electoral
offences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000481" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000481">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:43:03"></hs_TimeCode>

of this House was asked, “Would you like to be a director of my
company? I’ll give you £24,000”, that is a very
straightforward approximation of the offence of bribery as it relates
to this House. There is also the offence of treating, which means
saying to the electorate, “I’ll buy you a slap-up dinner,
and drinks at the bar are on us, provided you vote for us.” The
parallel, as far as our affairs are concerned, would be offering a

are two other main electoral offences that relate to our lobbying of
the electorate, and the Secretary of State has referred to one in
relation to the content of his proposed Bill. He said that we want to
know who is lobbying us and that the Government will legislate to fill
that gap. That is the offence of personation. We need to know who is
exercising the vote. If we were to try to defraud the electorate by
having someone vote in place of the person who really had the vote, an
electoral offence would be
committed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000485">The
final major electoral offence is that of undue influence. That is the
parallel offence that is wholly absent from the proposed
legislation as it relates to our proceedings. Undue influence is not
about whether someone is paid or given a weekend away, or whether
someone else stands in their place; it is about someone exercising
various means of persuading another person to vote for them that are
beyond the cause of reasonable lobbying. That seems to me to be the
crux of the issue. The proposals do not provide for an overall register
of all lobbyists, with sanctions and the ability to throw people off
it, properly to take account of the question of undue influence in the
lobbying process.</hs_Para>

am sorry that that appears to be the way the proposed legislation is
proceeding, because it could easily be fixed by some fairly brief
discussions between the parties. After all, this is a matter that
affects not just one particular party or Government. The legislation
needs to stand the test of different Governments of different parties.
It is an issue that concerns all parties and this House. Therefore, it
seems to me that above all the legislation must be proceeded with on
the basis of what the parties think is the right way
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000487" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000487">It
is shocking that the Government have taken a year to respond to the
all-party Select Committee inquiry on lobbying and what can be done
about it. That is way out of line with what is normally expected of
Government responses to Select Committee reports. That ought to be
rectified immediately. Pre-legislative scrutiny of what is proposed
would not derail the legislation unduly. For example, the Energy and
Climate Change Committee was recently given six weeks to consider the
entire draft Energy Bill before it came to the House. Pre-legislative
scrutiny would give a vital opportunity to get something that works
across the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000488">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:47:47"></hs_TimeCode>
am a little disappointed that much of this afternoon’s debate
has been something of a knockabout rather than about principle. I have
tried to inject into the proceedings a little focus on what we are
really about, which is principles for legislation. Between us, we must
ensure that the legislation works for the future. If that takes a few
weeks of discussions between parties to get it right, and if there is a
little give and take with regard to how it will work, that will be a
good thing for the House. If it ensures that undue influence is not
exercised in the House by lobbyists, if it is clear about who should be
included in the rules, and if the public are confident that the right
people are included in those rules, that, too, would be a gain for us
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000489" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000489">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:48:48"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that the Government will not decide this afternoon that this is
about bashing the Opposition’s motion and getting their
amendment through; it is about trying to get something through that is
good for us all. If that means both sides laying the motion on the
Table in order to proceed, perhaps that would be a good thing for the
House. I think that above all we need to get the legislation on
lobbying right so that everyone benefits in future. It is not about one
party scoring a few points from the other in the short

beginning of the debate, there seemed little chance of consensus, but
as it has gone on issues have emerged on which Members on both sides of
the House can be pleased that progress has been made. We have, however,
either underplayed or glossed over three specific points, the first of
which is obviously one of definition. Despite numerous speeches on the
topic, we are still pretty unclear about precisely who should or might
be caught by the proposals. Secondly, we have, I believe, slightly
underplayed the positive contribution made by lobbyists to many of our
lives—not only in the House, 
<?notus-xml column=202?>but in our constituencies. Thirdly, we have made some progress, albeit
not much, on how the matter can be properly
resolved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000492" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000492">We
need to give the greatest care and longest time to the problem of
definition. We have touched on the role of pressure groups, which
include charities, as well as industry representatives—a phrase
that could cover a multitude of sins. Local groups could be well funded
or well advised or simply put themselves together on the spur of the
moment to lobby us in our constituencies on a particular interest or
issue. The words “professional lobbyist” have been used
without much qualification during the debate. More clarity on who would
come under that description is crucial if we are to get things
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000493"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Thomas" PimsId="4261" UID="13062570002288" xid="589" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570002288">Mr

entirely respect his view. I sometimes think we underplay the obstacles

Ministers. We are talking about creating not only new legislation, but
legislation on top of an already stringent set of rules. Again, I am
not trying to duck the issue, but I will come back to the hon.

turn to what I call “donor lobbyists”, the strongest part
of whose argument appears to be the strength of their bank balances. I
am interested that the Labour party has made concessions on that,
particularly with regard to the influence of trade unions. For some
time, a concern among Members on the Government Benches has been how we
could have a register of lobbyists that did not include everybody.
Members on both sides of the House have made progress on that during
this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000498" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000498">I
shall make only two further points, the first of which is our strange
obsession with what we seem to call these days “professional
lobbyists” without any real qualification of what they might be,
although the Chairman of the Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee 
<?notus-xml column=203?>went some distance towards that. Plenty of people consider themselves to
be professional lobbyists but have many other strings to their bows and
do many other things for the organisations they represent. Are they or
might they be considered professional lobbyists under the proposals? We
have yet to find
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000499" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000499">It
strikes me as odd that we seem to gloss over some of the big
organisations. Tesco has been mentioned, probably unfairly, as an
organisation that might not fall under the proposals because everybody
knows what it stands for. Actually, that is not right. Tesco might come
into this building to lobby on fuel prices, planning, food labelling or
any number of issues that come under its jurisdiction. We have to be
careful about drawing some random arbitrary line above which some
people go. Rather than re-establish public confidence in what we do, we
could end up causing great disappointment to those interested in the
proposals and do ourselves considerable harm in the process. Likewise,
there are plenty of well financed, organised and documented pressure
groups—campaigning against or in favour of major wind farm
developments or things such as HS2—that are unquestionably
engaged in very sophisticated lobbying.</hs_Para>

surprise hon. Members to hear that I want more lobbyists; I think they
are a good thing and bring great variety and strength as long as we
treat them with sufficient recognition and responsibility. Doing
anything that might deter people from being able to lobby us pretty
well however they wanted would be a counter-productive road down which
we should not
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000501" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000501">We
seem to have overlooked some existing legislation—the Freedom of
Information Act 2000. Whenever I have wanted to know what has been
going on in the darkened corners of ministerial offices, I have simply
put in a freedom of information request and have probably acquired most
of the information I have wanted about who is meeting whom and on what
basis. Let us not reinvent something that already exists and to which
every member of the public has perfect
access.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000502" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000502">Lastly,
I want to touch on two things. First, there is the positive
contribution of lobbying, which some of us seem to have slightly
overlooked. Personally, my life would grind to an absolute halt if
lobbyists representing all sorts of different groups did not supply me
with lots of useful, expert information on a range of subjects and
completely free to the taxpayer. If we had to get our offices to pay
for that information, the taxpayer might have something to say about
that. Let us not for one minute make it more difficult for responsible
organisations —charities, industry pressure groups or anything
else—to provide us with a constant stream of high quality
information, which makes us more likely to produce decent
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000503" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000503">Having
read the Government’s amendment to the Opposition proposal, I am
confident that we are pointing in the right direction on resolutions.
We need to avoid reforms that are simply a partial list of names on a
piece of paper. We must not over-regulate a responsible industry; that
might unintentionally make the life of the charitable sector, in which
I have some interest, all the more difficult. If we end up in a
situation where people who donate to charities or contribute to
charitable activity think that their donations may become the subject
of political debate or some public declaration, that might make them,
for all sorts of sensible reasons, much less inclined to make their
generous contributions to those 
<?notus-xml column=204?>charities. If the consequence of our trying to resolve a political issue
in this building is that we end up deterring people from supporting
valuable charities, we will not have done a good job in the eyes of the
public, but a very bad one.</hs_Para>

gets to the heart of the complexities of the debate. I hope we can
reflect on the views held by Members on both sides of the House, and
particularly the view of the Chair of the Select Committee. We should

we have not done something.</hs_Para>

from a handful of the contributions this afternoon that we could
legislate in great haste and make an absolute horlicks of this. It
would be much more sensible for us to work our way steadily through the

rather than having been able to tick a box and sign off an aspect of
the coalition agreement, we will have created a situation in which,
when the next lobbying scandal comes along—and it unquestionably
will—people will ask what the register was all about and why it
did not prevent the scandal from occurring. We will have to look them

Delving back not too far, who can forget Sir John Trevor, a former
Speaker of the House who was expelled both from the speakership and
from Parliament for accepting a 1,000 guinea bribe from the City of
London to promote a Bill on orphanages? Interestingly, the Chairman of
the Bill Committee, Mr Hungerford, received only 20 guineas

the Member for West Worcestershire (Harriett Baldwin) so rightly said,
it is an historic right of every one of our constituents to come to
Central Lobby, demand our presence and tell us their views on whatever
subject is important to them. That is a wonderful historic right. It is
a pity that people do not know about it and do not use it more. We
ought to encourage our constituents to come and lobby us in that way.
There is a nobility in lobbying that must not be lost in the midst of
the discussion about what is, in effect, corruption. Let us try to use
the terms differently and not allow lobbying to become a polite term
for criminality, dishonesty and
corruption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:13:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000526" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000526">Within
British politics, there are essentially two types of lobbying. There is
the lobbying of Members of Parliament, which is perhaps the triumph of
hope over experience, whereby people come to see somebody such as
myself, a junior Back-Bench MP, and say that they want me to do this,
that and the next thing and to change legislation, thinking that the
Prime Minister and the Leader of the House hang on my every word.
Sadly, I have to tell such people that that is not quite 
<?notus-xml column=208?>how it works. MPs have the ability to debate and argue, but not
necessarily to change the course of the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Then
there is the lobbying of Ministers, who have a much greater and more
direct Executive power—a decision-making power, rather than
merely an influencing power. The two types of lobbying need to be
regulated differently and
separately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:14:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000527">There
is a difference between those on the Opposition Front Bench and the

reality of power and lobbying them can have a direct influence on what

openness and transparency than Opposition Front Benchers, who ought to
be entitled to their smoke-filled rooms, although as they are
socialists, the rooms will have no smoke in them, because they do not

entitled to expel Members who misbehave. We may do so not according to
a detailed set of rules, but according to whether we believe, as a
House, that they have undermined the reputation of the House and have
not behaved like honourable Members. Such a decision is not justiciable

peerage comes from the sovereign, whereas our position in this House
comes from the people to whom we can be sent back. To get rid of a
peerage requires primary legislation. That was done in 1917 to remove a
group of peers who were fighting for the Germans and the Austrians
during the first world war. It is open to this House to do that with
the other place. We may pass an Act of Parliament to remove a category
of peers who have committed offences. The House of Lords itself can

the person expelled with a right of appeal to his constituents. The

have been a Member of this House since May 2010. When I was considering
standing for selection as a candidate, I had to think carefully about
whether this was something I wanted to do. I had concerns about the
male culture and ethos of this place, and the impact that that would
have on me as a woman MP. On that, my worst fears have been more than
realised. I also had concerns about leaving a relatively successful
career in education where I was relatively well respected to become a
Member of Parliament, when the path to Parliament is hardly littered
with respect and trust. I think we all know the reasons for that: it is
not just the scandal in the previous Parliament but the view, widely
felt out there among sections of the public, that we are all in it for
ourselves and that election to Parliament is an open door to all kinds
of experiences and funding not available to the general
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:24:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000543">I
know that the vast majority of Members of this House are here because
they genuinely want to make a difference to the lives of the people we
represent. We may do that in different ways and we may have different
priorities, but that is the reason why we are here. Scandals connected
with lobbying, like those highlighted in the press in recent weeks,
simply reinforce the negative view of politics and politicians, and the
view that the relationship between lobbyists and politicians is far too
close and is built upon mutual
greed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:25:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

be really difficult to regain the trust of the public, but surely a
good start is to put in place a statutory register of professional
lobbyists that is backed up by regulation and includes a clear
definition of what we mean by lobbying. When I say a clear definition,
I mean a definition that will make sense to the people who vote for us.
That should not just include third-party lobbyists, but in-house
lobbyists and anyone who lobbies for commercial gain. Our constituents
understand that the majority of all-party parliamentary groups provide
information for parliamentarians, and work to influence MPs on issues
of concern. All-party groups that support the work of parliamentarians
in education, care leavers, social mobility, multiple sclerosis, breast
cancer, ovarian cancer and autism—all groups that I am happy to
say I am involved in—and the charities and even companies that
support those groups, are not lobbying Members with anything other than
good intentions. It is right that those groups have access to
politicians, and that is what our constituents would expect.</hs_Para>

it is also clear to our constituents that we need regulation for
all-party groups funded by private companies and for organisations that
are bidding for Government contracts, offering lucrative jobs to former
Ministers, MPs and Peers, and whose profits depend on Government
policy. At its most basic, this issue is about the rich and powerful
gaining access to those in government who make decisions, very often
financial decisions, that can affect a company’s bottom line.
That access is not available to the rest of the population. Although we
may never be able to stop that completely, it is important that we
regulate it and make it
transparent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:27:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000546" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000546">I
have to admit that I have received very little of what I would consider
to be lobbying for commercial gain, but that is probably because I tend
to involve myself in areas of activity that do not attract lucrative
contracts. However, as the Government privatise more areas of health
and education it will be harder to avoid. It is therefore ever more
important that we have a statutory register in place that includes not
only a clear definition of professional lobbying, but a code of conduct
that is so clear that our constituents will understand it and approve
of it, including a headline that forbids inappropriate financial
relations between lobbyists and parliamentarians. I know that that is
difficult. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:28:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

could be prevented from working in Parliament again, and that in the
most serious cases matters could be referred to the police and
ultimately result in jail sentences. Despite the Prime
Minister’s promises that he would deal with this, all he has
done is to kick it into the long grass and he has only retrieved it

I want to say that Labour did put a voluntary code of practice in place
in 2009 but, like so many other voluntary codes of practice, it simply
did not work. We need a statutory code of practice; something that has
teeth and will bite. Our constituents need to see that, this time, we
mean business. That will happen only if there is a statutory code of
practice in place that works, so that those who breach it—MPs,
peers and lobbyists—are dealt with severely. This will not in
itself reinstate trust in politics, but it will be a good place to
start.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_25_PT_1/67FF400B81D324F396BCA00ADEBB82387AA7B3E8" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="25 June 2013">Tuesday

decisions made in Parliament take place in rooms to which we are not
invited. That is important. Who influences the decisions in those
rooms? Very often, in this day and age, it is election strategists. I
have no objection to election strategists but if we are to have
transparency in representation to decision- makers, we must have
transparency in who election strategists, for all political parties,
are also representing outside that very important

that much of the lobbying we get is critical to helping MPs do their
jobs: the letter from constituents demanding improvements in patient
care, the quiet word from small businesses about the failure of big
banks to lend money. These are all forms of lobbying, and they all

the growth in the amount of evidence on the scale of lobbying and its

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:37:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Warrington North (Helen Jones) and for Easington
(Grahame M. Morris) made clear, the public’s concern is that
much of the lobbying industry is hidden from public view. A lobbyist is
not obliged to identify who they are, what they do, the sources of
their finance, who their ultimate client is and how much is being
spent. In short, there is no requirement on lobbyists or those who want
lobbying done to operate in the open, in the light, where their
conversations and the responses of those they lobby can be scrutinised
more effectively.</hs_Para>

best lobbyists, it is true, operate according to an ethical code, but
comparatively few are signed up to the various codes that exist, so
without clear legal force and teeth, such voluntary codes of conduct
will clearly not be taken seriously enough by all in the industry.
There have been a series of revelations about the scale of big
business’s influence on key Government legislation, such as, for
example, the Leader of the House’s disastrous Health and Social
Care Act 2012. I am not against the lobbying of Government by big
business—I welcome it on the same basis as I welcome all
lobbying—but it has to be done in the open. It would appear,
however, as a result of the Government’s proposals, that
lobbyists working directly for big business groups will not be required
to register—an extraordinary situation—to abide by any
code of conduct or to spell out what they are lobbying about.</hs_Para>

of Health and throughout Whitehall, not the voice of ordinary people in
Britain. There are other international examples of clearer, tougher

office. Out of 4,000-plus declared ministerial meetings recorded by the

congratulate the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:41:08"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Members for Hemsworth (Jon Trickett) and for Harrow West (Mr
Thomas) on initiating the debate and on giving the coalition Government
an opportunity to set out how we are tackling third-party influence. I
am happy to congratulate them, but I must gently chastise them too.
Their motion is the most egregious attempt to jump on a bandwagon that
I have seen in recent years. They call on the Government to introduce a
Bill on lobbying before the summer recess, when we had already
announced such a Bill two weeks
before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:41:38"></hs_TimeCode>. At the
same time, and in the same breath, for the first time in three years
they are calling for cross-party talks when they know that such talks
would make the task of delivering a Bill by the summer recess virtually
impossible. They will of course have an opportunity to demonstrate
their desire for a consensual, cross-party approach as the Bill makes
its passage through the House, and we look forward to their
wholehearted and constructive
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:42:05"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:42:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000566" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000566">I

his Committee plays. I know that he will not be entirely satisfied with
the way in which the Government intend to proceed, given the report
that the Committee has produced, but I believe that our proposals are
well thought out, perfectly formed and tightly focused. We will not
adopt the full-blown register that he is seeking, but I hope that our
proposals on a third-party register and those on ministerial
reporting—which will require any meeting with an in-house
lobbyist to be reported, with a description of the
discussions—will provide the transparency that he
wants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570000567" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570000567"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Allen" PimsId="3636" UID="13062570002308" xid="9" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0002.htm#13062570002308">Mr
Allen:</Member></B> Speaking on behalf of the Select Committee, which
studied the proposals in some detail, I am not proposing that the
Government should accept the things that we said in our report. I am
saying that the House as a whole should be given, say, three weeks
under the auspices of the Select Committee to examine the Bill
seriously, preferably before its Second Reading but even during an
interregnum after that point, so that any Member, anyone in Government
and anyone in the lobbying profession can make their views plain.
Whatever shape the Bill is in—I am sure that it is perfectly
formed—we might be able to improve it slightly through such an
examination.</hs_Para>

She, too, did not take account of the fact that meetings with in-house
lobbyists are reported. Those who want to establish whom Ministers have
met and why, and the dates on which they have met, can refer to the
quarterly report, and can then ask questions if they wish to do so. If,
for instance, it concerns them that a Minister has met representatives
of Tesco to discuss food labelling, they can pursue the matter further.
However—this is relevant to what my hon. Friend the Member for

to rich states. Climate change will reduce available land, food and

new multilateralism, and that our armed forces must be higher-skilled,
focused on stabilisation, cultural embedding and building other
nations’ underdeveloped forces so that they can share the burden

we, as the Opposition, have worked with business to develop and deliver

veterans a guaranteed interview or other form of enhanced employment

that abuse of the forces should be treated as aggravated, thus
guaranteeing specific punishment for those who attack our forces. The

refused service in a public place. The Bill also proposes to outlaw
discrimination against members of the forces in the provision of goods

The Government, as part of a national effort, should help to lead the

degree of understanding. The approach that we favour, as the hon.

for those without qualifications. This should apply across the UK
because while education may be devolved in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland, our collective responsibility to our forces is not. I want to

specialist training in literacy teaching, increased provision of Army

the armed forces covenant an important objective and why we enshrined

not face disadvantage with regard to the provision of public and
commercial services, and that special consideration is appropriate in

£35 million from the fines levied on banks for attempting to
manipulate the LIBOR interest rate to support the armed forces

of this funding included £1 million for Fisher House, which

other local organisations are well placed to understand and respond to
the needs of their armed forces communities. To date, over 330 local

Gentleman. I also visited Northern Ireland, and was briefed in detail

ground level. In terms of practical day-to-day measures, it is working

and needs are represented. Westminster city council is changing its
procedures on housing allocation so that service personnel will not
slip down the list if they are posted overseas on operations. We
encourage local authorities to give special consideration to veterans
when considering the allocation of service housing; I hope

decisions, and although I do not wish to spoil the bipartisan nature of
this debate, the hon. Gentleman will know what lay behind many of them:
the very difficult financial situation we inherited in the Ministry of
Defence. Having made that point, I will not dwell on it. From memory,
just over 60% of those affected in tranche 1 were applicants who had
applied for redundancy, the tranche 2 figure was just over 70% and I
believe the figure for tranche 3 was 84%, so a larger proportion of
those in tranche 3 have applied to go voluntarily. However, we do
realise that these are very difficult decisions and we provide support
for all those leaving as redundees via the Career Transition
Partnership, which has a very good track record of getting people into
employment within six months or so of their leaving the forces. When
people do leave the forces, we therefore do everything we can to
support them, but I say again that we had to take some very difficult
decisions because of what we were bequeathed.</hs_Para>

endure well beyond the end of operations in 2014 to harness all that

plays an enormously important role. It provides information
communication systems to the emergency services and local government in
an emergency. That is not something that it just practises and train

more important, the community of Sheffield supports our armed forces,

newspapers and other media will take note that the House of Commons is
today united in support of our armed forces, and that we have complete
respect for them and all that they do 
<?notus-xml column=249?>for our country. That is a substantial change from what it was like when
I first came here 30 years ago, when there was trench warfare between
the parties—to use a military expression. That does not apply

salute the attempts that the previous Government made to engage the
British people. I have no doubt that Armed Forces day, previously
Veterans day, has served as a valuable focus to draw the
public’s attention to the role played by our armed forces and to
get behind them. That is evidenced by the huge amount of money that the
public willingly give to a range of charities—not just Help for
Heroes but wonderful charities such as Combat Stress. They have done a
great job, as did General Lord Dannatt in encouraging the public to
express their support for Her Majesty’s armed

will be marking Armed Forces day with a military festival in Aldershot
for the whole of next week, and the Aldershot military will be part of
the celebrations. I pay tribute to the outgoing military commanders in
Aldershot: Colonel Mike Russell, the garrison commander, who has done a
fantastic job over a short time of liaising with the local community
and running the garrison; and Brigadier Neil Baverstock, the commander
of 145 Brigade, who might be more widely known to hon.
Members and has also done a superb job. He retires from the Army this
week to assume a role with a wonderfully outmoded

repatriation of our forces from Germany. With the new building that is

context of our debate is more difficult, however. As the Minister of
State, Ministry of Defence, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Rayleigh and Wickford (Mr Francois), mentioned, we are having to make
cuts to our armed forces, but that is difficult for Conservative
Members, because we believe that the defence of the realm is the first
duty of Government. However, the public finances that we inherited had
been completely destroyed, so we have had to make unpleasant decisions.
I hope that our withdrawal from Afghanistan will reduce the pressure on
our armed forces, but I cannot be certain that Her Majesty’s
Government will not be faced with other emergencies throughout the
world. Given that the Prime Minister rightly wants the United Kingdom
to play the significant role of trying to fashion the world in which we
live, rather than simply reacting to it, our armed forces are unlikely
to be kicking their heels on the parade ground in Colchester,
Aldershot, Catterick or

leverage fantastic influence for the United Kingdom. I welcome the
defence engagement strategy, which I had some part in preparing when I
was a Minister. There is a focus in the Ministry of Defence on that
strategy and on how we leverage defence diplomacy to the advantage of
the United Kingdom to influence events in the world, as well as in the
wider context of supporting our defence industry. I am delighted that
the Opposition’s excellent motion—I salute them for
this—refers 
<?notus-xml column=250?>to the work force of the British defence industry and the support that

Blenkinsop</B> (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) (Lab):</Member>
More than eight months ago one of my constituents contacted me, fearing
that, come April this year, her sons would be left homeless, owing
to what has become known as the bedroom tax. Like thousands
of other people across Teesside and East Cleveland and the United
Kingdom, my constituent, Alison, would have had to find an extra
£100 per month because she was deemed to have spare rooms. For
those hon. Members not familiar with Alison’s story and
therefore questioning the relevance of the bedroom tax to this debate,
I hasten to add that her two sons are both serving in the armed forces,
one of them on the front line in Afghanistan as we
speak<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. We have a
proud military tradition in Teesside and East Cleveland and
Alison’s story rightly began to attract attention from the local

was not too long ago that the armed forces covenant was enshrined in
law. This was meant to recognise that the whole nation has a moral
obligation to members of the armed forces and their families, and it
established how they should expect to be treated and to redress the
disadvantages that the armed forces community faces in comparison with
other
citizens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:40:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570001795" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001795">Alison
has been a tenant of the same housing association for nearly two
decades, and in this home she had single-handedly brought up her twin
boys. Despite this history, she spoke to her housing officer about
moving to a smaller property, only to be told that the association does
not have enough one-bedroom properties to meet the needs of everyone.
Alison was not opposing the Government’s policy out of
stubbornness. She was trying her hardest to adapt to it but, as we are
finding out across the country, the policy is one of the most
ill-thought out that this Government have implemented, and the
appropriate accommodation simply is not
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:40:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

after Alison initially brought her situation to my attention, national
interest in the issue understandably peaked. Alison’s case was
even raised by the Leader of the Opposition during Prime
Minister’s questions, in which the Prime Minister insisted that
the changes were “fair”. Nevertheless, in early March
this year, the coalition Government performed an apparent U-turn when
they made the following

may now be thinking that that is an excellent outcome and that the
Government have realised their mistake and put it right, as did I, but
unfortunately Alison’s story, and more than likely that of many
others like her, does not end with this apparently successful change in
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:41:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570001799" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001799">It
has been almost three months since the bedroom tax came into being and
I am sure Members will have noticed the impact of the policy on their
work load. Alison’s family has still been hit by the bedroom tax
and she is now in rent arrears. The rushed U-turn has left the new
rules unclear, with local authorities interpreting them with varying
degrees of success. Unfortunately, because of the way in which the
Government have worded the regulations, only a tiny number of
personnel, primarily reservists, will be exempt. If they lived in
barracks prior to going away on operations and/or prior to commencing
pre-deployment training, the Department for Work and Pensions holds
that they are not the claimant’s non-dependent children.
Operations include deployment abroad, pre-deployment and the debriefing
process at end of deployment. Therefore, the exemption applies only to
a small number of people, and DWP Ministers have confirmed this in
response to written questions. To all intents and purposes, the
Government seem to be redefining what adult children who are members of
the armed forces register as their
homes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:42:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570001800" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001800">It
is true that people can have a number of residences. However, for tax
purposes, only one home or domicile is used. If, as seems to be
suggested by Ministers who have responded to questions on this issue
from me and from the shadow Work and Pensions Minister, the Government
consider barracks the home of adult children who usually live there,
the barracks should be used for tax purposes also. The regulations
suggest to working-class young men and women that joining the forces
may jeopardise their parents’ home—hardly a wise

is grossly unfair to differentiate on this basis. It is a very
mean-spirited technicality. The motion we are here to debate today is
one to celebrate and commemorate our armed forces, and the armed forces
covenant is a key way for us to do this. It recognises that the whole
nation has a moral obligation to members of the armed forces and their
families, and it establishes how they should expect to be treated. If
that is the law, the least our young adults serving in the armed forces
deserve is to have their ability to live in their homes with their

direct attack on those who are putting their lives on the line to keep
us all safe. The Government cannot get away with statements that appear
to resolve an issue but which, in reality, are deliberately intended to

regard to the armed forces covenant, the Defence Committee, of which I

conflicts are emerging already between the armed forces covenant and
the definition of social housing for single former military personnel.
I think that there has to be a ruling on that, because some local
authorities are interpreting it differently from what the armed forces
covenant means. I am concerned that the community covenant might, in
some cases, be paying lip service, rather than being a reality. We need

earlier, the people of Dudley make a huge contribution to the armed
forces through the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry, a
Territorial Army regiment with a base at Vicar street in Dudley. The
regiment has a history in the region dating back to 1794, and A
Squadron has had a base on Vicar street for more than 20 years. It
attracts recruits from across the black country, having recently taken
on 47 trainees; it is processing another 60 at the moment. Two dozen
volunteers are currently on active service in Afghanistan. It is a
popular and expanding squadron in a popular and expanding regiment with
deep roots in the local and regional communities. In fact, it is one of
the best recruited yeomanry regiments in the whole Territorial
Army.</hs_Para>

will be pleased to hear that the regiment is making exactly the sort of
contribution they are asking for as they seek to double the size of the
TA in the next few years. However, under current proposals, the
regiment could be disbanded to make way for a new Scottish regiment. A
Squadron in Dudley would be merged with B Squadron in Telford, and the
Telford base would cease to be a regional headquarters, becoming part
of the Royal Yeomanry regiment based in Croydon. The Telford squadron
would end up paired with a new Queen’s Dragoon Guards regiment
in the regular Army, based in Norfolk. Together with other changes to
squadrons in the midlands, this means that the RMLY would be disbanded,
despite its history and the contribution that people in Dudley and the
wider black country make to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:54:46"></hs_TimeCode>. The midlands
would lose half of its five squadrons and a regional HQ. If we lost the
Vicar street base, 
<?notus-xml column=255?>people who have done a full day’s work in
Dudley would have to travel 30 or 40 miles to do their training and
fulfil their responsibilities in Telford, which is unlikely.</hs_Para>

Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:55:18"></hs_TimeCode> if bases in

in Nelson’s day wounded sailors were taken up to the Royal Navy
Hospital Haslar to recover, or otherwise. Of course, in those days they
were not necessarily as keen to be part of the Royal Navy as people
might be these days. They were held prisoner so that they did not
desert while being treated, and some tried to escape by going through
the sewers to the creek. I hope that these days people are much more

of those issues is the opportunity to balance military and family life.
That is a particular problem in the Royal Navy, which has the most
unfavourable harmony arrangements of the three main services. That is
why it is so important that shore-based military training is delivered
as close as is possible to the big military communities. In Gosport,
the marine engineering training at HMS Sultan, which is rated
outstanding by Ofsted, gives Navy families a rare opportunity to live
as a normal family, with husbands and wives coming home every

big challenge is service mobility, which risks disadvantaging personnel
and their dependants with regard to access to local public services,
such as doctors surgeries, schools and social housing. The rate of home
ownership is lower among service personnel than in the nation as a
whole. Accessing school places has always been a challenge. The pupil
premium that forces families now receive is hugely welcome. However,
accessing school places continues to be a challenge. In big military
communities, it is difficult for schools to maintain places for forces
families. One of my constituents has five children at four different
schools, which causes enormous
difficulty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:01:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

problem relates to ongoing treatment and support. Serving in the armed
forces comes with the inherent risk of serious physical and mental
injury, which can result in the need for ongoing treatment and welfare
support for service people and their families. I have talked about the
legacy of the military buildings in Gosport, but there is a legacy in
the people too. Many of my constituents have served in the armed
forces. Many have given up the best years of their life and their good
health for our country. Tragically, this country has not always given
enough back. I have been troubled on countless occasions by the stories
of ex-service personnel who have not received the help that they need

community organisations in my constituency help service personnel who

are having this debate today, because this evening I will have the huge
pleasure of hosting an RAF Bomber Command dinner as vice-chair of the
all-party parliamentary group for the armed forces with responsibility
for the RAF. This evening, we will welcome Douglas Radcliffe MBE, a
wireless operator; Commodore Charles Clarke OBE, a navigator; Alf
Huberman, Bob Gill DFM and Harry Irons DFC, air gunners; Doug Newham
LVO DFC, an observer; and Les Temple, who was on special duties, all of
whom were part of Bomber Command during the last
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570001841" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001841">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>
House will remember that Bomber Command played a crucial part in
maintaining this country’s freedom: 55,000 airmen lost their
lives during the second world war, a truly staggering death rate of
44.4%; 8,500 were wounded in action; and 10,000 were captured and
interned. They were very young men—the average age was 22. The
group I am hosting this evening are, on the whole, very old men, but
men with a proud history of service to their country. I am pleased that
many colleagues will be joining me to welcome them here to this

we are looking at what we do for our armed forces in the present. My
local authority, Bridgend county borough council, has signed a

veterans champion. We take that responsibility very seriously. On
Friday, I will be attending a Royal Navy eve of Armed Forces day

field gun demonstration. I am sure that

raised a number of issues in an Adjournment debate earlier this year.
Following that debate, it was brought to my attention that the Armed
Forces Act 2006 contains an anomaly for which I can find no reasonable
explanation. The Act contains a list of what are known as schedule 2
offences, and requires a commanding officer to report those offences to
service police. Explicitly spelled out in the Act is the exclusion of
sections 3, 66, 67 and 71 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 from schedule
2. These sections cover sexual assault, exposure, voyeurism and sexual
activity in a public lavatory. This means that if an individual reports
any of these offences to their commanding officer, there is no
requirement in law for that report to be referred to the service
police—the report can stay within the chain of command. I can
find no explanation for that. It was not clarified in the Public Bill
Committee’s deliberations, and the House of Commons Library was
unable to shed any light on it. To date, I have not received a reply to
a letter I wrote to the Minister on 23 April on this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:07:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the civilian world, no individual would be required to report a sexual
assault to their employer; they would go straight to the police. Their
military counterparts are at a distinct disadvantage. I draw the
attention of Ministers to the YouTube clip of Lieutenant-General David
Morrison speaking on sexual offences in the Australian military. It is
a fantastic clip, in which he makes it very clear that sexual offences
have no place in the Australian military. He says that armed forces

have also talked of the need for a service ombudsman. Yet again, the
Service Complaints Commissioner has said that the service complaints
system is not working efficiently, effectively or fairly.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:09:26"></hs_TimeCode> seems to
be resistance from the chain of command, who fear it would undermine
their authority. We cannot continue with a halfway house. Our
servicemen and women deserve an ombudsman who can take forward their
complaints, so that they can have a right to
justice.</hs_Para>

start by paying tribute to all our armed forces, all who support them
and, given the flavour of previous speeches, to the awesome Portsmouth
military wives choir, but it will be no surprise to the Minister that I
wish to focus my speech on the issue of the Service 
<?notus-xml column=259?>Complaints Commissioner. I am extremely pleased with the work that
Ministers have done on this, and with their recognition of the
importance of the role and of the fact that it must be reformed. It is
vital that we get this to work, especially in very serious cases such
as physical and sexual assault, or where psychological and medical help
is needed, or where the family is in need
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570001849" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001849">In
one case I have dealt with, the armed forces completely failed a young
soldier who was beaten, burned and sexually assaulted by men in his
unit and, after making a complaint, was placed back in the unit with
the assailants. He received no help, despite two suicide attempts. When
he was returned to his parents’ home, the family were unable to
cope with his considerable distress and no help was made available to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570001850" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001850">This
experience, and evidence gathered by the Defence Select Committee, has
led me to conclude that the role must be able to compel the armed
forces to act. The commissioner’s role must be to intervene when
a complaint is live, to be proactive and to be able to spot trends, act
on them and head off trouble. Arguments deployed against the Service
Complaints Commissioner having an ombudsman role have included that it
would interfere with the chain of command and that the role would
constrict the complaints commissioner from acting on live complaints.
The Defence Committee has outlined how both of these concerns can be
met within an ombudsman role.</hs_Para>

with the work that Ministers have done on this issue and that they have
made it a priority. I believe that they are extremely sympathetic to
reforming this position, but I know from the few years that I have
spent in this place that a Minister knowing the right thing to do is
the easy part; it is making it happen that is the tough part.</hs_Para>

this opportunity to urge the ministerial team to pursue the request to
beef up the role? The British Legion has highlighted that an ombudsman
role would be much better understood by service personnel themselves.
It must be able to act on live complaints and to compel the armed
forces to act and a complaint must not necessarily close if a service
man or woman is killed. Where there are systematic problems in our
armed forces, they must be dealt with proactively. Our armed forces
have nothing to fear from an ombudsman role and everything to gain. I
urge Ministers to pursue this agenda relentlessly. We must settle it
way in advance of a new Service Complaints Commissioner coming into
post.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13062570001946" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001946">6.17

would like to make a few points. They include: the importance of the
armed forces as institutions in this country; their changing nature, as
the Government seek to replace professional servicemen and women with
an increased reserve force following the strategic defence

becoming an MP, I have had the opportunity to increase my familiarity
with the armed forces, particularly with the Army, a great deal. I have
visited British Army Training Unit Suffield in Canada, the armour
centre in Bovington, the Army Foundation College for our youngest
personnel and, of course, Camp Bastion in Afghanistan. I have spent
time everywhere, from my local recruiting office in Manchester to the
Defence Academy at Shrivenham. I have done that because if I have to
make decisions about voting to deploy British service personnel
abroad—putting them in harm’s way—I want to know
first hand about the training, equipment and preparation they have
received.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062570001856" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001856">The
high standard of training and the professional identity of armed forces
are extremely impressive. The British armed forces are among the
best—if not the best—in the world. I believe that that
strength comes from three things: the quality of our recruits, the
quality of the training they receive, and the common identity that is
instilled in our people by the units themselves and, in particular, the
regimental system. I am extremely proud of the regiments associated

how the regiments continue to support those families and how they

understood or appreciated by the public. I cannot begin to understand
how a family must feel when, knowing that their child is away on
operational duty, they open the door to see military personnel standing
there and realise that it cannot be good news. When I talk to families
in my constituency who have been in that position, I am impressed by
how the regiments continue to support
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:15:57"></hs_TimeCode>. I believe
that all the branches of the armed forces, but particularly the Army,
are fundamentally important national institutions, and part of being a
one-nation party means promoting those national institutions that bind
the country together. The Army is a particularly fine

make-up of the Army is changing considerably under the
Government’s plans following the strategic defence and security
review. The Army will now comprise 
<?notus-xml column=261?>a smaller regular force and be more dependent on reserves, as we have
heard. I have the greatest of respect for our reserve forces,
especially given the role they have played in Iraq and Afghanistan, but
this will pose substantial challenges. We should carefully consider
what the effects might be on our reservists, their families and their
employers, particularly if we find ourselves embarking on another
military deployment of a similar scale to the one now drawing to an end

their spare time to reach the same standard as full-time professionals;
to be prepared to put their civilian lives and civilian jobs on hold
for lengthy tours of duty, possibly involving combat; and then to slot
back seamlessly into civilian life at the end of it, only perhaps to do
the same again within a year.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>That puts a real
strain on people, so I urge the Government to consider whether the
harmony guidelines that exist to maintain a balance between time on
deployment and ordinary service will still be suitable for a military

operations and to promote and praise employers who correctly recognise

not seeking a grandstanding public inquiry or suggesting a political
reckoning; I am simply saying that we must critically evaluate how we
have fought and managed this difficult conflict. Do we believe, for
instance, that the strategic decisions made were the right ones? Did we
initially get our force rotation right? Did the frequent change of

am concerned, as are a number of Members on these Benches, that by
keeping on cutting defence expenditure, we risk creating imbalances on
a variety of fronts. Can it be right, for example, that the budgets of
Departments dealing with health, welfare and international aid are
being protected, if not expanded, as a percentage of Government
expenditure? That puts disproportionate pressure on other Departments,
such as Defence, when trying to save costs.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:19:58"></hs_TimeCode>I also wonder
whether imbalances are being created in regard to our transatlantic
relationship. Our defence capability is one of the key anchors of that
relationship, but it is not a one-way ticket. There are obligations on
both sides, including our own. If we keep shaving our defence
capability, might we put elements of that relationship at
risk?</hs_Para>

also suggest that we might be creating imbalances in other areas, such
as our capability to meet our foreign policy objectives, whatever they
might be, and defend our interests overseas. The House knows that I
have not been supportive of our military interventions over the past
decade, but let us put that to one side. There have been moments during
those interventions when our resources have not matched our ambitions.
It was not the fault of the troops on the ground, but in Iraq and
Afghanistan in particular the necessary resources were lacking, and

have other concerns but, as an ex-soldier, I shall focus on the Army.
The plan to disband 20,000 regulars before knowing whether the plan to
recruit 30,000 reservists to take their place will work is high risk,
given that we do not know whether those reservists will be able to plug
the gap from a capability point of view, or from a boots-on-the-ground
point of view. I ask Ministers to ensure that that issue is centrally
addressed in the forthcoming White Paper. There are key questions that
need answering very soon, because redundancies are taking effect as we
speak, and we do not know whether the plan will work.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062570001869" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062570001869"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:22:08"></hs_TimeCode>There
is a real danger that Government proposals will prove a false economy,
in financial terms and in terms of military capability. Let us take
cost savings as an example. I am conscious of the figure of £1.8
billion over 10 years, and more details will follow in the White Paper,
but at the moment the Government are long on promise and short on
costings and details. They have admitted in the Green Paper that it
costs more to train reservists than regulars. The financial incentives
being offered to regulars to join the reserves mean that they will be
on a better scale of pay than a serving brigadier, if we include the
£5,000 sign-up bonus, the bounty, the daily rate and so forth.
There is also the question of civilian salaries being matched, although
I am aware that the Government are considering capping an element of
that. Again, we need to see the details.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:23:05"></hs_TimeCode>And all that is
before we even consider the fact that the reservists will not be
deployable in their first year.</hs_Para>

have already raised the question of the number of reservists that will
be required. According to Ministry of Defence figures, the present
Territorial Army mobilisation rate is 40%. If we apply that to the
20,000 regulars, we will need 50,000 reservists. I look forward to
seeing the details of how that magic figure of 40% is going to be
increased. It will take a concerted effort to 
<?notus-xml column=263?>achieve a mobilisation rate of much more than 40%, given that many
people in the Army believe that we are not even hitting 40% at the

is also the question of the capability gap. In the 1980s, when many of
us served, the TA did a very good job that basically involved
reservists being transported out to Germany, digging a trench and
waiting for the Soviet or Warsaw pact forces to arrive. Today,
asymmetric warfare is becoming the norm. The skills base will become
much higher, and our requirements will be much more demanding, yet I
understand that the number of training days is being increased to 40
overall—an increase of only five days. I question that on the
capability front, particularly when those forces are going to be
mobilised as groups rather than as add-ons. That factor must be
considered.</hs_Para>

me finish with a concern some of us have about the potentially
distorting effect on the ground. Excellent, well recruited battalions,
such as the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers, are being
axed, while more poorly recruited battalions are being saved. It is
costing millions of pounds to keep over-strength battalions up to the
mark. Such a policy is, in many respects, simply reinforcing
failure.</hs_Para>

conclusion, I think this is a high-risk policy, and I ask Ministers to

to see concrete evidence that the reservist plan will take effect and
will work—before we let the regular battalions go. Here we are
dealing with the defence of the realm, and this is happening when many
countries not necessarily friendly to the west are arming and
increasing their expenditure on defence. No one here can tell when or

fact that the armed forces are now treated far better, and are seen in

something about the charities that support our armed forces. I want to
focus on the work of Veterans Contact Point, a wonderful organisation
that is based in Nuneaton town hall. It has three notable features.
First, it is entirely run by volunteers, who are former members of the
forces themselves and who understand the issues that confront service
personnel when they arrive on civvy street. Many of those who run the
organisation have also experienced problems after leaving the services,
and are therefore well placed to provide our veterans with advice,
guidance, signposting and other forms of practical support and
help.</hs_Para>

of Veterans Contact Point lies in the help that it gives to the cohort
of people with whom it engages most: those who find it difficult to
reintegrate when they leave the armed forces and return to civvy
street. Many of these people have a problem with dependency on drugs or
drink, or have been in trouble with the police or have been in contact
with the probation service, and might have been in prison. The project
is led by Len Hardy, the Warwickshire Probation Trust veterans
champion, who has done a magnificent job. It has been extremely
effective in providing a holistic service for our veterans in Coventry
and Warwickshire, because it has brought together elements of
Government and our charities. I want to mention in particular the
important input of the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families
Association, the local Nuneaton and Bedworth branch of the Royal
British Legion, the Scraping the Barrel charity, ABF The Soldiers
Charity, which was known as the Army Benevolent Fund, and the European
Social Fund. I would like a Minister to come and observe this excellent
service in action, because it provides a huge amount of community good
and a huge amount of support for those coming out of our armed
forces<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T18:35:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062588000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0003.htm#13062588000012">My
third point is about how people in public service, local authorities
and the Government support our veterans community. Veterans Contact
Point has had a very mixed response from local government and as a
result may have to move venues. I do not want to be political, but we
need to make sure, across the piece in local and national Government,
that we do all we can to support such organisations. I have had some
discussions with Veterans Contact Point about the community covenant
grant scheme, and we need to address the way in which it works, as my
understanding is that some of the bureaucracy has caused an issue in
relation to accessing grants.</hs_Para>

Horwood</B> (Cheltenham) (LD):</Member> I thank the Opposition for this
opportunity to pay tribute to the courage and commitment of all our
armed forces. My constituency has a strong military heritage,
contributing many winners of the Victoria Cross—far more
than would be expected from a town of its size. I have had
many gallant predecessors myself, too, including the first, and first
Liberal, MP for Cheltenham, the hon. Craven Berkeley, and
Douglas Dodds-Parker, who was a Conservative MP in the post-war period
and who served in the Special Operations Executive in the second world
war with great distinction. I should also mention his successor, 
<?notus-xml column=267?>Charles Irving, who was deemed insufficiently robust for front-line
service and famously bayoneted a retired lieutenant-general in the

distinguished service was seen by many Gloucestershire soldiers, airmen
and sailors in two world wars, in Iraq and Afghanistan, in Korea and in
earlier conflicts. The Gloucestershire Regiment is now part of 1
Rifles, whose soldiers still proudly wear the back badge won by the
“Glosters” at the battle of Alexandria in 1801, when they
showed almost inhuman courage by turning back to back to face
simultaneous French attacks from front and rear. They showed equally
heroic courage at the battle of Imjin river in Korea in 1951,
tragically losing 620 men in that one battle.
Gloucestershire’s military tradition is also still
represented by the Gloucestershire Hussars. As part of the Territorial
Army, it counts Tobruk and Gallipoli among its battle honours. I hope

role of defence industries across the UK. We could not equip our armed

the support of those industries. He also congratulated the

pay tribute to him for how tenaciously he has championed her interests.
She finds herself in a terrible situation, where she proudly has two
sons in the armed forces but is losing out because of the
Government’s bedroom tax. I know that the Minister has sympathy
with this case and I share his frustration that the decisions of other
Departments sometimes have an unintended impact on the members of the
armed forces. However, this situation does need urgent clarity, because
Alison and many others will rightly feel let down by the fact that she
thought the Government had done a U-turn on this but they clearly have
not. This should be pursued as a matter of urgency. When I challenged

putting the cart before the horse and I agree with him that that is a
high-risk strategy. Recruitment levels will be difficult to achieve and
without proper protection in the workplace, many people will not be

basic problem can be simply stated. There are more than
20,000 NHS patients who are resident in England, yet registered with a
Welsh general practitioner. Of these, some 3,500 are

constituents in the village of Welsh Newton—a Welsh name, but an

people live in England, but they are being denied access to hospital
services in England. That is grossly unfair, especially as for many, if
not all, of them Hereford hospital is the closest and the best place to
be treated. The situation also has the damaging knock-on effect of
depriving Hereford hospital of revenue from patients who are being
treated in Wales. The result is a double whammy: the patients cannot
receive the health care that they want and need, and Hereford hospital,
already undermined by the deeply iniquitous NHS funding formula, must
suffer an unexpected additional financial burden. This burden is

us look at the issues in more detail. The relevant NHS regulations
state that legal responsibility for these patients remains with the
relevant clinical commissioning groups in England, but that local
health boards in Wales take day-to-day responsibility for
their care. The English and Welsh NHS take their guidance
from the protocol 
<?notus-xml column=275?>for cross-border health care services, the latest version of which was
agreed by Welsh and English Ministers in April this year. However, it
appears that the protocol does not give full effect to the law.
Specifically, point 14 of the current protocol implies that
patients from England who are treated in Wales are to be seen and
treated within the maximum waiting time targets of the NHS in Wales,
which are of course rather different from those of the NHS in
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:04:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Why

2009-10 I commissioned an independent study of the funding of public
services in Herefordshire relative to other suitable comparators across
the country. I was only a parliamentary candidate at the time and such
a study had never before been undertaken, but it seemed obvious to me
that Herefordshire suffered from a serious shortfall in public funding
and I was determined to get to the bottom of the matter. The results
were astounding—even frightening. The study found that
Herefordshire had been underfunded by no less than £175 million
over the previous five years across all public services. In health
care, the underfunding was £44 million, or roughly £9
million a year. It is no coincidence, I suggest, that Hereford hospital
is currently running a deficit of almost exactly that amount. It is
that deficit that is being worsened by the denial of choice to
cross-border patients in my constituency and
elsewhere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062588000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0004.htm#13062588000083">Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:08:56"></hs_TimeCode>
did that funding shortfall occur? The reason is that the NHS funding
formula is systematically skewed against areas that are highly rural
and have a large population of older people, and systematically favours
urban areas with younger populations. The formula does not recognise
the relatively high cost of delivering services in sparsely populated
areas, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:09:23"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for North Herefordshire (Bill Wiggin) indicated,
and it does not adequately recognise the special costs imposed by
caring for older people—particularly the over-85s, the very
oldest in our society. Research by Professor Sheena Asthana at the
university of Plymouth indicates that the areas of greatest health care
need are those with the highest proportion of over-75s. However, the
current funding formula is focused on deprivation rather than on need
for health care. That means that less funding is available to treat
older people with chronic
diseases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062588000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0004.htm#13062588000084">Nationally,
17% of people are aged 65 or over. In Herefordshire, the figure is
already 22% and pensioners will make up a third of the population by
2030. In 2010-11, Herefordshire had the highest proportion of over-75s
in the west midlands, and the most patients per 100,000 on the cancer
register.  It also had the lowest cancer spend per cancer
patient per year—a little over £5,000—and was in
the lower half of the per capita allocations. </hs_Para>

the Heart of Birmingham PCT had the lowest proportion of over-75s in
the region, and the fewest patients per 100,000 on the cancer
register.  However, the spend per cancer patient per year there
was not £5,000 but more than £10,000—nearly double
that in Herefordshire. Thus the effect of the funding formula is that
Heart of Birmingham has twice as much 
<?notus-xml column=277?>funding per cancer patient as Herefordshire, for a
much lower incidence of cancer. That is not merely unfair; it is a
monstrous
injustice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062588000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0004.htm#13062588000086">I

Department amend the cross-border protocol and reintroduce patient
choice for English residents registered with GPs in Wales? Secondly,
will she acknowledge the strain that the protocol places on hospitals
such as Hereford hospital? Thirdly, will she press her Department to
make the case to NHS England for a fairer funding settlement, which
will give older people—not merely in Herefordshire, but up and

to register with a GP practice on either side of the border, that is

many people are registered with a local GP in England but
the main practice is over the border in Wales. Those people may not
want to change their GP practice. Why indeed should they? We could
understand why they might, because in Wales people unfortunately do not
get some of the excellent access to services that we enjoy in England.

am reliably informed—this point is important—that
allocations to individual clinical commissioning groups, which are made
up of the GPs and other clinicians who now commission services locally,
and the formula that is used to decide what those allocations should
be, are the responsibility of NHS England. I am not seeking to pass the
buck, but it does bear that responsibility. In making those
allocations, NHS England relies on advice from the Advisory Committee
on Resource Allocation. ACRA provides advice on the share of available
resources provided to each CCG to support equal access for equal need,
as specified in the mandate given by the Secretary of State to NHS
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062588000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0004.htm#13062588000110">Therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:24:33"></hs_TimeCode>,
NHS England does not set income for CCGs on an equal cost-per-head
basis across the country. Instead, allocations follow an assessment of
the expected need for health services in an area, and funds are
distributed in line with that, meaning that areas with a high health
need should receive more money per head. The calculation is based on
the age of the populations, relative morbidity and unavoidable
variation in cost. The objective is to ensure a consistent supply of
health services across the country. The greater the health need, the
more money is received because the more health services are
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062588000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/debtext/130625-0004.htm#13062588000111">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T19:24:33"></hs_TimeCode>

with the allocations to their CCGs and, in effect, to their

communities and enable the best outcomes for local people. Perhaps
there is hope in that. Obviously, I must say quickly that I cannot make

faced not only unacceptable delays, but a devastating impact of the
consequence of those delays. One constituent from Tiptree suffered
lengthy delays on not just one but two occasions—in August and
September—before passing away. On the first occasion, she
suffered a mini-stroke, and the emergency doctor who attended her home
called for an ambulance that morning, but it took more than three hours
for a paramedic to arrive. The paramedic then called for  a
back-up ambulance, which did not come. After waiting four hours,
members of my constituent’s family placed her in one of their
cars to take her to hospital. Although  
<?notus-xml column=4?>my constituent had suffered a stroke, the trust
neglected her. If her family had not taken the risk of transporting her
to hospital, she may never have got there.</hs_Para>

following month, my constituent fell in her care home and banged her
head, resulting in a lump larger than a chicken egg on her temple. The
ambulance was called at 9.38 pm, but it did not arrive until almost two
hours later, at 11.25 pm, despite the fact that the care home was
barely five minutes from Colchester ambulance station. Once my
constituent was in hospital, a CT scan confirmed that she was
haemorrhaging on the brain, and she died soon after. Had the ambulance
arrived sooner, my constituent would have received treatment more
promptly and might still be alive today.

constituents have also let me know of their frustration about delays.
Mrs Houghton, from Tolleshunt Knights, has two young daughters with
serious medical conditions that require frequent hospital care. One has
a condition that can lead to sudden death syndrome; the other suffers
from a condition that includes supraventricular tachycardia, which can
cause her heartbeat to quicken, and her treatment requires a
life-saving injection. Last year, my constituent reported to me that
ambulances were taking longer to arrive than they used to and that
rapid response vehicles were sent instead to take her daughters to
hospital. As the Minister will appreciate, these incidents have caused
Mrs Houghton increased anxiety, particularly given that her daughters
are children. They need an ambulance to attend promptly, but that is
simply not happening.</hs_Para>

a separate case, a constituent who is a carer for a relative, Mrs
Gladys Money, reported to me the delay Gladys experienced while waiting
for an ambulance. Only two weeks ago, Gladys, who is 96 years old,
suffered a fall in her kitchen. She could not reach the telephone, so
she used the emergency call line button she carries with her at all
times to request assistance. An ambulance was called, but it did not
arrive for an hour and a half. During that time, Gladys was in much
distress and could not lift herself up or even call for further help.

Interestingly, funding was not an issue in this case; the trust is very
well funded, and I will come to that. This is about professionalism and
training. With the board and the trust, we have seen a complete failure
of not only leadership, but skills; there is a question about the
skills base of the board and the non-executive directors, and it is

management, directors and non-executive directors. Since the
publication of the CQC report, a new interim chair, Dr Geoff Harris,
has been brought into the trust. A governance review and additional
support are being provided by Dr Anthony Marsh, the chief executive of
the country’s best-performing ambulance trust, in the west

review of governance that highlighted the extent of the scandal and

system of local accountability, putting it at county level as it once

hon. Friend the Member for Witham (Priti Patel) on her

my hon. Friend, I pay tribute to the paramedics, drivers and
engineers—the people at the sharp end—because they have
done a consistently good and professional 
<?notus-xml column=10?>job, despite poor leadership; they have not had the backing that they
deserve. I also join her in paying tribute to the Minister’s
ministerial colleague, Earl Howe, who has been very attentive to our
concerns
throughout.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000065">Dr
Marsh’s report is well researched and impressive. If the report
has one compelling conclusion, it is that the crisis in the ambulance
service trust is the consequence not of a lack of resources, but of a
lack of leadership, vision and strategic direction. The comparisons
that he draws with West Midlands Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust
are pertinent, because it is a trust with a similar population
base—the population is obviously more urban—that faces
similar challenges, but it has met those challenges through strong
direction and leadership throughout. That is why the West Midlands
Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust is at the top of the pile.
Unfortunately, our trust is down at the
bottom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000066">I
agree with my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:03:45"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Broadland (Mr Simpson), who said in his
important intervention that recently, over a number of years, a
management culture has emerged in the East of England Ambulance Service
NHS Trust that basically deems second best to be acceptable, and
consequently action that should have been taken has not been
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:04:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000067">If
the trust was an alternative investment market-listed company that had
gone into crisis mode, the non-executive directors would have resigned
on principle; if the trust was a company listed on the main stock
exchange, the directors would have had to resign. It is staggering that
they have somehow decided that it is okay to cling on to their jobs and
stay, despite the complete lack of oversight of corporate governance
and the failure to adhere to the combined code. As I understand
it—the Minister will correct me if I am wrong—the
non-executive directors are responsible under the combined code in the
same way as directors of public companies. The trust is obviously not a
public company, but it has the same corporate governance rules.
Notwithstanding the fact that it is a different organisation, the
non-executive directors have that responsibility. If they had any
integrity, they would offer their
resignations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000068">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>
hope the Minister is able to tell us that she will advise the
non-executive directors, with the approval of the Secretary of State,
to resign before tomorrow’s board meeting. It is no good for the
interim chairman, Dr Harris—there is a whole lot of management
speak here—to review the board members’ benchmarking
against leadership criteria, etc. What the hell does that mean?
Basically, the board needs reconstituting, and it needs reconstituting
very soon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:05:46"></hs_TimeCode>. Will
the Minister give us some insight into what her Department is doing to
try to bring new blood—people with real ability, not jobsworths
who simply get recycled around one public board after another—on
to such
boards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:06:02"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000069">Just

King’s Lynn and west Norfolk is

lagging behind the rest of East Anglia. I find that very worrying.
Obviously, I accept that, in remote rural areas, there are some hamlets
and remote communities where it is physically impossible for an
ambulance to reach a patient within the targets. We know that. There
are some places in my constituency, and in the constituencies of many
of my colleagues here today, where that is absolutely impossible, even
with the best will in the world. There might be a coincidence in which,
for example, an ambulance is going along a main road at a 
<?notus-xml column=11?>particular juncture, but achieving the target may well be impossible, so
it is even more important that the targets are met in the towns and
bigger communities, where it might be thought perfectly reasonable to
expect ambulances to get to a call within the target time in 95%-plus
of cases. Unfortunately, the targets are not even being met in the
towns in my
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:07:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000070">I
have been given permission by my constituent  Mrs Delna Barrett
to refer to her case. Her husband, Chris, had been suffering from
Parkinson’s disease for some 20 years. He stopped breathing in a
restaurant in Hunstanton, which is the second-largest town in my
constituency, and it took the ambulance more than 20 minutes
to arrive. Despite numerous resuscitation attempts, he died in hospital
two days later. We do not know whether, if the ambulance had arrived
within the target time, he would have had a better chance of surviving.
The family are not criticising the paramedics or the staff, but the
bottom line is that the ambulance did not arrive within a reasonable

which my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:08:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Witham alluded in her excellent speech, and we
know that those problems have been around for quite a long time. There
certainly are problems at the Queen Elizabeth hospital in my
constituency, and there are problems at the Norfolk and Norwich
hospital, where at one stage back in March all 17 of the trust’s
ambulances were tied up waiting outside. All that is well documented,
and it is not entirely within the purview of this debate, but we cannot
consider the problem of the ambulance trust in complete isolation; we
must consider out-of-hours services and out-of-hours
cover.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000072">Very<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>
often, individual family events bring home to us the different parts of
the health service that are perhaps in need of improvement or are
examples of best practice. Some 20 years ago, I was staying with my
mother near King’s Lynn, and at about four in the morning she
banged on my door and said that she was dying. She was in the most
appalling pain—absolute agony. My mother is a war veteran who
was in the Women’s Royal Naval Service. She is a very tough
person, and she never complains about anything. She told me that she
was in complete agony and could not move. I rang the local doctor, who
came out within 20 minutes. He said, “You have kidney stones,
and I am going to give you an injection that will put you asleep until
tomorrow afternoon. I will then come back and we will take stock of the
situation.” He gave her some more injections the following
afternoon. The stones were broken down, and she did not even have to go
to hospital.</hs_Para>

knocked on my door now, what would I do? Obviously, I would dial 111 or
999, but so risk-averse are all those call centres that she would
undoubtedly have gone into A and E. I would not have been happy with
any advice from someone who did not know her medical records. The key
to her treatment by the local doctor was that he knew her medical
records and understood that she might be prone to that
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062551000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062551000074">We
must sort out the out-of-hours cover. We cannot go back to what we had
before, when each doctor’s surgery provided out-of-hours cover,
but the idea of co-operatives and mergers between GP practices to
provide cover and ensure that the people who deal with 
<?notus-xml column=12?>patients out of hours understand their medical records and are prepared
to provide service is key to sorting out the problem. Otherwise,
given that the population in some parts of the
country is growing, that people are living longer and that many more
people have challenging illnesses and a multiplicity of problems, more
and more people will have out-of-hours difficulties. Unless we sort out
the out-of-hours service, we will have more and more

conclusion, there is a great deal of concern throughout the region, but
we take the view that the problem can be solved through new leadership

and take great pride in doing so. Those people set high professional
standards. Given the right management, they will do the job to a high
standard and give our constituents the ambulance service that they
deserve. This is a turn-around situation. I wish the interim chairman
and chief executive all the best in sorting out the problem. However,
they require the Minister’s assistance and support, and her
first step must be to grip the decision of the non-executive directors.

I suggest, this is a sad tale that started some time ago. My timelines
of the issue start in the middle of 2011. We are driven by the
experiences of our patients  
<?notus-xml column=13?>—those who have suffered. Let us be honest: the vast majority of
people in our constituencies have a good ambulance service. Once an
ambulance arrives, care is very good; nobody denies that. However, too
often that excellence of service is concentrated in certain areas of
the region in order to meet a false regional performance target, and
almost everything else is put aside. It does not matter if only 50% of
people in south Norfolk get an ambulance within 90 minutes as long as
the regional target is met. That is all that matters to the leadership

been dragged kicking and screaming into showing its performance targets

say, “You can look in the minutes of your local primary care
trust to find response times.” It is unacceptable for those at

series of complaints, including about the case of Nora Dennington,
whose family finally went to the press to get an answer after three
months. To be fair to Maria Ball, the former chairman of the trust, she
got answers to those complaints then and there, and within a week,
Hayden Newton resigned.</hs_Para>

could go on about all the different meetings, but I will not, as I am
conscious of the time. What I will say is that patients’
complaints were not being answered, and patients were not being treated

climb in sickness rates, and the CQC should have done more than tick
the box saying that the trust had passed staff compliance on the basis
that appraisals had been done. There was an element of external
scrutiny by the CQC, the strategic health authority and, to some
extent, Monitor, which did not approve the foundation trust status
application, but passed the trust on the governance rating. All those
different regulators, as well as the leadership of the board, need to
look at themselves to understand why they, in effect, let people down.
The board was fixated on getting foundation trust status; it was only
focused on the regional target, and it did not matter that residents in
Suffolk were being failed, as long as the regional target was

telling me that the rapid response vehicles were only being used to

according to the worker, rapid response vehicles should be in addition

Sickness levels are high, with an 8.8% sickness rate—almost
double the national average for ambulance trusts in England. Also,

ambulance service and that they are placing people’s lives at
risk. The trickle of complaints became a torrent. When an elderly lady
suffered a stroke, the paramedics and rapid response vehicle arrived
within 10 or 15 minutes, but the ambulance to take her to hospital did
not arrive for another 105 minutes. A gentleman in Lowestoft fell off
his bike and it took  90 minutes for the ambulance to arrive
from Ipswich, some 45 miles away. A 90-year-old disabled gentleman fell

him. It took four and a half hours for an ambulance to

all the staff I met were dedicated professionals, but they were worn
down by the pressures of the job. Their pleas for understanding to the
trust’s senior management fell on deaf ears. On those two
evenings, we were on the go from the moment we left the depot. There
was no time for meals or comfort breaks, and I was told that 12-hour
night shifts almost invariably became 13 or 14-hour
shifts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062554000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062554000038">Secondly,
it became clear to me that the trust did  not have the right
balance of vehicles on the road. There were too many cars and not
enough ambulances. There is concern that the cars are used to reach
patients 
<?notus-xml column=18?>quickly and to meet targets—effectively acting as clock-stoppers.
If an ambulance is then required to take a patient to hospital, there
can be a long delay before it arrives, and for a stroke victim that
could be very
serious.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062554000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062554000039">Thirdly,
based on what staff told me, it was clear that the handover delays at
district general hospitals are a major reason why the service is not
functioning properly. On the two nights when I was out, there were no
problems at the James Paget hospital in Gorleston, and I pay tribute to
David Hill, its interim chief executive, who will step down shortly.
Whenever I am with him at the hospital to discuss the problem, he takes
me straight down to A and E to see what the situation is like at that
time and to get feedback from staff. His is the hands-on,
at-the-coal-face, sleeves-rolled-up management that the trust should
replicate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062554000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062554000040">Although
there were not problems at JPH, there were problems at the Norfolk and
Norwich hospital, which is a Bermuda triangle that swallows up
ambulances. I do not want to place too much blame at the
hospital’s door, but the development of a large hospital, albeit
one that provides high-quality services and serves a large rural
catchment area, means that a possible weak link is inadvertently
created in the health system in Norfolk and Suffolk. It is important
that the new management of the ambulance trust work with the Norfolk
and Norwich hospital to strengthen that weak
link.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062554000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062554000041">Is
it any wonder that the management have become so out of touch with
their staff and the service they run when they set up their
headquarters in a stand-alone, business park location in the middle of
the fens? In effect, they are working in a vacuum. Surely they should
be close to their operational centres where they can be in day-to-day
contact with those who are working on the front line. That isolation
may have contributed to their pursuit of foundation trust status when
the service they ran was so clearly inadequate for the needs of their

service includes many people with different callings, and thank
goodness for that. Some have a calling to look down microscopes and to
do scientific experiments to figure out how to solve 
<?notus-xml column=19?>the problem of cancer. Some have a calling to work with people with
mental health problems and to help them return to
stability, productivity and a flourishing life. Some have a calling to
help at the roadside those who are in critical danger following
dreadful accidents and those of us who are unfortunate enough to face
near death. Imagine what it must be like to have that calling, to feel
that one’s life purpose and work is to help such people, to have
the training of a practitioner in emergency medicine, but to have to
hold someone who is dying because an ambulance trust does not work

Anthony Marsh’s governance review, which was published earlier
this month, is deeply worrying. He commented that the trust’s

December 2011 with December 2012, the average handover time—the
time between an ambulance arriving at a hospital and the hospital
taking responsibility 
<?notus-xml column=21?>for the patient—increased by more than three minutes to more than
20 minutes a patient. The number of patients waiting more than 30
minutes increased by 75%, from around 2,000 to more than 3,500. Even
more worryingly, the wait for patients does not start there; the number
of ambulances responding to the most serious call-outs within eight
minutes was fewer than
70<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:42:10"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062554000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062554000059">Those
numbers are shocking enough, but the figure that helps to demonstrate
the worst type of patient experience is that, in December 2012, at
least one patient waited in the back of an ambulance for more than
six-and-a-half hours, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:42:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harlow (Robert Halfon) raised an even worse example. It is worrying
how only a few numbers can paint such a vivid picture of a service that
is clearly not working as it should for the patients who rely on it,
and, as has been pointed out repeatedly, who pay for it as
well.</hs_Para>

heartened to learn that the trust recognises that its service has not
been acceptable, and I welcome the turnaround plan that was released in
late April. I ask the Minister to outline any discussions that she, or
the Secretary of State for Health, has had with the trust that informed
the plan and its implementation. Will she explain why, when the data
that I have just given, as others have freely done today, are so easily
accessible, nothing has been done previously to improve performance in
the trust? I also ask her to provide the details of all efforts made by
the Department to help the trust improve performance, when those began
and what the results have been. We are seeing all aspects of emergency
care services—whether ambulance trusts or accident and emergency
departments—being driven into chaos too often of late. We have
just endured the worst winter performance in A and E for years, and the
warnings are that next winter’s will be even worse.</hs_Para>

which my previous figures relate—hospitals in the east of
England region missed their  A and E target more often than
not, and almost one in 10 patients had to wait for more than four hours
in  A and E before receiving treatment. Pressures in one part
of the service can manifest in other places—as has often been
said, A and E is the bellwether of NHS performance—and there is
clearly a link between poor performance in ambulance services and the
pressure so clearly apparent in A and E units around the country.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:44:12"></hs_TimeCode>When a patient
needs emergency care, they are being made to wait at home, then wait in
an ambulance, and then wait in a waiting room. When the Minister

has had with other ambulance trusts to ensure that those failings are
not repeated elsewhere in the country.</hs_Para>

on to the personnel aspect of Dr Marsh’s report, he raised
concerns about the rate of sickness absence in the trust. Alarm bells
should be ringing that the level is so much higher than in other
trusts. Did the Department of Health become aware of that, and if so,
when did it become aware and what was done about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T10:44:47"></hs_TimeCode>?

April, at the time of Dr Marsh’s governance review, the acting
chief, Andrew Morgan, announced plans to recruit 350 staff. He denied a
staffing crisis, but admitted that the leadership was not good enough.
I think that that is an understatement, given that it was widely
reported in May that the trust was offering financial 
<?notus-xml column=22?>incentives to staff to retire early or to leave the service. The trust
spent almost £100,000 on those incentives, and it is now
offering staff a £500 bonus if they refer a friend to join the
trust. If it needs staff, it should not be offering incentives for
staff to leave. What kind of recruitment programme is that, and how
does that illustrate protection of the public purse? It is an
incredibly worrying demonstration of the lack of communication and
oversight within the trust. The position appears to be entirely

she tells the Chamber when she expects the problems with this ambulance
trust to be resolved; what the Department is doing to assist the trust
with its recovery; what additional expenditure, if any, that will
require; and whether hospitals that are reliant on the trust can expect
any additional support, financial or otherwise, owing to the avoidable
operational pressures that the ambulance trust has placed upon them.
Can she guarantee that the performance of the trust has not seriously
affected clinical outcomes for patients in the local area? Based on

support, and many tributes, for the staff—the front-line
workers. Nobody is for one moment saying that there is any failing on
their part. The failing is clear: it is failing at a leadership level
and at board level. There is a failing of leadership, which must be
addressed as matter of some urgency.</hs_Para>

the Member for North West Norfolk (Mr Bellingham), who asked whether
the usual rules that apply to non-executives on public limited

on, apply to non-executives who are appointed to NHS trusts. I must
tell him that the rules are not the same; their responsibilities and
duties are different. I will provide more detail in a letter to my hon.
Friend, but it is not as simple as it is when people are non-executive
directors on other bodies, where it could be said there is much more
accountability and much more of a duty on them to resign when there
have been the sorts of failings that we have heard about
today—if that was applied to a business, for

know that overall in England in 2012-13 the number of emergency calls
to ambulance services  was 9.08 million—a 6.9% increase.
That is an important figure, I would suggest. We know that overall, in
England, the performance figures are stable. That does not really
assist in this debate, of course, because we also know that the East of

best that I can say of the performance of the East of England ambulance

lowest-performing ambulance trust in England. As with the national
picture, its overall poor performance figures hide huge discrepancies
between the services and response times in the urban and rural areas
that it covers. There are too many stories—we have heard many
today—of patients in distress having to wait hours for
ambulances, or solo paramedics being sent when an ambulance is needed.
Solo paramedics cannot transport patients and might not, for instance,
be able to lift or move a patient unaided. It is simply not good

shall certainly take it away and speak to the Secretary of State,

have its own leadership academy, where it seeks to bring on people.
That is within the NHS. But I think that we should involve far more
people from other fields, who could come into the NHS—people
with huge skill sets, who have proved those in other walks of life. I
am thinking of, for example, retired judges, who would have an
invaluable role to play—people who have shown real leadership

Tony Baldry</B> (Banbury) (Con):</Member> I am grateful for the
opportunity to raise the issue of bats in churches and the impact of
the EU habitats directive. The House will not be surprised that I wish
to do so, given my  role as the Second Church Estates
Commissioner. At the outset, I want to make it clear that as far as I
am concerned, bats are part of God’s creation. Indeed, there are
three specific references to bats in the bible: Leviticus, chapter 11,
verse 19; Deuteronomy, chapter 14, verse 18; and Isaiah,
chapter 2, verse 20. Bats are part of the interdependence of
God’s creation, but the numbers of some bat species in the UK
are under pressure, which is why the EU habitats directive
applies.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062555000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062555000003"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:01:08"></hs_TimeCode>Bats
are mammals, and one of the things I remember about mammals from my
A-level zoology course is that they can be distinguished from other
species by seven characteristics, two of which are that mammals
defecate and urinate. The blunt reality is that bat faeces and bat
urine have the potential to cause and do cause enormous damage in
churches. English parish churches and cathedrals have significant
holdings of monumental sculpture that date back to medieval England.
Bat urine and faeces are extremely damaging to church monuments, as
they are to other important artefacts in churches. Bat urine decays to
form dilute ammonia, which is alkaline, chemically aggressive and can
cause pitting, staining or etching on porous or polished material.
Monumental brasses are particularly affected by the urine. It causes
corrosion, evidenced in a disfiguring spotted appearance to the
surface, as on the brass at the church at Elsing in Norfolk—one
of the finest brasses in
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062555000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062555000004">Sculptured<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:02:29"></hs_TimeCode>
monuments are also being damaged by bat urine and faeces. The small
number of medieval wooden effigies that survive in England are
susceptible to damage to the pattern of the surface, which has been
built up over centuries. Bat urine can also harm precious original
paint and other surface finishes on historic monuments. For example,
the church of St Peter ad Vincula at South Newington in my constituency
has some very fine—almost unique—medieval wall paintings,
which were spared by Thomas Cromwell’s men, but having survived
the ravages of the Reformation, these irreplaceable parts of our
national heritage are now threatened by bat urine.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:03:13"></hs_TimeCode> build-up of
bat faeces on the porous surface of monuments, especially marble and
alabaster, is also problematic. The excreta hardens and is then subject
to moisture, which is common in churches. Bat faeces can cause marked
discolouration and other harm.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:03:30"></hs_TimeCode> course, it is
possible for monuments to be protected to an extent by covering them
with sheets of plastic, but that is unsightly, prevents them from being
seen and enjoyed by the wider public, and can produce a microclimate
that leads to other conservation
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062555000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062555000005">Importantly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:03:55"></hs_TimeCode>,
churches are places of worship; they are not field barns. I fully
appreciate that one of the challenges for bats is that some of their
natural habitat is threatened, but there has to be a balance. Churches
are active community centres; indeed, the Church of England is making
every effort to ensure that as many churches as possible can be centres
for community use and community life, used throughout the week, not
just for a few hours on a Sunday. Churches play host to a wide range of

<?notus-xml column=28?>events, such as children’s playgroups and lunch clubs 
for the elderly, for which a domestic level of hygiene  is
expected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062555000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062555000006">Large<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:05:30"></hs_TimeCode>
internal roosts of bats have significant financial and human costs to
those who worship in church buildings. The cost of cleaning, bat
monitoring, delays to building work and bat mitigation measures are
significant and must be funded by weekly church collections, at the
expense of the other pressing demands of sustaining the church
community and church buildings. The amount of monitoring and mitigation
required, before even basic repair works can be undertaken, can act as
a disincentive to the ongoing maintenance needed to retain a church
building in good condition. Such delays are not only costly, but
disheartening for church congregations and communities, who work hard
to keep church buildings alive and fit for community use.
Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:05:30"></hs_TimeCode> of the
churches affected by bat infestation are approaching a situation where
their buildings may be unsustainable as places of worship.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:05:42"></hs_TimeCode> is sometimes
said that excluding bats from churches will render the bats homeless,
but there is every chance that church congregations will find
themselves homeless and without a place of worship, with listed
buildings left unoccupied. That solution is surely undesirable for both
bats and
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062555000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062555000007">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:05:56"></hs_TimeCode>

spent some £29,000 on mitigation repairs. Another typical

forced to spend £2,600 in a single year on cleaning costs to
clear up after its resident bats. The mitigation work associated with
church repairs over three years for just one architect—just one

are the policy issues here? Bats are a European protected species under
the habitats directive 1994. In most circumstances, it is a criminal
offence to disturb bats or to damage or destroy their breeding site or
resting place deliberately. The criminal offence in English law, with a
maximum sentence of six months’ imprisonment, is provided by
regulation 41(1) of the Conservation of Habitats and Species
Regulations 2010. Natural England has the power to grant a
licence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>, the
effect of which is that bats can be deliberately disturbed, or their
breeding sites and resting places damaged or destroyed, without its
being a criminal office. The existence of such a licence constitutes a
defence to the criminal charge.

bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we
identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic

distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the

for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller

Furthermore, our results point to a new

species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs (Richard Benyon):</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend the
Member for Banbury (Sir Tony
Baldry)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>for<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:18:12"></hs_TimeCode>
raising this important issue. It is always a pleasure to see him, but I
was dismayed that not long ago he had to bring yet another delegation
to my office—a Trollopian group of senior clerics and
others—to talk about the problem yet again. I would have hoped
it unnecessary to have this debate, but I recognise that the problem
persists, and I hope to be able to reassure him that we are tackling
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:18:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000002">The
simple way to look at the issue is to say, “We can interpret the
regulations how we like, and if the European Union doesn’t like
that, we will see it in court,” but that is not a sensible
approach to such directives, as my hon. Friend well knows from his
experience in my Department. The alternative is to seek to change the
directive and its implications for churches and other places of
worship. That approach may have merit, but it is a longer-term route
down which we need to go in a proportionate way because, as I will go
on to say, we should be mindful of the species that we are discussing
and the serious declines that they have
suffered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:19:33"></hs_TimeCode> third way is
to seek to find a solution within the framework of the directive, but
one that is quick and effective, and I hope to give him some comfort
about that in the remaining
minutes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000003">I
stand by every word that I said in reply to my hon. Friend’s
question in the House. It is clearly not acceptable that
people’s rights to worship in buildings that were consecrated
many centuries ago and are used for that purpose should be affected in
such a way. Equally, it is not acceptable that priceless artefacts or
the furnishings necessary for a church to function as a place of
worship should be damaged or put at risk. He clearly outlined that that
is happening in many churches because of the presence and impact of
bats.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000004">The
way in which I look at churches has changed since the problem was
brought to my attention. My mind now occasionally strays from the
sermon, and I look up to see the impact that bats may be having in my
church or elsewhere. In the vast majority of places of worship, it is
managed perfectly well: either the quantity of bats is small or the
species does not affect the premises, or the bats are properly dealt
with by those who manage the building, but in all too many cases there
is a serious problem. My hon. Friend is right to 
<?notus-xml column=32?>raise a problem that causes great distress to people who value places of
worship not just for their heritage and religious importance, but for
what they do for their
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000005">Like
my hon. Friend, I support bat conservation. As he said, bats are
another of God’s creatures and are part of our natural heritage:
17 species of bat are resident and breed in the UK. I want to say a few
words to put into context the protection that they enjoy before I turn
to the specific issue of bats in churches. Until very recently, the
number of bats in this country had suffered a dramatic decline, most
notably because of changes to habitats, such as the loss of many of our
hedgerows in the last century and the destruction or refurbishment of
many traditional buildings. Those changes, particularly the loss or
alteration of other old buildings, have resulted in bats increasingly
making use of and seeking refuge in some older churches. In turn, those
buildings have  in some cases probably become more important to
the survival of
bats<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000006">Although
the presence of small numbers of bats in churches rarely causes any
problem, larger numbers certainly can result in intolerable problems in
some churches. Given the reduction in the number of bats and the
threats that they face, all species of bat have been listed in the EU
habitats directive, but as my hon. Friend said, there are a number of
derogations from otherwise prohibited actions, including activities
that cover public health and safety or the prevention of serious damage
to property. Natural England is the licensing authority for such cases
in
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:23:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000007">One
or both of those tests would clearly seem to be met in the
circumstances that we are discussing, but the directive and our
implementing regulations require some checks and balances to ensure
that harmful or unnecessary actions are not permitted, such as that the
action must not negatively affect the conservation status of the
species and that there are no alternatives to the actions proposed.
Although many people may agree with my hon. Friend’s points
about the likelihood of bats finding alternative roost sites and,
indeed, about the unacceptability of the alternative of doing nothing,
the tests are not easy to meet, as is clear from some European Court
cases. Frustrating though that is, it is a
fact.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000008">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:23:49"></hs_TimeCode>
my hon. Friend and I have inferred, the problem may be that some
affected populations are the rarest and are in locations of particular
importance to the species. Like him, however, I simply do not believe
that those who drafted the habitats directive intended to render places
of worship unusable to congregations or to impose unreasonable
financial burdens on them. That cannot have been the purpose of the
directive, and we must find a way round
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:24:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000009">It
is clear that the granting of permission—for example, to destroy
a bat maternity roost by blocking access to it—might result in
challenge and delay. Nobody, least of all parishioners, wants a long
drawn-out debate; they want solutions. To achieve solutions and
resolution to such intolerable problems sooner rather than later, we
are taking action on two fronts. First, we are making sure that the
guidance offered by Natural England and the national bat helpline is
clear, proportionate and unambiguous. Secondly, we are undertaking
specific actions at several churches to find means of moving bats away
from sensitive areas.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=33?><hs_Para UID="13062556000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000010">Unfortunately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:25:15"></hs_TimeCode>,
there are examples of costs and delays occurring, as my hon. Friend has
mentioned. For that reason, I have asked Natural England to look again
at the guidance that it provides to churches about the sort of
operations that can take place without a licence or a bat survey. The
figure that he mentioned of the cost to  a small rural church
is intolerable: the process has to be quicker and cheaper, which I am
doing everything I can to
ensure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000011">To
make sure that unnecessary costs are not incurred,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:25:36"></hs_TimeCode> have asked
Natural England to provide guidance on the nature of surveys that may
be required or the sort of actions to prevent impacts on bats. I
believe that many problems come not from Government agencies, but
organisations such as building companies or architects who say,
“Oh, you need to do this,” or “You will get into
trouble if you don’t do that.” We need to get to those
people as well, because they advise church wardens and others about
what they can and cannot
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:26:08"></hs_TimeCode>. There is a
lot of misunderstanding about what is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000012">I
have also asked Natural England to look into reports of over-zealous
advice being given to churches. It has assured me that it will
investigate any such instances. I rely on my hon. Friend, in his
position as the Second Church Estates Commissioner, to keep me informed
of the dafter
stories.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000013">Better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:26:34"></hs_TimeCode>
guidance will go a long way to minimising the impact of bats on most
churches, but as we have heard, large populations of bats cause serious
concerns in too many churches. In those cases, dealing with them is not
just an expensive chore; they can make the church unusable at the worst
times. That cannot continue, so we are funding research to find ways to
move bats to less sensitive areas of
churches.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000014">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:27:11"></hs_TimeCode>
a two-and-a-half year project, a team led by Bristol university is
investigating the combined use of deterrents and alternative roosting
sites, such as bat boxes, to encourage bats to move away from sensitive
areas  in churches. The study, which is taking place in eight
Norfolk churches, began in 2011, and the project trialled the use of
three types of deterrent—lighting, acoustic and
radar—last year. For those who think that we can just block bats
out of churches, that is more difficult than they possibly imagine.
Many of the buildings are mediaeval and have more ways in than we can
imagine<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:27:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000015">The
most dramatic effects were found when using  500 W halogen
lamps: the bats simply refused to come out of their roosts. That solves
one problem, but it 
<?notus-xml column=34?>might create another by entombing the bats, possibly resulting in the
presence of rotting carcases within the infrastructure of a church.
Therefore, the Bristol university team will trial smarter uses of
lighting this year to see whether such a relatively cheap method could
be used effectively by
churches.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000016">Based<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>
on last year’s results, acoustic devices appear to present the
best hope for a solution.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:28:05"></hs_TimeCode> date, those
devices have been used only for short periods, but they were effective
in moving the bats from their maternity roosts to other parts of
churches and, in some cases, in moving them out of churches. This year,
acoustic devices will be used for longer periods to prove, I hope, that
the bats do not habituate or get used to the devices and simply start
to ignore
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000017">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:28:30"></hs_TimeCode>
the same time, Bristol university has initiated work to explore the use
of a prototype acoustic device that would be portable and cheaper to
use. I am hopeful that extended trials this year, together with the
production of portable devices, will finally produce a permanent
solution to the problems that many churches have had to put up with. I
look forward to seeing the results of the work at the end of this year
and to sharing those results with my hon. Friend and the Church.
Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:28:56"></hs_TimeCode> deterrents
may not, however, provide solutions for all
churches.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000018">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T11:25:19"></hs_TimeCode>
conclude by mentioning one situation that my hon. Friend
raised—that of St Hilda’s, Ellerburn, in North Yorkshire.
St Hilda’s is a single vestibule building, and in such a case
there is simply no possibility of moving bats to a less sensitive area.
To resolve the problem there, Natural England has let a contract to
gain the necessary evidence to enable the complete exclusion of bats
from the church. It was hoped that the exclusion would occur before the
bats begin to arrive in a week or two’s time, to avoid entombing
the young bats. If, because of the unpredictable weather, insufficient
data were gathered before the summer to support an exclusion at St
Hilda’s, work will continue over the summer to ensure that there
is enough information to reach an absolutely clear resolution of the
problem in that
church.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062556000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062556000019">I

Clark</B> (North Ayrshire and Arran) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure,
Mr Davies, to see you in the Chair and to have secured this debate on
the privatisation of Royal Mail. I should declare an interest here. I
am chair of the Communication Workers Union’s parliamentary
group. Members may well be aware that only last week in a consultative
ballot on Royal Mail 96% of CWU members voted to reject the
Government’s proposals in relation to privatisation. Other
organisations such as the National Federation of SubPostmasters have
also expressed concerns about the Government’s plans and have
called for a delay in the proposals. It says that post offices will
face an “extremely uncertain future” should the proposals
go ahead. Given the concern in the industry about the
Government’s plans, Parliament should have the time and the
opportunity to debate such
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062568000006"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:30:47"></hs_TimeCode>In
addition to the concerns that I have just outlined in relation to post
offices, the affordable six-day service is under threat and would be
less secure if Royal Mail is transferred into private ownership. The
Government claim that the universal service is enshrined in law, but
many aspects of the universal service obligation are set by the
regulator and can be easily changed. The track record of the regulator
to date does not inspire confidence. The regulator has recently
consulted on user needs from the universal service. It looked at ways
in which the universal service could be changed to make it cheaper to
run, including getting rid of first-class mail and therefore next-day
service, reducing quality standards and cutting delivery days from six
to five days each
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:32:24"></hs_TimeCode>. The
regulator stepped back from making any changes, but a privatised Royal
Mail under severe pressure to compete and to generate a return for
shareholders is likely to lobby for such
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:32:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062568000007">In
the coalition agreement, the Government said that they would aim to
inject private capital into Royal Mail. The Postal Services Act 2011,

Clark:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a powerful point, which I
hope to explore in my speech. The point that I was making 18 months ago
when I previously secured a debate on this issue was that no other
country in the world has attempted to do what the Government are doing
here, which is to separate the mail service from the post office
network. At that time, a great deal of the concern over the proposed
privatisation related to the already vulnerable post office network. At
the time, there were many warm words from the Government about how post
offices would not suffer as they would become the front of house for
the Government. Indeed, the Government said in that debate that they
were looking at a range of both national and local government services
that post offices could provide. They said that post offices could act
as the front line for users in local
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0001.htm#13062568000015">One
of the major reasons why the National Federation of SubPostmasters is
now saying that there should be an immediate delay in the privatisation
plans is that the Government have failed to deliver on that promise.
Its concern is that post offices remain highly dependent on Royal Mail
transactions. It says that both post offices and a stand-alone Post
Office Ltd would have a highly uncertain future should privatisation of
Royal Mail go

debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T14:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000067">As
the hon. Lady says, Royal Mail is an essential part of Britain’s
social and economic fabric. One of the UK’s largest companies,
it has more than 150,000 employees and a turnover approaching £9
billion. In 2012, research 
<?notus-xml column=43?>from the Centre for Economics and Business Research found that, in terms
of Royal Mail’s economic footprint, its core UK business ranks
as the eighth largest organisation in the UK. It contributes nearly
0.5% to the UK’s total GDP, rising to 0.7% when its wider
economic impacts are included. That means that, for every £1
Royal Mail pays in wages, an additional 57p is generated elsewhere in
the economy; it is a massive organisation by anyone’s standards,
and one that is operating in a fast-moving and ever-changing
marketplace. Like any business of that scale, the key to Royal
Mail’s future success is access to the flexible capital that it
needs to innovate and
invest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:00:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000068">My
first real involvement with Royal Mail came back in the ’90s,
when I was running my own small business. In the days before e-mail, as
I am sure everyone recalls, we had a daily collection for franked mail,
through which we sent out all our mailshots, quotes, artwork and
invoices, as well as the products that we manufactured. Now, all those
things, other than the products themselves, are sent electronically. My
business, like many others, has seen a massive fall in its use of the
post. Conversely, of course, there are other small businesses across
the UK for which the internet has been the catalyst for a massive
increase in their use of Royal Mail, with the growth of online
shopping, eBay and mail
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:00:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000069">On
average, the spend on post by small businesses is quite low—just
£9 a month for the average micro-business. Royal Mail has always
kept the needs of business customers at its heart, as far as I can
tell. Prices of franking services used by businesses have lagged behind
inflation for many years and continue to do so. Franking customers
benefit from good prices and significant discounts, but even so, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:01:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:01:12"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Lady said, the marketplace is increasingly competitive. Many large
businesses, such as banks and utility companies, already employ one of
Royal Mail’s rivals, such as TNT and UK Mail, to collect bulk
mail. According to its website, UK Mail is the UK’s self-styled
leading alternative mail service provider and claims to handle more
than 2 billion letters per annum and to support more than
1,000 businesses.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:01:58"></hs_TimeCode> survive in
the face of such competition, Royal Mail needs flexibility to act in
the most businesslike way
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000070">I

visit to Glasgow, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:01:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin) mentioned a moment ago, and I was
struck by how unbusinesslike the Royal Mail’s spokesperson was
in his approach to potential Scottish independence. I found that
shocking. Royal Mail must act in a more businesslike way, and it needs
to improve its efficiency to invest and innovate, which means that it
needs access to the capital that other large companies enjoy so that it
is sustainable over the long
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:02:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000071"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Gregory Campbell" PimsId="2448" UID="13062568000307" xid="95" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000307"><B>Mr

excellent point, but for any business to continue, it cannot just look
at what it is doing now; it must consider future challenges. As we have
already heard, the self-styled rivals to Royal Mail offer daily
challenges, and any company with long-term aspirations must be able to
innovate, invest and grow in the future. That is the problem. At the
moment, Royal Mail is competing for scarce public capital against other
priorities such as schools and hospitals. Unless Royal Mail can access
equity markets, every £1 that it borrows is another
£1 on the national

Stoke-on-Trent have gone through incredible change and have adapted to
new systems. Indeed, they are so efficient that I sometimes wonder how
on earth our postal workers manage to do some of the things they are
being asked to do. There is new equipment and new vans. There has been
huge investment, and the work force have adapted incredibly to very
stringent business standards. I really do not recognise the picture

Dinenage:</Member></B> I am sure Stoke-on-Trent is a fabulous paragon
of what our wonderful mail services do—as is Gosport, I hasten
to add. I do not think anyone today is in any way casting aspersions on
either the service or the quality that Royal Mail delivers; we are
talking about how to ensure that Royal Mail is able to continue doing
that in the long term when we are facing other challenges to the public
purse. Clearly, adding further to the national debt would not be
responsible in the current environment, especially when Royal Mail can
run on a fully commercial basis and already has the capacity to be
profitable, as we have
heard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000075">Royal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:05:25"></hs_TimeCode>
Mail has the highest service specification of any major European
universal postal service: 93% of first-class mail is delivered the next
working day and 99.9% of delivery routes are completed each day. But I
argue that the quality of service framework that applies to Royal Mail
under public ownership would continue to apply under private ownership.
We talk about private businesses being interested only in shareholder
profit, but having run a private business for more than 20 years, we
are also very keen on quality of service and maintaining our customers,
which must be taken into
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:05:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000076">Leading
postal operators that provide universal postal services in other
European countries have moved into the private sector and been
successful. The Austrian postal service and Deutsche Post, for example,
have delivered consistently high mail profitability since flotation,
and Deutsche Post is perceived as being in the vanguard of digital
transition. Furthermore, levels of service  have remained
consistently high. In 2012, for example, the proportion of letters
delivered the next day in Germany and Austria was 95%,
compared with the 93% regulatory target in the UK. Those and other
international examples 
<?notus-xml column=45?>show private sector investment delivering competitive, profitable postal
frameworks without necessarily compromising on service

Government say that their overarching objective is to safeguard the
one-price-goes-anywhere, six-days-a-week universal service, to deliver
taxpayers value for money and to deliver customers the quality of
service that they are used to. The best way to safeguard the universal
service for future generations is to combine the best of both the
public sector and the private sector and to give Royal Mail the
independence, flexibility and, above all, access to the investment it
needs to face future
challenges.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13062568000253" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000253">3.7

congratulate my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark), who
chairs that group, on securing this timely and important debate and on

course, this debate is timely in that it closely follows the result of
the ballot held last week. The result should embarrass the Government,
as 96% of postal staff rejected their plans, despite the cash bribes
that Ministers said postal staff would receive. That is a reminder to
the Government that principles cannot be privatised, which I know is
not something many Tory MPs understand. For them, privatisation is a
panacea to every problem, whether or not the problem is even genuine. I
say that because this debate strikes more than a passing resemblance to
the debate on the privatisation of the east coast main line, with which
I will draw some parallels to make my points even
stronger<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:08:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000080">Just
as with the east coast main line, the Government want to privatise a
key national asset against the wishes of the vast majority of
stakeholders, and just as with the east coast main line, the desire to
privatise clearly owes more to dogma than to the bottom line. The east
coast main line has flourished under public control since the collapse
of the private operator and has generated hundreds of millions of
pounds in returns to the Treasury while requiring little subsidy and
ploughing tens of millions of pounds from the remaining profits into
service
improvements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:08:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
Similarly, last month we saw that Royal Mail profits are also showing
hefty improvements —up to £324 million—as
a result of modernisation and the increasingly buoyant internet sales
market. Royal Mail has made a total of more than £0.5 billion
over the past two financial
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000081">The
east coast main line and Royal Mail are not failing monoliths or drains
on public resources; they are valued services that can and should
provide an ongoing contribution to the public purse. Yes, we should
always look for them to be better, but private does not necessarily
mean better and in many cases may well mean worse. In both cases, the
fear is that the Government are opting for a short-term, one-off cash
boost ahead of the election, rather than retaining assets that can and
should generate ongoing returns to the public purse for years and
decades to come.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>
I am sure the Minister will say that that is not the case. Why, then,
do the Government plan to pursue the sale of shares in Royal Mail
during 
<?notus-xml column=46?>this financial year, while markets are still quite shaky, rather than
waiting until the time is right, to ensure that the best value can be
achieved for taxpayers? If Royal Mail is sold off in the next few
months, what guarantees do we have that that would represent a good
deal for the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>? I know
there is a difference between rail franchising and a flotation, but
what guarantees will we have that the taxpayer will not be called on to
foot the bill for private failure, if it comes to that, as happened
with the east coast
line<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:10:22"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000082">It
should not be forgotten that, in pressing ahead, Ministers are not only
forgoing the decades of returns that could be realised, but undermining
the job security of more than 100,000 postal workers. They are also
putting at risk the future of a service that millions of people rely
on, despite having no electoral mandate to do so. As always, a Tory
Government are putting private profits before
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000083">My
constituents want their Royal Mail to continue to represent their
monarch, not to operate in the interests of overseas royal families as
part of their investment portfolios. They also want their Royal
Mail’s directors to concentrate on improving services, not the
bank balances of shareholders, which they would have a duty to do.
Finally, they want their Royal Mail to concentrate on maintaining local
delivery offices and on keeping services affordable because of the
social benefit they bring, not on stripping assets to satisfy the
demands of institutional
investors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I

I would like to start by paying tribute to the Post Office and Royal

the sorting office in Stourbridge. I visited the delivery office early

the case for part-privatising the Royal Mail service to guarantee its

that point, firmly believing that Royal Mail was not sustainable in the
form it existed in at that time. The current Government are merely
taking on that unfinished business so that Royal Mail can, as my hon.

capital on the stock market. We can surely all agree that we do not
want to add in any way, shape or form to the country’s debt if

Post Office Counters local service back in an area that had its post

served on the Committee that considered what is now the Postal Services
Act 2011. I opposed privatisation at the time; nothing that has
happened since has persuaded me to do otherwise, and I still strongly
oppose privatisation. Areas such as mine have seen major changes in
postal services, with reductions in mail collections and ever later
deliveries.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:18:27"></hs_TimeCode> I

business side of the matter that I want to comment on. Royal Mail is
not a drag on public spending, but an important economic driver,
especially in rural areas. In his evidence to the Committee that
considered the Postal Services Act 2011, Richard Hooper quoted the
point that I made to him at the outset of his 2008 investigation of
Royal Mail, during the Labour Government. I observed that the universal
service is crucial to businesses in rural areas, and have argued that
point ever since. It colours my whole attitude to the
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:20:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:20:19"></hs_TimeCode>;

Hooper made a point about a young lady with a mobile phone and laptop,
and wondered why she would need anyone’s physical address.
Perhaps she has now moved on to a smartphone, and I empathise with that
view, because young people are no different in Angus from anywhere
else. They use e-mail and texts. Mr Hooper made the point that only
about 10% of mail is private letters, and about 8% of that is sent
around Christmas—it is mainly cards. That is a sobering fact,
and I suspect that things have deteriorated since then. It seemed to me
that there were fewer Christmas cards about last year. Perhaps that was
because of the rising cost of postage, or perhaps I am simply less
popular—I do not know. The youngster with the phone and laptop
may never feel the need to write a letter, but I am almost certain that
if they live in a rural area they will use the internet to order books,
CDs or DVDs, even though those may be under threat from digital
streaming, and, increasingly, fashionable clothing—not a problem
I have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:21:19"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are very few outlets for entertainment and fashion items in rural areas
now.</hs_Para>

is sobering that when last Christmas I, like many others, visited my
local sorting office, I was struck by the fact that it was stacked with
packages from Amazon and similar online retailers. That is where the
great growth in mail delivery is happening. The important point for
areas such as mine is that the process works both ways. Not only do
people in rural areas use the post to get items delivered; crucially,
small and medium-sized businesses in those communities use Royal Mail
to get their products out. In many cases they do not have an 
<?notus-xml column=49?>alternative. The other private companies do not offer a service in many
parts of rural Scotland. The universal service is crucial to those
businesses, and it is crucial to those of us who hope that businesses
will be created and sustained in rural areas.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Stourbridge (Margot James) said that the regulations
under the Bill were sufficient to enable a universal service obligation
to be maintained. I am afraid I do not accept that. There are many
aspects of the Bill that cause me great concern. That is nothing new,
because under the previous system Royal Mail investigated the
introduction of a zonal pricing system. I must ask what protection the
customer really has. Ofcom has already removed price caps from all
Royal Mail products, apart from the second-class universal mail
service, with the result that that is now the only truly universal
service. First-class mail can be priced out of the reach of many, and
with the price of a first-class stamp already 60p—one of the
highest in Europe—how many people or, crucially, small
businesses will send first-class mail?</hs_Para>

There is nothing in the 2011 Act to prevent Royal Mail or a private

which confirmed in a letter to

Government have talked about an initial public offering, but they have
not ruled out a sale to one of the major international companies, such
as TNT and Deutsche Post. The Communication Workers Union in its
document in relation to the Bill made the views of some of those
companies about the universal service very clear: they amount to an
intention to get rid of it if they can, because they consider it to be
an anchor on their
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:24:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000103">Ministers
have previously argued that the universal service is a benefit to Royal
Mail, as it is the only carrier that guarantees a delivery to every
address. However, that ceases to be true when other companies take on
the most profitable routes. A couple of months back I met a man
delivering mail on the stairs of the block of flats where I live in
London. He was wearing a postal uniform, but not a Royal Mail one: it
was a TNT uniform. Ofcom has already, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:25:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Ayrshire and Arran said, sanctioned trials in areas of London
for other companies to run an end-to-end service. Quite how that fits
in with attempts to sell Royal Mail to such companies I am not sure,
but it is a sure sign of the huge pressures on the USO that will come
with privatisation. You can bet the mortgage on the fact that they
might do it in London, but they will not do it in rural
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:25:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000104">I

in an intervention on
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:26:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stourbridge (Margot James), 96% of the members of the union who
were balloted said, on a 74% turnout, that they did not want that. Even
Boris Johnson, who constantly lectures the unions about ballot
thresholds, could hardly argue against those sorts of
figures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:26:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000107">I
have no doubt that people will say, “It’s self-interest.
They want to remain where they are,” but the bosses of Royal
Mail said—pigs may fly one day—that the terms and
conditions of the workers will not be affected; so they cannot be
accused of self-interest on that point. Perhaps their self-interest is
based on their pride and faith in the service. They believe that Royal
Mail is not just a brand to be bought and sold in the marketplace; they
believe in the principles and ethos of public service. So do many other
public service workers. In the past 25-plus years the House has ignored
their voices. We have always known better. For example, in 1992 the
public services trade unions argued against the private finance
initiative. Hardly anyone in the House today would speak in favour of
PFI as a wonderful success, but for 25 years when the trade unions said
anything the response was, “Ignore them—they are just
looking after their members.” They were right when they said it
would not work: it has not
worked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T15:27:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000108">Likewise,
members of the National Union of Mineworkers said, “If you close
the mines in this country and privatise them, what will you end up
with?” We can see what we ended up with: there are three coal
mines left in this country; we import 50 million tonnes of coal from
some of the least secure regimes in the world; and the reality is that
the lights of this country may go out. Similarly there was the
“Tell Sid” debacle: “Tell Sid” to have
shares, and we will transfer all the risk to the private utilities.
What did we end up with? The voice of the work force was ignored, and
the utilities sector is not fit for purpose. There is a £200
billion bill—we will have to find that to make sure we can power
our country for the future—and a pricing regime that has pushed
millions of people into fuel

the same process that is now being suggested for Royal Mail was carried
out in the deregulation of bus services. In my part of the world we had
something called Busways. We were told clearly, “Sell the shares
to the work force—it will be their company.” What
happened? In a few short months there was a management buy-out. Four
people walked away with millions of pounds; the people on the ground
were left with worse terms and conditions, working bad shifts with
lower numbers, a poorer service for the public, a worse deal for the
work force, and huge hikes for those using the service.</hs_Para>

ignored. We saw what happened last week, but I will tell you what: I
bet the two previous Health Secretaries—and probably the present
one—wish they had paid a bit more attention to the people who
actually work in the service than they did to those who advised them.

the coal industry, which has been completely obliterated, and the
electricity industry, in which the big six companies make billions of

of fuel poverty. We only have to look at the privatisation of telecoms

completely lacking. Privatisation fails this country. The record is

and the coalition in the short term, not what is best for the country.
For the record, Royal Mail is making a profit. It is a profitable and

on what has happened since the Government argued for privatisation, the
original Hooper report of 2008 identified a number of issues faced by
Royal Mail. Many of those issues have been resolved, notably the
pension deficit and regulation, which leaves the Government’s

the Government’s claim, there is no good reason why Royal Mail
should not be able to borrow the capital that it needs to invest, while
remaining in the public sector. That would not be at the expense of
public sector spending, and it would not need to count towards
Government debt. In 2008, the Hooper report identified five problems

goes back to the 1980s, the last time a Conservative Government decided
to go on a privatisation binge. I saw it up close, personal and at
first hand when I was an employee of British Telecom and the
Conservative Government at that time decided to sell it off, supposedly
to make it leaner and more competitive. I saw job losses, closed depots

plug a gap left by failing Government policies and to pay for the
rising number of unemployed. The current group of state-owned
businesses proposed for privatisation could fetch nearly £9
billion, £3 billion of which would come from the sale of Royal
Mail. The original rationale for privatising the Royal Mail was that it
was making a loss. We now know that that is no longer true. Annual
profits are up more than 60%, and figures show that the amount of mail
being sent has risen.</hs_Para>

They do more than just deliver mail, and they go in early to set out

mail back and not deliver the full amount. Posties are the ones who we
see in the community and who are recognised as part of the community;

the industrial relations issues that we heard about in the CWU survey

the position of Royal Mail on delivering that USO is compromised by the

what has been done since, shows that the company can be viable in the
public sector. The issues raised by Hooper deserve a bit of attention.
The pension fund assets have of course gone into the public purse, so
the public purse is now responsible for the liabilities. In essence,
having just nationalised the liabilities to the taxpayer, the
Government now propose to privatise the potential profits. The
regulatory environment has improved, following the transfer of
responsibilities to Ofcom, and we have seen that in the deregulation of
pricing, with the exception of second-class stamps; a lot of the
profits over the past year or 18 months have been directly attributable

for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark) on securing this debate, and
I thank hon. Members who have contributed to it. It has been a good
debate, and I welcome the opportunity to respond to the issues raised

in this financial year.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=57?><hs_Para UID="13062568000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000149">The
Government’s overarching objective is to secure the future of
the universal postal service: the six-day-a-week service at uniform,
affordable prices that delivers throughout the UK. The service is vital
to our economy. The Government’s reforms go back to Richard
Hooper’s independent review of the postal sector which was
commissioned by the Labour Government because the volume of mail was
falling. That review concluded that there was a substantial threat to
Royal Mail’s financial stability and that the universal service
was under threat. It recommended that action should be taken as a
package to secure the universal postal service with responsibility for
postal regulation being transferred to Ofcom, the Government tackling
the historic pension deficit, and Royal Mail entering into a strategic
partnership with one or more private sector companies to give it
commercial confidence, access to capital and corporate experience. The
Labour Government accepted those
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000150">In
2010, following an updated report by Richard Hooper that confirmed his
initial findings, apart from the need for a strategic partnership, the
new Government introduced a Bill to enable implementation of the
package of recommendations. Since the Postal Services Act 2011 received
Royal Assent in June 2011, we have implemented two elements of that
package by establishing Ofcom as the regulator with stronger powers to
protect the universal service, and by taking on Royal Mail’s
historic pension deficit. By removing those major barriers, Royal Mail
has begun its journey to long-term sustainability. It is now
profitable, as hon. Members have said, and its overall financial
position has improved.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062568000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000151">The challenge
now is to maintain that positive momentum. We should not forget that in
recent history the Royal Mail group has swung between profit and loss.
Royal Mail’s core UK letters and parcels business suffered
losses in five of the last 12 years. During that period, overall losses
were around £1 billion and around 60,000 jobs were lost, so
resting on the current year’s profitability is not enough. The
core UK network made a margin of 3.9% in that financial year, which was
an improvement, but it was well below international peers such as
Deutsche Post and Austrian Post with a margin of more than 8% and
Belgium Post with a margin of 17%.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13062568000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000152">A more
profitable Royal Mail will be better able to weather any future market
weakness and, more importantly, will be able to take advantage of new
opportunities. The company needs future access to private capital to be
able to continue its modernisation programme and to seize opportunities
for growth such as the boom in on-line shopping. The final phase of our
reforms and implementation of the Hooper recommendations is the sale of
Royal Mail shares, which will give Royal Mail future access to private
capital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000153">That
is the way to put Royal Mail’s future on to a long-term
sustainable basis. It is consistent with developments in Europe where
privatised operators in Austria, Germany and Belgium have been
profitable and continue to provide high quality services. Only last
week, there was a successful sale of shares in the Belgian post
operator, bpost. The Government’s decision to sell shares in
Royal Mail is not ideological. It is a practical, logical and
commercial decision, just as the Labour Government’s decision
was in 2009. What they got 
<?notus-xml column=58?>wrong and what everyone opposed, including me and most Labour MPs at the
time, was of course their proposed
implementation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000154">I

change it. Only the House can change the universal service

important question from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:21:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Ayrshire and Arran on what triggers a review of the universal
service requirement: could Ofcom do it at any time or does a review
need ministerial permission and so on? The answer is that Ofcom can
review user needs at any time and it must carry out such a review
before it can modify any part of the universal service order, but it
cannot modify the order in a way that changes the minimum requirements.
That can be done only by Parliament amending the Postal Services Act
2011, which gives all of us the protection we need, and that protection
continues irrespective of the ownership of Royal Mail.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady asked about disposables. The directors of the
company—a privately owned Royal Mail—must act in the best

the postal access file as an integral part of the business. It is
separately regulated by Ofcom, and that separate regulation continues
irrespective of the particulars of ownership. If I have missed any of

Royal Mail is a business with a £9 billion turnover, which

<?notus-xml column=59?>economy should have access to the flexible capital it needs: to continue
to modernise; to become more efficient and competitive; to innovate and
invest; and to seize opportunities presented by new markets, such as
the rapid growth of online shopping. Over the past years, Royal
Mail’s investment in the business has increased from £555
million to £665 million. As I said earlier, Royal Mail is
profitable, but its margins are still behind those of its competitors.
Investment remains crucial if it is to continue to improve margins and
provide the services that customers
demand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000162">No<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>
responsible party would propose that in the current environment Royal
Mail should have to compete for scarce public capital against other
services, such as schools and hospitals. Royal Mail, run on a fully
commercial basis, has the capacity to be cash-generative, profitable
and perfectly able to raise the capital it needs from the private
sector. A sale of shares will also reduce the possibility of any future
government interference in the operations of the company. It is time
for Government to step back from Royal Mail, to allow its management to
focus wholeheartedly on growing the business and planning for the
future. We will give Royal Mail the commercial freedom it has needed

long.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_25_PT_1/4C098ACFA7BD13FC55558ADD26096975CC6FEC36" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="25 June 2013">Tuesday

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:24:38"></hs_TimeCode> am pleased to
be able to lead a debate  on this most important subject. I
shall speak about mitochondrial disease, the devastation it causes and
the new techniques developed by Newcastle university to prevent it. I
declare an interest in that my father studied medicine at Newcastle, so
I am a natural champion of that great university’s medical
research and innovation. I am here primarily to champion not Newcastle
university however, but the interests of my constituents struck down by
mitochondrial disease, and indeed all those who suffer from
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000164">The
subject is technical and I will attempt to be clear as possible in
setting out the arguments.
Mitochondria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:25:19"></hs_TimeCode> are
found in every cell in the human body, except red blood cells. They are
the batteries generating energy for the cell. Mitochondria convert the
energy of food molecules into the energy that powers the cell’s
functions. About 200 children are born every year with a mitochondrial
disease. Such diseases are passed from mothers to their children and
are caused by faulty mitochondria. Like all DNA, the DNA in
mitochondria can mutate and mothers can pass those mutations on to
their children. Faulty mitochondria mean that the cells are unable to
function normally and the diseases caused by them can have a
devastating effect on families. The diseases tend to affect parts of
the body that use a lot of energy, such as the brain, muscles, nerves,
liver, kidney and heart, and vary widely in severity, from
life-threatening to having few or no obvious symptoms.
Symptoms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:26:44"></hs_TimeCode> vary,
but can include poor growth, muscle weakness, tiredness, poor
co-ordination, and sensory, respiratory or cognitive
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000165">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:26:54"></hs_TimeCode>
are no effective treatments available for serious mitochondrial
disease. When the cells go wrong, it can result in serious conditions,
including blindness, fatal heart failure, liver failure, learning
disabilities and diabetes, and can lead to death in early infancy.
Prevention is the only realistic option. In 2010, Newcastle university
scientists, with funding from the Wellcome Trust, pioneered research
into variations of in vitro fertilisation procedures that could prevent
the transmission of the genetic mutations that cause these devastating
disorders. The techniques use part of an egg donated by a healthy
individual, to replace the faulty mitochondria of the affected mother.
The intention is to give affected families a chance to have healthy
children that are genetically related to them, but born free of
mitochondrial disorders. Such techniques are not currently permitted in
the UK, but legislation allows the Government to introduce secondary
legislation that would allow the treatments to be
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000166">Mitochondrial
disease can blight families for generations, because, as I said, it is
passed from the mother to child during pregnancy. The techniques could
put a stop to it, by preventing the faulty mitochondria from being
passed to the embryo. Mitochondrial disease affects about 6,000 adults
in the UK. In my constituency, four families—Bumstead, Cass,
Bland and Mahmood—suffer from mitochondrial disease. Although
every effort is being made to help them, there is no cure. For example,
Lily Cass, who is in her 70s now, has five brothers and three 
<?notus-xml column=61?>sisters, and one brother who died at 56. They are all affected in
different ways by mitochondrial diseases, and some more severely than
others. Some days, Lily can hardly move due to lack of energy caused by
her faulty mitochondria, which takes all her strength away. She has
four children, including a daughter, who is likely to pass the disease
on to her children. She worries about that all the time.</hs_Para>

advances, it is right that the ethics are properly considered before
techniques are adopted, and the Minister will be aware that concerns
have been raised. There are those who argue that the techniques create
children with three parents, but the embryo would carry only a small
number of genes from the donor—just 13 out of 23,000, or 0.056%
of the genetic material. How much of a parent is that? The function of
the 13 genes is restricted to powering the mitochondria; they do not
affect personal characteristics such as eye or hair colour, or
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000169">Last
June, the Nuffield Council on Bioethics produced a report that found
that the technique would be an ethical treatment option for affected
families, as long as research showed that treatment was likely to be
safe and effective, and families were offered full information and
support. The council’s report found that no strong cultural or
social emphasis is generally placed on mitochondrial inheritance as a
specific element of personal identity. Many of the social and
biological aspects that typically imply a “parent”, and
may be relevant in egg donation for reproduction, do not apply to
mitochondrial donation. The council therefore suggested that if the
treatments were made available, mitochondrial donors should not have
the same status in regulation as reproductive egg
donors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000170"><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Mary Glindon" PimsId="5558" UID="13062568000327" xid="1213" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000327"><B>Mrs

Onwurah:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. There has been some
debate about the status not only of the donors but, most importantly,
of the children. The Nuffield Council on Bioethics says that families
must be offered full information and support, and that must also apply
to the children, so that they understand the scientific nature of the
very limited gene inheritance from the
donation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000172">If
mitochondrial donors were not given the same status as reproductive egg

permanently cure the disease in future generations. Changes resulting
from the replacement

2012, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology

further 1,800 completed questionnaires. It also organised public
workshops around the UK and spoke to individuals affected by the
diseases, to gauge their views. It published the results in March of
this year, and found broad public support for the use of the

positive, with only 8% negative. When asked about altering the genetic
make-up of an egg or an embryo, 56% were positive or very positive and
only 10% were negative. Attitudes to the use of genetic material from a
third person showed that 44% were positive or very positive, with only
15% negative. The HFEA therefore advised the Government that there was
broad support for mitochondrial replacement being made available to
families at risk of passing on a serious mitochondrial disease. It also
advised that if treatment were to be authorised by Parliament, it
should be under certain conditions, such as its being available only in

Soubry:</Member></B> I absolutely agree. I am perhaps putting the
subject in simple terms, but that is how it is. This is actually about
the fact that if someone is effectively carrying this particular
disease, the mitochondria—the batteries that charge
things—are replaced to make sure that they do not have these
diseases. Because the mitochondria cannot be taken out of the
mother’s egg, a donor egg has to be found. The DNA is removed
from that egg and the mother’s DNA is put in—taking those
good healthy mitochondria or the batteries—so that she has a
healthy egg that, in due course, can be fertilised by the father in the
normal way. It is absolutely right that the genetic make-up of a
resultant child will be the mother’s and father’s. That
does not of course guarantee that the child will have the same colour
eyes as their mother, as we all know, especially me as a blue-eyed
mother with two brown-eyed daughters. As ever, Mr Davies, I digress,

while fortunate in many ways to live in this part of west London,
suffer the severe misfortune of living next to perhaps the most

site sits slap bang in the middle of a residential community and is a
throwback to a time when Horn lane was home to factories rather than
the flats and houses that are there now. As forum posts on the local
residents’ website frequently demonstrate, the community there
cannot fathom how or why that industrial remnant is still allowed to be
there. Residents have had enough of the disappointing performance of
the local authority and the Environment Agency in getting anything
significant done about the consistently excessive pollution that
emanates from the site. They are able to provide numerous examples of
the negative effects it is having on local people’s
health.</hs_Para>

activity. Horn lane has been up there yet again as the most polluted
area in the whole of London. A simple look at the readings broadcast on
Ealing council’s own air quality webpage confirms that Horn lane
is an outlier when compared with other sites, and all the while Ealing
council is bidding to become an air quality exemplar borough, but more

I know from previous attempts to get something done about this
difficult site, responsibility for monitoring and taking enforcement
action when necessary is conveniently shared between a public body, the
Environment Agency, and the local authority, Ealing. I say conveniently
because, as the Minister admitted in his response to me last time, this
creates a complex and all together confusing picture, which I am afraid
all too often leads to spectacular inaction. I do not think it is
overly cynical to say that that suits almost everyone concerned apart
from the residents who have to live with the effects of the site. I am
back again to say that this time enough really must be enough. I am
sick of the excuses. What we need now is meaningful action. Either we
get some proper enforcement against those persistent polluters or we
should completely rezone the area for business and residential use, a
perfectly sensible and achievable ambition, especially with Crossrail
set to arrive at Acton mainline station in the next few
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062568000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/halltext/130625h0002.htm#13062568000204">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T16:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>
the Minister knows from my brief potted history of the saga last time,
a group of determined and committed local residents decided that they
needed to find a way of 
<?notus-xml column=68?>upping the ante and applying pressure on those with the power to take
enforcement action against the operators at the site. They banded
together to form an action group, SHLAP, or Stop Horn Lane Air
Pollution, and I secured a series of meetings for them with the
Environment Agency and an Ealing council officer here in Parliament.
Together we tried to get to the bottom of various licensing agreement
conditions and were presented with endless pages of monitoring
statistics from the various monitors installed at the site as part of
an attempt to control the

was a frustrating exercise in which we learned from the Environment
Agency that because of potential legal action from any company that was
threatened with losing its licence because of regular pollution
breaches, it rarely, if ever, wanted to go down that particular route.
As it said, it would have been necessary to be able to prove precisely
which operator was to blame for any pollution infringement. As that
would be nigh on impossible in such a complex area, it was never really
going to be a

April when it came to the attention of local residents that Ealing

the tune of nearly £500,000 to become an air quality exemplar
borough. Imagine their surprise when, reading the report presented for
a Cabinet discussion on the issue, they discovered there was not even a
mention of Horn lane. Imagine their frustration. It really did beggar
belief that Ealing would put itself forward as an air quality exemplar
borough with absolutely no reference at all to the shocking pollution
levels on Horn lane. Only when that was pointed out to the council did
an addendum to the report magically appear, finally mentioning the

fact the local authority’s casual attitude to the problems of

is its failure to accept that the unusually high pollution levels in
the area are caused by the Horn Lane industrial site, and I am sorry to
say that that was a feature of the Minister’s response back in
2010 as well. The now familiar refrain, or a useful get-out clause is
my view, is that there are numerous other potential sources of
PM10— particulate matter of less than 10 microns in
diameter—close to the monitoring station at the Horn Lane site.

several units engaged in concrete production, aggregate supply, scrap

other two locations.

the immediate Horn Lane area is actually generated by the industrial
site itself. Moreover, there are many other major roads in other parts
of London with similarly heavy traffic that do not generate the high
readings that Horn lane does. It is also worth noting that Horn lane is
a small connecting road, whereas the A40 is a main arterial road and
Hanger lane a major gyratory system.

general traffic in the Horn Lane area, plus the trains, ensures a
degree of pollution that in itself might be problematic, but clearly it
is the addition of the local industrial site that tips the levels
around Horn lane over levels that would be acceptable. That is why
attention must be focused on bearing down on that source of high

say that it has succeeded in reducing the amount of tonnage going
through the waste transfer facility. Despite this, however, on many
occasions the spikes in air pollution remain as high as ever, so
clearly the Environment Agency has not got to the bottom of the
problem. Indeed, despite the engagement of the agency with the local
SHLAP group, local residents are still being exposed to unacceptably
high levels of pollution. The official monitoring statistics continue

Ealing council has consistently failed to do anything about a road
that—under its watch—has fast become what is often the
most polluted road in London. For example, it is quite extraordinary
that Hansons, the cement plant, got away with expansion without
planning permission, and it was only after local pressure was 
<?notus-xml column=70?>exerted that the council is now insisting on a retrospective planning

there is a wide range of powers available to local authorities,

is no use the council launching new and costly consultations about what
new monitoring or green infrastructure measures might help to ease the
problem. We have already had eight years of monitoring. At the very
least, what is needed is action against the pollution perpetrators and,
more importantly, greater thought to be given to a site that should be

the problem. Also attending the meeting on 12 July will be
representatives from City Hall and I hope that Ealing council will be

understand that when a rezoning is being considered there are
implications for the Mayor’s London plan, which make things more
difficult. In particular, the site also operates as an important
railhead for freight transport, which takes a degree of pressure off
all the roads going into central London. Clearly, that element of the
site might have to remain, but why should that preclude proper
consideration being given to the rezoning of the rest of the site?
After all, if we were planning from scratch, would we put this
industrial site right in the heart of a residential community? I do not
think we would.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T17:04:35"></hs_TimeCode> benefits of

the Mayor, who is the strategic lead for air quality in London, and my

several industrial processes adjacent to residential properties and a

waste transfer, scrap metal, aggregate supply and a concrete batching
process. In addition, there are various key transport pollution sources
in the area, including traffic on Horn lane and on the western A40;
buses along Horn lane; and trains on the adjacent railway. But I
concede my hon. Friend’s point that, although those may be part
of the problem, they are not the significant driver, because plenty of
other areas in her constituency with the same transport issues do not
have this problem. One does not have to be a scientist or to have any

April 2013 DWP introduced mandatory reconsideration for universal
credit and personal independence payment, which will be extended to all
other DWP administered benefits and child maintenance cases from
October 2013. The mandatory reconsideration process results in a
linear, escalating process for claimants wishing to dispute decisions.
The decision maker will contact the claimant to provide an explanation
of the decision under dispute and encourage the claimant to provide any
additional information or evidence that may change the decision. This
will ensure DWP has an opportunity to resolve disputes at an early
stage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13062592000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130625/text/130625w0001.htm#13062592000226">The

It will provide scalable protection for the head, torso and

protection of its vehicles in order to counter a range of threats
including blasts. Physical protection includes armour as one of these
layers. Physical protective measures are supplemented by layers that
aim to reduce the likelihood of blast attacks occurring in the first

procedures and the effective use of

It offers a range of services to entertain and inform the UK armed

the Ministry of Defence to deliver audio and audio visual services
commencing in April 2013 to Defence personnel and dependents at
locations in the UK and overseas. Decisions on other broadcast services
that SSVC might offer that could be received by the general public are
primarily a matter for SSVC's board of trustees.</hs_Para>

Harper:</Member></B> Home Office Immigration Enforcement regularly
conducts manual embarkation checks on passengers on an intelligence-led
basis, targeting routes which are known to be used by
immigration offenders. This ensures that immigration
offenders are prevented from returning to the UK for a defined period.
Embarkation checks can be conducted at any port, including Terminal 4
at London Heathrow. More generally, the use of advance passenger
information supports our ability to undertake effective exit checks as
passengers leave the UK.</hs_Para>

related, per year from 2010 to 2012. It should be noted that the
Security Industry Authority (SIA) takes into account all convictions,
spent and unspent. As such for reporting purposes it is not recorded
whether a licence is refused on the basis of spent or unspent
convictions, but simply on the basis of

Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for
South West Surrey (Mr Hunt), on the importance of podiatry to people's
overall health, and the Department has issued no guidance on the
commissioning of podiatry services. It is the responsibility of local
clinical commissioning groups to commission services to meet the needs
of their community including the provision of podiatry services. The
Department does not centrally collect the data on the amount that was
spent on podiatry in the past or within each constituency, or what the
expected level of spending on podiatry services will be in the future.
The spend and priority of allocation of podiatry services is for local
determination.</hs_Para>

there were 98 compromise agreements issued. During 2010-11, 2011-12 and
2012-13 the Fund issued 25, nine and nine compromise agreements

countries to ensure that all aspects of their health
systems—including health workers, medicines and commodities,
equipment, financing arid management—are working well. DFID
provides technical support directly to countries in ail of these areas.
DFID also uses multilateral organisations to provide technical support.
For example, DFID is funding the World Health Organization (WHO) to
help more than 20 countries develop and implement health
financing strategies based on the best available evidence and aimed at
achieving universal health coverage. In order to strengthen WHO's own
capacity to do this work, DFID has also seconded a health financing

Statutory guidance sets out the criteria for initiating a Serious Case

Department does not exempt LSCBs from publishing an SCR. It is for each
LSCB to take the decision as to whether or not to publish. From 1 July
2013 a national panel of independent experts will be fully operational.
The panel will advise, and where appropriate, challenge LSCBs on any
case where an LSCB has concerns about publication of an SCR report
and/or intends not to publish an SCR report.</hs_Para>

the academic years 2011/12 and 2012/13 we provided £65 million

excellent commercial deals with its suppliers resulting in the

To qualify for incapacity benefit claimants have to undertake a medical
assessment of incapacity for work called a personal capability
assessment. Under the employment support allowance regime, new
claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment. From April
2011 incapacity benefit recipients began also to undertake this
assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not
itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment support
allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer
claiming IB or ESA on the basis of drug abuse would be based on their
ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the
personal/work capability assessment; or on the effects of any
associated mental health
problems.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment support allowance (ESA)
from October
2008.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
Medical condition is based on evidence provided at the start of the
claim, this in itself does not confer entitlement to IB/SDA or ESA and
may not represent a claimants most recent medical condition. Please
also note that where someone has more than one diagnosis or disabling
condition only the predominant one is currently
recorded.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
DLA case loads give the number of people in receipt to DLA and so
excludes people where the payment has been suspended, for example if
they are in
hospital.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is
automatically entitled to DLA. Entitlement is dependent on an
assessment of how much help someone needs with personal care and/or
mobility because of their disability. For example, a customer would not
be awarded DLA on the basis of a diagnosis of drug/alcohol abuse the
decision is based upon the care/supervision and difficulty getting
around as a result of the substance dependency and any associated
physical or psychological complications. These statistics are only
collected for administrative
purposes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7.
For DLA it is not possible to break down drug abuse or alcoholism into
separate
categories.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">DWP
