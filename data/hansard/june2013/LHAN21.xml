preventing and combating violence against women and girls.
Our national campaigns try to encourage teenagers to rethink
their views about abuse. Government-funded community activity
challenges so-called “honour crimes” and new legislation
against stalking and forced marriage sends a strong preventive message.
However, as this report highlights, there is much more to do. Our
updated action plan strengthens our preventive approach, responding to
a number of the End Violence Against Women coalition’s
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:07:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Howe of Idlicote" PimsId="1034" UID="13062064000679" xid="1751" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000679">Baroness
Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that very
useful list of activities. However, in view of the report’s
considerable concern that the Department for Education has
substantially reduced spending in this whole area, how will the
Government ensure that every child receives age-appropriate information
in schools—for example, about the harmful effects of
pornography—not least since a report from the Children’s
Commissioner for England, entitled <I>Porn is Everywhere</I>, also
underlines the urgent need for such

Northover:</Member></B> This report emphasises that we face a wide
cultural challenge, which needs to be tackled at every level by
everybody. The quality of teaching in schools is very important. The
Department for Education is providing funding for the PSHE Association
to work with schools to support them in developing their own curricula
and improving the quality of teaching, which is clearly
key<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:08:21"></hs_TimeCode>. In
addition, from September 2014, the new computing curriculum ensures
that, for the first time, pupils aged five to 11 will be taught about

McColl of Dulwich:</Member></B> My Lords, as people generally seem very
reluctant to believe the extent of the abuse, is it not time for the
Government to broadcast the figures in more dramatic terms? For
instance, they could say that millions of men are smashing up millions
of women and that millions of men are sexually abusing millions of
children. These abusers are normally distributed throughout society,
which might account for the fact that so few prosecutions
occur<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:09:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

88 women were killed by a partner, 60,000 women were raped and 400,000
were sexually abused. The report talks about a “watershed
moment” in relation to child sexual abuse and other violence
against women and girls, as shown by the concern about the Savile
investigations, and so on. We have to make sure that it is indeed a
watershed moment and that things start to
improve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:09:29"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Smith of Basildon" PimsId="5786" UID="13062064000683" xid="2058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000683">Baroness
Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Baroness will be
aware of the value of women’s refuges, which allow women to
remove themselves from immediate danger of physical or sexual violence
towards them or their children. A number of refuges are reporting
serious financial difficulties at the moment. Will the Government
consider carrying out some kind of review of the impact of local
government cuts and of stopping the ring-fencing of financial support
so that we can assess that impact and see what can be done to ensure
that these refuges have the finance that they so desperately

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a clear link
between domestic violence and sexual abuse and women’s
offending, with between 50% and 80% of the women in our prisons being
victims. Is this not a sound reason for devoting more government
resources, as this report demands, to education and to campaigning in
the community to help to bring an end to this dreadful

Northover:</Member></B> We recognise the challenge posed by female
offenders and the fact that they themselves are often at risk of
violence and have specific rehabilitation needs, as well as often
having high levels of mental health problems. Many of them have indeed
suffered domestic violence. The Ministry of Justice has just set up a
cross-departmental advisory board on women offenders, chaired by the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State. This group will be looking at
more provision in the community, more rehabilitation, a review of the
prison estate to raise the profile of women offenders and the factors
associated with offending that my noble friend has just pointed

Gale:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that the level of
domestic and sexual abuse towards women and girls in our country is an
absolute disgrace? Does she further agree that the daily displays of
semi-nude women in the popular tabloids help only to build up
disrespect among boys and young men in their formative years?
Therefore, will she join me in congratulating the No More Page 3
campaign? More than 106,000 people have already signed its petition,
including me. If she agrees to endorse that campaign, perhaps she could
sign the petition herself, as I believe that it is one way of combating
the disrespect that can build up among boys and young

its board. I would describe what the noble Baroness has portrayed as
also being outdated. Personally, I would indeed endorse the campaign

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> My Lords, domestic violence is clearly a
loathsome feature of our community. Does the noble Baroness agree that,
as so much domestic violence is founded on the exploitation by men of
their relative superiority in strength, physically and economically,
over women, there is a strong case for either legislation or sentencing
guidelines to be considered regarding domestic violence as an
aggravated form of violence, to be dealt with, where appropriate, by

We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:17:59"></hs_TimeCode> have had a
recession and we are now having slow growth. One of the most
interesting things is how the effects on employment have been nothing
like what we have seen in previous recessions. One reason is the
effectiveness of active labour market polices, particularly those that
address youth unemployment, which has been coming down in the last year

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, we have a huge number of programmes in
our youth contract to encourage people into work. One thing I need to
emphasise is that we have a long-term problem of disengaged youth,
which we had right through the longest boom we have ever had. The real
measure here is people not in education or work. In 2001, that figure
stood at just shy of 1 million and it rose through the boom
period. Since the election, we have pulled it down by 60,000. The
figure currently is 1.3 million. It is a real problem that cannot be
brought down with short-term programmes; it is brought down by
fundamentally restructuring how youngsters are supported—through
vocational education as a key underpinning to get these kids into
meaningful long-term
work.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/4E6272ED86CC920E5DF68F365032B3A38A28401A" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

one of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, because it
is important to get a precise answer. The attacks on doctors and nurses
in the course of these demonstrations, and on hospitals to where people
injured in the demonstrations have been taken, seem to raise profound
questions about the way in which we work with the World Medical
Association and other competent medical authorities. How do the

slightly more the complexity of what led to these protests. What
started off as concerns about a Bill on the use and sale of alcohol
became an environmental dispute about the development of a shopping

became a broader political dispute. It is important for us to remember
that there are different things happening with the different groups in
Turkey, but I completely take the noble Lord’s point in relation
to making sure that these matters are resolved peacefully and by a

2,880 Army and 750 RAF—were selected for redundancy. Achieving
the reductions required to bring the Regular Army to 
<?notus-xml column=391?>a strength of 82,000 is expected to require a further redundancy

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Earl for repeating the statement, and I declare my interest as a
consultant trainer with Cumberlege Connections and as chair of the
Heart of England NHS Foundation Trust. Yesterday’s
report will have left your Lordships shocked. The noble Earl began with
an apology and we on this side of the House echo that apology. Of
course, it is a sad fact of life that mistakes will be made. What is
never acceptable is when people or organisations try to hide those
mistakes. Sadly, this is what appears to have happened in this
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:45:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000075">The
report covers a four-year period up until autumn 2012 and deals with
failures in regulation, but also with subsequent attempts at
a cover-up. It was only published thanks to the efforts of James
Titcombe and his family, and I echo the tributes that the noble Earl
has paid to him. It is essential that he and all the other families
affected in Lancashire and Cumbria get the answers they are looking
for. We on this side of the House are fully committed to making sure
that this
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:45:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000076">The
most shocking revelation in this report is that in March 2012 an
instruction was given by a member of senior management at the CQC to
delete the findings of an internal review. Today’s report
says:</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13062064000597" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000597">“we

one considers the context in which this takes place, it is truly
shocking. At that time, we were almost two years into a public inquiry
into the failings at Mid Staffordshire. That followed an earlier
independent inquiry, also led by Robert Francis, following which all
parts of the NHS had committed to full openness and transparency. It
came after failings at other trusts, most notably Basildon and
Thurrock, had been made available, which led to the Opposition calling
for an in-depth look at hospitals and a new assurance that they were
safe. That is why yesterday’s report is so hard to comprehend.
It raises serious questions for the CQC and the Government, which I
will take in

the question of the CQC, I agree with the noble Earl’s
assessment of the quality of the new leadership team at the CQC. I
commend the new chief executive,

address this point directly and tell the House whether he is confident

specifically, is anybody who is involved in the decision to delete that

public would find it very hard indeed to accept data protection laws

to the noble Earl’s department, can I just have it confirmed

there should always be support for whistleblowers, and he was right.

understand that she was then subject to attempts to remove her from the
CQC board. The noble Earl will recall that I raised this in the House,
and he very kindly took action on the matter. It has been reported that
the same whistleblower told the CQC board yesterday that she raised
issues internally first and then within the department, including
directly with the then Secretary of State, in a meeting. Is the noble

note the important work of Mr Don Berwick, but should we not be getting
on with implementing the recommendations of the Francis report in this
regard? The Care Bill, which is now in your Lordships’ House, 
<?notus-xml column=396?>is an ideal vehicle for implementing Francis but is remarkably light on
clauses relating to Robert Francis’s recommendations. His report
emphasised the need for openness, transparency and candour. Openness
will enable concerns and complaints to be raised freely and without
having questions to answer. Transparency will enable the truth about
performance and outcomes to be shared with everybody with an interest
in it. Candour will ensure that any person harmed by the provision of a
healthcare service is informed of that fact and an appropriate remedy

made specific recommendations, including that a statutory obligation
should be imposed to observe a duty of candour. He wanted healthcare
providers who believe or suspect that the treatment or care provided to
a patient has caused death or serious injury to inform that patient, or
a duly authorised person, of that fact as soon as practical. He said
there should be a statutory duty on all directors of healthcare
organisations to be truthful and that it should be made a criminal
offence for any registered medical practitioner to knowingly obstruct
another in the performance of the statutory duties that he wished to
see enacted, to provide information to a patient or nearest relative
intending to mislead, or to dishonestly make an untruthful statement.
However, the only offence in the Bill is a corporate one of providing
“false or misleading information”. That is not a duty of
candour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T11:52:48"></hs_TimeCode>, so I
was very surprised to see the Secretary of State say yesterday in the
other place that there would be a duty of candour in the Care Bill. It

the noble Earl also not agree, in the light of what happened at the
CQC, that it is perverse that the duty not to provide false or
misleading information applies only to providers? It does not apply to
the CQC; to the other regulator, Monitor; to NHS England; or to his own
department. Is he prepared to agree to amendments to the Care Bill on

is clearly a real problem about the approach that the CQC has taken to
hospital regulation. Is the noble Earl willing to have a lengthier
debate about regulation? I wonder whether we are just putting too much
responsibility on regulators and not enough on the people who actually
provide those services. I particularly worry about what he says about
the introduction of Ofsted-style ratings into the health service. He
will have seen evidence from a number of medical bodies, which are
concerned that this is going to be too simple a process when judging
something as complex as a
hospital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000088">A
hospital may be given a 1 rating—an outstanding rating
Ofsted-style—but inevitably within a large hospital, although
overall it may be a category 1 there are likely to be services that are
not so good. My worry is that a hospital, because it has been given a
1, will not then be reinspected for a number of years, which is the
Ofsted style, and its weaknesses will go undetected. When at some point
a real problem with patient care comes into the open, it will undermine
the whole credibility of the exercise undertaken by the CQC.</hs_para>

by the noble Earl, particularly in respect to the CQC’s new
focus on being a champion for patients, putting safety and care at the
heart of the system and having more specialist teams. I am particularly
pleased that David Behan has been appointed as the new chief executive.
However, I am extremely concerned that another scandal is looming round
the corner. There are very strong warnings. I am extremely
concerned that mental health patients detained under the
Mental Health Act are very poorly served at the moment.
To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:05:13"></hs_TimeCode> put this in
context, the CQC was formed from three organisations: the Healthcare
Commission, the Commission for Social Care Inspection, and the Mental
Health Act Commission. The Mental Health Act Commission was not an
inspectorate—it was a visitorial body, and looked after the care
and treatment of detained patients. It did so by employing a number of
commissioners with specialist expertise, not only in understanding the
issues faced by mental health patients but also in mental health law,
which is so important.</hs_para>

Bradford, making those points very powerfully some years ago when we
debated the Bill that created the CQC. He makes an extremely important
point. I think that we can take it from the statements of David Prior
yesterday that the decision taken in 2009 to take 
<?notus-xml column=400?>a generalist approach to inspection was a mistake. The CQC’s
inspectors are in one sense specialist inspectors who are trained and
supported to carry out their role, which they do to the best of their
ability. However, requiring inspectors to have oversight of a wide
range of service types from slimming clinics to acute hospitals, and
indeed mental health establishments, has spread expertise too
thinly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000109">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:05:13"></hs_TimeCode>
are clear that we must now work with the CQC to create a much more
specialist approach to inspection, including on mental health. I think
that the three new chief inspectors we are appointing will help to do
that. It is not the whole answer, because they need to be supported by
clinical expertise and by the people who are experts by virtue of their
experience in care services. However, I will take away the noble
Lord’s idea of a chief inspector of mental health. I must be

Hunt of Kings Heath, that legal advice can sometimes prevent people
from doing the right thing. I was very sorry to hear that. I think that
good legal advice should in fact produce the result of people doing the
right thing. The second point I want to make relates to the claims
against the health service for negligence. These have been quite
substantial over the years. Could the CQC look at that area and examine
the grass-roots standard of care given to

quoted as saying that confidentiality and data protection issues should
not stand in the way of disclosure where disclosure is clearly in the
public interest. I completely agree with that. That is why our instant
reaction yesterday, when we were told by the CQC that legal advice had
said that the names of the individuals had to be kept confidential, was
to challenge that. I am pleased that that decision is to be reversed

friend’s second point, most certainly yes: the CQC should take a
view about matters relating to negligence. However, I would add that
apart from the CQC, we now have the new Healthwatch bodies, part of
whose function will be to make sure they provide good soft intelligence
on what is happening in NHS and social providers in their local areas.
The Healthwatch bodies can then act as the eyes and ears of the CQC,
which, with the best will in the world, cannot be everywhere at once.

it is just an allegation—is a simple case of malfeasance in
public office. One of the things that seem to have happened over
scandals such as Stafford, or even LIBOR, is that the ordinary criminal

whether this case highlights a gap in the law but if it does, I can

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, this is one of the reasons why the
previous Government introduced quality accounts, which are becoming
more and more sophisticated and which focus the minds of a board on
quality of care. It is easy to give the impression that we want to
introduce a punitive culture into the NHS: we do not. However, there
should be sanctions in the background to back up any serious failings
of care. That is broadly what Robert Francis was driving at in talking
about fundamental standards below which no care provider should fall.
The CQC will be consulting on those standards later in the year, but I
take the noble Baroness’s point about trust boards. It remains
within the powers and competence of Monitor to suspend trust boards,
either in whole or in part, where concerns arise over the governance of
an organisation. That is a drastic power to invoke and they can take

through the quality and safety committee that deals with what are

leadership changes at the trust. Sir David Henshaw was appointed as
interim chair and Eric Morton as interim chief executive. The trust
appointed four new non-executive directors and a new chief operating
officer and recruited a new obstetric consultant and additional
midwives. There have been other appointments as well. It has
established a programme management office, as requested by Monitor, to
oversee the implementation of programmes of work to bring about lasting
improvements across the trust—and it has recruited a number of

Today’s debate is not about 
<?notus-xml column=405?>the minor tiffs that all children go through, learning about
relationships, power and listening to each other. It is about the
children who are so severely bullied that it is having a catastrophic
effect on their lives—to the extent that some children kill

let us clarify what we are talking about here. The definition of
bullying is aggressive behaviour that is intended to cause distress or
harm, involves an imbalance of power or strength between aggressor and
victim, and commonly occurs repeatedly over time. Children severely
affected by it miss school for long periods of time, often
self-excluding due to the trauma caused by the bullying.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062064000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000140">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>
image of self-excluding may seem odd to those who do not know about it.
I will tell you about a time when I was standing in a primary school
playground with a head teacher. We had talked about her early
recognition and intervention techniques, but she wanted to show me the
practical effect of bullying on a youngster. This child, no more than
eight years old, was standing on the edge of the playground. He refused
eye contact with any of the children and, when their play moved near
him, he sidled round the edge of the playground as far away as he
could. The head told me that he had arrived from another school and was
finding all social relationships very difficult following bullying
elsewhere. He did not want his parents to intervene with the school
because every time they had reported it in the past, the bullying had
got worse. Even worse for him, his previous school had told him that he
was behaving like a victim. This head understood that he needed
intensive support, which she had put in place, including staff members
keeping an eye out for him and a safe place inside if he felt he could
not bear to be in the playground. This child was heading towards a
classic downward spiral. His concentration had gone; understandably, he
was not learning; and it was going to take many months to start
building him up again. At least he had parents who had taken action and
a new school that understood the problem.</hs_para>

campaign, with the charity BeatBullying and the <I>Sun</I> newspaper,

Ayden is not the first; nor, indeed, is this the first campaign. Other
recent tragedies include Aaron Dugmore. He hanged himself at home after
relentless bullying. At nine years old, he is Britain’s second
youngest suicide victim of bullying. Other cases are Natasha MacBryde,
who jumped in front of a train because she was being bullied about her
parents’ divorce, and Sam Leeson, whom internet bullies drove to
suicide because of his taste in music and love of fashion.</hs_parafo>

that more than 16,000 children a year are so severely bullied that they
cannot face school, and it is estimated that a shocking 44% of suicides

bullying. I support much of what Ayden’s law seeks to achieve,
including compulsory family intervention and children, teachers and
social workers all having anti-bullying training. The model, Jodie
Marsh, who was herself severely bullied at school, has worked with
anti-bullying campaigner, Alex Holmes, to celebrate the good practice
at some of our schools. She went to Springwell College in Staveley,
Derbyshire, which has 25 anti-bullying ambassadors. They are now
spreading that work to other schools. A TV programme broadcast a couple
of months ago showed what they were doing with Carlton Community

These units are designed for children whose behaviour is so
unacceptable that they cannot remain in their mainstream school, and so

this is the right route for them, especially if they have to give up

remind the House that the definition of special educational needs is
having learning difficulties that make it harder for children to learn

bullied children fit that description. They need this formal label to
help to create the package that is going to help them to return to
their mainstream education, whether it is in school or college. It is
evident to those who work with these children that severe bullying is,
at the very least, a temporary special educational need that will
persist and worsen without intervention. Will the Minister consider
specifically adding severely bullied children to the category of those
with special educational
needs?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000148">The
Government are rightly concerned about the achievements of children who
fall through the net. Students who end up in pupil referral units do
not perform well. Less than 1% gain 5 A* to C GCSEs. That should be
compared with specialist intervention at places such as Red Balloon,
where the figure is 75%. Therefore, I further ask the Minister to
ensure that alternative provision for bullied children is made
available that compares performance not with the mainstream education
system but with other children who also face major difficulties,
whether the comparison is with pupil referral units or even with the
data for looked-after children. It is not fair to set a benchmark for
these children that does not recognise the trauma they are

reality of what these children and their parents have to deal with is
stark, especially when schools refuse to face up to their
responsibilities. A 13 year-old boy in year eight was threatened by his
school and the education welfare team, which said that he had to come
to school despite severe bullying because, if he did not, his mother
would be taken to court and might go to jail. That is shockingly cruel.

it is okay to taunt, let alone bully, someone because of their race,
disability or sexual identity. There is also a disturbing increase in
physical attack and even rape as a part of
bullying.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000155">It

Lexden:</Member></B> My Lords, it is both a pleasure and a privilege to
make a short contribution to this debate, initiated with great skill
and in the most moving fashion by my noble friend Lady Brinton, who
speaks with such tremendous authority on this grave social and
educational issue—authority drawn from her patient, dedicated
and successful work in combating it in practice on the
ground.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000157">School
bullies are sad individuals, cowards every one of them, who gain
satisfaction and pleasure from showing unkindness to others—a
reversal of the right and proper order of things. Unkindness leading to
persecution can be such that, in some cases, it leads—as we have
heard—to suicide. My noble friend spoke particularly movingly on
that point. For far too long, indeed over generations, there were in
our country too many weak and callous teachers in uncompassionate
schools who did little or nothing to tackle the disfiguring phenomenon
of bullying in their midst. Today, however, they can no longer evade
their basic responsibilities, which have been clearly defined in law,
endorsed by all political parties and by successive
governments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000158">This
Government have shown themselves to be particularly sensitive to
widespread concern—reflected in my noble friend’s
important Motion today—about 
<?notus-xml column=409?>the extent of bullying prevalent in our schools. That is underlined by
the deeply disturbing facts and statistics that my noble friend
referred to. The Government have consistently shown their
responsiveness to well founded anxiety. In 2011, they brought up to
date the anti-bullying advice drawn up to enable all schools to tackle
bullying effectively. Teachers have been given new powers to tackle the
hideous new phenomenon of cyberbullying, for instance by searching for
and, if necessary, deleting inappropriate images on mobile telephones.
Very importantly, the Government have laid a requirement on Ofsted to
take account of behaviour and well-being, including the incidence of
bullying in schools. Most recently, funds have been made available to
enable four specialist organisations to work with schools in exploring
new, innovative ways of tackling the scourge of bullying. These points,
I hope, bring some measure of comfort to my noble friend, while also
underlining the need for her continuing commitment to securing further
progress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000159">The
Government deserve great credit for extending and enhancing the
national framework through which bullying can be confronted and
reduced. However, particularly after hearing my noble friend’s
speech, we all now yearn for results—for tumbling rather than
rising statistics. That can be the only truly satisfactory measure of
success.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062064000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000160">I
will illustrate the point by turning to an aspect of the issue that has
always been a particular concern and anxiety to me personally:
homophobic bullying. Last year, Stonewall published results of research
carried out on its behalf by Cambridge University, involving a survey
of some 1,600 lesbian, gay and bisexual young people in our schools.
Some 55% had experienced homophobic bullying in schools and 99% had
heard homophobic language. It is not surprising, and confirms the other
evidence that my noble friend has given us, that this bullying had a
marked adverse effect on young people’s attainment, health and
well-being. Three in five bullied pupils said that it had a negative
impact on their schoolwork. One in three bullied gay young people had
considered changing their future educational plans because of the
bullying. Nearly a quarter of gay young people had thought of
attempting suicide. More than one half had harmed themselves. Polling
of more than 2,000 primary and secondary school teachers by YouGov,
published in 2009, showed a similar picture. Nine in 10 secondary
school teachers said that they had witnessed homophobic bullying.
Worryingly, half of secondary school teachers who were aware of
homophobic bullying said that the vast majority of incidents go
unreported. There is a further important point to be made in this
connection. Stonewall’s research into homophobic hate crime in
2008 found that three in five hate incidents are committed by people
under the age of 25, highlighting the transition from homophobic
bullying in schools to homophobic hate crimes in local
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000161">In
this area, as in others, the Government have shown commendable
resolution and determination. They made tackling homophobic bullying a
priority in both the coalition agreement and the 2010 schools White
Paper. They have strongly encouraged schools to seek advice and support
from Stonewall. Ofsted 
<?notus-xml column=410?>inspectors are advised to ask pupils about the use of homophobic
language in their schools and whether or not they learn about gay
people in the curriculum.</hs_para>

will now consider taking further steps. For example, through the
National College for Teaching and Leadership, they could seek to ensure
that high-quality training on preventing and tackling homophobic
bullying is part of all teachers’ initial training. They could
help schools further to share best practice and to learn from each
other in this area, in particular encouraging academy chains to provide
such opportunities among their schools. The Government could also
ensure that free schools and new academies recognise the importance of
combating homophobic bullying and supporting gay young people when
establishing policy and procedures. As president of the Independent
Schools Council, and its former general secretary, I also recognise
that action in these matters should not be confined to the maintained
sector. It is needed in all our country’s
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000163">Bullying

She drew together many of the issues which we all believe to be a
terrible, often hidden, problem for many children. Any bullying can
become severe bullying. Prevention, as well as dealing with the issue,

Children’s new report on an inquiry into what opportunities
children think they should have. I declare an interest as the chair of

teacher, I was aware that some children were not only being
discriminated against but were being bullied. I recall how difficult it
was to identify the problem and to deal with it. Bullying is very
difficult to prove and it is very difficult to change the behaviour. I
recall that children might be bullied perhaps because they were clever,
not clever enough or had a physical feature such as an accent, a limp
or red hair. The schools I taught in had a proportion of children who
were black or Asian, which could be a
factor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:51:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with e-mails, texts and so on. It is clear that there is the same old
problem. Many children—I believe that now it is about
28%—do not want to talk about being bullied either to their
parents or the school. Parents and schools often are in denial about
children who are being bullied or children who bully. I believe, as I
suspect do many people, that 
<?notus-xml column=411?>bullies also need help and that they exhibit behaviour that may damage
their lives. All that is even more terrible when there is severe
bullying. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Bullying states that
children who have suffered severe bullying may develop temporary
special educational needs, which was referred to by the noble Baroness,

also may be victims or perpetrators. We are now going back an awful
long way but I have never forgotten a friend of mine at school who was

she was overweight, middle class and very clever. She said that she

severe bullying, as has been said, can have tragic consequences in the
deaths of young people. Today, I am very grateful for the many

continue to learn, it is clear that bullying has an impact on the
physical and mental health of children—the more severe, the
greater the impact. It is also clear that bullying may have a profound
impact on achievement in school and on the whole life of a child both
immediately and in the future. The noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, spoke
of the Red Balloon Learning Centres group, which estimates that 16,000
young people may be absent from school at any one time due to bullying.
That is a shocking
figure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:53:34"></hs_TimeCode> and these
children may be treated as if they are just truanting. What impact on
the self-worth of a child must bullying have? Without self-worth,
attendance and academic, as well as social, competence may be severely
affected. The Anti-Bullying Alliance reports that more than 61% of
children reporting to child and adolescent mental health services are
being bullied. The NSPCC’s Childline estimates that 38% of young
people have been affected by cyberbullying.</hs_para>

on what can be done to either prevent bullying or tackle it before it
becomes dangerous. Parents are key. The National Centre for Social
Research points out that children being bullied at the age of 14 or 15
were much less likely to be bullied at 16 if parents had reported the
bullying. But, as I have said, and as we know, parents often do not
know what is going on and friends—if the child being bullied has
friends—also find it difficult. Bullies can be very powerful,
particularly when they are in a gang.</hs_para>

want to look at how we can prevent bullying in schools, starting with
the importance of immediate action. I have to say, and the British
Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy reaffirms this, that
having a school counsellor is one of the most immediate and accessible
ways of offering support. Sadly, provision of school counselling
services is not universal. It should be and I wonder whether any
schools are using the pupil premium to supply such services. That would
be money well spent. Perhaps I may ask the Minister how many school
counsellors there are working and by what means they are
paid.</hs_para>

to personal, social and health education in schools. When will the
Government accept that every child, in whatever type of school, should
be entitled to protection and encouragement from a solid programme of
personal, social and health education? That would be much less
difficult than the Government think. We have had this debate before and
no doubt will have it again. A school policy on behaviour and bullying
is part of PSHE. Many schools have such policies, although Kidscape
asserts that some schools are reluctant to discuss their policies. I
cannot think why: perhaps they do not have one.</hs_para>

a school where I was a governor, the children helped to develop the
policy. School councils can help to monitor behaviour policies. Class
representatives on school councils often know what is going on before a
teacher and may have suggestions to repair the damage. One school,
Goose Green in east London, came to speak to the All-Party
Parliamentary Group for Children. The teachers and children spoke
eloquently about their experiences of personal, social and health
education and of a friendship system where a child can go to another
child for help and support, which is just brilliant. I wish that Mr

health education is not just a woolly concept about being nice; it
should be rigorous with structures and policies to help children gain
information at the appropriate age, develop the skills and confidence
to use such information, and develop respect for themselves and others.
I hope that the Government will provide a more encouraging lead on
this. I believe that there are others in the Chamber today who think
the same way.</hs_para>

a positive school ethos and are not just about mistreating others.
Personal, social and health education is about what happens not just in
science lessons where reproduction may be taught, even if it is not
human reproduction, but also in English lessons, history, art, sport
and so on where children can discuss relationships and reflect on their
behaviour. PSHE may happen in lessons on topics that are not
necessarily carried out by teachers but by special visitors, such as St
John Ambulance, the school nurse, scouts and guides, the police,
parliamentarians and so on. There do not have to be specialist teachers
but the school has to be organised to make use of such visitors. I know
of one school which invited a school counsellor and a child who had
been bullied to a lesson to talk about their experiences. It was a very
powerful experience for all those people in the
classroom.</hs_para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T12:58:47"></hs_TimeCode>is preventive
work. If a school discovers bullying, the staff policy must kick in
fast. The incidents need to be analysed, solutions sought and, if
necessary, help found. It is not enough simply to punish. As I said
earlier, an elected school council may be able to help, as well as
counsellors, parents and a strong school ethos. There clearly is a
problem here. For children who are bullied, it is disruptive and a
terrifying problem. I have suggested two things that could help schools
to help children; namely, school counsellors and a programme of
personal, social and health education. I look forward to the
Minister’s
comments.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/F1FC090B8FAE18087CDC2562F3EE411CAB44C818" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

this debate I want to make the point that it is essential that we
advocate for those who are often unable to advocate for themselves.
Children who are either affected by mental health conditions or are
being bullied are not in a good place to have their voice heard. It is
important that we find ways to do just that. As is evident from the
report by the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Bullying, many children
who are bullied feel isolated from their peers. This can have a
profoundly damaging impact on their well-being at that time and over
the rest of their
lives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000185">There
are two points that I would like to make about children who are
particularly vulnerable to bullying. First, children living in poverty
face a number of issues with bullying. This can be due to lacking
things that their peers may have, such as not being able to go 
<?notus-xml column=414?>to the cinema, or to a friend’s birthday party because they
cannot afford a present. I underline what the noble Baronesses, Lady
Brinton and Lady Massey, said about understanding child poverty in
terms of the children’s own understanding of what it is like to
live in poverty. Children can miss out on school trips, or not have the
same basic material goods that other children have. This will have an
impact on a child’s sense of self-worth. They are therefore more
vulnerable to bullying and socialised isolation than their
peers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000186">If not
administered correctly, things such as free school meals can serve to
highlight differences between children. In many schools children on
free school meals are not easily identifiable, which reduces the risks
of stigma. However, I am concerned that nearly half of secondary
schools do not have cashless systems, meaning that those on free school
meals may be singled out. My first point is to highlight the need to
listen to the voice of children in poverty and note the implications on
their lives of being
bullied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000187">My
second point relates to young carers. The latest census statistics
reveal that there are 166,363 young carers in England, compared to
around 139,000 in 2001. This is likely to be the tip of the iceberg, as
many young carers remain hidden from official sight for a host of
reasons, including family loyalty, stigma or indeed bullying. As well
as having the potential to suffer stigma and bullying, young carers are
particularly vulnerable because their caring responsibilities can have
a severe impact on their school life and long-term
outcomes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000188">We
know that one in 12 young cares is caring for more than 15 hours per
week. Around one in 20 misses school because of their caring
responsibilities. Young carers are more likely than the national
average to be not in education, employment or training—one of
the NEETs—between the ages of 16 and 19. That is why I welcome
the Children’s Minister’s announcement last week that the
Government will be looking at how the legislation for young carers
might be changed so that rights and responsibilities are clearer to
young carers and practitioners
alike.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000189">It is
important that the Care Bill that covers the adults’ legislation
around social care, and the Children and Families Bill, work together
to better identify and support young carers and their families. Schools
and teachers can play a vital role in doing this. Schools also play an
important role in promoting positive attitudes towards young carers and
their families to help mitigate the impact of stigma, discrimination
and bullying. It is important that children who struggle in school get
the support and help that they need, and this includes mental health
support. I fear that the provision of mental health support and the
structures in place are not sufficient for the needs of young people
and
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000190">I
also want to ask if it is right that we should allow young people to be
carers, which inevitably limits their childhood and opens them to a
range of potential problems, not least bullying and missing out on
education. These put added strain on their mental health. I dare wonder
whether society is in danger of being the bully in allowing young
people to be carers. What about the rights of the children and young
people themselves?</hs_para>

this debate on such an important matter. I am glad to be able to speak

are vulnerable to bullying and to mental health concerns and who need
advocates on their behalf. Equally in need of advocates are the young
carers, who again are open to being bullied. I question whether we
should not take more seriously the issue of whether we can do more to
allow such children and young people to have their right to a
childhood. I look forward to the contributions of other Members and

I said, the title of the debate points to the level of educational

event, is there not a necessity for rather more than the required

years-old is the official age at which a child is required to attend

schools. The only problem is that they are insufficiently publicised. I
remember attending a meeting several years ago when one such successful
example was being discussed. Where better to start than at the moment
when a child arrives in school? What unfolded seems a pretty good way
to provide an early intervention exercise that would have an excellent
chance of working. In this group of schools, every new pupil is given a
slightly older mentor whose duty is to settle the child into its new
surroundings and environment. How well the child does will affect the
number of brownie points that the mentor gets, so both the new pupil

case studies that they included—I had a few moments to scan some
of them yesterday—were extremely interesting. Quite clearly it
is not only at the very beginning of your life and at school that
problems occur that can lead to bullying and huge periods of isolation.
Those case stories showed a high level of success when places such as
those provided by Red Balloon offer support to cope with this
situation. It would have taken some time to establish what was really
required in those cases, but at least it was established, whereas in
other situations in other parts of the country I am afraid the local

went by before any notice was taken. That is horrendous because that

their anti-bullying programme. It is obvious to me that PSHE courses
that build up children’s self-confidence and self-esteem will
help the bullied students to “stay calm and confident”

gap in their own self-confidence by belittling
others.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062064000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000220">Ofsted
also pointed to the need for good-quality teacher training and CPD to
help staff to deal with situations that might arise. That is quite
right, but it is important that staff identify bullying as a child
protection issue, not just in relation to the bullied child but so that
they will look at the underlying issues in the life of 
<?notus-xml column=420?>the bully. Domestic violence at home, drug and alcohol problems, neglect
and a poor relationship with their parents can all be contributory
factors. The child may never have developed the ability to empathise
with others, possibly because of attachment problems early in life. For
reasons to do with his background, he may have great difficulty forming
relationships. Perhaps he has never been
loved.</hs_para>

quality PSHE in all schools, which noble Lords know I always advocate,
I recommend a programme that has had a great beneficial effect in all
the schools that have used it, so much so that it is rapidly spreading
across the country, particularly in Scotland. It is called Roots of
Empathy and was developed in Canada by a wonderful woman called Mary
Gordon, who ought to get an honour. As Mary herself
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062064000584" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000584">“Roots
of Empathy is an evidence-based classroom program that has shown

empathy”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13062064000558" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000558">Her
aim is to change the world one child at a time. If a child has empathy,
why would he ever bully another child? The strong evidence from schools
is that this programme improves behaviour and reduces
bullying.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13062064000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000222">The first Roots of
Empathy classes in England began in October last in 14 primary schools
in the south London boroughs of Lewisham and Croydon, although it had
been going for some time in Scotland. The classes are co-ordinated by
the Pre-school Learning Alliance, with support from the WAVE Trust and
funding from the Big Lottery. How does it work? The basis of it is
that, following preparation by the teacher, a mother or father brings
his or her young baby into the primary classroom and the baby becomes
the "teacher". Indeed, he wears a cute little T-shirt that tells us he
is the teacher. The children sit around the baby in a circle and are
asked to observe his behaviour, interact with him and comment on how he
is feeling. The whole thing is very structured and there is plenty of
cross-curricular follow-up work. By interacting with a tiny vulnerable
child in a controlled environment, the children go back to the
beginning and learn how to empathise with others, understand their own
feelings and why they sometimes feel sad or uncomfortable. All
aggression is taken away and it is often amazing and very touching to
discover what the children reveal about themselves and their home
backgrounds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:30:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000223">The
programme also gives the children a model of parenting which some of
them never see at home. In Scotland, the programme is so popular that I
believe it has now been introduced in two-thirds of all primary
schools. The programme has now been extended to the early years and is
called Seeds of Empathy. It is being piloted here in Lewisham, although
it has been operating in Canada since 2005 and is being evaluated
there. Seeds of Empathy, apart from helping children develop their
social and emotional skills, also helps them develop positive attitudes
to reading. It does not teach reading as such but uses stories to
explore feelings, such as feeling grumpy or happy, and helps the
children to be comfortable about expressing how they feel. The children
observe how the baby’s capabilities develop from week to week
and consider why his or her moods change and how that relates to their
own
moods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the programme helps children develop their executive functioning
skills, dealing with impulse, self-control, flexible
thinking and decision-making. In this way, these toddlers are being
prepared to benefit from their formal education a little way down the
road. Having seen these programmes in action, it is hard to
believe that any of the children will develop violent or disrespectful
behaviour towards their peers. Respect is, of course,
a key word in relation to bullying, and there is
another programme that is highly successful in
developing this, the UNICEF Rights Respecting Schools
programme, about which I have spoken before. It is logical, is it not?
If a child understands his own rights, he learns to understand that the
other children in his school have the same rights and that these should
be respected as much as he would wish his own rights to be respected.
Therefore, a school that fosters this mutual respect usually does not
have a major problem with bullying and has a structure for dealing with
it, if it does
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:33:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000225">Finally,
I would like to mention counselling, as was mentioned by the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey. When I visited a primary school in Beijing, I
was surprised to be told that all Chinese primary schools have access
to a school counsellor. Why should we not have that here too? I think
that we need it since our children are often under great stress and
really need help. Children need someone to talk to who will not be
judgmental but will help them work out their own problems or direct
them to other help. Some great organisations do this, such as Place2Be.
If children are listened to, they feel valued. We know that if children
do not feel valued, they sometimes strike out and that is what we want
to avoid. It is striking that most of these counselling services help
both the bullied and the bully. However, I know that schools struggle
to find the money to introduce these programmes, so will my noble
friend the Minister confirm that they could legitimately use some of
the pupil premium money to do so as long as they can show that the
programme helps to underpin the learning of children who attract that
money to the school? Of course, I believe that it does. A child in fear
is not a learning child and neither is a child who is angry, so again
the same service helps both the victims and the perpetrators. Is not
that
unusual<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000226">This
matter boils down to the culture of the school and its duty of care to
bullied children to ensure they get an education, but also to its duty

those of others, because nobody loves a

think we all share a common purpose in raising this issue. Anyone who
has read the case studies and the media stories cannot help but be
moved and saddened by the dire consequences for the happiness of young
people if bullying is allowed to carry on unchecked. The fact that at a
low level it appears to be so prevalent in schools—which should,
after all, be providing a secure and nurturing learning
environment—should be a wake-up call for everyone involved in
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000230">The
Department for Education report which showed that 47% of children
report being bullied at 14, 41% at 15 and 29% per cent at 16, is truly
shocking. Many of those reported that bullying was not just a one-off
incident but was ongoing, and for some of them it was an
everyday occurrence. The noble Lord, Lord Lexden, rightly raised
concerns about the prevalence of homophobic bullying, which, as he
reported, is widespread. It is also distressing to hear that children
with disabilities and special educational needs are three times as
likely to be bullied, with verbal, emotional and physical bullying
again being
prevalent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000231">Meanwhile,
as a number of noble Lords have commented, the dramatic rise of
cyberbullying is finding new victims, with new vulnerabilities and
opportunities for exploitation and abuse. Recent research has shown
that nearly one in five young people have been victims of Facebook,
internet or mobile phone bullying, with girls affected more than boys.
Many of these children will slip under the radar. Their plight will
never be drawn to the attention of anyone in authority and they will
develop coping methodologies to survive, and as a result will never
know the full impact on their confidence, self-worth and sense of
well-being as they progress into
adulthood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000232">We
know that bullying is not a harmless rite of passage or an inevitable
part of growing up but can have long-term consequences into adulthood.
A recent study at the University of Warwick showed that children who
are exposed to bullying during childhood are increasingly at risk of
suffering psychiatric disorder in adulthood, regardless of whether they
are the victims or the perpetrators. Victims display a higher level of
agoraphobia, general anxiety and panic disorder, whereas bullies show a
tendency to develop an anti-social personality disorder. The noble
Baroness, Lady Walmsley, rightly identified the need to break that
cycle of bullying at an early age and the factors that lead children to
bully. I was very interested to hear about the Roots of Empathy
programme that she described in detail, which should be
encouraged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:38:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000233">It
appears that the problem is growing and that the onus on schools and
local agencies to have a clear, firm policy in place is ever greater.
So what needs to be done? At the outset, schools need to have a
zero-tolerance policy towards bullying. There are simply too many
examples of children or parents who have reported bullying to a teacher
or head teacher but who then find that nothing is done or that the
child is disbelieved or the problem minimised—or, worse, that
the child being bullied is further isolated or removed to another
class, rather than those who are doing the bullying. 
<?notus-xml column=423?>Schools need to have an active anti-bullying policy that is backed up by
staff training and regularly reviewed. They also need to take
responsibility for what happens at the school gates and
beyond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000234">The
noble Baroness, Lady Howe, rightly made the point that mutual respect
should be learnt from a very early age. My noble friend Lady Massey
made a powerful case again for the role of PSHE and also for the role
that school councils can play in empowering young people to tackle the
bullies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:39:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there also needs to be a much clearer strategy for those children who
are so traumatised that their behaviour, school attendance and mental
health are beginning to be affected. We have some evidence of the
problem from research by the National Centre for Social Research for
the Red Balloon Learner Centres. As we have heard, it has calculated
that more than 16,000 young people at any one time refused to attend
school because of
bullying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:40:15"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
the parental, legal and educational pressure on young people to attend
school, it is also fair to assume that there is a much greater number

trapped within the school and without adequate
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:40:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we make for these young people? First, given that they are the victims
of bad behaviour by other children, I hope we can agree that any
alternative education and support should be at least as good as that
which they would have received in mainstream education. Secondly, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, highlighted, consideration should be
given to those young people accessing temporary SEN status, which would
allow them to fund and access individual support.</hs_para>

as many of these young people have complex needs, there should, as is
fairly obvious, be a range of support packages available. These might
include counselling facilities and in-school specialist units. As has
been pointed out, however, we need to be aware of the limitations of
these options. PRUs often do not address the child’s trauma of
going through the school gates, remaining on the same site as the
bullies or dealing with the staff who they feel have failed them in the
past. Sometimes, as we have heard, it is expected that they will be
taught side by side with other children with a range of other
behavioural problems, including the very anti-social behaviour often
displayed by bullies that they
fear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:41:49"></hs_TimeCode>. All too

local authorities have a duty to provide suitable education for
children who are unable to access mainstream education, the reality
appears to be that there is little funding available and that provision
is patchy. Local authorities are quick to pass the problem back to the
school or, as we have heard, in cases where children refuse to attend,
they consider prosecuting the parents for their child’s
non-attendance rather than tackling the root cause of the
trauma<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000239">Fifthly,
it seems that government and educators are becoming much more proactive
in addressing the physical health of young people through, for example,
providing sport and tackling anti-obesity. However, there is not the
same drive or expertise to tackle the equally pressing 
<?notus-xml column=424?>mental health issues of young people in education. There needs to be
much better awareness and training for staff on effective strategies
for addressing mental health issues. The noble Baroness, Lady Jolly,

promote the benefits that specialist trauma recovery units can provide.
Like others, I am very impressed by the successful work carried out by
Red Balloon to provide a safe sanctuary for bullied children combined
with strategies to help them back into mainstream education. Many of
the children they help are academically bright and it is crucial that
they are not lost permanently to the educational system. It seems a

characteristics, compassion for and consideration of others. They must
have a clear PSHE policy, which includes an anti-bullying policy, and
emulate what good schools do, as my noble friend Lady Walmsley

our drive to tackle bad behaviour and bullying, we have changed
legislation to strengthen teachers’ powers to enforce discipline
and promote good behaviour in schools. Our guidance published in 2011
sets out schools’ legal duties and powers in relation to
bullying. Teachers can search pupils and delete inappropriate images on
electronic devices potentially used for cyberbullying. There are now
plenty of examples across the country, including in many sponsored
academies, where behaviour has gone in a relatively short period of
time from being, frankly, pretty awful to good, thanks to strong
leadership, a clear behaviour strategy, and the strengthened powers
that we have given to
teachers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000248">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T13:48:38"></hs_TimeCode>
believe that the balance is now about right between a statutory
framework that requires schools to address behaviour and bullying and
is clear about the powers at their disposal, but which also allows
schools freedom as to how they tackle bullying. I will come to
Ayden’s law shortly. But along with freedom comes
accountability. As a number of Lords have mentioned, Ofsted now clearly
holds schools to account on how well they deal with behaviour and
bullying. Since January 2012, inspectors must consider pupils’
freedom from bullying, harassment and discrimination. The department
has also provided £4 million for four anti-bullying
organisations to work in
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0001.htm#13062064000249">Section

Government have agreed to all Charlie Taylor’s recommendations

alternative provision. We have set clear standards for this
provisioning and, since September 2012, Ofsted has shone a bright light

to conduct detailed thematic surveys of this every three years. As part
of the wider school funding reforms, since April this year we have
ensured, for the first time, that all maintained alternative provision
providers such as PRUs, AP academies and AP free schools receive
essential core funding of £8,000 per pupil. Top-up

problems before they become entrenched. It also means that schools will

turn now to the mental health support available for children and young
people who are bullied. Good head teachers know the importance of
supporting young people who are unhappy, unwell or struggling with
their family life. Ofsted evidence shows that schools whose
pupils do well academically recognise this. In July last year, the
cross-government <I>No Health Without Mental Health</I> implementation
framework was published. It describes the role that schools and local
authorities should play and recommends that schools and colleges have a
whole-school approach to this. In his AP review, Charlie Taylor said
that the

running a little short in time because those taking part were a little
more succinct than expected, the doorkeepers, at our request, very
carefully put on the annunciator the normal green sign, which gave
ample notice that the following debate in the name of my noble friend
Lord Lester of Herne Hill was going to begin in short order. That is
the sign that noble Lords should have been waiting for; indeed, they
should have been here as soon as they saw that the Minister, the noble
Lord, Lord Nash, was winding for the previous debate. It was therefore
regrettable that there were two Back-Benchers who were not present, and
in trying to be courteous one of my colleagues, who is one of the best
of our Government Whips, took advice and felt that it was perhaps
better to adjourn. I have advised her that in being kind she was
perhaps too kind. This is not something we will seek to

are two main reasons in favour of a modern constitutional Bill of

instead of relying upon a European treaty to define and protect our
fundamental civil and political rights and liberties, we need a
home-grown constitutional measure based on our constitutional and legal
heritage that will command widespread public confidence beyond the
courts and the legal profession. The bad reason is that a home-grown
Bill of Rights would enable us to withdraw from the European Convention
on Human Rights and the ability to seek redress from the European Court
of Human Rights where our courts are unable to provide a remedy.
According to this view it would enable the Human Rights Act to be
scrapped and replaced by a measure that gave more power to the
Executive and Parliament to restrict or limit our civil rights and
freedoms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000283" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000283">Many
of those who would agree that there are good reasons in theory in

John Stuart Mill called the “tyranny of the majority”. It
was that well founded political anxiety that led to dissent by two of
the commissioners appointed by the Deputy Prime Minister, the noble

example, it should be replaced by a federal system in which this House
becomes an indirectly elected senate with some appointed members. If
so, there would definitely be the need for a federal Bill of Rights to
be read and given effect in accordance with our international and
European legal obligations. There is also the long-standing pledge in
the Belfast agreement to introduce an additional Bill of Rights for

refusing to give effect to the Strasbourg court’s judgment in

aspect of the debate that has not sufficiently been emphasised is the
extraordinary cost of human rights. Before I became a member of the

the commission would be considering as part of its report questions of

arrival at the commission, it was apparent that the membership did not
consider cost to be within its terms of reference. On 7 March 2013, I
asked the Minister here in the

were timely, in particular those that effectively implemented the
Jackson reforms. I was somewhat less enthusiastic about the alterations
to legal aid, which had the potential to deny representation to some
with genuine claims and limited means. However, the Minister was
reassuring as to the alternative and cheaper ways in which ordinary
citizens could seek appropriate remedies. One exception to the
cost-cutting exercise appeared to be cases involving the Human Rights
Act. No figures were given to Parliament as to how much such cases were
costing or would cost in the future. Were the Government concerned that
denying legal aid to any claim involving the Human Rights Act would put

Abu Qatada litigation is said to be in excess of £1.7 million.
It seems to be absolutely crucial that the Government should at least
make some attempt to calculate what the HRA has cost in terms of legal
fees generated by litigation. The cost does not end there. Public
authorities have conscientiously attempted to ensure that their
policies and practices are human rights-compliant. This is a very
difficult exercise because it depends on trying to second-guess what
view the Strasbourg Court, and thus our courts, will take of a
particular situation. We need to know about these costs in an area that

another substantial question for the Minister. I appreciate that he may
have difficulty in answering some questions, in view of the well

he can answer this one. Do the Government agree that in leaving the
ECHR, if that course were taken, we would also have to leave the
European Union? This was the somewhat surprising view recently
expressed by Judge Dean Spielmann, the president of the ECHR. My
understanding of the position is that EU treaties do not provide that
adherence to the European convention is a formal requirement of
continued membership of the EU, even if membership may be regarded as a
benchmark in terms of respect for human

respect is something that unites us all, but if we were to leave the
Strasbourg Court and indeed the Council of Europe, this respect for
human rights would not diminish. Before the Act came into force, this
country had a proud, albeit not unblemished, record for the protection
of human rights through its 
<?notus-xml column=438?>domestic law. We are, of course, bound by a plethora of international
obligations from which we would not be relieved were we to leave the
Strasbourg court. Any noble Lords who wish to be reassured about our
contribution to the protection of human rights and democracy all over
the world should read the 2012 Foreign and Commonwealth Office report
published in April this year. It is a remarkable tribute to the work of
the FCO. If I highlight in particular its work in relation to sexual
violence as a weapon of war, that does not in any way diminish the
other aspects of its work.</hs_para>

Goldsmith:</Member></B> My Lords, I need to start with an apology to
the House and to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, for
arriving after the start of the debate. I can pray in aid a little bit
of confusion about the starting time of the debate, and I know very
well 
<?notus-xml column=439?>the views of the noble Lord, Lord Lester, from over the years so I can
predict some of the things that he would have said.</hs_para>

therefore hope that the House will permit me to make a few brief
observations on this very important topic. In doing so, I declare an
interest as a practising lawyer. I have been involved in human rights
work, in the sense that a lot of the work that I did when I was
Attorney-General involved vetting and approving—and occasionally
not approving—legislation or executive action on the grounds of
compliance or non-compliance with our Community obligations and arguing
cases on behalf of the Government either in this country’s
courts or, from time to time, overseas, including in Strasbourg. I have
some experience of how the European convention and the Human Rights Act
work. I was also the Prime Minister’s personal representative in
negotiating the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which was set
up following the Cologne and Nice summits to try to draw up a charter
for the institutions of the European Union rather than its member
states. I am therefore familiar with the
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000314">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T00:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>
principal point that I want briefly to make is that I am despondent and
unhappy about the turn which has been taken in the debate on human
rights, and I am therefore unhappy about the commission’s
report. I am concerned about a proposal that would not just put in
place additional protection in a British Bill of Rights but, at least
in the view of some members of the commission and some members of the
Government, replace the European Convention on Human Rights with
something else. There are three reasons why that would be a retrograde
step.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000315">The
first reason is the universality of human rights protection that the
European convention gives rise to. It gives rise to universality across
the European countries which subscribe to the Council of Europe and the
European convention. This does not mean that it is interpreted or
applied in exactly the same way in every country, nor should it be.
There are different social conditions and the principles—the
so-called margin of appreciation—provide an opportunity for
different countries to be allowed a chance to apply the rules and
rights in the European convention in a way which suits the social and
economic conditions of that country. Otherwise, it means that all the
countries which subscribe share the same fundamental values and are
subject to the same fundamental restrictions on how they deal with
people within their territories.</hs_para>

am really worried at the prospect of the message it would send if the
United Kingdom were to leave the European convention. The noble Lord,
Lord Faulks, talked about the UK becoming a pariah state, but that is
not quite what I have in mind. He also rightly described the very proud
and important contribution that this country has made to human rights
protection in many parts of the world. However, once it became clear
that the view of the United Kingdom was that it could go its own way
and no longer needed the European Court of Human Rights or to follow
the European convention, I would worry about the example that we were
setting. There are countries in eastern Europe—I will not name
them but noble Lords can identify them very easily—that already
find it difficult to comply 
<?notus-xml column=440?>with their obligations, and if they felt that they had the
liberty to produce their own Bill of Rights and their own protections
they would move in a very different
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000317">Secondly,
the convention provides for a permanence of protections. It is not an
immutable convention: it is open to member states to change. It is more
often changed by the addition of rights through the agreement of new
protocols but it is not impossible for member states to agree changes.
However, it differs very much from parliamentary legislation in that it
is not open to a single state to say, “We do not like the
decision that the court has just made therefore we are now going to
amend the right that is at issue”. I would be very worried if
the protection of human rights in this country depended only on a
statute of this Parliament, for which I have enormous respect. It would
still mean that it would be capable of amendment, variation, revocation
or removal if there were a parliamentary majority for that to take
place. I am concerned that there is a risk that something as important
as the protection of our fellow citizens could be subject to short-term
political issues or the pressures of
newspapers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000318" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000318">My
third concern is the detail: the devil is always in the detail. I see
from the commission’s conclusions
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13062064000587" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000587">“The
majority are agreed that such a Bill should have at its core the rights
currently in the European Convention on Human Rights … That does
not necessarily mean, however, that they would have to be written in
identical
language”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13062064000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000319">I
had exactly that issue when negotiating the charter. The question then
was whether we should write the relevant rights and obligations in the
same terms used in the European convention or use different language.
As soon as you use different language, any lawyer will find a
difference in the meaning intended. I do not know how it is to be done
because we do not know what the detail of a new Bill would be, but
there is a real risk that the rights written—allegedly not in
non-identical language but protecting the same rights—would not
actually be protected. When I was in office and debated the European
convention with my opposite numbers I used simply to ask which of the
rights in the convention they did not agree with: the right to a fair
trial, the freedom of speech, freedom of association, the prohibition
of torture, the prohibition of inhuman and degrading treatment. When
one analyses that—given that the rights concerned are basic
rights, rightly put into place following the horrors of the
Holocaust—it is difficult to rewrite this in a way which does
not risk removing those rights in some respect. If that is not the
intention I do not see the point of rewriting it, and that worries me a
great deal.</hs_para>

I share the views of those who have said that it would be very good if
more could be done to try to explain how the Human Rights Act and the
European convention work. There are myths and misconceptions; we came
across a lot of them in the time that I was in office. For example,
there was the allegation that an escaped burglar was provided with food
when he escaped because of his human rights, when it was nothing at all
to do with that. In fact, it was not food but drink; it is a jolly good
way to get somebody down from a roof, to ply him with a lot of
drink—non-alcoholic drink, of course, although maybe 
<?notus-xml column=441?>with alcoholic drink it would have been even faster. Lots of stories
were promoted, and came across in the newspapers about events said to
have taken place, but they were simply not the case. There is a huge

worry about the things that the present Government say that do not
illustrate a complete understanding of the Act. This is not the first
time that I have said this, but I was troubled by what the right
honourable Mr Grayling, the Lord Chancellor, said in
relation to the prisoner votes debate—that it was open to this
Parliament to ignore a decision made in a case to which the United
Kingdom was a party. Under the Human Rights Act it is perfectly true
that, when it is a decision in relation to another country, our courts
are required only to have regard to the decisions. However, none of
that takes away from the obligation that this country has, having
entered into an international obligation, to follow the decisions of

Professor Philippe Sands were reluctant to advocate any change in the

the scope of domestic protection of human rights should be enlarged.

aspects of our constitution are developing gradually, but without
necessary regard to their impact on other aspects. At this time, not
least because of the Scottish dimension and the definite possibility of
a referendum on independence, we will have some difficulty in
considering this in isolation from these other constitutional
considerations. I would hope, however, that in pursuance of one of the
recommendations of the commission, namely that of making the public 
<?notus-xml column=442?>more widely aware of the importance of the protection of human
rights—of what the Human Rights Act does and where it is,
perhaps, limited—we could establish some kind of convention, not
just on the protection of human rights, but more widely. Speaking as a
Scot, I do not think that the people of Scotland should think that
their choice is between independence and the status quo; there should
be a possibility of development towards a more federal system of
government internally in this United Kingdom. If that proposal were to
be taken up by the Government, I hope that it would be considered with
great care—and it has been considered by the Graham
Allen-chaired committee in the House of Commons. There would be an
opportunity to involve not just interest groups or politicians but
individual citizens and to spread a greater understanding of the
importance of the protection of human rights. One possibility is that
we might seek to extend effective protection by taking account of other
conventions to which we have signed up but not necessarily given

issue that has emerged in this debate is around the language of the
protection of human rights, which has always been cast in very broad
and general terms. If you go back to the Bill of Rights of 1689, you
will find similarly broad expressions. I do not think that it would be
at all sensible to narrow the effectiveness of those broad rights by
having greater definition; certainly there could be extension, but not
tighter definition. That is why the judges should have a balancing role
in our constitution. I am very unhappy about the principle of
sovereignty of Parliament, if it is judged as being something capable
of being used to produce results contrary to the history of our country
and values that we have, over many centuries, embraced and become more

majority’s central recommendation in this report and the
nightmare of having to wrestle in the courts in future not merely with
the complexities and uncertainties of the convention and of the vast
body of jurisprudence that it has spawned but with those of a new UK
Bill of Rights superimposed on it. I say “superimposed”

should be a different approach, recognising that there has been a
little progress. English judges have been moving away from the notion
that they are strictly bound by the jurisprudence of the European
court. While respecting the boundaries of the convention, the Human
Rights Act recognises and encourages the development of independent
domestic rights jurisprudence. The English courts are taking the
jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights properly into
account, but are not necessarily bound by its decisions. I believe that
for the present we should make a concerted effort to win over public
confidence in the European convention by making the British public more
aware of what the English courts are doing. I am not persuaded that we
should embark now upon the costly, time-consuming and difficult task of
proceeding with a UK Bill. As I have said, I do not believe that cogent
evidence is available to show that that would be better supported by
the British public. Instead, and despite the considerable difficulties,
which I acknowledge, we should seek again to reform the European court,
as has already been proposed and attempted. The Prime Minister should
add this to his agenda when he begins negotiations for wider
reform.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/71B799A5B494DE8B95A06DCA07FDF43897FFB3E1" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

public would be right to ask the question, “Whatever happened to
that commission?”, because, of course, the commission’s
report was published six months ago and we have not heard very much
about it since. This is perhaps best answered by the fact that the
commission was really set up to answer a political 
<?notus-xml column=447?>problem. Here was an issue on which the parties to the coalition were
deeply divided. Some Conservatives hold strongly that the European
Court of Human Rights and the European Convention on Human Rights are
an abomination and that we should be putting an end to them as soon as
possible. Other Conservatives may take a more sensible view. The
Liberal Democrats are deeply committed to human rights and to the whole
framework for securing respect for human rights throughout Europe and

Human Rights Act and commitment to abolishing it within the
Conservative party, and, on the other hand, the commitment of the
Liberal Democrats to the very opposite. That is why the commission was
set up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000351" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000351">I pay
tribute to the fact that the Liberal Democrat end of the appointment

than I think there was on the Conservative end. We gave consideration

those who drafted it would be concerned about the rather activist way
in which law has developed. However, I would say to him that that is
the nature of law. Society changes and develops, and so it is right
that courts should take account of the way in which our societies
evolve. Sensible Conservatives know that it is to Britain’s

when it was pointed out to those who thought this up that a British

parts of the United Kingdom which prefer to be referred to under the

entered into it, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, mentioned,

to the noble and learned Lord is that if one takes a closer look at the
publication that was produced, one will find that reference to that

have written about this matter in a number of journals, including the
<I>London Review of Books</I>. We started out with an open mind as to
whether a UK Bill of Rights was needed and whether it was a good thing.
We ended up with very strong views as to why we could not sign up to
it. The main reason was that the case was not made. The evidence we
took showed that, beyond the <I>Daily Mail</I>, the <I>Daily
Telegraph</I> and the activist sections of the Conservative Party, up
and down the country, particularly in the devolved nations, there was a
great deal of support for the European Convention on Human

also received a great deal of evidence. In fact, we had consultations
on two occasions. After the first, there was the suggestion,
“If you don’t like the first consultation’s
answers, let’s have another one”. The second consultation
reached the same conclusions: namely, that the general public, when
invited to express their views, were supportive of the Human Rights Act
and of being part of this greater fabric across Europe of protecting
human

also took the view that we could not support this because the timing
was absurd. A decision had just been made to have a referendum in
Scotland on whether there should be independence for Scotland. To be
rocking the boat and talking about, first, a British Bill of Rights,
and then a UK Bill of Rights, did not seem an appropriate or sensible
thing to be doing at this moment. Indeed, dependent on the outcome of
that referendum, it may be that we will embark on a set of
constitutional changes that would involve us having to look at all our

third matter for us was that there was very little thinking of the

emphasise that as the commission continued with its deliberations, we
became aware of the real motivations of some of our number: namely,
that they feel so strongly about being part of the European system

creating a British or UK Bill of Rights is a Trojan horse in order to

about this being a rebranding exercise and that a new UK-type Bill of

means to reduce rights, and a way of casting off Europe and returning
to some delusional idyll of an earlier age of sovereign authority,
unconstrained by obligations set out in international instruments. That

fault lines in the commission were real and deep. They related to the
failure to grapple with the content of such a Bill and with what its
real purposes were. The underlying desire was to decouple the United
Kingdom from the European convention and the jurisprudence of the
European Court. We were not prepared to go along with it. We see no
benefit in creating a superficial consensus, which was why we made our
separate entry in the report. We were also concerned that there was not
enough emphasis on the benefits of the European convention. These
benefits are important for Europe as a whole and for the United
Kingdom. Individuals in 47 states can now take challenges to abuses of
public power to an international court in Strasbourg. We should feel
proud of being part of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000364" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000364">At home,
the convention has brought great benefits. For example, it has
reinforced our commitment to due process in court proceedings. It has
advanced children’s rights and the rights of the elderly in care
homes. It has advanced freedom of expression and assembly, and
protected individuals from unfair extradition. Perhaps most powerfully,
it has reinforced the ban on torture and served as a source of
international inspiration, which again are things that we should be so
proud of.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000365" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000365">We
should keep in mind the way in which disregard of judgments flies in
the face of the rule of law. For our Government to be talking about
doing that is shameful. In the business, for example, of
prisoners’ voting rights, the margin of appreciation meant that
that could have been dealt with easily by providing the right to a
postal vote to those on very short sentences. That would have satisfied
honour in the European Court, but it is not how it is presented to the
public in our tabloid
press.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000366" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000366">This is
about a set of attitudes. At the heart of the differences on the
commission were distinct beliefs about the reach and purposes of human
rights. We were very separate. It was about the relationship between
matters local, national and international. A UK Bill of Rights may seem
harmless on the face of it and attractive at first sight, but alarm
bells should be ringing for everybody who cares about human rights. For
us, human rights are about working not just within our own country but
with other countries to improve the human condition, engender respect
for all individuals, protect those who are vulnerable and create the
conditions for the delivery of justice and peace
internationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000367" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000367">To
remove the glue that holds us together with other nations is dangerous.
Our criticisms of the European Court should galvanise us to reform it,
not cut ourselves off from it. I would say to the Liberal Democrats
that the lesson for them is that there are some areas where you cannot
do business with the Conservatives without 
<?notus-xml column=450?>selling your souls. That is what this commission has taught you. The
message to you must be: here is the big divide. It should be the
message to our nation as a whole. Human rights matter. They matter to
all of us. Even to contemplate decoupling from this important way in
which we join with Europe and the world in protecting human rights
would be folly in the extreme. That was why Philippe Sands and I
proudly distinguished ourselves from the rest of the commission. You
cannot sign up for this, because it is about diminishing rights for the
people who need them
most.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/3C9D0F0DCB80B0240FB867382A55C0A5E9B163BF" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

where, excellent though the commission’s work is, there are
serious dangers in approaching the matter in the way the majority have
indicated in the report. That does not mean that the work of the report

position of human rights is elevated into proper public debate. In
saying that, I am not referring to some of the debate that takes place

is important to understand that human rights are different from rights
set out in ordinary legislation. They are fundamental to the way of
life of this country—indeed, I would go so far as to say of all
countries that purport to or do adhere to the rule of law. What is
special about the rule of law is that when it talks of that subject it
is, in my understanding, talking about those rules which should govern
societies in general. The way they are applied and interpreted in
different jurisdictions does not mean that they are better observed in
one jurisdiction than another or less observed in one country than
another. The rule of law requires that a society adheres to basic
principles—principles which are the source of the European
convention and many other conventions. They are the source of justice,
the source of fairness, the source of proportionality and the source of
many other matters that make our society one that up to now has been
respected in many parts of the

Council of Europe, invited me to make a report when I ceased to be Lord
Chief Justice, one of the first activities I had at that stage. In the
course of it I interviewed individually most of the judges on that
court, looked at various procedures and was well aware of the huge
backlog of cases that they had. I found that the more I talked to those
judges, the more impressed I became. I was convinced that they were
concerned about the same things with regard to justice that I would
expect a British or United Kingdom judge to be concerned about. Within
the confines of a system they were called upon to administer, they did
their very best to achieve the results which they were required to
achieve in order to honour the principles set out in the European
convention. Of course some of the decisions would be popular and some
unpopular. I am afraid that that is true of a judge’s job. It

what they could with them. The second commission—and bearing

different jurisdictions. I mention it to declare an interest, but more
importantly to point out that although those 10 members were drawn from
different nations, they all struggled to work together to produce
results that would be beneficial to the court. They could not complete
their task in so far as they were not in a position to provide an
answer to all the problems. Those problems remain although they have

They were unstinting in their praise of our advocates who they said
were so good at understanding the real core of human rights. However,
they added that the cost of those advocates was totally
disproportionate when compared with that of advocates drawn from other
jurisdictions. Indeed, our advocates, of whom we are proud, are 10

Strasbourg, I am afraid that it would reflect adversely on this

apologise but I want to say one or two words more. If your Lordships
will bear with me, I will deal with them as quickly as I can. My belief
is that we must work towards obtaining the public’s confidence.
The only argument in favour of a British Bill of Rights is that it
would improve the public’s confidence in this area. If we do not
succeed in doing that, the future of human rights in this country will
be at risk. It is at risk at the moment and we must do everything which
is practical and possible to ensure that the British public take
possession of human rights and regard them as singling this country out
as being pre-eminent on issues of fairness and justice. If they
recognise that this is a relevant issue, this country has hope for the
future. If they do not, this country is very much at risk of
relinquishing its legal

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, as one who was at school with the noble
Lord, Lord Lester, I can share with this House the fact that there was
absolutely no doubt whatever among his contemporaries as students, or
indeed the staff at the time, that he was going to make a powerful
contribution to the future of this country. 
<?notus-xml column=453?>The fact that he has made it in the context of the realm of human rights

have just indicated and underlined my age. At the age of 13, my father
took me with him to an international conference he was organising in
Geneva. At that conference, I had the privilege of meeting Eleanor
Roosevelt and I had the pleasure of listening to Eleanor Roosevelt. As
I listened to this debate and the anxieties that have been expressed, I
reflect on the huge gap between life as it is today and life as it was
in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War. There was a
passionate conviction which gave her her strength and power, together
with all those working with her, that human rights were not just a
moral option in the way you organised your society. With all the
searing experience of the human suffering of the Second World War,
human rights were an absolutely essential and indispensable pillar of a
stable and secure
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:56:25"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
somehow lost that underlying basic philosophy and conviction.
Discussion is all about the management of human rights, the operation
of human rights law and the rest. We cannot repeat that conviction
too
often<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:56:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on personal experience, as someone who has no legal qualifications
whatever, but as somebody who has spent most of his life working in the
humanitarian sphere outside this House, I can say that pretty well
every month of every year in my practical work, I have seen again and
again the crucial importance of human rights to the cause of improving
the well-being and potential of our fellow human beings across the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:57:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000385" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000385">I
declare an interest as a member of the advisory board of the London
School of Economics Centre for the Study of Human Rights. I
think, and I say this sometimes at meetings of the board,
that we have to take seriously the criticism that is
sometimes loosely used about the human rights industry. To some people,
there is a perception which we have to examine that there is a human
rights industry—the chance of academic prowess and
postgraduate degrees, a preoccupation with much legal discussion about
it all, and the rest.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:59:23"></hs_TimeCode> seems to me
that we need to reconnect—that has come across in this debate
very well—the whole cause and indispensability of human rights
to real experiences and the real lives of people. That is an argument
for a Bill of Rights which cannot just be dismissed. As I understand it
as a layman, the strength of law at its best is when it underpins an
ethic which is broadly there in society. It will never bring everybody
on board, but an ethic is substantially there among people
instinctively that this is the kind of society in which they want to
live. This law underpins that reality and helps those who want to
distort or abuse it to be dealt
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:59:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000386" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000386">It
seems to me that a gap has developed here because people do not feel
they own human rights law. They see people, as it were, operating
downstream in the context of the human rights law that has been
created. It is very important to go back to source and reargue the case
for human rights and their indispensability. We have to look at that,
of course, in the context of our educational system and elsewhere, and
look at how seriously we are taking discussion 
<?notus-xml column=454?>and debate about human rights, and why they are so important, in our
educational system. As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, will remember, we
were both involved in the Council for Education in World Citizenship in
those days. It was a very lively body of sixth-formers across the
country with the whole cause of preparing for citizenship. Taking these
things seriously was central to our preoccupations. The Christmas
holiday lectures were packed. I am talking about the enthusiasm,
commitment and integrity of someone such as Eleanor Roosevelt and the
passion that she brought to this because of her experience of the war
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:00:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000387" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000387">I
apologise if I am reminiscing too much, but this is important because
these were the formative years. I recall that, slightly precociously,
we had a youth parliament in the constituency in which I lived as a
youngster. In that youth parliament, by our own choice, we took the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and set about deciding and
discussing how we would put it into action in our own society. These
things were vivid in the culture at the time. There has been a certain
amount of subjective interpretation about history, even in this debate.
I can remember that there were Conservatives then who shared this
concern and passion every bit as strongly as I did as a member of the
Labour League of Youth. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf,
emphasised, there seems to be a real need to regenerate this cause of
human rights and to highlight their indispensability for
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000388" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000388">There
is another issue. If I have come to one conclusion in the course of my
life, it is that the first reality for all of us is that, from the day
we are born, we live in a totally interdependent global community. I
worry about any action on our part in this country that undermines that
understanding and reality. It seems very important, in a realm as
crucial as human rights, that we have objectives, aspirations and
convictions towards which we try to encourage all our fellow citizens
across the world community to strive. If we start a process which
begins to suggest that human rights are things that you look at in a
national context and put first into your national culture, I wonder how
far we are helping the world to face up to this reality of
interdependence and making a really constructive and imaginative
contribution to the emergence of a better society and better
values.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000389">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:03:18"></hs_TimeCode>
noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, talked about the rule of law and
its importance. As a layman, I know that I want to live in a society
which observes the rule of law. However, there is a huge debate about
what that law should be. It seems to me that what we are all seeking is
justice. What matters is how<I> </I>we<I> </I>strengthen the debate
about what justice is and how justice should be reflected in the
law—it is not just about having a rule of law, it is about
ensuring that the rule of law reflects the cause of justice, of which
human rights are a part. Sometimes I wonder whether we have to use the
term “human rights”—which has become so
stereotyped—and to what extent we are really not just talking
about
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:03:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000390" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000390">I
am afraid that you cannot look at this debate, and the possibilities
for change, without examining the context of the dynamic in which it
takes place. It would certainly be very naive to try to do that. If I
am 
<?notus-xml column=455?>allowed to make so bold, noble Lords in this debate have been a little
cautious about facing up to some of the crude realities here. I wonder
whether people in years to come will see it as altogether a coincidence
that, at a time when we have the reassertion of rather crude and
unpleasant nationalist populism, there is debate about whether we could
have a Bill of Rights for
Britain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000391" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000391">Are

British way”—whatever we mean by Britain and a British
way—with which everyone is expected to conform but which does
not necessarily represent the realities of our society and the creative
potential of our society as a multicultural society? This is a huge
debate and we should not drift into it inadvertently. Debates like this

great friend and ally of my noble friend Lady Kennedy. I hope she will
forgive me saying that I was not really very happy with her seeming to
imply that there were no Conservatives who care about human rights and
the things I have been talking about every bit as much as I do. In the
noble Lord, Lord Gold, we have a classic example of a Conservative who
not only feels these things but feels them so sincerely and deeply that
he can express himself very well in a debate of this kind, in a way

will continue this discussion in many places for long weeks ahead

about the words she used. She also suggested rather that it was the
Conservative Party with which it was impossible to do business. The
society I want to live in by definition is one in which the
Conservative Party is as committed to the things I am talking about as
anybody else. We should be strengthening the elements within the
Conservative Party who share our convictions and speeding the day when

25th anniversary of the establishment of Charter 88, many of the
aspirations of which were adopted by my party in the early 1990s and
then put into effect by the Government from 1997 on. Who says that
pressure groups cannot achieve results? According to Professor Bogdanor
the constitutional achievements of the Labour Government, ranging from
the Human Rights Act to devolution, freedom of information, the
creation of the Supreme Court, and much more, represent a formidable
list. He may go too far when he says that it was an era of
constitutional reform comparable to that of the years of the Great
Reform Act 1832 or the Parliament Act
1911<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:11:30"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
even more impressive is the amount of power that was given away by some
of these measures by that Labour Government. For example, the Human
Rights Act gave power to individuals, the national states were given
power by devolution and the judiciary was given power by the difference
between the role of the Lord Chief Justice and that of the Lord
Chancellor and by the creation of the Supreme Court. Professor Bogdanor
went on to say that no British Government since World War II had
dispersed power to the same extent.</hs_para>

in all this—certainly for the most part—both in argument
and votes by the Minister’s party, the Liberal Democrats. Both
party manifestos for the 2010 general election talked about support for
the Human Rights Act; the Liberal Democrats’ manifesto talked
about protecting the Human Rights Act. It is therefore hardly
surprising that when the Liberal Democrats found themselves in a

that election and what will follow from it that we can realistically
move forward. I would expect the Liberal Democrats to be every bit as
robust in their defence of the Human Rights Act as I hope my party will

want to end on a perhaps rather less consensual note. I am afraid that
the Liberal Democrats’ effective defence of the Human Rights Act
and the convention is in marked contrast to the feebleness and lack of
concern for the individual citizen evident in their acquiescence
to—and sometimes even welcome for—some of the more
reactionary measures that Her Majesty’s Government have recently
taken. I of course refer to the restrictions either passed or proposed
on judicial review, the no-win no-fee policy, and the position that
private firms doing public work on public contracts may be exempt from
freedom of information. Above all, I must say, it is evident in the
decimation of social welfare law by taking it outside the scope of
legal aid. It is no answer to say that citizens are still able in
theory to go to law, because the reality is that without free legal
advice, the poor and the marginalised in practice cannot go to law.
Human right exist outside the Human Rights Act. By limiting and
restricting the ability of the citizen to take on the state, the
Liberal Democrats are colluding in particularly anti-liberal

conclude by saying to the Minister that he has nobly protected the

Lords, they say that they never come back, and yet there is the noble
Lord, Lord Bach, back on the Front Bench in fine, feisty form, taking
on a kind of Dame Nellie Melba role in the number of questions that he
asks. He has also tabled a Question for me to answer in a few
days’ time. The rather emotional goodbyes that I bid him a few

were familiar from our debates over the past two years, I shall not

grateful for the tribute that the noble Lord paid to the Cook-Maclennan
reforms. Certainly, the success of that first Labour Government from
1997 to 2001 owed very much, as my noble friend Lord Lester said, to
that blueprint setting out much of the constitutional reform during
that period. I believe that 
<?notus-xml column=459?>when future historians come to review that period, they will agree that
that burst of quite extraordinary reform started to peter out only when
the Government departed from the Cook-Maclennan blueprint and began
increasingly to rely on ideas usually prepared on the back of an
envelope by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, and the noble
Lord, Lord Prescott.</hs_para>

excellent debate. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith—the
late Lord Goldsmith—posed the question, “Which human
rights are you planning to repeal?”. It is a legitimate question
to ask those who seek change. The debate was made all the healthier by
the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, who produced with characteristic clarity
what I would call the case for the prosecution. He asked specifically
whether membership of the EU and membership of the European Convention
on Human Rights were compatible—whether we could withdraw from
one without affecting our membership of the other—particularly
given the ECHR case to which he referred. My officials advise me that
this is a moot point. I find it to be an extraordinarily moot point,
because I have always understood that one of the qualifications for
membership of the EU was observance of the European Convention on Human
Rights.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062064000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000413">In
recent years, I have had the opportunity to visit a number of countries
that, in working towards membership of the European Union, have been
set high hurdles by the EU in terms of human rights observance. One of
the great triumphs of the EU is how, by insisting on those high
hurdles, it has moved human rights eastwards across Europe. On 1 July,
we celebrate the latest addition to the European Union, Croatia. After
a terrible war, it has been the European Union and its insistence on
high standards in the rule of law that have prepared Croatia for its
rightful place in the European family, a family that is resting on the
ECHR.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000414" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000414">I
understand the points about how human rights have suffered by appearing
to delve into trivialities. However, as a number of speakers have
pointed out, the media often attribute to human rights reasoning and
causes that have nothing to do with the actual Human Rights Act. This
is rather like health and safety and data protection legislation, which
I also support. When the media talk about a pancake race that has been
cancelled by health and safety rules, I like to count the number of
deaths that have been prevented on building sites by those rules. That
is when these rules bite. Similarly, we only have to open the newspaper
every day to realise how important data protection rules are in a
modern society.</hs_para>

exposition of the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, which stimulated responses
in others, and I will try to cover a number of the issues that were
raised. I was extremely grateful for the intervention of the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, because he
counterpointed the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, in warning us of the
complexities of trying to write a UK Bill of Rights. There is always a
danger that, if you make a speech that is slightly out of step with
your party, everybody else praises you, so I hope that it does not do
the career of the noble Lord, Lord Gold, too much damage to say that I
found his intervention extremely

Bach, and the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, both seemed to imply that
there was some secret about the origins of the Bill of Rights
commission. This Government were formed as a coalition between two
parties that have, in recent years, taken a different view about the
Human Rights Act and the part that the European Court in Strasbourg,
and the European Convention on Human Rights it interprets, should play
in our national law. The response of the new coalition Government was
twofold. We established the commission, of which the noble Lord, Lord
Lester, was a distinguished member, as was the noble Baroness, Lady
Kennedy, and the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, and we embarked on a
programme of reform of the Strasbourg court that culminated in the
Brighton

have also said that I do not consider the Human Rights Act to be a
precious vase, to be kept on a high shelf, never to be taken down or
examined for fear of breaking it. I agree with the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Woolf, that well informed debate about human rights is
extremely healthy. I welcome, particularly in this House, our periodic
examination of human rights and their place in our society—the
noble Lord, Lord Bach, referred to the one such review led by the noble

ago.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062064000418" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000418">I hope
that the House will keep on returning to this subject, because, like
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, I remain confident that such an
examination invariably concludes with a reaffirmation of human rights
as something deep in the political DNA of the British people and of our
history. The noble Lord, Lord Lester, reminded us of the relevance of
Magna Carta, the 800th anniversary of which we celebrate in 2015. That
linkage between our history and the growth of the concept of human
rights was underlined, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, reminded us, when
Eleanor Roosevelt launched the UN Declaration of Human Rights and

explanation of what she meant. She was part of that “never
again” generation who had experienced the horrors of when state
power goes unchecked and human rights are subjugated to the power of
the state or some perverted political doctrine. The noble Lord, Lord
Judd, is right: that generation, whether it be the noble Lord, Lord
Healey, or Ted Heath, or others who came back from that war, had a
“never again” determination that impacted on the
legislation that they brought forward and the themes that they
espoused.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062064000419" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000419">Let
us be clear that human rights and civil liberties are not some foreign
invention. They are deeply rooted in the history of the people of this
country. Upholding them should be a source of national pride. As the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, and the noble Lord, Lord Gold,
pointed out, too many people do not fully comprehend the impact of
human rights on their daily lives, and myths and misreporting about
human rights are often accepted as fact. If we look beyond the
sometimes skewed perceptions, we see that the Act is a measured piece
of legislation when understood 
<?notus-xml column=461?>and used properly. The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, cited some very
good examples of human rights in action and I could give others. As the
noble Lord, Lord Faulks, said, human rights are not a matter of
abstractions; they are about realities. It is not an airy-fairy notion
reserved for philosophy seminars but the practical interaction between
the state and its agencies and those they should
serve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000420" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000420">The
message from this debate is that it is your human rights, my human

reflecting on judgments, we should note our actual Strasbourg record.
As the noble Lord, Lord Lester, reminded us, the number of applications
involving the UK that resulted in a judgment by the European Court of
Human Rights is small. In 2012, there were only 10 judgments finding
violations against the United Kingdom out of over 3,300 applications.
Our record on implementation of judgments is generally good: from March
2010 to May 2013, the United Kingdom completed the implementation of 82
judgments, with just 22 outstanding. One highlight of my ministerial
career was when, in May 2012, I sat in front of the United Nations
Human Rights Council in Geneva being held to account for the
UK’s human rights
record.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000422">The
UPR mechanism offers the Government real opportunities to consult civil
society organisations and our national human rights institutions.
Through open discussion with them, we build an understanding of where
we should focus our efforts on key human rights issues; this dialogue
allows them to monitor our progress. We have also gone digital. On top
of stakeholder events, everyone now can send us online submissions via
our website. All this ensures that we remain connected to, and aware
of, human rights issues as they affect real people. We aim to use the
information gathered from our engagement with civil society and through
online submissions to help to shape how we respond to the United
Nations in our mid-term review next summer. This approach pays
dividends in engaging people in human rights. It helps us to focus our
efforts and enables civil society to monitor our progress. Generally,
our approach to the review was one of openness, celebrating success
where we can but being receptive to challenge. We have had very
positive feedback from civil society organisations in the UK on our
engagement
strategy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000423">Also
in May, the United Kingdom was examined against our obligations under
the United Nations Convention Against Torture. We will consider the
recommendations carefully before responding. That was a point made by
the noble Lord, Lord Faulks. It is not just a matter of the ECHR. In a
world of interdependability, we are part of a whole range of
conventions and commitments, by which we test Governments’
behaviour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000424" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000424">As
I said, undergoing such scrutiny is necessary and proper to ensure that
the United Kingdom is fulfilling its obligations under the Human Rights
Act and that 
<?notus-xml column=462?>the Act itself is fit for purpose. It was with this in mind that the
Government put forward plans for the Commission on a Bill of Rights. On
behalf of the Government, I express thanks once again for
the dedicated work of all those associated with the
commission, culminating in the publication of its final report. Like
others, I pay particular tribute to Sir Leigh Lewis, as chairman of
that commission. My view is that the only job that he is otherwise
qualified for is leading the Liberal Democrats in the House
of Lords, because he has all the same attributes, as we have seen
today—he had some fairly big personalities to keep in
check.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000425" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000425">I
remind the House of some of the commission’s key conclusions. A
majority of the commission concluded that there is a strong argument in
favour of a UK Bill of Rights. However, that was on the basis that any
such Bill would need to incorporate and build on all the UK’s
existing obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights and
that it would provide no less protection than is currently contained
both in the Human Rights Act and in the devolution settlements. Both
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, and my noble friend Lord Gold
made powerful arguments about whether that was the right way forward.
This finding was in line with the commission’s terms of
reference. The majority saw the current lack of public ownership of the
Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights as the
most compelling reason in favour of a new Bill of Rights. However, as
my noble friend Lord Gold reminded us, even if it were to be carried
through, it might not solve this problem of public understanding and
acceptance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000426" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000426">Some
of those in the majority who favoured a Bill of Rights felt that any
new Bill could usefully define the scope of some rights more clearly
and adjust their balance. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy,
has told us, she and Philippe Sands concluded that the
commission’s consultations and its deliberations had failed to
identify any real shortcomings either in the existing Human Rights Act
or in the way in which it is applied to the domestic courts. They were
concerned that any move towards a Bill of Rights would lessen the
rights protection that is currently available and would potentially be
a first step towards the United Kingdom withdrawing from the European
Convention on Human Rights.</hs_para>

was unable to reach agreement on all its conclusions, it identified and
reported issues that would need careful consideration before any
changes were made to the UK’s legal framework for human rights.
I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Bach, and some of the
distinguished academics. I think that any political party looking
forward and working on its policy on this issue, and any Parliament
looking at it, will find the commission’s work an exercise in
ground-clearing and testing of arguments that will stand us in good
stead for the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000428" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000428">My
noble friend Lord Maclennan reminded us, as did the commission, of the
background against which this discussion is taking place. Next year we
will definitely have to make a very clear decision about the future of
this United Kingdom. The evidence showed—and there was unanimity
on this—that to discuss any

note in passing that, although we think that perhaps the other place is
more hostile and more populist, when a 10-minute rule Bill to repeal

Bacon MP last December, it was defeated by 195 votes to 75. I just do
not believe it is true that there is some great populist seething

suggesting ways in which the effectiveness and efficiency of the court
could be improved. I hope that there is good news for him. Better late
than never, at the recent meeting in Strasbourg the court accepted a
number of the recommendations in the noble and learned Lord’s
report. I would not presume to suggest that the legal system sometimes
moves very slowly, but it gets there in the end. On Monday, our
ambassador in Strasbourg will, on behalf of the UK, sign Protocol 15 to
the convention, which implements the amendments to the convention
agreed in the Brighton declaration. We are continuing to press for
reforms of the Strasbourg court in a way that we think will give it

deep in our history and deep in our national psyche. Let us not be

European treaty? For the rest of Europe and most of the Commonwealth,
the question is, is this incompatible with our constitutional rights?
The question that the report poses, and that has been debated this
afternoon, is whether we command more public confidence by relying on
the European treaty, or whether, as the Labour Party agreed in 1993,
the first step should be incorporating the convention by statute, but
that that should be followed by the second step of a constitutional
instrument? As I think everyone has said, that question can only be
answered after the Scottish referendum. I hope that in June 2015, two
years from now, when we mark the anniversary of Magna Carta and its
Scottish equivalent, we will strive to ensure that it will be an
occasion to celebrate what has been achieved and to build on those
achievements, not to weaken them. I am grateful to all noble
Lords.</hs_para><hs_Procedure Justify="left" UID="13062064000830" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000830">Motion

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe):</Member></B> My Lords, in 2009 we debated piloting direct
payments for healthcare as part of the wider personal health budget
pilot programme. Personal health budgets allow people to have choice
and control over the care and support that they receive. A care plan is
drawn up between individuals and their healthcare professionals, which
is person-centred and designed to allow them to access care that works
in the best way for them. It is already possible to offer personal
health budgets where the money is held by the NHS or by a third party,
but direct payments would allow personal health budgets to be held by
the individual in the form of cash sent directly to their bank account,
albeit one separate to their own personal
funds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000440" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000440">Direct
payments—and, indeed, personal health budgets more
widely—are new to the NHS and we wanted the pilots to explore
whether they would be beneficial. We wanted to find out which people
and services were likely to benefit most and how we should implement
them in order to get the best results. The pilot programme ran from
2009 to 2012 and I am delighted to report that the independent
evaluation of that programme supports the wider use of direct payments
in healthcare.</hs_para>

minutes talking about what the evaluation and the learning from the
pilot programme tell us about direct payments for healthcare and
personal health budgets more widely. The evaluation demonstrated that
personal health budgets were most beneficial for people who had higher
levels of health needs. In particular, it identified benefits to people
with long-term physical or mental health conditions and disabilities
who access the NHS most frequently. For these people, having real
choice and control over how to manage their budget to meet their
individual needs is a key factor in how they handle their own condition
and improve their quality of
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000442" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000442">The most
important element of our debate today is the discussion around whether
we should take a step further and allow direct payments for healthcare
as a new option for people who have or want personal health budgets,
building on the success of the pilots. If the House agrees with the
principle, secondary regulations, which will be laid before the Summer
Recess, will set out the rules for the making of direct payments for
healthcare.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000443" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000443">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:50:16"></hs_TimeCode>
current debate focuses on direct payments for healthcare because this
is the only part of the personal health budgets policy that requires
legislative change. The other two ways to manage personal health
budgets, where money is held by the NHS or alternatively by a 
<?notus-xml column=466?>third party, are currently lawful. However, direct payments for
healthcare are a great deal more than money in lieu of NHS services.
They are designed to allow people more flexibility and control over how
their health needs are
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000444" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000444">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:50:49"></hs_TimeCode>
pilot programme showed that the success of direct payments for
healthcare is dependent on good-quality, personal, holistic planning.
The secondary regulations set out that individual care plans must be
agreed before a direct payment can be approved. Importance is placed on
the development of the plan being led by the individual or their
carers, or a collaboration of both, using the right information and
support. It should bring together their knowledge and experience of
what works for them alongside clinical knowledge and expertise. The
role that healthcare professionals play is still vital, but the
conversation between the individual and specialists involved in their
care should be a different, more real
partnership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000445" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000445">So
where does the NHS constitution fit into all this? It is vital, as we
are absolutely clear that the budget must meet the full cost of the
care and support agreed in the plan. NHS care provided through a direct
payment for healthcare remains comprehensive care, free at the point of
delivery, based on need rather than on ability to pay. This means no
top-ups.</hs_para>

the vast majority of cases, direct payments for healthcare will
continue to be used on traditional care and support. However, a
personal budget will give people the freedom to set
arrangements that work for them. For example, people will be able to
employ their own carers. In these circumstances, they will have greater
control over who comes into their home, when they are scheduled to come
and what tasks care staff perform. This can make a real difference to
people’s lives and to their families’ lives by
encouraging them to organise care that is more appropriate for their
needs and the lifestyle they wish to lead. It is crucial to note,
however, that direct payments for healthcare are not about new money;
they simply allow people to use money already being spent on their care
in a different way.</hs_para>

NHS provides a huge range of care, support and treatment, and it would
not be appropriate to include all NHS services in direct payments.
Secondary regulations will set out what services should be excluded
from a direct payment for healthcare. These will include, for instance,
GP services, as we believe that disruption to the holistic care
currently provided by a GP would be
detrimental.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000448" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000448">In
addition, we do not think that it is appropriate to include the costs
of unplanned care in a direct payment for healthcare. This would
include things such as a visit to accident and emergency or admissions
to hospital. However, it is important to point out that the evaluation
of the pilot programme suggests that people with personal health
budgets use secondary care services less. We are therefore confident
that there is merit in giving people budgets to help them access care
and support which works for them and prevents their unnecessary
admission into hospital. Everyone will be able to reap the benefits as
individuals will experience a more infrequent need for acute care and
the overall cost of care for each individual will decrease, meaning an
overall saving to the public purse.</hs_para>

not think that the use of direct payment for healthcare would add value
is payment for medication. Deciding what medication an individual
requires is a core responsibility of GPs and it should remain that way.
This is currently dealt with using a two-stage process whereby a GP
gives a prescription and pays for the cost of the medicine, and the
individual then contributes with their prescription fee. We do not
believe that direct payments should be used for either stage, or for
any other area where NHS charges
apply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000450" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000450">There
may be concerns surrounding the proper or improper use of funds, or
people’s needs not being met. In order to monitor this, there
will be periodic reviews to ensure that the care and support being
delivered are meeting the individual’s needs. In the case of
direct payments for healthcare, these reviews will include a financial
review to ensure that the money is being used appropriately. The
details of what the review should entail will be set in the secondary
regulations and explained to the individual as part of the
care-planning
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000451" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000451">The
evidence from the pilot programme suggests that people spend their
money as set out in the individual care plan. What is more, they were
happy to give money back if it was not needed. However, safeguards will
be written into the secondary regulations to ensure that action can be
taken where there is an excess that people are reticent to return, or
where fraud has
occurred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000452" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000452">In
implementing direct payments for healthcare we are keen to ensure that
integration between health and social care is taken into account. There
are a few differences between direct payments for healthcare and direct
payments provided by local authorities to fund social care. For
example, the latter rely on means-testing, whereas direct payments for
healthcare do not. Nevertheless, where possible the policy and
regulations for direct payments for healthcare mirror those for social
care. This will help to facilitate integration across health and social
care. In future, it is intended that adults who have both health and
social care needs could have a joint plan and
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000453" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000453">I will
now turn briefly to the issue of who should be able to have a direct
payment for healthcare. We do not believe that such a payment would be
appropriate for everyone who uses NHS services, or for all the services
that an individual may use. The founding principle is that there needs
to be a benefit from having a direct payment and that this should
outweigh any additional costs. The evaluation suggests that those with
higher health needs and inevitably larger budgets benefit
most.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000454" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000454">I make
it clear that direct payments for healthcare will always be voluntary.
No one will be forced to have one or be asked to take more control than
they would find comfortable. However, where they add value and the
individual is interested in using them, the right information and
support should be made available so that people can make informed
choices about how they wish to proceed. The need for information and
support is intrinsic to this entire process, and this will be set out
in the secondary regulations.</hs_para>

the evaluation that followed provided evidence that the concept of
direct payments for healthcare is beneficial and cost effective if
properly implemented. Nevertheless, we accept that there is still much
to learn and that we are only at the beginning of the journey.
Therefore, it is important that direct payments for healthcare are
introduced gradually and in a way that guarantees the sustainability of
the programme. As of April 2014, people receiving NHS continuing
healthcare will have a right to request a personal health budget and
direct payments. It is thereafter anticipated that this progression,
allowing more and more people the opportunity to have direct payments,
will continue into 2015 and
beyond.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000456" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000456">In
conclusion, I trust that I have demonstrated how the draft order
removing the pilot scheme limitation will enable direct payments for
healthcare to be made to patients using the NHS in England, and how
secondary regulations will clearly set out the details of how they will
be implemented. I commend the draft order to the

Wheeler:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
comprehensive explanation of the background and purpose of the order.
We recognise that it is a technical amendment, but this is nevertheless
a good opportunity to be updated by the Minister on the consultation on
the extension of direct payments for healthcare and how the learning
points from the pilots are to be translated into the revised
regulations. Labour is fully supportive of extending personal health
budgets, having pioneered them in social care through our
personalisation and transformation of social care agenda, and set the
ball rolling into 2009 on the PHB direct payments
pilot.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000458" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000458">It was
also right to focus on exploring the use of PHBs and direct payments
where people had the highest needs, such as those with long-term health
and mental health conditions and who access the NHS most frequently.
The pilot group covered CIPD, diabetes and long-term conditions, mental
health and stroke and patients eligible for NHS continuing care. Labour
was particularly concerned that PHBs do not stop at physical health but
also include people with learning

national rollout target for PHBs to be extended to 56,000 people by
April 2014 is challenging but is necessary to boost the take-up of PHBs

pilot evaluation concluded that the majority of budget holders and
their carers reported positive impacts of PHBs on patients—on
health and well-being, care and other support arrangements for family
members. As we know, PHBs have the potential to improve quality of life
and satisfaction for both patients and carers, including psychological
well-being. Helping patients design packages of care and support from
clinicians, primary and secondary care and community health services
also helps to provide joined-up integrated 
<?notus-xml column=469?>care, as the Minister pointed out, and in many instances has led to a
reduction in the number of hospital visits. This is exactly where we

a member—like many Members on all sides of both Houses—of
the Westminster Health Forum, I recently chaired a specialist
conference on PHBs which was attended by staff, providers and
practitioners from across health and social care. The forum conferences
are a valuable exchange between experts and staff on the ground
including, in this case, those who are part of the multidisciplinary
teams supporting and delivering PHBs. There was strong support for PHBs
but it is clear, as the Minister said, that we are still very much in a
learning process about their development. As usual, as you would

should like to finish by asking the Minister three questions on the
issues that arose. First, there were widespread concerns at the
conference that the evidence on the impact and effect of PHBs needed to
be sharpened up in the future evaluation process. The pilot evaluation
showed that there did not appear to be an impact on health status per
se. Can the Minister explain whether there are plans in the rollout to
assess possible measurements of health improvements, although of course
we recognise that these can be hard to achieve in long-term health
conditions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:02:29"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000463" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000463">Secondly,
a number of GPs at the conference spoke about the challenge of getting
wider GP buy-in to PHBs. Can the Minister update the House on
discussions with the Royal College of GPs and the BMA on addressing
this important issue? The college’s guidance on PHBs was
especially commended by conference

there was widespread concern about how PHBs will be taken forward by

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, this is most definitely one area of policy
where all sides of the House are at one and I am grateful to the noble
Baroness for her comments. She is right that the pioneering work on
social care budgets was carried out during the previous
Administration and gave us—and her own Government in
2009—sufficient confidence to institute these pilots for
healthcare. I am pleased that she is as gratified as I am that the
pilots have been a success, although as I emphasised earlier, we still
need to feel our way in rolling them
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:03:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000466">The
noble Baroness mentioned specifically people with learning disabilities
and I agree with what she said. Although the number of people with
learning disabilities involved in the pilot was small, it is clear from
their stories that people with learning disabilities and their families
benefited from the flexibility and control offered by personal health
budgets. As the final report on Winterbourne View
identified, personal health budgets have the potential to improve
commissioning for people with complex needs and challenging behaviour.
Many people in out of area placements, or who are at 
<?notus-xml column=470?>risk of such placements, are funded entirely through NHS continuing
healthcare or have some NHS funding. These groups could be offered
personal health budgets as the basis for a person-centred approach,
meaning that they could have more control over where they live and the
care they can access. It is that kind of intangible benefit—the
noble Baroness asked about health benefits—that is very
difficult to capture metrically, but it is nevertheless an important
factor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000467" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000467">The
noble Baroness asked me about resources and whether they
will be available. As I mentioned earlier, personal health budgets are
not about new money, they are about using existing money more
effectively. Funding for budgets will need to be found
from within normal NHS allocations and how that is done will
be a decision for local CCGs. The personal health budget toolkit
contains learning from the pilot programme on this and more information
will become available during the early rollout phase as Going Further
Faster sites consider sustainability issues. NHS England will be
publishing guidance to help CCGs consider how to introduce direct
payments for healthcare and personal health budgets on a local level in
a sustainable way.</hs_para>

Baroness’s question about health outcomes, it might be helpful
to run through some of the findings from the pilots, which I think show
that we can hold our heads up and say that they benefit people. First,
we are clear that personal health budgets are cost-effective. They
improve or maintain outcomes and reduce costs or are cost-neutral.
These results are particularly true for people eligible for NHS
continuing healthcare and people with mental health problems. When
personal health budgets are implemented so that the person has choice
over services and how they receive the budget, the cost-effectiveness
increases. People can choose to meet their needs in different ways
through lower-cost interventions, for example by training their
personal assistants to carry out some health tasks, such as changing
dressings. This means that people’s needs can still be met but
in a different way, and perhaps in a way which is less stressful for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000469" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000469">Personal
health budgets also clearly resulted in an increase in the quality of
life. The study found that effects were greater when people had budgets
of more than £1,000, and this generally applies to people who
have higher levels of health need, as I mentioned earlier. People
benefited more from personal health budgets when there were fewer
restrictions in place around what they could spend the money on and how
they received the budget—that is, having a choice of a direct
payment, a third-party budget or a notional budget. I hope that that is
helpful to the noble Baroness in answer to her
question.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000470" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000470">In
answer to the noble Baroness’s further question, I can tell her
that the review will include a review of whether the budget is meeting
the individual’s needs. That is clearly an important factor. We
need to make sure not only that the money is adequate but that the plan
itself and the money that goes with it are in step with each other. As
regards the Royal College of General Practitioners and wider GP buy-in
to personal health budgets, we have been very careful to engage 
<?notus-xml column=471?>with the royal college at all stages. We met them in conference last
week to discuss their role going forward. It is important, as the noble
Baroness stressed, that we engage GPs in this process, and I hope that
we can continue that active co-operation with
them.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13062064000831" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000831">Motion

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Wales Office (Baroness
Randerson):</Member></B> My Lords, this order brings into force the
code of practice for the exercise of powers in the Justice and Security
(Northern Ireland) Act 2007. The 2007 Act provides a range
of powers to the Police Service of Northern Ireland, including stop and
question, stop and search for munitions and wireless apparatus, and
entry of premises. It also gives the police the power to seize items
found during searches of people, premises and vehicles. While a number
of the powers in the 2007 Act are primarily for use by the PSNI, the
Armed Forces also have powers under the Act which they can use in
support of the
police.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000472" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000472">Amendments
to the 2007 Act made by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 introduced
an authorisation procedure for the exercise by the police of
stop-and-search powers in relation to munitions and wireless
transmitters. The purpose of this code is to set out how the powers at
Sections 21, 23 and 24 and Schedules 3 and 26 to the 2007
Act should be exercised by the Police Service of Northern Ireland. It
also sets out the fundamental principles which underpin the
use of the powers. The purpose of Annexe C of the code is to set out
the general principles for the use of the powers at Sections 21 to 28
and Section 30 of the 2007 Act by the Armed Forces in the exceptional
circumstances in which they may be
exercised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000473" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000473">The
code of practice has been developed to provide guidance on the use of
these powers, particularly to ensure that they are used with regard to
proportionality and necessity principles. Effective controls on police
powers are essential if we are properly to protect civil liberties.
Noble Lords will wish to note that there was no requirement to develop
a code under the 2007 Act. The Act simply allowed the Secretary of
State to make one and my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State decided to do so following the
changes to the powers made by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012 to
ensure that they were used proportionately, recognising that they are
extremely valuable to the PSNI but that we must ensure that they are
used properly. We believe that the amended powers and accompanying code
of practice strike the right

that there are robust safeguards to ensure that the powers are not
abused or used

recognise that some of these powers, such as the power to

the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 codes

introduction of the code of practice as drafted. The comments were
carefully considered and amendments to the code were made. The draft
code was close to being finalised when the Court of Appeal issued its

Court of Appeal found that, without a code of practice in place for the
use of these powers in the 2007 Act, the powers were too broad and
lacked adequate safeguards. Noble Lords will wish to note that the
judgment related to the powers in the 2007 Act prior to the amendments
made by the 2012 Act, which brought in the safeguard of an
authorisation process for the stop-and-search power.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>,
following the judgment and subsequent legal advice, the PSNI suspended
its use of stop-and-question and stop-and-search powers until a code of
practice was in place. Due to the risk to public safety if these powers
were not available to the PSNI, it was considered necessary to bring in
the code of practice under an urgent procedure, as provided for by the
2007 Act. With the approval of the Secretary of State for Northern
Ireland, the code of practice was brought into force on 15 May and the
PSNI was able to resume use of these powers, which are an essential
tool in ensuring public safety.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:16:46"></hs_TimeCode> urgent

terrorism. The powers are an important tool for maintaining public
order and were exercised by the PSNI during the recent flags dispute.
However, given the current situation in Northern Ireland, these powers
are often used to protect the public from terrorist attacks. The PSNI
has demonstrated that these powers are necessary and effective in
dealing with Northern Ireland-related terrorism. They have prevented
attacks, saved lives and led to arrests and convictions. I commend the
order to the

is under the part of the code dealing with search for and seizure of
munitions and transmitters. My slight problem with that phrasing is
that it seems to say that there are two rights. It does not do so
explicitly but it leads into it. One is the right to a private life and
the other is the commitment that the police must have, under the
European convention, to protect life. Following the Court of Appeal
ruling, we are putting this problem back with the officers on the
ground, and it is probably reasonable to make it clearer. I think that
Parliament properly believes that the right to life, in certain
circumstances, trumps the right to a private life for a person who
might be under investigation. There is just an element of equivocation
in the drafting there, which suggests an apparent equality of rights. I
accept that it does not actually equate those rights but it certainly
does not prioritise one right over
another.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062064000482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000482">Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:22:03"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords will remember that we have expected officers in the last few
days, in the lead-up to the G8

have been in a situation of trying to intercept ammunition that was
being moved around Northern Ireland. I cannot imagine that it would be
enormously helpful for them to have to have in mind that they must, on
the one had, weigh up their views on the right to life—we all
have the right to life but in this case it is the lives of some very
important people—and at the same time have to bear that in mind
that they might be interfering with the private life of the person
driving the car. There is a real problem of balance here and I just
think that the drafting is slightly too glib. I am not in any way going
to push this point but think it is worth registering. Broadly speaking,

contributions from noble Lords, in particular from the most reverend
Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury. I am delighted that he has found

are in a very desperate and difficult situation. The payday lending
industry is making a small group of people very rich by lending to
people who struggle to get access to reasonably priced financial
products to meet their needs at the most exorbitant and outrageous
rates of interest. As the most reverend Primate told the House when he
spoke during the passage of the Financial Services Act, this is nothing
more than usury. A loan becomes usurious because of the excessive or
abusive interest rates applied, and the payday lending industry does
just
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:30:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

disappointed that the Government have done next to nothing on this
issue following the cross-party agreement on an amendment to cap
interest rates which was passed in this House last year. Will the noble
Viscount tell the House why the Government have done so little on this
issue? Yes, we are living in tough times, but I get the feeling that
for some people times are tougher than for others. I do not feel that
we are all in this together. Rip-off Britain is alive and well. The
payday lending industry is one of the worst examples of exploitation of
the poor and the vulnerable, and we all need to do something about it.
Government, Parliament, banks and other financial service providers,
the Office of Fair Trading, other regulators, the Church and civil
society all need to say, “Enough is enough. We are not going to
let you treat people like this any

be doing a number of things and should use their influence to get
others to take action as well. We find ourselves in a situation where
the alternatives to the payday lending industry are few, and the
alternatives that exist need active help and support to grow in

consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000494" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000494">The
Government have had plenty of advice, seen plenty of studies, and lots
of work has been done to identify the problem for them, but so far
their response has been poor. Some of the worst practices of this
industry include poor lending checks—when there is no proper
assessment as to whether the applicant for a loan has enough disposable
income to repay the loan in full. Payday lenders often roll over loans
without checking whether they will be affordable, even though rollovers
should be seen as a clear indication that the borrower may be
experiencing financial difficulties. The Office of Fair Trading noted
that payday lenders have a strong incentive to roll over loans, making
as much as half of their revenues this
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000495" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000495">Multiple
loans are also a key indicator of acute repayment problems and should
ring alarm bells—but they do not. The misuse of continuous
payment authorities has seen situations where money is taken from
people’s accounts, leaving them with no money to cover food,
housing and other essential bills. Default interest and charges make
the cost of rollovers very expensive for borrowers, who cannot repay
their loan on time. Again, this is another huge source of revenue for
payday
lenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000496" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000496">The
aggressive targeting of students and young people is wrong. I was
horrified to learn of young people using their smartphones to get a
payday loan to buy another round of drinks on a Saturday night. I could
go on with this list of bad practices and horror stories but I am sure
that other noble Lords will have further examples that they will want
to share with us. I will speak about some of the things that could be
done to regulate the industry more effectively and get it to act

House just over three years ago almost every Minister who spoke from
the Dispatch Box told us that the answer to most of our problems was
the big society. Today we never hear the term mentioned, as
if it had been banished from the book. If the concept ever meant
anything, surely it means people coming together, supporting
their community and the most vulnerable, working together,
opposing injustice and unfairness, and not letting people be ripped

can we do? At a minimum, we could create a situation where no one is
struggling to pay off multiple payday loans. No one should owe more
than £500 in payday loans. Lenders recovering payday loans
should never leave borrowers without the means to meet basic
expenditure such as rent, food and council tax. The use of continuous
payment authorities should be stopped, and replaced with payment
authorities that are controlled by the customer only. If that is not
possible because the type of basic bank account the customer has will
not allow that, the bank should change the rules and permit it. If a
customer notifies the payday lender that they are in financial
difficulties, then default charges and interest payments should be
stopped for at least 30 days while they get help to deal with their
debts. The default charges and other punitive charges should never
exceed 30% of the original
loan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000500" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000500">Every<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

also provide similar information. I would like to see all payday
lenders carry a health warning on their advertisements in whatever
medium. These warning should be about 20% of the size of the advert.
Similar rules used to apply for cigarette companies, before they were
banned from advertising. Payday lenders should tell customers where to
go for debt advice, and notify them that cheaper alternatives are
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000501" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000501">For<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
all those measures, other measures are being introduced by payday
lenders. We need a plan, and we need to support the alternatives to the
payday lending industry. Credit unions have a role to play, and noble
Lords will be aware of my active support for the credit union movement
over many years. However, only the biggest credit unions will be in a
position to provide immediate help. The London Mutual Credit Union, one
of the biggest in the country and the biggest in London, has taken up
that challenge. The legislative reform order the Government passed on
credit unions was very welcome, as is the Treasury’s recent
announcement of a rise in the interest rate
cap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000502" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000502">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
credit union expansion project is good news, and on many occasions I
have praised the Government for their work here, but a £35
million fund is not going to provide the solution to our problems. It
is a drop in the ocean, and much more needs to be done. In this House I
have previously called on the banks to actively support the credit
union movement. They must do so not only with a bit of sponsorship or
small sums of money, although that would be welcome, but by making a
commitment to build these organisations and make 
<?notus-xml column=478?>them financially robust. Banks should use the skills and expertise of
their own staff, working on long term secondments to help the credit
union movement grow and develop. The aim is to build what we see on
both sides of the border in Ireland and in the United States of
America: financially robust institutions, owned by their members, which
deliver locally tailored financial products at a reasonable
price.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000503" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000503">We<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
also need the support of the wider business community, and in fact
every employer in the public and private sector. Simply advertising the
availability of their local credit union to staff and allowing them to
save with it through check-off would be a big step in the right
direction. Some of our biggest companies and the Government should take
a lead in this with an advertising campaign in support of the credit
union
movement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000504" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0002.htm#13062064000504">It<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
would also be very helpful if local government as a whole took a
proactive role in supporting local credit unions. There are some
fantastic examples in places such as Southwark, Islington and Sandwell,
to name just three. We need the whole of local government to play its
role. If every local authority pledged to deliver a place on the high

be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000505" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062064000505">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
was surprised to learn how basic some basic bank accounts are. In an
age where you can get a payday loan on your smartphone in minutes, some
of these accounts do not allow people to get cash back at a supermarket
when going shopping, forcing them to use cash machines. If your local
bank branch has closed and taken its cash machines away, you are left
with the corner shop where you have to pay to use the cash machine.
These machines charge £2 or £3 to get out a £10
note. Why can the banking industry not look at some sort of basic loan
of up to £500? That could make a huge difference here. Why can
the Government not work with banks to provide them with protection and
support if they work to help people get away from the payday lending
industry?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000506" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062064000506">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
point I want to make in this debate is that if whole communities are
abandoned then they will become the victims of the payday lending
industry. To stop that, there must be a full range of financial
products available. We must ensure that you are not discriminated
against because of where you live or because you are poor. There need
to be viable alternatives to payday lenders. Credit unions are part of
the solution, but not all of it. Other financial providers need to step
up, and civil society as much as Government need to say that enough is
enough.</hs_para>

reminded us that credit is a risky business. It is risky for lenders,
of course, but it is risky for borrowers, too. Taking on credit means
mortgaging your future in a large or small way. And none of us can be
certain about the future. Today’s rising casualty rate raises
anxieties about the greater potential for damage in an expanded market

unavailable to the poorest and most vulnerable in our country: the
disadvantaged consumers. They would undoubtedly lose access to the
legal market and be forced into the hands of loan sharks and illegal
lenders whose terms and methods cannot be easily controlled or
monitored. All Governments and consumer groups are concerned that when
it went wrong, the borrowers would be afraid to seek help from the very

empowered by having choice, by having access to that choice, by having
the right information on which to make that choice and by having
safety, equity and redress. Taking away access to a market—in
this case, capping the lending market—is giving a disadvantaged
consumer no choice other than the black market. As I have already said,
capping would mean that the most vulnerable could not make a choice,

Hollick:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend Lord Kennedy of Southwark
for giving the House the opportunity to discuss and debate this
important topic. High-cost lending is a booming business. The demand
for short-term payday loans and longer-term high-interest loans is
being driven by the crushing impact that the very tough economic
climate is having on personal and family budgets. The fall in real
incomes and the above-inflation increases in the price of essentials
such as utilities and food are leaving many people short of the money
they need to make ends meet, so they turn to the payday
lenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000517" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062064000517">The

high-cost lenders, which showed that they had enjoyed a 30% growth in
turnover over 
<?notus-xml column=481?>the last 12 months and were achieving 30% profit margins on that
turnover. Harsh economic circumstances might be the driver of demand,
but the secret of the high profit is the mix of simple and instant loan
availability, lax regulation, the absence of competition and
eye-watering interest rates. Desperate borrowers—and it is
estimated that there could be up to 5 million such
customers—many with poor or no credit histories, can get instant
cash, often without credit checks, documentary evidence or, as the

notably from the United States. The expansion of the payday loans
industry in the US has been curtailed by the growing clampdown on high
interest rates by state regulators, with some states going so far as to
ban payday loans completely. Others, such as Pennsylvania, have capped
interest rates on short-term loans at 30%. Similar initiatives are

vanishingly light regulatory environment here in the UK is a big

expense not only of our most hard-pressed citizens but of our taxpayers

a lucrative market would typically see high levels of competition,
which would benefit borrowers with lower interest rates, but that is
not the case, one reason being the complete absence of the major UK
banks from this market place. That is all the more surprising, since
the one thing that every high-cost borrower must have is a bank account
to receive the money borrowed and to pay the interest and repay
the principal by direct debit or similar arrangement. The
millions of payday borrowers are all existing customers of our major
banks, with known financial profiles and transaction histories. Yet the
banks have failed to provide small loans to their existing creditworthy
customers on terms that would almost certainly be substantially less
expensive to the borrower than those currently available while being
very profitable to the bank itself. To compound this failure and add
insult to injury, it is reported and widely understood that the banks
actually downgrade the credit rating of customers who take out payday

of England, loans to SMEs have shrunk in each of the last
three years, and loans to individuals are difficult to obtain and often
prohibitively complex. Although the banks do not lend to their existing
hard-pressed customers, they are happy to participate in this lucrative
market by providing funds directly to the high-cost lenders. The Royal
Bank of Scotland and Barclays have lent substantial sums to a range
of payday lenders that are often secured on the very loans
made by these lenders to the customers of the very bank providing the

want to end on a happier note. Not all high-cost lending is actually
high cost. Indeed, if you are the right borrower, the terms can be very
attractive. An example of this is the Arbuthnot Banking Group, which
owns high-cost lender Everyday Loans, which typically charges between
50% and 200%
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:55:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:54:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:54:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, Arbuthnot has made a loan facility of £5
million to the Conservative Party at the very attractive rate of 3.5%.
I have no doubt that all the appropriate steps were taken by Arbuthnot
to satisfy itself as to the credit worthiness of the Conservative
Party. Then again, it probably helps that Arbuthnot is run by
Mr Angest, a former Conservative Party treasurer and major

However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:55:40"></hs_TimeCode>, I will

those who call for a cap on payday lending. It may mean that we first

play a very important part in trying to provide an alternative, as do
the co-operative banks and the mutuals. For all of them it is quite
difficult, because they cannot put the kind of spend into sexy
advertising and affectionate granny puppets that payday lenders can.

will talk about another area where I think we have been
missing a trick, and I take my example from the United States. It is
the concept of community development finance institutions. There are
relatively few of these in the UK, but in the US they are common.
Indeed, many of the states that are now capping payday lenders are able
to do so because the CDFIs offer the alternative that some in this
Chamber have talked about. CDFIs have a mission to provide financial
products and services to people and communities underserved by
traditional financial markets. They are sometimes banks, sometimes
credit unions, sometimes loan funds and sometimes venture capital
funds. Indeed, they account for a lot of the early start-up capital for
new businesses in the US.</hs_para>

it is their commitment to distressed communities that sets them apart.
For example, while a traditional credit union serves its members, a
community development credit union is specifically targeted at a
disadvantaged community. CDFIs
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:58:13"></hs_TimeCode> local
institutions serving their local community, and members of the
community usually serve on the boards. They are typically funded by
outside investors. These could be social investors, who are seeking
either no return or little return in financial terms but are looking
for social and environment return. In the United States, they are
frequently able to access capital from the Government. However, they
are required, as they function, to be self-sufficient and to operate on
commercial
principles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T17:58:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000531" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062064000531">Your

high-street banks in the UK are actually lending their money and what
types of loans they are making, be they small business loans, mortgages
or unsecured loans. We will know it by bank and by postcode once a
voluntary agreement, which is now in negotiation, is completed between
the Treasury and the banks. We hope that the first data disclosures
will be available before the year end. As noble Lords will remember,
the Government promised to get this disclosure after the issue was
forcefully raised in this House through proposed amendments to the
Financial Services Bill. The Government promised this House that, if
such a disclosure agreement could not be reached voluntarily, it would
be mandated through an amendment to the banking reform Bill.

data should tell us whether the high-street banks are neglecting
communities and, if so, which communities they are and where they are.
If we identify vacuums, it strikes me that they will be the perfect
space into which to introduce CDFIs. In the US, major banks that fail
to lend in areas where they take deposits can, as it were, amend the
situation by investing in a CDFI to do the job which they, the
high-street banks, are reluctant or not equipped to do. That seems to
be very right, as at least a part of banking is surely a utility
service, and that can be recognised in the terms of the banking
licence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062064000533" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062064000533">I
anticipate that local authorities, charities and social enterprises

know-how from the major banks. As I said before, a growing breed of

environmental returns for their money. This is a way for them to begin
to participate in this kind of benefit to disadvantaged communities. I

CDFI world in the United States has assets under management exceeding
$30 billion. It is a massive sector, stretched across the country. In
the UK, we have just a scattering of institutions. However, they lent

ground, and they had some 33,000 customers. Many of those customers
were social ventures but they were also micro-businesses and
individuals. So far, they have been helped to the tune of some
£60 million by the regional growth fund. The
high-street banks have agreed in principle to refer to the CDFIs small
businesses whose loan applications they have rejected, although I do
not think that the referral system is working terribly well at the
moment. However, there is the beginning of a relationship and a network
between the existing banks, the major banks and the existing CDFIs, and
we can start to build on that. It is crucial that we find ways to bring
disadvantaged communities into the economic mainstream, as that will
enable people to empower themselves in their lives and contribute to
the

period of banking reform that we are going through at the moment comes
together with new regulators, who have a new attitude. Both the FCA and

unheard of in the past. All these things have created a window of
opportunity. However, if we do not seize that window and try to make
sure that over the coming years we create the necessary network to
provide banking services and credit to all the communities in our
country, we will lose it, because there are plenty of naysayers who are
happy to write off both disadvantaged individuals and disadvantaged

incentives and other mechanisms to boost investment in these bodies. If
we find from data disclosure that the high-street banks are essentially
neglecting certain communities, it seems to me that the moral case is
made for those banks to step in voluntarily, support CDFIs and make
sure that no one falls through the cracks. If they will not do it

caps. I very rarely dare to disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady
Wilcox, but on this occasion I will take my life in my hands. A cap
does not mean 25% or 30%. It is not any figure. The Financial Services
Act provides for a study of the consequences of a cap to be looked at
and then for the cap to be brought in at an appropriate level. Caps are
needed at a sensible level that does not choke off supply and send
people into the hands of loan sharks. I have seen the effect of that
when working in Toxteth. Caps are there to prevent usurious lending.
The noble Baroness said that caps should not be introduced at any
price. The trouble is that the interest rates are at any price,
typically more than 2,500% on an annual basis. We need to look at
reasonable limits that cut out legal usury from our high

few and far between. My own group, the church, can play a part in the
development of credit unions up and down the country. There is a role
to be played by local institutions. We have, so to speak, branches in
every community—16,000 branches in 9,000 communities, even more
than the banks. If we wish to see the development of alternatives to
payday lenders in all communities, we must use all the institutions in
all communities—churches, post offices, and even, if I dare say
so in the presence of the Government, the Co-op. The Post Office is an

Glasman:</Member></B> My Lords, I echo the sentiments of gratitude to
my noble friend Lord Kennedy for initiating this debate and for his
work over many years. He knows the realities and speaks plainly about
them. It is also a tremendous honour to follow the most reverend
Primate. I believe that the last archbishop to take a very strong
stance against usury was Archbishop Laud and I say to the noble
Baroness, Lady Wilcox, that we know what happened to him. I consider it
a tremendous act of courage to stand in favour of the cap. It is an
interesting story: the church resisted the increasing demands, but in
the end, in the time of the Long Parliament, it was decided that
politics should have no role in the setting of interest rates. It is
wonderful that the voice of the church, Catholic and reformed, is heard
once more<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T18:14:23"></hs_TimeCode> on
this issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000002">I
declare an interest: I worked for many years for London Citizens and
the Industrial Areas Foundation. The noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, spoke
excellently about the community development funds. An aspect that may
be of interest to the Government is that the seed money was provided by
President Nixon. It is not the case that Conservative Governments are
hostile to the conditions of the urban poor. The interesting thing was
that the initial seed money was £9 million. The assets of the
urban development funds, looked at as a mixture of venture capital,
urban development and loans, are now well over £1 billion. I
have worked with them and looked closely at that in terms of Baltimore,
and the effects that this has had
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000003">That is
very inspiring, but we have nothing like it. We have no such framework;
no initiatives have been taken. This speaks to the heart of the issue.
I here put my head on the block in relation once more to what the noble
Baroness, Lady Wilcox, said. My noble friend Lord Hollick spoke about
Barclays: it made a loan of £120 million to the Money Shop six
weeks before Christmas. I believe that the rate was 7%. The rate that
was lent at to people was 4,000%, and now Barclays discriminates
against its own customers and 
<?notus-xml column=488?>will not give them loans. This is completely out of order. The
conditions of the working poor and the debt in which that they have to
live are, as they say on the 73 bus where I come from, bang out of
order. People cannot find access to money. They do not earn enough;
they cannot find a decent, meaningful and honest way out of the poverty
wages that they receive. Yet there are no new institutions in the
banking sector that address this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000004">I am
involved in a conversation with Salford about establishing a
bank of Salford, working on the credit unions. An interesting addition
to the suggestions made, which the Government should look into, is that
if you put the payroll through the new institutions of local government
or city governance, it transforms the financial status of those
institutions, and suddenly they are able to lend. That is one important
issue. We need to notice that there has been no innovation in
institutions relating to the banking
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000005">We
must go back to 2008 and assert sadly that none of us is innocent.
Between 1997 and 2007, of the £1.6 trillion invested
in the British economy, 81% was in mortgages and financial products.
Family and personal debt exploded. People cannot find a way out of that
debt. It is not outlandish to say, as we did in 2008, that 5% of the
bailout should be used to establish regional banks, as part of this
story. Why is quantitative easing going through the same failed banking
institutions that are refusing to lend to local businesses and the
working poor? It is important to stress that the overwhelming loans
owed to these payday lenders are not from those on benefits. They are
from working people who do not earn enough and cannot discharge their
fundamental responsibilities to their loved ones and their absolute
obligations to pay their taxes and rates. Overwhelmingly, the money
goes on
food.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000006">I
conclude by saying another thank you. This is the most fundamental
issue that we face. Debt is exploding. We have not moved to
value—we still have debt. We need to look at community
development funds and the decentralised way in which they work, and the
way in which they are controlled by local people. I worked with the
Industrial Areas Foundation. To ease the concerns of the noble
Baroness, Lady Wilcox, let me say that when the interest rate cap was
set in Maryland, because of access to the alternative finance system
there is no evidence that it led unavoidably to loan sharks. That is
not the case. There were alternative financial institutions, and many
were set up by a partnership between churches and local
unions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000007">There
are many creative ways in which we can deal not only with the issue of
the working poor but by which we can reactivate the civic institutions
to a common purpose, which is value. We need to move absolutely from
debt to value in the economic system. We must stop subsidising,
bankrolling and giving all the perverse welfare incentives that we had
to the banking institutions that are not fulfilling their role. We must
create new institutions that have local people’s ownership and
control, people who serve their own interests. This debate is a
wonderful opportunity to investigate the genuine opportunities to bring
some credit to the starving people of our
country.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/7E04D647DB3AB3071314B788D44C4DD5083FC4E2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

me that the Government wanted me to withdraw the amendment the next

to defeat the Government, so why should I withdraw.
“Because”, he told me, “we know you’re

course, the amendment is now law and the FCA’s powers will

to start with. Do the Government accept that it is reasonable for
London buses to be driving around advertising loans that bear an
interest rate of 4,200%? Will the Government state unequivocally that
usurious interest rates are morally wrong and should be made illegal?
Will the Government state emphatically that they will support the FCA

would like to add just one more point before I turn to credit unions.
In previous years loan sharks were very obvious—muscular men,
probably with tattoos on their forearms and oozing menace. Their
companion of choice? A pit bull terrier. Their message was crystal
clear: if you don’t repay on time, you know what will happen.
Today payday lending has become 21st century cool—iPhone apps,
slick websites, high street offices with smiley people and flowers on
the desks. They can disguise it any way they like; the fact is that
they are all loan sharks. Some are legal, some are not, but they all
peddle the same
usury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000018">Fortunately,
some organisations are choosing to distance themselves from these
lenders. I am pleased to say that Bolton Wanderers Football Club no
longer wants to be associated with QuickQuid. Unfortunately others have
not been so responsible. It is a shame that great clubs like Newcastle
United and Blackpool have chosen to be sponsored by Wonga, although
individual players—to their credit—have bravely refused
to wear its logo. Can it be that individual ethical institutions, such
as the Wellcome Trust, are listed as one of Wonga’s
shareholders? Following my noble friend Lord Hollick’s statement
about Mr Angest, I believe that Mr Adrian Beecroft, also a major
shareholder in Wonga, is similarly a major donor to the Conservative
Party. I will say no
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000019">Let us
move on to the alternatives. The noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, has been a
champion of the credit union movement and has spoken eloquently on this

<?notus-xml column=491?>subject a number of times. The combination of the excesses of the
recession and the reduction in government benefits has made life doubly
painful for many people in our society. More than ever it is necessary
to have viable alternatives to legalised loan sharking and payday
lending.</hs_para>

April I saw a vivid example of this. I joined up with the Movement for
Change and the Fair Credit Commission and I went to Kilburn. There I
walked along the high road along with local residents. Today the street
has at least 13 payday lending shops on it. It mirrors the situation in
many other parts of the country. Local residents told me about members
of their community running up unpayable debts. In one instance, a woman
with disabled children told us how she now owed around £3,000.
In another, a man with quite obvious serious learning difficulties told
us how his unpaid bill with Vodafone had been sent to debt collectors
when he was unable to pay. There the payday pattern of interest swung
into effect—the amount outstanding rocketed as massive interest
rates came into play. There are thousands upon thousands of
heart-rending stories like this around the country. Some talk of
suicide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000021">One
of the more positive stories was that of a man who, like his father in
Dublin, had set up a credit union in Kilburn after arriving there as a
teenager. As noble Lords will be aware, the credit union movement in
Ireland is particularly strong, with almost half the population using
their services. It is a vivid example of their potential to expand
here. This is especially needed as historically what credit unions
provide reaches beyond just savings and credit to financial advice,
encouraging a culture of saving. This week Glasgow Council announced
plans to open a credit union account for all children starting
secondary school. It is a particularly interesting step in that
direction.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062091000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000022">This kind of financial
advice contrasts sharply with the growing evidence about how payday
loan companies are operating. Noble Lords will also be aware of the
ministerial statement last week that credit unions are now able to
charge a maximum interest rate of 3% a month, a rate of interest that
strikes me as just about spot on. It bears a stark comparison with the
38% charged by Wonga and others where there is no legal maximum. I hope
that credit unions will be able to offer their services to more people
and to run on a more secure financial footing. I also hope that they
will be able to take advantage of new technology to improve their
provision of low-cost credit to the people who need it. This was
recommended in an ABCUL report on credit unions, and by Gillian Guy, of
Citizens Advice, who wrote an article in the <I>Financial Times</I>
this April which encouraged different providers to use modern
technology to deliver financial support to those who need it. This
leaves me with a thought on how to go forward—why does your

would like to ask the Minister some further questions. Will he confirm
that the Government will continue to support credit unions, and in so
doing carry on the good work of the previous Government? Will the
Government reiterate their previous support for capping interest rates,

some, payday loans can be a way of managing a short-term cash flow

spiralling cost of credit is not the main crux of the problem. Problems
arise when people take out this kind of short-term, high-cost loan when
it is not suitable for them and they cannot afford to repay. As the
strength of the evidence shows, part of the issue is, first, that
lenders are not always conducting adequate assessments of potential
borrowers’ ability to afford the loan. This was a key finding of
the OFT’s payday compliance review. Secondly, as the Citizens
Advice payday consumer survey found, there is poor compliance with the
voluntary codes implemented by lenders last November and 82% of loans
did not meet the commitment

the Bristol report found that 60% or more of payday customers felt that
it was too easy to borrow in this way and that more than four in 10
customers showed signs of financial distress. Here I echo the opening
comments of the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, that these reports show that
the payday market is not functioning in the interests of consumers. The
Government are therefore deeply concerned about the scale of consumer
detriment identified, the speed and ease with which loans can be
accessed, the frequency with which loans are rolled over, the grave
financial and social problems arising from defaults, and the calling

the last significant debate on this issue in this House, we have begun
to tackle these problems; my noble friend Lady Wilcox touched on this.
In March, the Government and regulators announced a joint action plan
to tackle the key problems, taking tough enforcement action against
unscrupulous lenders and ensuring a strong robust regulatory framework
for the future. Also since March, the OFT has begun clamping down on
irresponsible lending practices across the payday industry as an
enforcement priority. First, they have given no less 50 firms 12 weeks
each to change their business practices or risk legal requirements or
loss of their licence. Two firms have already surrendered their
licences. Secondly, the OFT has revoked the licences of three payday
lending firms and has three further investigations open. Thirdly, the
OFT has consulted on referring the sector to the Competition Commission
for market investigation and expect to announce a decision
soon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062091000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-0003.htm#13062091000029">A

essence of this debate is the alternatives to payday lending. The
Government have committed to further investment of up to £38
million to March 2015 to support and expand the credit union sector.
Credit unions are community focused, and to this extent touch on the
big society ethos. They are also non-profit making. Members share a
common bond and often save before borrowing. The investment will enable
them to provide financial services, including affordable credit, for up
to 1 million additional consumers on lower incomes. Our ambition is to
save low-income consumers up to £1 billion in total in loan
interest repayments by March

my noble friend Lady Wilcox so eloquently put it, an underlying issue
is that we still have a culture of people wanting and expecting to be
able to buy items on credit when they cannot afford them. Better
financial education, raising awareness and signposting to
sources of advice are key to helping people
understand the alternatives to payday loans. That is why we set up the
Money Advice Service to promote financial capability and to provide the
tools that customers need to make informed decisions about their money.
In 2013-14, the MAS is retaining its spending on debt advice provision

short-term loans—a point that we might all be aware of. The risk
premium is high and the costs associated with lending to high-risk
customers and giving them small-value loans are such that it is not

She said that it would push the poorest and most vulnerable into having
no access to credit at all. I thank my noble friend for giving an
interesting historical perspective on the credit market and agree with
her that a cap is not the solution for the payday market at this time.
The Bristol report indicated a range of unintended consequences and
risks which would harm customers rather than help them, such as a
reduction of access to credit, lending charges being added outside the
cap and, generally, less sympathy for those in financial difficulty.
However, the Government have ensured that the FCA will have the power
to cap in the future, if it is needed to protect consumers at that

apprenticeships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000009">The
final truth, which I want to focus on, is that of character and
resilience, something the All-Party Parliamentary Group saw as the
missing link in the chain. Character and resilience are somewhat
amorphous terms, which some might choose to dismiss as fluffy or
cosmetic soft skills. In fact, the very term “soft
skills” strikes me as something of a misnomer. Far from being
fluffy, developing character and resilience is about developing the
fundamental drive, tenacity and perseverance needed to make the most of
opportunities and to succeed in life, whatever the obstacles. It is
about self-esteem, self-discipline, aspiration and expectation. In
everyday language, it is about believing you can achieve, understanding
the relationship between effort and reward, sticking with the task at
hand and bouncing back from the knocks that life inevitably
involves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000010">Recent
survey evidence from the Prince’s Trust tells us that young
people from affluent backgrounds are more likely to be told by their
family that they can achieve anything, and that one in four young
people from poorer backgrounds felt that people like them do not
succeed in life; if they have, for example, failed an exam or been
turned down for a job, they are more likely to feel that they have
already failed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:05:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is also a growing body of evidence showing the link between
developing the social and emotional skills and doing well academically
and in the workplace. Research by the IPPR indicates that personal and
social skills have become 33 times more important in determining life
chances, while soft skills have become 10 times more important in
determining future incomes in a single generation. Paul Tough’s
recent book, <I>How Children Succeed</I><I>,</I> also illustrates the
ways in which character skills contribute to cognitive ability along
with the American Nobel prize-winning economist James Heckman, who
found that character traits are just as 
<?notus-xml column=141?>predictive of academic or job success as more traditional cognitive
skills and, indeed, that the two are very much
linked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:05:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

from all this research is the evidence that these character or
personality traits are not innate. They can be taught and developed
through life. Heckman has shown that investing early in these skills,
particularly with disadvantaged children, generates strong economic
returns. Looking exclusively at earning gains, returns to cash invested
can be seen to be as high as 15% to17%. These so-called “soft
skills” can lead to hard
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:06:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

evidence, the All-Party Parliamentary Group, with generous support from
the Open University, hosted a character and resilience summit earlier
this year. Whether hearing from Tony Little, the headmaster of Eton, on
how he teaches his pupils about dealing with failure, or Camila
Batmanghelidjh, the founder of Kids Company, about working with some of
the most deeply traumatised children in the country to rebuild their
basic self-worth and faith in life, the summit confirmed to me that,
for those who care about social justice, developing character and
resilience is essential. As Alan Milburn, chair of the Social Mobility
Commission, who was present on the day, emphasised, it is not ability
that is unevenly distributed, it is opportunity. In order to overcome
this disparity, what he describes as the “Berlin Wall”
between state and private sector schools needs to be broken
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:07:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

great work going on in state schools, too, with examples of
volunteering in the local community, outdoor activities which put
pupils outside their comfort zone to develop their resilience and a
really wide range of imaginative extracurricular activities. Indeed, we

business and that, for employers, these less tangible skills of
sticking at it, not giving up, empathy and teamwork are precisely what
they are looking for in potential
recruits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Overall, the message that we heard from academics, head teachers,
employers and charity leaders alike is that, whatever qualifications

Governments’ efforts to narrow the gaps between the rich and the
poor have largely focused on exam results. However, as the stark trends
I outlined earlier show, just more of the same will not be enough. It
is necessary, but it is not sufficient. That is why I call on the
Government today to take more account of this growing evidence

offer. More could be done in early years, working with health visitors
and children’s centres, linked to the expansion of free early
years education. To break down that so-called “Berlin
Wall” between the state and independent sector schools,
practical incentives are needed to encourage sharing of approaches and
good practice. I would like to see schools being able to allocate
greater space in the state curriculum for volunteering, sports, drama
and music to help to bridge the gap, as well as using PSHE and 
<?notus-xml column=142?>citizenship to the full. I would particularly like to see the pupil
premium being used directly to develop character and resilience and the
identification and spread of good practice. Teacher training should
include models for effective teaching of character and resilience.
Because we all know what really drives behaviour in schools, I would
like to see the Ofsted framework developed to include the importance of
character and resilience to learning outcomes, and that reports and
inspections say how effectively this is being addressed.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>These are just
ideas, but I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that these
and other ideas will be taken seriously as policy is

why this matters so much when in economic terms the case is clear.
Studies suggest that reaching international benchmarks on social
mobility could be worth around £150 billion a year in the UK, or
the equivalent of a one-off increase in GDP of 4%. However, socially
and morally the case is overwhelming. Someone who has
overcome disadvantage, persevered in the face of adversity, and shown
real strength of character is surely the one who deserves the
opportunity to succeed and share in the rewards that society has to
offer. Surely that is what a just society is all about.</hs_para>

Perry of Southwark:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this debate and I
congratulate my noble friend on her excellent speech. Most
particularly, I welcome her emphasis on character and resilience as
factors in any individual’s prospects. Although Governments have
a role in ensuring that any barriers to mobility are removed and that
opportunity is open to all, no Government can determine how any
individual will live his or her life. Upward mobility comes from
individuals grasping opportunities, working hard against the odds,
leaping over barriers, setting themselves high goals, and often
swimming against the stream of their own community and background.
These things are done through character and

in personal terms, today I want to illustrate why I believe so strongly
in the response of individuals to opportunity by telling a personal
story. I am immensely proud of the women of my family across three
generations before me. My great-grandmother, the first of the three,
was a working-class girl from Sunderland. She was widowed while still a
young woman and was left, as I understand it, almost destitute. Too
proud to seek charity, she turned her hand to taking in washing to
support her family.</hs_para>

this, she was determined that her daughter, my grandmother, would have
an education. Each week she would put a penny of her hard-earned income
into a tin on the mantelpiece to pay the fees for the Dame School her
daughter attended. My grandmother proudly told my sister and me that
although she was only a little girl, she realised both that her mother
could ill afford the weekly fee and that she was needed at home to help
with the huge barrels of washing, which were the family’s
business. Therefore, she told us, she worked really hard to complete
the work for her school leaving examination and graduated, as they say,
at the age of 10 instead of 11. Incidentally, despite the short spell
of 
<?notus-xml column=143?>her education with an unqualified teacher, my grandmother wrote
beautifully in an elegant script with perfect grammar and spelling, and
read newspapers and books voraciously until her death at the age of

women, my grandmother, had clearly inherited the character and
resilience of her mother and was determined that her daughter, my
mother, would have an even better education. Facing up to the
prejudices of her husband, who said, “What’s the point of
education for a girl? She’s going to get married, isn’t
she?”, my grandmother’s fight was with him to ensure that
my musically gifted mother won a scholarship to grammar school, stayed
on for the sixth form, and gained both her teacher’s certificate

low aspiration are removed. This Government are working to do just
that, but ultimately it is people, women and men of determination who

the noble Baroness. Listening to her stories, I commend to her Alan
Johnson’s memoir of his childhood, which tells a similar and
brilliant story. I say at the outset that I have just started working
for Brent Council, chairing a commission on social mobility, which
reflects on the achievement in their schools, which are now
outperforming the national average but with no impact on social
mobility or poverty. The council wants to understand that. That
reflects my interest in community social mobility as much as individual
social mobility. I very much welcome the debate and the way in which it
was introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady
Tyler.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000025">By
happy coincidence, today is also marked by Ofsted publishing its
excellent report, <I>Unseen Children: Access and Achievement 20 Years
On</I>. It is a welcome return by the Chief Inspector of Schools, Sir
Michael Wilshaw, to focus on outcomes for disadvantaged pupils in
England. Ofsted has found that underperformance is no longer dominated
by areas with concentrations of deprivation. There is an explicit
acknowledgement of the success of Labour’s London Challenge, set
up by Stephen Twigg MP and then taken over by the noble Lord, Lord
Adonis, the subsequent Manchester Challenge, overseen by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hughes, and the Black Country Challenge, which I looked
after<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:15:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Those 
<?notus-xml column=144?>challenges used data to shine a light on underperformance and to
identify top-performing leaders who could then support and challenge
those schools and leaders who needed it most. The report therefore
points to the importance of collaboration and to Governments taking a
strategic approach to focus attention where improvement is
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000026">I very

learn from London. If Hackney, Newham and Tower Hamlets can raise
results for free school meal pupils by 20% over five years and be 15%

period, my home county of Dorset managed only a 2% improvement for free
school meals children, remaining 10% below the national average for
those poorer pupils. It is high time that we shook schools in rural and
coastal areas out of any complacency and used data to expose
the underachievement of those who need good education more than

we solve those problems in school, would we solve the problems of
social mobility? Sadly, we need to do more. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Tyler, said, we need to build resilience, to build the capability of
all of us to deal with mistakes, to take risks and to learn from
failure, to celebrate that failure, to have the traditional stiff upper
lip but with empathy. That resilience is being strategically built in
London boroughs such as Newham and Islington at both community and
individual level. Alongside Every Child a Reader and Every Child
Counts, Newham has Every Child a Musician as a programme and, as a
council, has a huge volunteering programme for 7,000 elderly
people. Elsewhere, organisations such as the Transformation Trust and
Future First are doing a great job in offering after-school activity
and state school alumni programmes which mirror some of the success of
the private

build resilience, will that do the trick? Another great obstacle
remains. That is the poverty trap. I cannot see how children can get
the support that they need at home, working with schools, or a richness
of aspiration when they are burdened by acute poverty. Growing numbers
of families, in Devon as much as Durham, are dependent on food banks to
feed their families. The shortage of affordable housing to rent or own
is common across rural and coastal areas and leads to overcrowding and
very difficult study environments for children. Free-school-meal
children need free school meals, but they are being cut. Rising debt
leads to relationship breakdown. All of those features of poverty are
getting worse. We need a welfare state that is not about managing
poverty but more about helping people get out of poverty.</hs_para>

mobility. I was particularly struck by the commonsense definition of
social mobility: the extent to which where you end up in terms of
social class is different from where you started. It pointed out that
that means that sometimes, people go down as well as up. It is also
linked with a sense of happiness and well-being. You need to have
aspirations—this comes out in character and
resilience—and to have aspirations you need to be able to see a
better future for
yourself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000032">I
want to concentrate my remarks on the universities as a key determinant
of later opportunities. Great strides have been made in widening
participation over the last two decades. For those in the
socio-economic bracket of the lowest 20%, the difference in
participation has gone from 9% in 2004 to 14% in 2011-12, which is very
significant. For the bottom two quintiles it is now up to almost 20%,
but that compares to 45% for the top quintile. It is therefore
interesting that whereas the introduction of tuition fees has seen a 2%
to 3% fall-off in application rates from the top quintile, this is not
true of the bottom quintile. Those in the lower socio-economic brackets
have actually maintained their participation rates rather than falling
off. Equally, it is still three times more likely that if you come from
the top economic group, you will go to university—and
disproportionately so if you go to a private rather than a state
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000033">The
publication earlier this week of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty
Commission’s <I>Fair Access Challenge</I> in relation to
universities, which reprised a report that it published last year,
reminds us that while the general feeling in relation to universities
is positive from the lower socio-economic groups, in the top Russell
group universities the participation from those bottom groups is far
lower, and fell during that same period of 2004 to 2012. Much of this,
as the <I>Seven</I><I> Key Truths</I> report makes clear, is because
state school pupils do not achieve the required entry grades. This is
why it is so important to improve the quality of teaching and teachers
in state schools. As the noble Lord, Lord Knight, indicated, this is
possible. The position of the London boroughs shows so well what can be
achieved.</hs_para>

is that there are still something like 3,700 or so young people who
achieve the required grades but do not apply. This suggests that the
widening participation message is not reaching them or, perhaps more
significantly, their teachers. The message to the Government from this
is that we most not relax the widening participation agenda, whether it
is through pressure from OFFA or HEFCE’s funding towards
widening participation.</hs_para>

two very important issues. First, on information, advice and guidance,
there has been an almost complete collapse of careers education in
schools and it is absolutely vital that young people get good and
relevant advice. Secondly, the national scholarship programme needs
reform. Most of the funding for this comes from the universities
themselves, some of which use it for fee remission and fee waivers.
Research has shown that this is much less effective than such things as
supporting summer schools and outreach programmes. We need to be much
smarter in using this money.</hs_para>

Northbourne:</Member></B> My Lords, in the time available I shall
attempt to make only one point. There is no doubt in my mind that
upward social mobility in our society—funnily, nobody ever
speaks about downward social mobility—can be unfair to
individuals and a lack of it can impoverish society. In spite of the
withering critique by Civitas in the report that was published for this
debate, I still believe that there is an extraordinarily strong case
for encouraging upward social mobility. Like other noble Lords who have
spoken, the Sutton Trust focused on the link between poverty and lack
of social mobility. I recognise that that is extremely important, but
we should by no means be perceiving it as the only cause or problem.
There are other causes. The Government have done a lot to intervene and

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to remind us of the
context that a number of us have mentioned. Since the mid-1970s, there
has been an increasing gap between those at the top and those at the
bottom. That is the pole that we are talking about in terms of social
mobility. We have three big groups now: those who are doing well; those
who are surviving; and those who are dropping below the
radar—that is the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Knight,
about the poverty
trap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000044">As
other noble Lords have mentioned, social mobility between those poles
implies the reality that some people are going down. I want to focus on
that briefly, alongside the proper aspiration to help people go up.
People will always be going down as well as up. If the measure is an
economic and occupational one, we will struggle. We need
other measures really to go for what I would call social inclusion. We
should not talk about social mobility without talking about social
inclusion, so that we reach out to those who are going
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:28:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000045">We
know how easy it is for people to fall out of being included. There are
emphases on particular skills or educational models which some people
cannot access. We have a winner-take-all mentality, so we discard
people quite easily. Sadly, the media and public attitudes are quite
harsh towards those who are poor and in the poverty trap. There is a
great deficit of compassion in our society. That is why the linking of
this with character and resilience is so important. That is where we
can be inclusive socially, whatever is happening economically or
occupationally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:29:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000046">It
was very inspiring to hear the family story of the noble Baroness, Lady
Perry because resilience and character are not individual things; they
are relational. One of the things that must be part of this mix is
government doing all it can with others to support resilient
families—like that of the noble Baroness—so that that can

to give two brief examples from my own context. I am the Bishop of
Derby, and Derby College works with the Prince’s Trust Team
Programme. I have had contact with and heard the stories of people with
Asperger’s syndrome, dyslexia, impaired vision or family
breakdown—all the factors that get someone down and put them out
of the loop. Through simple mentoring programmes and plenty of
encouragement, character and resilience is built up, and there are many
inspiring stories of people getting back into the

situated right in the middle of Derby. It is all about jobs, education

mentoring and work experience that is available through engaging with
this scheme, on average  
<?notus-xml column=148?>these youngsters’ exam grades go up fourfold. Simple things being

to make is that character and resilience are not important simply so
that someone can be more economically active; more important, they are
the stuff of citizenship. We need the FE sector and charities like JET

number of questions for the Minister. Will he comment on the issue of
social inclusion for those who are pushed downwards by the fact of
social mobility? Could he also comment on the role of FE colleges and
voluntary sector organisations in this? How can the Government support
the formation of resilient families? Lastly, as young people build
character, how can they develop a portfolio that they can carry around
with them to show employers in the same way they show their exam
results? How can we help young people to demonstrate that they are team
players and are willing to turn up regularly? How can they show that
they are characterful and resilient citizens? We need some kind of
award, which would be a way of accepting and applauding the development
of those
skills.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/BDFC51E4B7EA1FA6DD4943B142A1A91B0D5889EC" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</Member></B> My Lords, I warmly thank my
noble friend for enabling us to discuss this important issue. I think I
subscribe more to the idea of equality than to that of social mobility
for the reasons that the right reverend Prelate has just set out so
well. It is gone into in depth in the book, <I>The Spirit Level: Why
Equality is Better for Everyone</I>, and pursued by the work of the
Equality Trust. Nevertheless, I recognise that character and resilience
are very important, but perhaps noble Lords will dwell for a moment on
how much character and resilience a child can have if they come to
school without having had any breakfast and with perhaps just a Mars
bar for lunch. Obviously, it does not mean that a child will not have
any character, but the fact is that the child’s body will be in
a much less good state for learning.</hs_para>

chairing the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Food and Health. We have
heard from a number of academics over the years about the impact that
diet has on children’s ability to learn and on their life
chances. Many noble Lords have spoken in this debate about the
importance of education, and indeed my noble friend in her excellent
introduction said that it is critical. If children are not able to
learn because their diet is too poor, they are crucially disadvantaged
for their entire life.</hs_para>

can give some specific examples of this, one from Professor Andrew
Scholey, the director of the Human Cognitive Neuroscience unit based at
Northumbria University. The study he presented to our group compared
the cognitive effects in children of two different breakfasts. One had
a high glycaemic load—Coco Pops—and the other a low
glycaemic load—All-Bran, but it could have been porridge. He
found that the low GI breakfast is much more effective in protecting
against a decline 
<?notus-xml column=149?>in performance. Other work on this has been done jointly by Nuffield
College and the University of Essex showing effects on memory and
attention span. Indeed, a survey by the Local Authority Catering
Association found that snack foods that are high in sugar and fat
produce problem behaviour. We can definitely say that a healthy diet
improves children’s behaviour and academic performance. Of
course, if you are badly behaved in school to enough of a degree, you
end up being excluded, at the worst end of the spectrum, or possibly on
Ritalin, because your diet means that you are on a permanent sugar
high. There has also been much national and international research into
the effect of vitamins, minerals and other compounds, such as
amino-acids, on brain chemistry. Among the nutrients known to affect
mood and behaviour are zinc, essential fatty acids, vitamins B5 and B6,
calcium and
magnesium<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:35:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000054">I
am sure that when the family of the noble Baroness, Lady Perry of
Southwark, was going through that tremendous educational attainment,
the diet may have been more basic but would have been more likely to
contain the nutrients I have mentioned than the diet of today’s
children. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:35:50"></hs_TimeCode>So the
first problem is diet. The second problem is the lack of breakfast
clubs. My final question to the Minister is: will he encourage
Sir Michael Wilshaw at Ofsted to address this issue and not
belittle the role of food in
attainment?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13062070000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000152"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:36:08"></hs_TimeCode></I>2.36

Bilimoria:</Member></B> My Lords, the claim that social mobility in
Britain has been falling is made regularly. On the other hand, a lot of
the research on class mobility does not support this. Lots of studies
have found that, if anything, relative class mobility—the
probability of a working-class child getting into the middle class and
a middle-class child ending up working class—has been rising
since the 1950s. There is no question about it, however, there is a
relationship between inequality and earnings elasticity. The Gini
coefficient—a measure of inequality—has been rising over
the last 20 to 30 years, particularly in countries like the United
Kingdom and the United States, but also in Australia and
Canada<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000056">There
is no question that there is a relationship between earnings and the
benefit of going to university. On the other hand, there is a
correlation between higher spending on higher education and higher
levels of mobility. The reality is that we underinvest in higher
education compared to the United States, compared to the EU average and
compared to the OECD average. We do not invest as much in higher
education as we
should<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:37:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000057">Despite
this, however, our universities are doing a good job. Universities UK

Government are aware of a fabulous programme called GEEMA, the Group to
Encourage Ethnic Minority Applications, at the University of Cambridge

programme whereby the ethnic minority undergraduates at Cambridge take
a week off during the summer and state school children from 
<?notus-xml column=150?>ethnic minority backgrounds, whose families invariably have never had a
background of education in their history, come to spend a week in
Cambridge and experience a week in the life of Cambridge University.
This programme has a phenomenal effect on creating aspiration among
these children, many of whom end up going to Cambridge itself. The
programme has helped increase the number of BME undergraduates from
5.5% to 15%. Could the Government roll out this sort of programme in
more universities around the country?</hs_para>

thank the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, for leading this debate. She
spoke about character and resilience. The headmaster of Eton College,
Tony Little—and I declare an interest; my older son is
there—has noted that boarding schools are the nation’s
untapped asset. He has said that children learn more from each other
than from adults. They learn more from outside the classroom than from
within. There are so many ways in which we can learn from schools in
the private sector—as the noble Baroness said they make up 7% of
the total and they produce so much excellence—but unfortunately
they are not available to
everybody.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000060">I
conclude by saying that I have seen with my own eyes the change in this
country from when I came as a student in the early 1980s, when there
was no aspiration but there was a glass ceiling. That glass ceiling has
now been shattered and there is the ability in this country for anyone
to get anywhere, regardless of race, religion or background. That

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a great but very short
debate. I am so sorry that I have only four minutes in which to
respond, so I cannot possibly comment on the many wonderful speeches.
However, there was some clear consensus around the Committee today.
First, we all think that social mobility is good. We must also
acknowledge that if we allow inequality to continue at the current
level, it is inevitable that social mobility will require some people
to go down as well as up, and perhaps go down quite a long way. Perhaps
I can tempt the Minister to depart from his brief briefly and look at
the way that someone like John Rawls might have encouraged us to think
about the circumstances in which, given a choice of an equal or an
unequal society, but with no way of knowing where we might end up in
the distribution, most of us would come down firmly in favour of a more
equal society. What might that tell us here?</hs_para>

exception of the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, there was also a
recognition that social mobility is in trouble in Britain. After my
first 
<?notus-xml column=151?>visit to the United States, I came away both impressed and shocked,
feeling that I had come across a country which had very low social
mobility but believed passionately in very high social
mobility—hence the American dream. As my right honourable friend
Ed Miliband said in a speech last year on this subject, the reality is
that if you want the American dream, go to Finland. One of the
challenges we have in Britain is that our social mobility is pretty
poor by OECD standards, and slowing. We therefore have a problem; so
what do we do?</hs_para>

agreed that education is crucial. I will not repeat the many
interesting ideas that have been put forward there. Most of us would
agree that early intervention is also crucial. The previous Labour
Government were very committed to this, as I am sure noble Lords will
accept. We created Sure Start and invested in thousands of
children’s centres. We also provided support for early years
education and for disadvantaged pupils, and the attainment gap narrowed
as a result. I worry about some of the changes in recent years. I am
concerned at moves such as the scrapping of education maintenance
allowance and the closure of children’s centres, and what that
might mean down the track for opportunity.</hs_para>

both my noble friend Lord Knight of Weymouth and the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Derby draw attention to some of the really severe
barriers at the bottom where, with the best will in the world and even
with lots of character, there are some pretty huge hurdles to overcome
if one does not even get enough to eat, never mind having the kind of
support comes in other homes. That point was also made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Miller. I, too, was hugely impressed at the great
lineage that has produced the noble Baroness, Lady Perry. That clearly
explains why we see such a force of nature here among us
today.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062070000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000066">I was
also very interested to hear about the question of character because,
aside from all the other questions, character and resilience are
clearly important. I did a stint on the Riots, Communities and Victims
Panel, which was set up to look into the 2011 riots. One thing we found
was clear evidence that as well as enabling young people to take
advantage of opportunities, character and resilience could mean that
when a split-second moment of crisis came and someone had to make a
choice that could be life changing, they would be enabled to make a
good choice at that moment and not a bad one. It has real benefits both
ways round. Given the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler,
to whose work and that of her All-Party Parliamentary Group I pay
tribute, about the formation of character being as important—if
not more important—than the acquisition of knowledge or other
things, do the Government feel that that is reflected in their approach
to the curriculum? I would be interested in the Minister's response on
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062070000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000067">I am
with the right reverend prelate the Bishop of Derby on this: we need to
be quite careful of being overly utilitarian. If we want to invest in
character in order to get certain results, there is a slight danger
that that is like trying to become happy, when it is by doing other
things that one becomes happy. In that respect, 
<?notus-xml column=152?>in preparing for this debate I looked at various sources, including the
Lexmond and Reeves 2009 report for Demos. I was childishly thrilled to
find that they began with Aristotelian ethics. It was a fascinating
notion. When Aristotle wrote about ethics, he was trying to set out the
ways in which people could become better or pursue the good. However,
they also told us that the closest translation of ta ethika was not, in
fact, “ethics” but “matters to do with
character”. In other words, character represents a set of life
skills, not a moral disposition.</hs_para>

quite exciting, I would suggest. It takes us to a view of character as
a shorthand for a set of personal capabilities that research shows to
be linked to a range of interesting positive outcomes. The report
describes it as well-being. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Derby said, that needs to be understood as well-being in its broadest
and deepest sense of human flourishing. If we have people who are
flourishing, we will find people who are more likely to succeed, make
the right decisions at crisis points, do better in exams and get more
fulfilling jobs, but they would also be better people and would build a
better society. That is the prize really worth

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, we have had a really good
Moses Room debate. As I have experienced on several occasions, it is
something like an academic seminar, from which one learns a good deal.
I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, partly because I should have
been reading a lot of this stuff before and she made me read it. We
have had a very interesting and informative debate in which I have to
say that the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, was one of
the most interesting and inspiring. I hope that we will now go away and
start arguing about this more actively in our parties and groups to
take it
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000070">I
have a speech with a whole range of statistics on what the Government
are doing about social mobility, but I want to concentrate on character
and resilience, which is the bit that has not been as emphasised in
dealing with social mobility as it should have

was originally a bit of a cynic about the big society, the national
citizen service and community organisers, until I went to see a
national citizen service scheme in Bradford last summer and spent a
long afternoon with children from what I know to be some of the
roughest schools in Bradford, when I was asked to teach them how to
give a speech. It was fascinating, because I realised that I was
dealing with people who thought that they could not do things, that
they could never stand up in front of others and perform. I managed to
persuade three of them to do so. I began to see that that course gives
you that much more confidence to believe that you can do things which
before you thought that you could not. I am now a strong proponent of
national citizen service. We are expanding its coverage this summer. Of
course, it is only one of the many elements that we need, but it is
giving children at different levels more opportunity to realise:
“I can do that”. It teaches them how to volunteer and to
take part in community activities. That is exactly the sort of thing
that
helps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:47:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=153?><hs_para UID="13062070000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000072">Similarly with the
community organisers’ scheme. In Yorkshire, I see the problems
of social mobility most of all in the big, almost entirely white
estates in Bradford and Leeds—and occasionally in Sheffield and
Hull. There is very high unemployment, a lot of intergenerational
unemployment and a deep sense of grievance that the local authority
does not look after them, but they do not actually look after
themselves very much. There is a high incidence of Staffordshire bull
terriers. There is a sense that nothing much is being done for them.
The community organisers’ scheme tries to get them back into the
habit of thinking that they could do some things for themselves with
themselves, the local authority and local voluntary organisations. That
is how you start to rebuild a community, because, as the right reverend
Prelate said, the collapse of local community is part of the
problem here. Your nonconformist church, your established church or
whatever gave you a lot of those skills as you grew up within it.
Sunday schools were not just about learning the number of books in the
Old Testament, there were a lot of other things as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:48:47"></hs_TimeCode>. That part
of what the Government are doing is useful.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062070000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000073">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:49:32"></hs_TimeCode>
declare an interest. For the past seven years, I have been chair of a
musical charity. I was bounced into it by some young men who have been
choristers at Westminster Abbey a long time after me, who decided that
they were going to set up not only a choir but something that would
bring music into primary schools. Two weeks ago, as they took over a
church in the City of London, the right reverend Prelate Bishop of
London and I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>
watched the Hackney Youth Children’s Choir performing. Evidently
from their clothing, they were children from deprived backgrounds,
standing up and performing in front of us and really enjoying
themselves and therefore getting a sense that they can do
things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000074">I
believe that music in schools, as well as sport and getting people out
learning to volunteer, is a very important part of building
self-confidence. One of the reasons why the Parliament Choir is so good
is that music teaches you two of the basic political skills: one,
standing up in front of other people; and two, projecting your voice.
Of course, that suggests that not everything we do on character and
resilience needs to be done by government, let alone central
government. A lot of this can be done by volunteers, by
non-governmental organisations and by government—locally and
centrally—and civil society working
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000075">A
number of people have talked about early years and talking to small
children. I have another personal interest in that I watch my
two-and-a-half year-old grandson and am deeply conscious that the
amount you talk to a small child comes right back at you over the
months, and that those whose parents do not talk to them are a long way
behind by the time they are three. In spite of the attacks in the
<I>Daily Mail</I>, I am strongly in favour of local authorities and
voluntary organisations providing parenting class incentives,
explaining to young parents in particular what they can do for their
children before they go to school, such as breakfast clubs and
children’s centres. My figures suggest that actually the
reduction in the number of children’s centres has been extremely
small in the past two or three years. There has been a certain amount
of 
<?notus-xml column=154?>merging and so on. We all recognise that this is a very
important part of the mix of things that we need to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000076">Moving on
to what one does in the later years, I find it very depressing as I go
around Yorkshire and ask people in pubs, restaurants and hotels why
they employ so many Poles, Slovaks, Lithuanians and so on, and the
answer is almost always, “Because they turn up for work on time,
they do not take sick leave, they dress smartly and they want to get
on”. Unfortunately, the children from these big inner-city
estates tend to take a lot of sickies and often do not really want to
work the hours that they would have to. We should be motivating them to
think, “Actually, this is quite fun” and that living in
Upper Wharfedale or wherever it may for a bit might be also quite fun.
It is not just a matter of forcing people to work and showing them what
they can do but showing them that they can follow their own careers and
that work cheers you
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000077">The noble
Lord, Lord Knight, asked how we get people out of poverty. The best way
to get people out of poverty is to get them into work—I think we
all agree—and that is partly where character and resilience are
needed to motivate all these people who are growing up, sitting around
and complaining. I am conscious that I am caricaturing a
little—but not very much. I have a vivid memory of an afternoon
in Armley jail in Leeds talking to the “popos”—the
persistent and prolific offenders—and thinking that these people
actually had the talent to do things if they had only been directed and
encouraged in the right
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000078">A number
of other points have been made about state schools and public schools.
The question of public benefit is clearly one that we need to revisit.
I know that a number of public schools are sharing their excellent
facilities with local state schools. That needs to be encouraged. It is
something that they should be doing on their own anyway. They can
certainly help with volunteering and getting out in local communities,
and that is something that we should be taking a good deal
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000079">Universities
and access were mentioned. Again, I have an interest to declare. When I
taught at the University of Oxford, every year I used to take children
from sixth forms in Wandsworth around Oxford. It was a disillusioning
experience, I have to say. I did it because my children were at state
schools in Wandsworth. The culture clash between many of the
working-class children from Wandsworth and the admissions tutors at
Oxford colleges was sometimes far too wide to be able to bridge. It is
excellent that the Sutton Trust and others are doing a great deal with
summer schools and access programmes. Partly re-educating the
admissions tutors is a road we need to go
down.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000080">Apprenticeships
help a great deal, particularly as we move towards keeping people in
school until 17 and 18 and discouraging people from dropping
out of education altogether. Giving people practical and directed work
experience with apprenticeships is highly desirable. The number of
apprenticeships has been rising over the past two years and we wish to
take it a good deal further. Volunteering of all sorts—the Girl
Guides, the Woodcraft Folk and all those other things—used to
provide opportunities for this. We have to build that 
<?notus-xml column=155?>back in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:54:51"></hs_TimeCode>. As has
also been said, this is all part of citizenship. It is not an accident
that those big, working-class estates only provide a 15% turnout at
local elections and about 25% at general elections. They feel
completely disengaged, so we need to rebuild the local community for
all these activities.</hs_para>

have heard about a wider range of issues from my noble friend Lady
Miller, the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, and the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Derby on a more equal society and moral climate,
which go wider than we can go on this occasion. We recognise that part
of what went wrong over the past 25 years has been that we have become
a much more atomised society, which valued wealth for its own sake and
in which inequality has risen. Part of the argument that we all need to
be making about taxation, personal reward and what companies and banks
pay is that a society which is too unequal becomes a society which is
very difficult to hold together. One loses a sense of common interest
and community, locally, regionally and nationally. The banking
commission hints at that in one or two places, but does not quite get
sufficiently explicit on it; that sounds to me like a good role for the
Church of England to take further in its contribution to the public
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T14:56:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000082">Having
made those comments as a wind-up to this seminar, I thank again my
noble friend Lady Tyler for introducing this subject and for

seeing what it produces from now on. I know that the Deputy Prime
Minister and others are actively interested in the work of this group.

areas. There is no single factor but a whole host of factors that come

Parnassian beauty of this debate is that everybody more or less has the
same time—nine minutes for every speaker, I think—as a
result of our modest but high-quality list, including my old friend
from the City, the noble Lord, Lord Flight. We changed the phraseology
of the Question because I did not want the old Question concerning the
City of London to obscure the obvious reality that there are many
financial institutions elsewhere in the UK, from the West End of London
to Edinburgh and other great cities. That is a fact of
decentralisation, which is also a good
thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000088">The
overall background is also the vital factor of our membership of the
European Union, and I am inevitably going to cover some points about
Europe. Membership of the EU is crucial for Britain and I think that
the madness of leaving is dawning more and more on sensible people,
even some of the more old-fashioned of our colleagues represented by an
uncomfortably large group of rather right-wing Tory MPs in the other
place. The latest House of Commons Foreign Affairs Select Committee
report spells it out loud and clear, although it wisely steers clear of
the immaturities implicit in hysterical referendumitis. I welcome the
elegant but firm rap on the knuckles for inexperienced British
Ministers set out in paragraphs 26, 27 and 28 of the
committee’s conclusions and recommendations. I also welcome the
bulk, but not all, of the evidence given to the committee by Business
for New Europe, which sets out a solid enthusiasm for our continuing
membership of the EU for practical
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000089">I

including assisting the general public in myriad ways with practical

balance is also needed between excessive adulation of the City, which

references to this in the debate that I opened in Grand Committee on 22
April on the dangers of UK isolation in Europe, col. GC 290, in the
last but two paragraphs at the end of my speech, caught that balance.
We also need to grasp the fact

I detect that some of the right-wing comics that masquerade as

back to the positive aspects of our financial services sector, we can
indeed be proud of what has been achieved here over the years on a
secular growth basis. As we know all too vividly, this country usually
has a large and uncomfortable physical trade deficit with most other
advanced countries in the world with the possible exception, depending
on the latest figures, of the United States, which is also a rather
inefficient and heavy importer. Just as Germany is immensely proud of
its industry—particularly its motor vehicle industry, which is
one of the wonders of the world—we admire our own financial
services sector for what it achieves in a non-visible surplus for us in
direct and indirect investments, insurance, shipping and, of course,
banking and fund management
forms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000093">When
government is called on to “protect” a valuable sector, I
trust it will always be in the sense of upholding the single market
rather than seeking artificial propping-up exercises, which would not
be justified. Happily, our present coalition Government have always
upheld the principles of transparency, free and open
markets—with a genuine single market—and robust
competition. The Prime Minister has moved away, thankfully, from calls
for what seemed to be special unilateral privileges, as in the bizarre
antics of December 2011 in Brussels, to asserting rightly the equality
of conditions philosophy. I think that will now persist.</hs_para>

particularly welcome it if my noble friend the Minister could bring us
up to date on government thinking on the eurozone’s proposed
financial transactions tax and our most recent responses, since it
seems to have stalled somewhat as a formal proposal among some inner
core member states. Even if talks resumed soon, I doubt whether it
could commence before 2015-16 at the earliest. I assume meanwhile that
the City of London Corporation is maintaining its strong opposition,

highly integrated with financial markets within other EU members. I

all interest rate derivatives, despite the fallout from the world
crisis in the previous decade—a crisis which, we need to
remember, started in the USA, apart from the Northern Rock debacle of
the previous year. Just as official circles in the UK quite rightly
hammer home the primordial need for the single market 
<?notus-xml column=158?>to develop more deeply in every sphere so that, EU- wide, consumers of
goods and services can benefit from equal conditions in the
theoretically perfect market set-up, so the other member states are
justified in insisting that Britain remains a good member of the club

drawn up to deal with money laundering. The amended text of the savings

it would be reasonable at the current state of play to ponder the
future in a wider sense. I believe that the impact and success of the
British financial services industry will continue, both as a great
national asset and as a solid contributor to the overall strength and
cohesion of the Union’s single market. What is disturbing,
however, is the way in which subtle and sometimes not-so-subtle
elements are creeping into this overall scenario which, particularly at
times of severe socio-economic austerity in many parts of the EU, are
in danger of increasing irredentism and fissiparous pulls among
traditionally friendly allies within the 28, weakening the single
market philosophy. We need to acknowledge that the others really and
profoundly want us to stay as members, but seemingly not at the price
of conceding to us anything other than the normative and steady
moderations of the Union’s acquis, which for them is constant
reform, and most definitely not the old-fashioned notion of reform that
has been expressed in some parts of the other place in recent

in framing sensible policies to appraise what the others think of us.
They were not impressed at us being the odd man out so often in recent

them real support

2008. That is now water under the bridge and it is time for us to work
together. We are taking the lead, I hope, in pursuing the tax evasion

I would just add a reminder. Professor Pauline Schnapper, the leader in
British studies at the Sorbonne Nouvelle University, reminded us
recently that the EU has actually been evolving in a rather British
direction over the past 15 years, showing greater pragmatism and
empiricism alongside enlargement. That should help us even more to shun
isolationism in the coming years. As I believe the euro will remain and
in the future will be an even stronger international currency, I hope
that one day we will regain our nerve and even join the

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I declare my interests as set out
in the register, but which amount to 43 years in the investment
management industry. Although I want to talk specifically about the
initiatives in this year’s Finance Bill, I should say that when
I started my career, I remember someone older than me asking,
“Why on earth are you coming into this? London is too big and it
only services the UK economy. It has lost all its international
business”. He could not have been more wrong. One of the things
that I am proud of over my career has been to see London return to
being the major financial capital of the world, earning somewhere
between £60 billion and £70 billion a year in invisibles
that help to pay for so many of those cheap Chinese imports. Although
the City is certainly subject to criticism, to regulation, and even to
a Government policy that led to the banking crisis, it is an incredibly
valuable asset to this country. For those who say that it is too big, I
would just point to Hong Kong where the financial services industry is
a far larger proportion of the economy, but because it got its
financial regulation and economic policy right, it has never been a
major problem. Rather than contract the City, let us expand other areas
and get its regulation
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:12:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the initiative in this year’s Finance Bill which will set up the
<I>UK investment management strategy</I>, a Treasury paper published

foreign fund management businesses to come to this country. That might
obviously benefit those who work for them, as well as the lawyers,
accountants, regulators and even HMRC because they would provide
another source of income. By the way, I think that the total fund
management industry represents around 1% of GDP, some £12

Luxembourg taking masses of new business which could rightly have come
to London. The Revenue would not accept the argument, and so Luxembourg
emerged with its huge industry of today,

there has been criticism for many years. Secondly, there is a

will not be affected if they are obliged to appoint a UK AIFM. I look
forward to working with TheCityUK and the new Financial Services Trade

constructive proposals which might be politically possible, and I am

the tax front, I remember some 12 years ago when I was seeking to drum
up support for the Conservative Party in the City, one of the major
world banks said to me, “We are totally happy as long as income
tax remains at 40%, as introduced by Prime Minister Blair, and,
secondly, as long as the pension plan arrangements aren’t
interfered with”. Well, sadly, both of those have been lost.
They were then boasting to me about the numbers of staff they
transferred from Paris and Frankfurt to London. Do not forget that
individual tax matters as well as the tax on the operations
themselves.</hs_para>

know that the Government are concerned because probably the largest
fund management group in London has recently started shipping staff and
a lot of its new business off to Luxembourg. I have explored that and
it is really not about the taxation of funds; it is about the taxation
of individuals. In particular, it is about what I think was a very
unwise and aggressive taxation of non-doms relating to their property
ownership, which for many will involve a 7% per annum mansion tax. For
funds and the fund management business, broadly the tax regime over
here is fine; and as corporation tax comes down to 20% for fund
managers it becomes an attractive tax
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000108">Again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:19:44"></hs_TimeCode>
there is some very interesting data here in the Government’s
paper. The volume of funds managed has risen from £2.7 to
£5 trillion in the past six years. Where this paper is slightly
mistaken is that while it initially focuses on the volume of funds
managed in the UK, which is what matters, it also focuses on the
domicile of funds. In fact, managing the funds—irrespective of
where they are domiciled—is where employment and revenues come.
It is much more important to keep the UK an attractive place to manage
funds that are not actually domiciled here. There is a slight error
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000109">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:19:44"></hs_TimeCode>
second mistake is that the paper suggests that the new AIFMD regime may
be good for the UK as it will encourage funds to be domiciled here. I
think it is 
<?notus-xml column=161?>serious bad news for the UK and will lead to a significant loss of
business. It is very expensive and very hasslesome. Anyone who is
managing funds which are not to be marketed to the EEA and EU are going
to move elsewhere and, indeed, are starting to move
elsewhere—predominantly to Singapore and Hong
Kong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000110">I am no
great liker of hedge funds and have never invested a penny in one, but
there is a great misconception in Europe that hedge funds caused the
financial crisis, whereas it was money being easy for too long, bad
regulation and so forth. It was really the banks and not the fund
management industry that led to the trouble. In terms of regulations,
the FSA as it was had become unnecessarily hostile to the fund
management industry. Many reputable businesses said to me that they did
not want to raise their criticisms of certain regulatory initiatives
because they were frightened of retribution. There was a breakdown in
communication. However, in Luxembourg, again, they virtually embrace
you with both arms and offer you all manner of inducement and
attraction if you will come and bring your business to them. I am
pleased that the Treasury is “in discussions” with the
FCA on that
territory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000111">London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:19:44"></hs_TimeCode>
obviously has a huge amount to offer: lots of people with high skills,
a wonderful place to live, wonderfully international and so forth.
However, I think that there is one danger of undermining all these
attractions by an increasing nightmare of regulation. It is not just an
AIFMD; the threat of the transaction tax would be a disaster for London
and the trickle-down effect means often that it would turn out to be at
least 1%. I hope that the Government will go to extreme measures to
stop it happening—although I am hopeful that Merkel wants to
give it up once the election is over We will now have to put up with
EMIR. The Government have done quite well on MiFID II but are still
somewhat protectionist towards third country suppliers. We have ESMA
wanting to take over regulation in this country. Candidly, I have never
known a more exhausting time of masses of excess and useless
regulation, particularly the AIFM report. No one will read it—it
is so voluminous and completely

friend Lord Dykes’s extolling of the situation, the main threat
to the UK fund-management industry is the regulation coming from the
EU. I end by saying that it was a great mistake of the previous
Government to surrender sovereignty on financial regulation to the EU.
We are inevitably vulnerable because some 70% of all financial
transactions for the entire EU are done in London. I do not
particularly blame Paris and Germany for thinking that they would like
to have a bit of the cake and to encourage measures which might lead to
that. As someone in the industry, I see that as the biggest

matters today, we have to move on from the disaster of 2008. We cannot
look back at what it was; we can never go back so we have to move on.
The key issue is that the prospects for the financial services industry
are good. Last year’s Kay review on equality markets and the
recent report of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
demonstrate that the UK is leading Europe in the debate on the
direction of domestic and international financial reforms. Negative
perceptions of the industry remain largely based around the lack of
diversity, both in terms of gender and ethnicity, as well as
remuneration, on which the Government have published a report of the
Commons committee. No doubt we will debate the whole question of
diversity, women on boards and equal pay in the next year. I do not
need to go down that road today, but economies cannot prosper if half
of the population is behind. Research from the World Economic Forum in
2012 said that women now represent 40% of the global market force,
which is a little higher in this country, and that more than half of
the world’s university students are women—again, it is
higher in this country. For a functioning economy, its full potential
of women’s skills and talents is very important—including
the export and import of those who are educated here and who then go
back home. The GDP they bring to those countries is vital for a stable

back to this country, across the domestic and international activities,
financial and professional services have contributed more than
£200 billion to the UK economy since 2012. In aggregate terms,
the contribution of the financial services industry represents some 15%
of UK GDP. Exports made up a substantial share of the contribution, of
up to 40%, of the financial services to the GDP, arising from the
sector’s exports and those services provided to overseas
clients. We should also be aware that when people require something we
sell, like law and education, our financial services are very much
sought-after in the Middle East and other countries. That is one of our
soft powers that we should be looking

the UK, including those based here. The UK has the second-largest
pensions industry in the world, with total investments of

Hong Kong and Singapore: if you want to go to the bank, there is
someone to meet you who wants to talk to you. Whatever deal we finally
do with the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds—we do not know
what will happen with one or two others yet; I hope nothing—if
they will not open places, which cost money, there should be the
availability to talk to somebody, because talking to a call centre or
an individual who does not know you or your industry and has never been
to your factory is not the same. That is vital to today’s
economy. Those of us who live in London or Scotland know that the
back-office industry there is huge, but in the middle of the country,
there is nothing. There are no banks, there is nowhere for people to go
to talk to someone. We must encourage building societies and those
other banks to open up, even if they are opening up in a mall, so that

that trade in financial services contributed huge amount to the trade
surplus that the UK has in services. The banking sector alone
contributed £21 billion to UK tax receipts in corporation tax,
income tax and national insurance. The OBR has shown that in 2007-08,
the effective tax burden from corporate and income tax as a share of
the GVA was the highest for the financial intermediaries. That is
partly because of the relatively high profits that the sector makes
compared to its contribution to GVA. 
<?notus-xml column=164?>Again, according to the OBR, in 2010-11 the financial sector accounted
for around 7% of government receipts once the bank payroll tax and bank
levy were
included.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000122">It
is a huge sector. As the noble Baroness, Lady Goudie, said, the
financial services sector accounts for 9.6% of GDP, but if you add the
professional services—a further 4.9%—it makes up almost
15%. Relative to other countries, the financial services sector is very
important for Britain. It is much higher than in the United States,
where it is just over 7% of the economy, and it is more than double a
percentage of our GDP compared with countries such as Japan, France and
Germany.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000123">Of
course, we then come on to the question of whether we have a balanced
economy. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, for initiating this really
important debate at this time. The noble Lord, Lord Flight, mentioned
the importance of the City of London. The joke is that the Lord Mayor
of London—and the City—makes the money and the Mayor of
London, Boris Johnson, spends the money. I do not think that this
bizarre situation exists anywhere else in the world, where you have
power and finance in a square mile of a huge city. Do we have the
balance right? Do we have the relationship right? Does it need to
change? I am not suggesting for one moment that it needs to, but I
would be very interested in the Government’s opinion on this
very important
relationship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000124">The
noble Lord, Lord Dykes, spoke about the European Union. One of the
UK’s great advantages, particularly when it comes to financial
services, is that we are not only at the top table of the European
Union but we are seen by countries such as India as a gateway to
Europe. As a founding chairman of the UK-India Business Council, I know
how important this is for Indian companies. It is crucial that we stay
at the top table of Europe, although I completely agree with the noble
Lord, Lord Dykes, that any talk of a tax on financial transactions
would be a disaster. We need to keep the balance right and thank God we
do not belong to the
euro.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000125">Another
advantage that London has is AIM. The Alternative Investment Market
started in 1995 and is coming up to its 20th anniversary. It is a huge
success but to this day, AIM shares are not allowed to be included in
ISAs. I declare my interest as the senior independent director of the
Booker Group. When I joined the board nearly six years ago we were an
AIM company. We then graduated to the main list and are now a FTSE-250
company. I find the situation so difficult to understand. I believe the
Chancellor said in the Autumn Statement that this would be looked into
and that consultations would start in 2013. They still have not started
and AIM shares still cannot be included in ISAs. So we are not really
encouraging investment in these shares as much as we could. AIM is a
crucial market in encouraging entrepreneurship and growth companies,
not just for the UK but I know how attractive an AIM listing is even to
companies from India. Perhaps the Minister could talk about the
importance of AIM, in particular AIM in
ISAs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062070000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062070000126">When I
used to promote Britain when doing business with India, I would always
speak with pride of our light-touch regulation and of what Margaret
Thatcher 
<?notus-xml column=165?>did in the 1980s in opening up Britain and the City of London with the
big bang, and how this gentlemen’s club and closed shop opened
up into being a meritocracy, and the world’s greatest financial
institutions flocked to London, and London has flourished. But later,
after the financial crisis, my colleagues abroad would say, “Ah,
what happened to your light-touch regulation?”. I would speak
with pride about the independence of the Monetary Policy Committee, one
of the best things that Gordon Brown did when he was

this country was hit by the subprime crisis that became the credit
crunch, that became the financial crisis, that became the great
recession, that turned into the sovereign debt crisis, that turned into
the eurozone crisis, we realised the mistakes that we had made. The
Treasury, Bank of England and the FSA, which in all the good times
leading up to this crisis were a happy merry-go-round, suddenly turned
into this great blame-go-round. I remember taking part in the debates
on the Bill to nationalise Northern Rock in early 2008. Northern Rock
went bust in September 2007 and was nationalised within six months; it
cost £26 billion to bail out a company—the biggest
bailout of any one company in the history of the world. We are now
talking about RBS and Lloyds. It has now taken six years to come up
with our new financial supervision regulations which will be much more
robust. Perhaps the Minister could talk about

and are attacked because of our tax system and companies not paying
enough tax. Well, the GAAR—the anti-abuse

Starbucks and Googles from what they are doing. This brings me to the
point of perception and reality. I chaired a meeting of the Industry
and Parliament Trust. Sadly, the public’s trust in business is
16%, and in government it is 17%. Shockingly, in a poll after the
Olympics which asked, “Are you proud of Britain?”, the

London and the City are a brand. What is a brand? I know about brands
from my own business, Cobra Beer. A brand is what a brand does. The

successful over a sustained period and called them miracle makers. They
followed three principles: first, they followed “better before

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, it may well be one of the
jewels in the Crown, but it is somewhat tarnished. I congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Dykes, on raising this issue at this time, which is of
the most profound significance for the nation—wider, I think,
than the agenda that he addressed. I agree with him about aspects of
looking at the financial transaction tax. I have great reservations
about that being proposed in Europe. If there is a possibility of such
a tax, endorsed by the Americans, which would help to ensure that the
finance capital, the City of London, and other centres across the world
repaid the colossal debt they owe to wider society as a result of their
mismanagement of the financial sector, that is only right and
proper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:38:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that we return to the age of light regulation. Light regulation brought
this country to its knees. We have more than 2 million people
unemployed; we have 1 million young people unable to obtain jobs. We
have a colossal problem with the cutbacks in public services, which are
felt as a massive cost for all but particularly those who are very
dependent on them for benefits and support. What is more, what does it
amount to that each and every man, woman and child in this country has
paid out £19,000 to the financial sector to create the bailouts
to get out of the colossal mess that we are
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:39:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

doubt that comments will be made about “the Government of light
regulation”. The Conservative Party points the finger and says
that Labour was in power at the time, as indeed we were, and was guilty
of not having taken sufficient note of the impending crisis, but the
Conservative Party was carrying down exactly the norms of light
regulation that have been expressed today. What the country is
demanding, however, is answerability. Of course we must create a base
on which the financial services flourish, but it is demanding that they
flourish within a framework where we never again see a crisis like the
one we have had these past four years. Why not? Because we may well be
in the greatest depression for a century and it may take us more than a
decade to recover from it.</hs_para>

standards are considerably below what they were in 2007. That is the
price which the nation is paying and it ill behoves those who argue
that the financial services need to be respected—of course they
do. How could you do anything else with a sector of the economy which,
as noble Lords have identified, amounts to such importance in it? The
noble Lords, Lord Bilimoria, Lord Dykes and Lord

Minister said that we must rebalance the economy. What does he mean by
that? He must, at the very least, mean two things: first, that
overdependence on the financial services industry makes the economy
vulnerable, as it certainly did in 2007; secondly, that the vast
majority of employment in the financial sector is within 20 miles of
this Building. It is in London or the south-eastern counties, and if
you talk about rebalancing the economy you have to look at areas where
people are grossly underemployed at present and where capital is at low
levels, such as the north of England, the north-west and elsewhere. A
balanced economy will require those issues to be addressed. That is why
it is necessary for the Government to spell out the position that they
are going to adopt. They will have that opportunity on numerous
imminent occasions.</hs_para>

the Government address themselves to the fundamental problems of our
economy at present. I give them all credit for the way in which they
have addressed the banking issue. I am not enamoured of the stance on
banking but I congratulate the Government on recognising that we had to
have banking legislation to clear up the mess of the past. Where I and
my party have our reservations, which will be voiced as we consider the
banking Bill, is that the question of sanctions seems to be rather
marginal. For instance, the Government do not seem to think that there
is much more to do than the Vickers fencing-off of the position of the
banks, rather than the direct separation that may be necessary. After
all, we have one instance before us at present in the Royal Bank of
Scotland. What are the Government going to do about that? Should they
not, at the very least, consider whether there should be a separation
between the retail and investment arms of RBS as a solution to that
position? Would that not also indicate that the legislation ought to
consider that dimension?</hs_para>

question of the financial transaction tax, which the noble Lord, Lord
Dykes, raised. I agreed with his sentiments that there is much merit in
it. The merit in it is quite straightforward: it potentially raises
vastly more than stamp duty raises at present. It is also necessary
that the financial services sector meets the obligations in terms of
proper payment, particularly against a background where the country is
scandalised that at the peak of the crisis, absolutely unjustifiable
bonuses were being paid out to leading figures, and where not just
incompetence but the depth to which finance had descended in terms of
morality was being revealed. You cannot look at the LIBOR issue and the
immorality of the terrible risk-taking with other people’s money
without recognising the old adage of, “My word is my

transaction tax is an important concept. I recognise that Britain
certainly could not go forward with it if the United States remained

at the moment and more to be added to the list—lend their
support to the concept, it would be appalling if the British Government
did not recognise those merits as well. That is not to endorse what is
before the Government at present, and I acknowledge entirely their
resistance to what is now on the table. However, I would argue that it

After all, the Commission on Banking Standards has pointed to a
significant way forward. We are all desperately eager to get the
Government’s definitive response to the crucial issues raised by
the commission. We did not have a chance to consider a Statement

Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Dykes for giving us an opportunity
to discuss this important question. I think that some very interesting
issues were raised. I am not sure that there is much
disagreement over principle; on practice and implementation, there may
be some more. Everyone gave their own measure of how important the
financial services sector is to the UK economy, and the obvious
implication of that is that we need to nourish and protect it, and to
use it as an engine for our future growth; I think that everybody
accepts that. My own numbers demonstrate that the financial services
sector represents 10% of our gross domestic product, 12% of our tax
revenue and half of our trade surplus, and employs over 1 million
people—two-thirds of whom are outside London. It was very
helpful to hear reference being made to the broader industries
involved, such as the pensions industry. I was at a meeting recently
with the Indian finance Minister, who asked us to help train
India’s whole actuaries sector, such is the respect with which
our pensions industry is regarded.</hs_para>

am also very persuaded by the soft power arguments in support of our
law and education expertise. Every time I travel with the aim of trying
to bring money into the UK or help UK businesses overseas, there is a
British law firm that is regarded as the leading light in virtually
every territory. It is an extraordinarily good example of soft power.
It is a similar case with our education system. The countries in which
we are most effective are those where the current ruling elite were
educated in the United Kingdom. What worries me is that when I look at
the next generation, a smaller proportion have been educated here.
However, it is a very powerful base from which to develop relationships

good regulation and this Government have been the leader in devising
the architecture and the systems that are now being put in place to
make this system better. We are absolutely in agreement. It is good
regulation we want, not lots of bureaucracy, and that is a critical
distinction to make. We all accept that the financial crisis was in
part caused—certainly exacerbated—by certain practices
within the banks and we have to get that corrected to ensure that it

probably a good time to follow up on what my right honourable friend
the Chancellor talked about in the Mansion House speech last night: the
plan going forward for RBS and Lloyds in particular. There are three
key objectives in the plan to restore them to good health: first, that
they can play a strong role in their support of the economy; secondly,
that any transactions that result in the sale of shares represent
excellent value for money for the taxpayer; and, thirdly, that we will
do whatever we can in restructuring and working with the banks to
return them to private ownership. As the Chancellor announced, Lloyds
is a lot closer so it is being prepared for a sale of shares to
institutions; RBS is still some time away. With regard to the noble
Lord’s suggestions, one of the restructuring options being
looked at is the so-called good bank/bad bank split, which is pretty
consistent with dividing it into a retail and wholesale bank. Certainly
something that will be evaluated quite carefully is whether that is the
better structural
option.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000006">My

word that is applied to almost every aspect of our lives these days. In
terms of making the banking sector less crucial to the UK economy, I am
much more interested in growing other industries than in shrinking the
banking sector just for the sake of it. It would be sensible to shrink
it if it was too engaged in risky businesses, but I do not think our
objective should be simply to reduce the scale of the banking business.
The focus needs to be on ensuring that we have a healthy business. As
was pointed out, Hong Kong has a bigger relative financial sector than
we do. The focus needs to be on our broader economic

the proactive things that we are trying to do as a Government to ensure
that the financial services sector is protected is to ensure that the
way in which we regulate and tax the market and all the infrastructure

the most effective, successful, dynamic financial sector in the world.
That should be our objective. That is how we bring business in. That is
why banks and other institutions want to come here. We should also
support very clearly our own institutions as they develop their
interests overseas; we have talked about insurance companies, for
example, and how effective and successful they can be overseas. We have
to get our financial regulation right. Finally, we have to incentivise
banks to lend to the real economy, and other markets and forms of
disintermediation have to work so that we can get key parts of the
economy financed.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:55:02"></hs_TimeCode> take on board
the noble Lord’s comments about AIM. I accept that ISAs cannot
be included for the time being. We will follow up with noble
Lords when those proposals become clearer later in the
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000009">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>
note that the Government announced the creation of the Financial
Services Trade and Investment Board—really as a promotion body
to help push the City forward. Historically, we have generally left the
City to its own devices because we thought it was so successful, but
this is a body with some very good people from the Government involved
to work through what we can do to support the industry and to make it
successful around the world.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:55:04"></hs_TimeCode> experience of
working quite intensively with both the lord mayor and the mayor has
been that this works quite well in tandem. We also, of course, have the
Treasury as a third strand of the Government promoting the City. It had
been suggested to me in the past that we should share the role by
having both a day mayor and a night mayor—noble Lords can choose
which one they would like to put in which category.</hs_para>

running and it is doing very well. The kinds of things that are on its
agenda are, for example, helping us to be the leading centre for the
internationalisation of the renminbi and, talking of India, to help us
to be well positioned as the rupee is eventually internationalised so
that we can capture that business. My noble friend Lord Flight gave a
very eloquent exposition of the UK investment management strategy,
demonstrating that, in general, it is a good thing. We need, however,
to be careful about how it is regulated—again, we are back to
good regulation. The abolition of stamp duty reserve tax, which was a
big step forward, was really aimed at making our industry the best one
in the world. As an example of what followed, we have seen Santander
choosing London as the base for its world-wide asset management
business, which is a great step forward. In March, we also established
an Islamic task force to try to establish the UK as the preferred
choice for the Muslim world to invest in and do business with. These
are the kind of new initiatives.</hs_para>

have talked a lot about the EU and the interesting challenge around
being the major financial centre in Europe but not a euro country, and
some of the issues and challenges which that throws up. The general
sense I got from this debate—which I certainly share—is
that noble Lords do not read very much in the papers about when the UK
has pushed legislation so that it actually gets the right outcome, not
just for this country’s interests but in the market’s
interest—and MiFID was a wonderful example of that. Of course,
the EU-US free trade agreement should be another example; financial
services will be a very big part of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000012">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T15:56:36"></hs_TimeCode>
talked a little bit about tax. I agree that the GAAR—the
anti-avoidance measure—may be limited. As we saw in Northern
Ireland, however, with the G8 meeting, the only real way to address
these tax issues is through international collaboration. I am delighted
that our Government are taking a lead on tax and transparency and
really setting the pace to help to improve those things. We have talked
enough about Vickers and what is coming
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000013">On the
comments on diversity, I could not agree more that there would be
nothing healthier for some of these financial institutions than to have
a broader and more diverse group of people working in them,
particularly at the senior level. My own example is that I joined a US
investment bank when I left university because I did not feel
comfortable in a merchant bank because I had not been to public school.
I can only imagine how a woman feels on the trading floor of a US
investment bank, because it is a distinct male environment. It would
benefit from that diversity. I am an absolute supporter of that. All my
experience in professional life has demonstrated the enormous power
that comes from that
diversity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000014">I
should address the financial transaction tax. The noble Lord is
absolutely right. If applied equally around the world, it is certainly
a runner, but the way that it is structured now it just will not work.

closing, we have heard how important the sector is, how we are
reforming it, how we are making sure that it addresses the problems of

Young of Hornsey:</Member></B> With the announcement of a significant
programme of activities and commemorative events next year, more than
£50 million of government 
<?notus-xml column=172?>funding being made available—and many arguments about the scale,
nature and purpose of marking this anniversary—historians, other
scholars, politicians, culture commentators and members of the general
public have all joined the fray, making for a fascinating and lively
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000017">Of
course, commemorative events are nearly always contested and throw up
all sorts of unexpected and, indeed, unintended consequences. In 2007,
many of us were involved in commemorating the abolition of the slave
trade on British ships and there was certainly plenty of controversy
there. But reasoned, vigorous discussion is a healthy sign and I
welcome the public debate that continues to develop about how we
mark—or not—the triumphs and tragedies represented by and
flowing from World War
I.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000018">In 2007,
one of the key issues to arise was how the stereotyping to which many
of us are subjected today springs from assumptions and
misrepresentations embedded in British history centuries ago: we have
been defined by stifling categories, with our histories in this country
and elsewhere all but ignored.</hs_para>

first conducted sessions with school students on historical figures of
African descent from Roman times through to the Second World War, a
young boy of Caribbean ancestry told me that we were making it up. If
what we said was true, he argued, then why were there not books and
television programmes on the subject? I am pleased to say that over the
past 40 years, certainly in terms of scholarly works, there has emerged
an ever-growing body of books and learned essays that continue to add
to the sum of our knowledge about our presence and agency in British
history. The Black and Asian Studies Association has been one of the
key organisations in this regard, with innovative research and website
materials by the Runnymede Trust most welcome
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000020">We should
bear in mind that it was only as recently as 2002 that the tremendous
effort of colonial troops from African, Asian and Caribbean countries
was finally officially recognised with the creation of the memorials on
Hyde Park Corner. I am delighted to take this opportunity to salute the
diligence of my noble friends Lady Flather and Lord Bilimoria for their
unstinting hard work on that project, as well as the noble Lord, Lord
Sheikh, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howells of St Davids, for
contributing to debates and Questions and thus making sure that our

on from the 1980s, there is still so much ignorance. I have noticed
recently how well educated, intellectually curious people react when I
speak about the subject of our debate today. They are amazed and often
want to know more, but even if they do not intend to follow up the
matter, they usually say something like, “Why were we not taught
about this at school?”. If we look for a moment at the scale, we
must wonder why so little of this history is known. Some 1.5 million
volunteers came forward from India and were in action on the Western
Front within a month of the start of the war. India’s
contribution was not confined to the army or to combat. The Royal
Indian Marine and the Indian merchant services had equally crucial
roles. From the African countries of 
<?notus-xml column=173?>Nigeria, Gambia, South Africa, Sierra Leone, Uganda, Kenya and what were
then Rhodesia, Nyasaland and the Gold Coast came the 55,000 men who
served in combat and the many hundreds of thousands more who served as
carriers and auxiliary troops.</hs_para>

islands came vocal and financial support for Britain’s war
effort. Ambulances, maintenance costs and approximately £2
million—£60 million in today’s money—were
given to the British Government. More than 15,500 men of the British
West Indies Regiment served with the Allied Forces. We should remember
that it is not just in terms of military and support services that
sacrifices were made. Food and other forms of production were disrupted
in those countries and the safety and security of their populations
were jeopardised.</hs_para>

to their commitment to education in the broadest sense, museums, other
cultural organisations and the voluntary sector are expert at examining
these less well known histories through a variety of analytical prisms.
For example, the Imperial War Museum is conducting a research project
funded by the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council
entitled “Whose Remembrance?”, which will investigate how
local communities are addressing the colonial experience during the two
world wars.</hs_para>

English Heritage, I am pleased to say that English Heritage has
grant-aided the repair of the grade 2 listed Muslim Burial Ground at
Woking, where Indian troops who died in the Indian Military Hospital at
the Brighton Pavilion were laid to rest. This complements the grade 2
listed Chattri memorial in Brighton, erected where Hindu and Sikh
soldiers who died in the war hospital there were cremated.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:08:01"></hs_TimeCode> further
designated memorial to Indian troops is at Barton on Sea in the New
Forest, where a grade 2 listed obelisk commemorates a convalescent
depot for Indian troops. English Heritage has also funded investigative
work on the SS “Mendi”, the troopship carrying more than
800 members of the South African Native Labour Corps that sank off the
Isle of Wight in 1917 with the loss of more than 600 lives. A meeting
of interested parties has recently been convened to discuss ways in
which the “Mendi” dead might be remembered and the site
appropriately managed. Research is also ongoing at Orford Ness in
Suffolk regarding the sea defences constructed there by a Chinese
labour battalion; again, it is worth noting that most of the 140,000
men who came from China to work for the French and British actually did
so on the Western
Front.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000025">Now
here is the difficult part: there are plenty of challenges as well as
opportunities. Simply pointing out how heroic the combatants from what
were then British colonies were is not, on its own, enough. To gloss
over the racism and discrimination that manifested itself in a variety
of ways, for example in the division of labour and the allocation of
resources for fighting, would be to hide the truth. Although racism
still permeates our society and there is still much work to do on this
issue, to say that nothing has changed would equally be to deny
reality. Relevant here is that the Armed Forces have been striving for
many years to 
<?notus-xml column=174?>demonstrate in practical terms their positive approach to equality of
opportunity and diversity in their institutions.</hs_para>

Lords present here today understand the need to ensure that our
citizens, particularly the younger ones, from every cultural and ethnic
background have a firm grasp of the complex ways in which
our heritage and histories are interwoven. A sense of belonging must be

number of government responses to questions about the commemorations
have emphasised the educational dimension. There are aspects of the
programme that suggest some exciting opportunities to engage young
people with the human stories behind the historical headlines, which I
welcome. There are several references to activities in partnership with
a range of Commonwealth countries and the Commonwealth War Graves
Commission, which I again welcome. However, while the concept of the
Commonwealth may make sense to us here, that is not necessarily the
case for many young people. I thank the Minister for our helpful
conversation earlier this week. Will he tell us how the Government
intend to ensure that the material that they will be generating
resonates in a profound way, encouraging analysis, critique and, yes,
perhaps some uncomfortable conversations with young
people—especially, but not exclusively, those of African, Asian
and Caribbean descent? Of course, the most obvious way of effecting
this would be in some way to recognise this material in the national

Desai:</Member></B> My Lords, we are grateful to the noble Baroness,
Lady Young, for proposing this topic for us to discuss. I agree with
her that every such commemoration raises a lot of controversy, but it
also exposes a lot of ignorance at the same time. Someone, perhaps to
take a radical stance, has called it a “European civil
war”. That may sound like brave talk, but it was not just a
European civil war. A lot of the rest of the world was fighting on one
side or the other in the
war<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:12:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the history, at the top as well as the bottom, of how the war was
fought. One of the most unique aspects—certainly it was not
repeated in the Second World War—was the formation of the
Imperial War Cabinet. The fact that it was formed, including people
such as Jan Smuts from South Africa and Satyendra Sinha—who
later became Lord Sinha of Raipur, the only hereditary Peer of Asian
origin—representing various parts of the empire and deciding
about the war, is not very well known. We ought to be able to
commemorate that as a constitutional innovation as well as an
historical
event<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000032">It
is true that this practice was not followed in the Second World War.
Despite that, the empire as it then was—or the
Commonwealth—contributed to the Second World War. As the noble
Baroness said, on the Indian side perhaps up to 2 million people
participated in the war. As noble Lords know, throughout the history of
the British Empire in India, the Indian army was paid for by the Indian
taxpayer; it was never paid for by the British taxpayer. In the First
World War, not only was all the additional recruitment paid for by the
Indian taxpayer, India alone raised £2 billion—I think. I
will check; I have written it in my own book, <I>The Rediscovery of
India</I>, so I can check that. I do not know whether India was ever
repaid, but we will pass over that.</hs_para>

recognise that when Britain was fighting the First World War, and
indeed the Second World War, there was a tremendous contribution from
the rest of the empire in terms of soldiers and resources. India was an
especially big supplier of raw materials and resources for fighting the
war, and that contribution was vital to that effort. I am really
pressing for recognition of the efforts of the top as well as at the
bottom, because one ought not to forget that the institution of the
Imperial War Cabinet was a remarkable constitutional innovation and we
ought to commemorate
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000034">That
said, although the celebrations will not go on to what happened after
the war, the First World War had a profound influence on the British
Empire. The movements for national liberation got a great fillip from
the soldiers who had come to Europe and fought the war. When the
soldiers saw that their masters were just about as good as they were in
fighting, and not a superior race, they realised that humanity is much
more alike than not. That message was carried much more thoroughly by
the war into the minds of ordinary soldiers who had come from
agriculture or other industries. We ought to recognise that that was in
some sense a creative contribution from what was a destructive
war.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

for this initiative on the part of the noble Baroness, Lady Young of
Hornsey, because she has drawn attention to a really vital theme of the
commemorations next year. It is particularly good that in the plans
already announced by the Government, the Commonwealth element is very
pronounced. The commemorations will begin just after the Commonwealth
Games in Glasgow, and there is a firm emphasis there. I was with the
Gurkha association just over a week ago and I was forcibly reminded of
the fact, which has already been stated, that there was a huge
contribution

theme plays in very different ways in different places. The First World
War was a vital element of nation-building in some parts of what is now
the Commonwealth. In other places, it was an episode of colonial
oppression; we had some very helpful lines from the noble Baroness,
Lady Young, on that. I have had the privilege of conducting a service
at the Memorial Gates, which she has already mentioned, every year for
the past 10 years. The establishment of those gates is, as the noble
Baroness said, down to the initiative of my noble friend Lord Bilimoria
and, especially, the noble Baroness, Lady Flather. I am very sorry that
she is not here to make a contribution because it has been an
extraordinary experience, year after year, to be reminded of the huge
contribution made by people from the Caribbean, especially, and from
Africa as well as India. The annual observances at the Memorial Gates
are on Commonwealth Day itself, somewhat before the August celebrations
or commemorations. Can the Minister say whether there are any plans to
use that location in August for acts of remembrance?</hs_para>

that, in contemporary Britain, we are now in the process of developing
a truthful narrative that weaves in the contribution of many different
communities to the history and flourishing of this country. This is a

young in the values and ethos of our society by mentioning the great
universals such as tolerance, courage and respect, and all those things
that we absolutely believe in. But unless they are
embedded<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:19:24"></hs_TimeCode> in
convincing narratives and in communities, they do not have the power to
transform lives. It is in that context that the remembrances and

organisations seeking ways of stimulating grass-roots participation in
the centenary. We cannot change the past, but it is a serious
responsibility how we choose to remember it, because that remembering
is itself extraordinarily creative and has an impact on the present.
The theme of World War I is so large and the suffering involved so
great that, as well as the proper emphasis of the noble Lord, Lord
Desai, on life at the top, it is important to balance the great events
with getting behind the columns of what Siegfried Sassoon memorably
called “these intolerably nameless names” on thousands of
war memorials. All sorts of resources are being developed to rescue
those names from anonymity. We ought to look at that in relation to
Commonwealth memorials as well. The faith communities

those who were fighting on the other side. It would be appalling if
this was an occasion of ramping up any kind of animosity against, for

Howells of St Davids:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to take
part in this debate, which was introduced so eloquently by the noble
Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey. I will concentrate on the Caribbean
and introduce the subject of World War II. One cannot overstate the
enthusiasm and willingness of individuals from across the Caribbean to
play a key role in Britain’s two world wars. To them, Britain
was their mother country; to them, it was part of their heritage. Their
collective loyalty to Britain manifested itself in many, many ways.
Thousands risked their lives in service, some so anxious to serve that
they lied about their age, often undertaking the most demanding and
dangerous jobs against the elements of a climate truly alien to them.
This loyalty was
unrelenting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000041">Donations,
which came despite communities’ own severe hardships, included
aeroplanes and ambulances. Villages across the islands took down the
gates and railings that protected their homes and contributed them to
what was then known as the war effort. Women’s groups and
schoolchildren knitted caps, gloves and scarves to keep the servicemen
and women warm. To date, the sacrifices of those men and women have
never truly been recognised—not with any tangible
acknowledgement of their contribution. They are not even allowed to
march as a group to the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday, something for
which they have been fighting for a very long
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000042">History
has shown us how these people were treated with shameful hostility. It
is not within the capacity of this debate to fully appreciate the
extent of the racism they encountered. I am reminded of the front page
of the <I>People</I>. It showed a black man, calypsonian, with a blonde
on one arm and a brunette on the other, with a caption reading,
“Would you like your daughter to marry one of
these?”—an insult to those who risked their lives and are
still risking their lives for Britain. We are talking about those who
gave everything to protect the values that too often we take for
granted, that we share as an intrinsic part of this country’s
heritage. Today’s Question is important because when the UN
declared 2011 the International Year for People of African Descent, the
Minister’s response to my Oral Question showed that Britain was
not prepared to make any effort to recognise their contribution. His
answer said absolutely nothing.</hs_para>

Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, the Government completely
ignored Caribbean nurses, the 16 to 20 year-olds who came to serve in
the National Health Service. They were the pillars of the
NHS. It was left to a voluntary organisation to make representations to
Buckingham Palace directly.

I encourage people to take their children to the Museum of London in
Canary Wharf. It tells the story of the marvellous contribution that
was made. Some of your Lordships will remember that Mr Peel was
responsible for setting up the police force. However, the Thames River
Police was first force, which was set up in the docks on the backs of
the Caribbean enslaved. When the ships came in, the cargos were looted
by the people of the East End. The magistrates set up the police force,

Taylor of Warwick:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble
Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, for securing this timely debate. My
grandfather was one of the 15,601 men and women of the British West
Indies Regiment who served with the Allied Forces in the First World
War. He was a Jamaican; indeed, Jamaica contributed two thirds of those
West Indian volunteers. Others came from Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados,
the Bahamas, British Honduras, Grenada, Guyana, the Leeward Islands, St
Lucia and St Vincent. More than 1,200 of those Caribbean servicemen
were killed or died, while more than 2,500 were wounded. Eighty-one
medals were won for bravery and 49 men were mentioned in dispatches. My
grandfather said very little about his First World War experiences,
describing them only as
“horrific”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000047">My
father was not deterred and joined the Jamaican Army. He was then
transferred to the British Eighth Army, fighting in Italy in the Second
World War. Again, my father was very reluctant to talk about what he
saw of combat. But his medals, which he left to me after his death,
spoke volumes. Ironically, although my father became experienced enough
in the British Army to train white soldiers to become officers, because
he was black he was not allowed to become an officer and attained only
the rank of
sergeant.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/A3694CC88588F8EC2C8E59478C0750332F92DF57" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

tribute to the British and Caribbean Veterans Association, which tries
to keep the memories of these brave men and women alive to this day. It
has a simple mantra, but it is one that says it all: “We were
there”. The King’s African Rifles were the largest force
of African troops in British Africa. First formed in 1902, the force
saw action throughout the continent during the war, especially in east
Africa. The West African Frontier Force, formed in 1900 was comprised
mainly of African troops and consisted of the Queen’s Own
Nigeria Regiment, the Gold Coast Regiment, the Royal Sierra Leone
Regiment and the Gambia Regiment. Much like the descendants of the West
Indian Regiment, descendants of the African regiments who fought in
both world wars today form the bedrock of membership of
Britain’s black-majority churches.</hs_para>

11 October last year, the Prime Minister said that the objectives of
next year’s anniversary are as follows: to honour those who
served; to remember those who died, and to ensure that the lessons
learnt live with us not as a monument to military glory, but as a
record of toil and sacrifice. After all, the good book does say,
“Blessed are the peacemakers”. Ultimately it has to be
discussion and diplomacy, not wars, that move our world forwards. I am
glad to hear that the Government intend to use a variety of means to
achieve these objectives next year, but I echo the noble Baroness, Lady
Young, when she says that these issues need to be on the national

about Britain’s disaffected youth, and in particular black
youth. It is my personal view that part of that disaffection is a
feeling of not belonging to Britain, and I suspect that the majority of
these young men do not know that their ancestors played a full part in
the First World War and the Second World War. That is why young
children need to know about their own heritage, and that those valiant
soldiers were not only white. As the years pass by, it
becomes increasingly important that the Government’s initiatives
should ensure that the contribution of people from Africa, Asia and
the Caribbean to British efforts in the First World War is
recognised.</hs_para>

Parekh:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking the noble Baroness,
Lady Young of Hornsey, for introducing this debate. I am sure that
noble Lords have seen the mural in the Royal Gallery by Daniel Maclise.
In the mural a black man is pointing to one of the marines who shot the
great admiral. Only a few inches away is an Arab gentleman on
Nelson’s ship. This is simply to point out that blacks, Asians
and Caribbeans played an important role not only in the First World War
and the Second World War, but in the Napoleonic wars. I cannot produce
the facts and figures, not because they are not available, but because
this is not the time. The history pre and post the Napoleonic wars
shows that the role played by Africans and Indians was very
considerable. This would seem to suggest that the liberty and democracy
that this country rightly enjoys are things to which other communities
have
contributed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:33:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

wars, which is what we are here to discuss, some 5 million Indians,
Caribbeans and Africans participated. More than 130,000 people died,
and 42 of them fought so gallantly that they were awarded the Victoria
Cross. As my good and noble friend Lord Desai pointed out, it was not
just a question of people dying, it was a question of how money was
raised and loans were made, as well as the ambulance corps and
voluntary groups to which Indians contributed in large numbers,
including Mahatma Gandhi. He was opposed to war, but because he had
benefited from the British empire, he felt an obligation to help in any
non-violent way he could. Let us not forget

that, I want to raise three questions. What are we commemorating? Why
are we commemorating, and how should we do it? I am not entirely sure
that we are clear about our answers to any of these three questions
either today or through the monuments that we have built. Let us take
the 
<?notus-xml column=180?>First World War, whose centenary falls next year, and to which the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of London rightly referred. In my view and
that of many historians, the First World War was unwise in its
conception, incompetent in its conduct—ordinary soldiers said
that it was like lions being led by donkeys—and the post-war
settlement was brutal, leading to the Treaty of Versailles and what
happened after
that.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/C082D9C247CF09F2E74233DD1495AB8DB78ECB5A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

consciousness so deeply that it discredited Europe in the eyes of lots
of people, including those in India and elsewhere. They thought,
“If Europeans can engage in that kind of brutality and that kind
of war, they are not entitled to talk of European civilisation”.
It also disillusioned large numbers of people within Europe about the
kind of society that they had created and led to interwar movements
that paved the way for the Second World
War.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000055">What are
we commemorating? In my view, we should be commemorating the fact that
war is not the answer to many of our intractable problems; that it
should not be romanticised, because it involves an enormous amount of
suffering; that, wherever possible, there has to be an alternative way
than violence of dealing with conflicts; and, equally importantly, that
our political leaders can be extremely incompetent and are not always
to be trusted. A recent example is that it has taken them 10 years to
realise that the Americans should be talking to the Taliban. Hundreds
and thousands of lives could have been saved if something that many of
us have been talking about had been realised earlier. Just because this
happens to be a life on the other side of the world, they think that
they can gamble, take things for granted and continue to make
mistakes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062076000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000056">For
me, the most important message of the First World War is that our
leaders are not as bright as they think they are. They are capable of
more stupidity than ordinary human beings. In fact, if any manager of a
company had handled his affairs in the same way as some of our Prime
Ministers and presidents have handled the great affairs of their
countries, they would have been sacked a long time ago. That, to me, is
one of the important lessons of the First World War, along with many
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062076000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062076000057">So why
should we be commemorating those things? It is for three reasons.
First, so that we can do justice to the victims; secondly, so that we
do not repeat the mistake and so that these things are burnt into the
consciousness of ordinary human beings; and, thirdly, that we recognise
the solidarity of the Commonwealth because it has contributed
substantially to the

commemorate? I am not entirely keen on statues, monuments and
memorials. We walk by statues. What do they tell us? Statues are mute
and do not tell the story. The story has to be told. Therefore, I
should have thought that the commemoration could take a form such as a
national day of reflection on what happened and why, which we should
get our schoolchildren to recognise through the school syllabus. There
could be an annual televised lecture which becomes a national event,
where people talk about these things at their hearths and homes. There
could be an essay competition in schools. As the right reverend Prelate
rightly said, we should help to construct a new national narrative in
which the Commonwealth contribution is 
<?notus-xml column=181?>fully appreciated. More importantly, for me, as we are talking about the
Commonwealth contribution, how can we link up with other Commonwealth
countries to commemorate this? It is not just about commemorating what
they did for us but, rather, doing it jointly.</hs_para>

I recognise that six out of seven speakers so far this afternoon are

proportion across the colour boundaries would have joined in, but it is

who have spoken in this debate for making it a very special moment. It
has been a wonderful short debate, dealing with very important issues
and it has been very moving to listen to all the points that have been
made. I also thank the Library for a very good research note, which has
obviously influenced a number of people’s contributions and

the British Government declared war in 1914, they did so on behalf of
the empire and not just of the UK. It is right that the forthcoming
World War I celebrations recognise the voluntary participation of so
many people then living in the empire and the considerable sacrifices
that were made throughout the war. In the words of the noble Baroness,
Lady Warsi, “Our boys weren’t just Tommies—they
were Tariqs and Tajinders
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:42:30"></hs_TimeCode>”. Of
course, they were not just boys either, although that is another

many noble Lords have said, the figures are not well enough known. As
my noble friend Lady Howells said, some contributions are still not
being properly acknowledged. There were some 1.5 million men from the
Indian subcontinent. It is worth pointing out, as has been mentioned,
that participants from the Indian subcontinent won 13,000 medals,
including 12 Victoria Crosses. The Caribbean supplied 15,000 soldiers
who made up the British West Indies Regiment and there were around
55,000 soldiers from Africa who mainly fought in that continent. As the
right reverend Prelate reminded us, there were Gurkhas, as always. When
people go to the major war graves in the Low Countries, the lasting
memory that we have in these endless fields, beautifully maintained as
they should be, is the moving sight of the rows of crosses, but search
harder and you can find the memorials to the 47,000 troops from the
Indian subcontinent who died on the Western Front. There are Sikh
memorials, Jewish and Muslim graves, as well as the grave markers of
members of the Chinese Labour
Corps<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:43:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062078000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062078000007">The
centenary that we are commemorating must engage with many national and
international levels. It is hoped that—as the noble Lord, Lord
Parekh, said—there will be activity in many places around the
Commonwealth. In our own country, given the diversity and the
challenges that exist in the moment, we should use this commemoration
to bring every one of Britain’s communities into some form of
discussion and knowledge about the event because so many of their
forebears were involved in the First World
War<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:43:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062078000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062078000008">Having
said that, it is important that the First World War be remembered for
more than the industrialisation of death that it caused. I hope that
the Minister will accept that it will be important to ensure that the
commemoration of the centenary is respectful, thoughtful and
reflective, without in any way glorifying the nature of the war and the
appalling human sacrifice that took place; a commemoration, not a
celebration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:44:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062078000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062078000009">There
is a huge opportunity here if we can but grasp it. The Imperial War
Museum will play a pivotal role; the National Army Museum and local
museums 
<?notus-xml column=183?>will play their parts. In addition, the Heritage Lottery Fund will give
£6 million to projects marking the centenary. So it would be
really good if the majority of those funds could be reserved to help
local areas and communities explore their history and heritage so as to
better understand the war’s impact on their
communities—to create a truthful narrative, as suggested by the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
London.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062078000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062078000010">The
Government have laid out three themes for the commemoration:
remembrance, youth and education. That seems to be about right, but I
hope there will also be an opportunity to reflect on why the war was
waged and to recognise, as the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, said, that
we would not have freedom today had it not been for the courageous
sacrifice and service of those brave individuals then. It is important
that we understand why so many Tariqs and Tajinders, as well as
Tommies, were prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice for that ideal,
and what the significance of that coming together of the empire means
today and in the future.</hs_para>

Lady Young, reminded us, much has been achieved in terms of knowledge
and understanding of the contribution made by people from Africa, Asia
and the Caribbean to the British effort in the First World War. As she
also reminded us, there is much more to discover and understand about
the impact of all this not only in the trenches and on the battlefields
but in the outposts of empire. The human and political strands must be
woven into the commemoration. I look forward to hearing how that will
happen from the
Minister.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_20_PT_1/804E61273F68A5376198F2D9D14FE5667E3626D3" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 June 2013">Thursday,

integral to our history. The Government are committed to commemorating
its centenary appropriately. The scale is overwhelming: over 16.5
million deaths, military and civilian, with 1.25 million from Britain
and its then empire, colonies and dominions alone. Let us not forget,
either, the many more who returned home physically and mentally
wounded. More countries were involved in the war than not, from the
vast Indian subcontinent to the small island of Nevis. All should be
remembered for the part they played, and I assure your Lordships that
they will.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062078000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062078000015">Those contributions
were as diverse as the countries involved. Many countries provided not
only troops but porters, engineers and medics,
among others. The noble Baroness, Lady Howells, particularly
mentioned the Caribbean. I found out that men travelled from there at
their own expense to enlist. In Africa, Asia and the Caribbean there
were significant financial contributions both centrally and from
citizens who raised large amounts, at a time when they were already
feeling economic hardships at home. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord
Desai, who referred to the Indian Army being paid by Indian taxpayers.
He also mentioned the donations in kind, as did a number of other noble
Lords, with each 
<?notus-xml column=184?>country giving what it could. Whether wood, fruit, sugar, rum,
aeroplanes or whatever it was, those were great
contributions.</hs_para>

these contributions is not new for us. I am particularly sad that the
noble Baroness, Lady Flather, is not with us today and I wish her a
speedy recovery. As the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, said, she had so
much to do with the Memorial Gates, as did he. That inscription on the
Memorial Gates on Constitution Hill is in memory of the 5 million
volunteers from the Indian subcontinent, Africa and the Caribbean. It
is as meaningful today as it ever was, while the nearby pavilion
includes the names of 23 gallant men from those regions who were
awarded the Victoria Cross in World War One, alongside those from the
Second World War. I am sure that the gates will be used over the four
years of commemorations. I rarely part company with the noble Lord,
Lord Parekh, but these memorial places are not necessarily there for
their stone but because they are a focal point for people to gather in
a meaningful way.</hs_para>

a new opportunity to mark these important contributions. Commonwealth
representatives will be invited to stay after the closing ceremony of
the Commonwealth Games to attend a service of commemoration at Glasgow
Cathedral on 4 August next year. It was right that the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of London referred to this, because it will
be followed by a wreath-laying service at the city’s
cenotaph.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062078000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-gc0001.htm#13062078000018">The
nearly 230,000 deaths among military personnel from countries now
within the Commonwealth are well documented. However, the speed with
which some of them entered the battlefield was extraordinary, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, mentioned, for the British
Indian Army arrived in France on 26 September 1914 and was
engaged in fierce fighting at Ypres the following month. Their heroic
exploits are rightly commemorated at Neuve Chapelle, where a memorial
stands as an enduring testament to the men from the modern-day
sub-continent who also served with distinction at places like Gallipoli
and Mesopotamia. Indeed, we heard from the noble Lords, Lord Bilimoria
and Lord Taylor of Warwick, of their own families’ service. Men
from across the African continent contributed, whether it was the
Egyptians helping to guard the Suez Canal, then British Nigeria
contributing to the German surrender at Duala, or the South Africans
seizing Delville Wood with great loss. There were many more occasions
such as this across the

the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, said about Commonwealth partners was
important. It is essential that the entire Commonwealth plays a full
part in the centenary commemorations. The Prime Minister’s
special representative, Dr Andrew Murrison, has held a number of
meetings with the Commonwealth high commissions in London to share our
plans and invite their involvement. There are plans for a plenary
session involving all high commissions in the autumn, and there have

was absolutely right that the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, referred to
my noble friend Lady Warsi. As part of her energetic efforts to
highlight the contributions of the Commonwealth, she visited the
Grootebeek military cemetery and the First World War graves of soldiers
from her parents’ home village in Pakistan. Similarly, we can
all be inspired by the First World War centenary to gain a greater
understanding of our roots. Indeed, one of the key aims of the
battlefield visits project in England, and now in Scotland, is that
pupils are given the opportunity to learn about the role of the
Commonwealth and former empire countries which fought in the
war.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Young of Hornsey, made some particularly poignant
comments about history and its teaching. It has also been said that
education and youth are absolutely key to our efforts. What the noble
Lord, Lord Bilimoria, said about that was equally moving. Even before
the recent launch of the small community grants scheme, the Heritage
Lottery Fund is playing a key role in connecting communities with their
First World War past; the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara,
mentioned this particularly. They have given early support towards a
number of projects which highlight the role played by the African,
Asian and Caribbean Commonwealth soldiers in this critical phase of
British history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:54:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
The right reverend Prelate mentioned nation building. This was

the battlefields visits programme and the HLF-supported projects, not
only will we gain a better understanding of our past but, collectively,
a strengthened feeling of national identity in today’s Britain,
whatever our cultural or ethnic background. There is no doubt that this
country could not have prevailed in the First World War without the
support and sacrifice of the Commonwealth countries. As we came
together then, so the centenary will give us an opportunity to come
together again to reaffirm our shared values. The noble Baroness, Lady
Howells of St Davids, spoke movingly about them. Those values have been
forged through experiences that will not be forgotten and they should
bind us together inseparably. Recognition of the important role that
men and women from Africa, Asia and the Caribbean played is an integral

gloss over the horror of the First World War or, indeed, who won. I
think I would need an hour to digest and satisfy the noble Lord, Lord
Parekh, in his questions around what, why and how, but they are
particularly important as many people discover things about that war
through listening to different historians—I have yet to meet
historians who take the same line, and no doubt we will hear a lot from
them. We will also want to come to our own judgments, and that is why
the Government are not planning anything along one theme. It is for
people to discover for themselves and it is why the battlefield visits
are going to be so important. Over the next four or five years, two
pupils and a teacher from every secondary school will go and see the
Western Front for
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-20T16:56:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I
would also like to reassure the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of

and suffering recognise no national boundaries and that those who were
once our adversaries are now our partners in building a better
world.</hs_para>

prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media. This
follows an earlier public consultation exercise on the interim
guidelines, details of which were announced in my written statement to
the House on the 19th December,
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062075000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-wms0001.htm#13062075000008">The
final guidelines take account of comments received in the consultation
and the experience of recent prosecutions. They have been amended to
clarify additional evidential and public interest considerations
relevant when prosecutors assess whether a prosecution is required in
accordance with the Code for Crown
Prosecutors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062075000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-wms0001.htm#13062075000009">The
overall approach of the guidelines remains the same, making a clear
distinction between communications which amount to credible threats of
violence, a targeted campaign of harassment or breach of court orders
on the one hand, and other communications - for example, grossly
offensive communications - on the other. The first group will be
prosecuted robustly. Whereas cases in the second group, which meet the
evidential stage, are unlikely to require a prosecution in the public
interest if the sender expresses genuine remorse, the communication is
swiftly removed, it is not intended for a wide audience or does not
obviously go beyond what could conceivably be acceptable in a diverse
society which upholds and respects freedom of
expression.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062075000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620-wms0001.htm#13062075000010">Copies

Agency (SOCA) had identified an error in the way in which they had
captured and reported the number of outgoing (Part 3) European arrest
warrants (EAWs) that have been issued since 2009-10. As I set out in
April, I take this matter extremely seriously, and undertook to
establish whether any adverse consequential issues may have arisen, as
well as ensure that any inaccurate data that may have been provided to
Parliament is corrected. Accordingly, I asked HM Chief Inspector of
Constabulary (HMCIC), in collaboration with SOCA, to audit
SOCA’s systems for collecting data on EAWs; to validate the EAW
figures; to ensure that the error identified in collecting data had no
detrimental impact on public protection; and to provide assurances that
SOCA’s new Case Information Management System (CIMS) will

complete and I would like to thank HMCIC for the work his Inspectorate
have done to produce their report so promptly, copies of which are in
the House Library. The report found that a) the audit SOCA undertook to
verify the data was robust, and the Part 1 audit would result in the
identification of more arrests and surrenders than previously
promulgated; b) there was no evidence of systemic weaknesses that would
adversely affect public protection; and c) CIMS would help SOCA record
more accurate data in future.</hs_para>

people’s housing needs over the last decade. On 6 September
2012, the Government announced the Housing Guarantees Schemes as part
of a package of measures to expand the provision of rented housing 
<?notus-xml column=18?>and boost economic growth. The Government is setting up two guarantees
schemes: one to support the delivery of large scale professionally
managed purpose-built accommodation for private rent and a second to
support delivery of additional affordable homes. The Government will
guarantee up to £10 billion of housing providers’ debt
through the two schemes.</hs_para>

licence to provide the Affordable Housing Guarantees Scheme to
Affordable Housing Finance Plc, a subsidiary of The Housing Finance

consider direct applications for the Private Rented Sector Guarantees
Scheme. The response to our invitation to tender for delivery of the
scheme indicated a demand from larger investors for individual direct
debt guarantees and that Government should take the first steps in
developing this new market. We are in conversation with the sector and
committed to exploring all of the market-led options, which will lead
to guarantees becoming available as soon as possible. We will look to
offer direct guarantees on money raised in the bond market by housing
providers investing in large-scale and purpose-built private rented
sector projects. The Government’s scheme rules for the
guarantees are unchanged. Some potential borrowers are already
discussing applications with my officials and others are invited to do
the same. A formal application process will open

Registration Act 1965 or Part 1 of the Commons Act 2006. A slightly
different system operates in the New Forest, where these Acts do not
apply. The Rural Payments Agency allocates to each commoner a notional
area of the common proportionate to the commoner's share of the total
grazing rights (so a commoner with 10% of the total rights would be
allocated a purely notional 10% of the common). The commoners do not
need to graze the land, but have to ensure the common is kept in Good
Agricultural and Environmental Condition. Owners, provided they are
farmers, generally have the right to any surplus grazing beyond the
registered rights of the
commoners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062081000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130620w0001.htm#13062081000004">As
