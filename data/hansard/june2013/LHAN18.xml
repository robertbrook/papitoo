Touhig:</Member></B> I must say that I am encouraged by the
Minister’s words. Four years after Parliament passed the
groundbreaking Autism Act, this National Autistic Society report
reveals that despite some progress far too many autistic adults are
missing out on everyday support. A shocking 70% of adults and their
carers say they get no help from social services, and this is not
always down to money. Indeed, economic modelling by Deloitte shows that
every pound invested in services for autistic adults with moderate
needs brings a return of £1.30. When the Government review the
autism strategy, will they consider providing an innovation fund so
that local councils can provide the cost-effective services that all
autistic adults need and actually
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T14:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13061712000316" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000316">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, we will certainly consider the idea of an
innovation fund during the course of the review. We have allocated some
central funding already to support the implementation of the autism
strategy, for example in commissioning a range of training products
from expert bodies to support local areas and professionals. I hope the
noble Lord will agree that the strategy and the statutory guidance that
goes with it mark a great step forward for adults with autism in
England. We now need to take an honest look at how it is all working

necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T14:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

strand of support for people with autism. Many people with this

the lead department on the Autism Act, but that other departments have
responsibilities as part of the strategy? He will be aware
of the finding of the Upper Tribunal (Administrative Appeals Chamber)
in a case against the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions that the
case has to be made that autism is different. Can I ask him to make

realise the difficulties that young people with autism can face in
making that transition to adulthood. Under the autism strategy, my
department and the Department for Education funded the social policy
research unit at the University of York to examine how statutory
services are currently supporting young people on the autistic

crafted and well camouflaged reply hardly answers my specific Question.
In 1982 at the time of the Falklands, we sent 22 escort vessels down
there. Now, we probably have hardly 12 that we could put out
operationally at any one time to meet all our worldwide commitments.
The pressure is increasing, with Russia reviving its nuclear submarine
patrols to the South Pole and China determined to become a major
maritime power to support its growing overseas interests. In addition,
the early warning Crow’s Nest radar system, to be integrated
into our Merlin helicopters, apparently will not be ready until five
years after our first new carrier is operational, thus increasing our
position of vulnerability. Is the Navy not more concerned about the
lack of escorts than anything else—and should not we

voluntary, business-led strategy of the noble Lord, Lord Davies, to
increase the number of women in UK boardrooms. At the time of the noble
Lord’s latest report of April 2013, women had secured 34% of all
FTSE 100 board appointments in the previous year. The UK corporate
governance code now requires boards to report on their diversity
policy. Head-hunters have pledged to ensure that women make up 30% of
longlists and, from October 2013, quoted companies will be required to
disclose the gender balance at various levels within their
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T14:52:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Thornton" PimsId="4281" UID="13061712000345" xid="1466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000345">Baroness
Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, this is not what the Cranfield review
of women on boards says, which is that that in the past six months,
progress in the number of female non-executive directors in FTSE 100
companies has reached a plateau; it is flatlining and stuck at between
26% and 30%. It also says that there has been a lack of progress at the
executive-director level of FTSE 100 companies. A rise from 5.5% to
5.8% since 2010 is not impressive. What will the Government do next? It
seems that they have got the low-hanging fruit on this issue. If they
have set their face against quotas, what does the Minister suggest
doing about the abysmal lack of gender diversity, about ageism and
about the lack of ethnic diversity in the country’s

as being open for visitors and business. That is very much the case as
far as China is concerned. The President of China has talked about
there being 400 million visitors from China by 2018. We need to
recognise the need for a customer focus in our visitor offer. That is
why the Government have broken up the UK Border Agency into two parts,
one of which deals with immigration enforcement. The other, UK Visas

Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the concrete points made
by the Chinese authorities in this article to which reference has been
made is that a decreasing proportion of Chinese visitors to
Europe—the European Union, broadly—are coming to this
country, because they can get a Schengen visa for all of the continent,
in effect, and the extra hassle of getting a visa for Britain deters
people from adding Britain to the European tour, as it were. Will the
Minister carry out a study as to whether our documentation could not be
nearer in line with what is done for the Schengen countries without our

Hylton:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is partly probing and
partly to do with language, and it may have some constitutional
overtones. I have tabled it for discussion because I believe that it is
not the business of government or of Parliament to change by
legislation the long accepted meaning of words. As has already been
said, the proposed change recalls Alice in Wonderland or, indeed,
Orwell’s Newspeak. Certainly the meaning of words evolves, and
sometimes changes direction almost completely. This, however, does not
justify changing known meanings by law. To do so undermines confidence
in all generally accepted meanings. It devalues language and the
honesty of spoken and written
meanings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T15:09:57"></hs_TimeCode>. On
those grounds, I appeal to the Government and those behind the Bill to
have second thoughts.</hs_para>

should say something about the word “Union” in my
amendment. It is a strong and honourable word. For example, the union
between Scotland, England and Wales has been a strong one, originally
uniting the Crowns and later the Parliaments of the two countries. I
trust that it will not end in divorce. The United States 
<?notus-xml column=12?>has similarly stood the test of time and survived a terrible civil war.

“espousal” would be appropriate to describe the

such an expression is a little archaic and may not convey permanence or
lifelong qualities. I submit that “Union” is a better and
stronger word and has wholly honourable connotations. To have two
different words to describe two very different kinds of relationship
would be far clearer. It would also make things far more
straightforward for teachers, parents and others who have to explain
relationships to young people.</hs_para>

constitutional reasons, believing that it was not right to seek to vote

implicit in the speech of the most reverend Primate the 
<?notus-xml column=13?>Archbishop of Canterbury, and it was certainly explicit in mine and in a
number of others, that there should be a new definition for same-sex
relationships which goes profoundly beyond civil partnerships and the
civil privileges that that arrangement brings. A number of us referred
to “union”, which the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, has
clearly defined in his speech. Like him, I regard this amendment as a
probing one. Indeed, I hope there will not be any votes during
Committee on this Bill. This House is at its best when it reflects on
the Committee stage and then votes, where appropriate, on Report. I

Lords in all parts of the Committee that surely we can find it within
us to come up with a definition which gives to those who want to make a
lifelong commitment to a same-sex relationship the same thing which
marriage gives to heterosexual couples. As became clear during the
debate a fortnight ago, there are differences that cannot be eradicated
by the change of a name. The union between two men or two women can
never be the same, in actuality or potential, as the union between a
man and a woman. We all have to give and take in a debate of this
nature. I would not only be content with, but would welcome, my
church—the Church of England—blessing same-sex unions,
and therefore giving them a recognition and permanence that they do not
currently enjoy.</hs_para>

parts of the House who are themselves gay—a number made very
moving and powerful speeches in the last debate—to recognise
that there is a strong feeling in this country that the relationship
between a man and a woman is marriage and should remain marriage, and
that we should look for some other definition beyond civil partnership
for same-sex relationships. Whether there is a majority or not for that
I do not know; only a referendum would tell. It is in that spirit,
which I hope is one of understanding and tolerance, that I commend this
amendment to your Lordships’ House, and hope that we can discuss
it and perhaps come back to it on Report. I cannot speak for the noble
Lord, Lord Hylton, but for my part, if another word was preferred to
“Union” I would not object at all. “Union”
is a good word—an honourable word of long estate—but
something that can and should be seriously considered by your

some have written to me more than once. They differ from the sorts of
letters one gets on these occasions in that they are all clearly
written from the heart. Equally, there are those who feel strongly the

said at Second Reading that I intended to sound out the House on
whether there would be much support for that nomenclature, and now I

reason that I want to persist in the suggestion that there should be a
different word for same-sex unions is largely to do with
reconciliation. This measure has excited more public interest and
reaction than any other measure that I can recollect in recent times,
and there is undoubtedly a widespread feeling among a large mass of our
fellow citizens—decent people who are not remotely driven by
prejudice—that, as the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, and I said at
Second Reading, there is a fundamental physical difference 
<?notus-xml column=15?>between the two unions. It is not a difference either of status or
esteem; nor a difference of stability or love, but none the less, it is
a fundamental difference. What is quite interesting is that a number of
the letters I have received have taken me up on the point that not all
heterosexual unions have procreative potential. If a couple are coming
together aged 96, there is not likely to be procreative potential. The
same goes if one of the couple is unfortunately sterile. However, that

we do not want a rumbling continuance of objection which could

of a different word. I would be willing to accept “union”

word “matrimony”, proposed in Amendment 46—which

noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury has said. In my speech at Second
Reading, I said that there is a great difference between a definition
in law and the real meaning of words. This is one that troubles me
considerably. I agree with him that Amendment 46, in the name of the
noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster, suggests a way forward
particularly because the word “matrimony” in the Oxford
English Dictionary derives from the Latin word “mater”,
which means “mother”, and therefore has the meaning of
children related to it. Whether or not a marriage produces children is,
in a sense, irrelevant. The meaning of the word is there, and it is
there for a particular purpose.</hs_para>

as marriages between a man and a woman. As the noble Lord, Lord
Cormack, said, there still remain some ineluctable differences between
the two kinds of marriage. The law will need to recognise, and be able
to provide for, this distinction. The Bill already shows that some of
the existing legislative provisions which apply to marriage, as we have
known it, cannot apply to marriages between same-sex couples, although
we should want them still to apply to marriages between a man and a
woman. My amendment proposes that, for the purposes of the law,
marriages between a man and a woman should be 
<?notus-xml column=17?>“matrimonial marriages”. This would mean no change in the

are precedents for a qualifying adjective for certain kinds of

not I think in English law—there used to be morganatic
marriages, where a man and a woman were lawfully married but the
children of the marriage were disqualified from inheriting the
father’s hereditary honours. The amendment which I am proposing
would provide a convenient means of distinguishing in legislation,
where necessary, between marriages of a man and a
woman—matrimonial marriages—and marriages of same-sex
couples. The word and concept of marriage would apply to both kinds of
marriage, but the amendment would provide a serviceable legal
distinction for one kind of marriage. It implies no moral, ethical or
value-based judgment, or discrimination, between the two kinds of
marriage. I commend it to the

precipitous. It has been just the same in Holland since 2001, and also

often influenced by issues of conscience. Speaking for myself, I have

marriage in the Bill that confronts us today. I voted against

the noble Lord, Lord Dear, because I believe that the House had a duty
to look scrupulously at and scrutinise carefully every detail of this
complicated Bill. I also believe that it was wrong to try to nullify a

on a free vote. Since then, I have had to confront the outcome of that

my view, marriage has been for a long time the foundation of family
life in this country and elsewhere. In that case, I believe that it is
indeed a framework for procreation and the raising of
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T15:40:35"></hs_TimeCode>. As we
all know, among mammals, human beings take longer to reach maturity
than virtually any other creature on the planet. It takes between 15
and 18 years for a child to mature—if one takes an optimistic
view—and I think many of us recognise that nowadays the actual
figure may be well over 20. What that means is that we are looking at a
very different proposition from other mammals. We are looking at what
has to be a very large part of a life’s commitment to raise
children properly, which is a very substantial factor that we have not
yet considered
sufficiently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000107">As
my noble friend Lord Alderdice has pointed out, the evidence from
social workers and psychiatrists suggests—I will not put it more
strongly than that—that it looks as if a marriage between a man
and a woman is probably the best and most stable basis for raising
children that we have so far invented. I would also suggest that there
is another factor than simply the biological one. Of course, we know
that there is a biological difference between the genders but it is
also critical to say that there is a difference between the approaches
of the genders to a whole range of issues. As the famous American
writer Carol Gilligan pointed out in her book, <I>In a Different
Voice</I>, women and men 
<?notus-xml column=19?>approach relationships, and very often their relationships with the
whole of society, rather differently; above all, they complement one
another. That is the basis of what is known in the churches as holy
matrimony and something that we have to consider very carefully
indeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000108">Traditional
marriage also gives equal value to parents of both genders. In a moving
statement yesterday, Mr Lammy, the Member of Parliament for
Tottenham, pointed out that there had been a serious devaluation of the
role of fathers in our society, citing his own experience as the child
of a single-parent family. Today hundreds of thousands of
children—more than 1 million—are being brought up without
fathers or mothers or another permanent, loving or male presence.
Single-parent families often display truly amazing—indeed,
nearly miraculous—commitment to their children. Many of them are
the breadwinners as well as the main carers for their families. I am
often breathless with amazement at the extraordinary courage and
dedication that the heads of single-parent families bring to that duty.
But often they find it utterly exhausting to try to handle the whole
burden on their own. That is not to condemn in any way single-parent
families but to say loudly and clearly that the role of fathers should
once again be sustained by the state and by society because they are
such a crucial element in sustaining a long-lasting and loving family
between two
parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000109">However,
of course there is a different side to the argument. The most reverend
Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury said that he had been stunned by
the quality of some of the relationships between gay men and lesbian
women that he had come across. I accede to that completely. Among my
own friends, some of the most remarkable examples of human union that I
have ever come across are between my gay and lesbian friends and their
partners. Therefore, why should there be any difference in the
nomenclature? The distinction is perhaps best made by pointing out the
very different roles, as has been done already by several speakers in
this debate, of a marriage that is based on the outcome of
procreation—the long-term maturing of children—and a
relationship that is based on the huge, total and intimate relationship
between two people who wish to live their lives
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000110">Quite
straightforwardly, the churches have a great responsibility in being

nomenclature describing different levels and different kinds of
commitment should not be part of this Bill. I strongly urge that we

the Chamber this afternoon, it never occurred to me that there might be
something original to be said. Having listened, however, to all the
speeches thus far, it seems to me that it is original to point out that
the very purpose of this Bill—its underlying objective—is
inclusivity; it is sameness; it is to eliminate, so far as possible,
any differentiation in regard and in treatment of same-sex couples from
heterosexual couples. It is to give same-sex couples the exact same
status, benefits, comfort, joys, estimation, reputation—call it
what one will—of marriage. The Bill is so called and the
Explanatory Notes make that
plain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T15:47:17"></hs_TimeCode>. With the

truth, this is a root-and-branch attack on the Bill, almost in the same

speak at Second Reading—I was in fact celebrating my own golden

of Berwick was among those who joined me in the celebration. He says
today that to talk of civil unions, instead of using the language of
marriage would be, and I think I quote him accurately, “to give
the gay community what it so obviously desires”. With the best
will in the world, it would not. They have civil partnerships. It is

in 1836? I am sorry to pontificate about matters that are well known to
many distinguished lawyers in this House but before 1882 and
the Married Women’s Property Act of that year, a married woman
could not hold substantial property in her own name. She could hold
what I think was called her “paraphernalia” but other
property became the property of her husband and she herself was
essentially a chattel of her husband’s estate. Immediately after
that Act of 1882, could anybody say that marriage had not changed at

these changes has substantially altered the institution of marriage.
Prior to 1991 a husband could rape his wife provided they were still
living together and no separation order had been made by a court. Was

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> That is absolutely true. That is the
assumption made in the <I>Book of Common Prayer</I>, which, as I
understand it—I am a Welsh Presbyterian—says that there
are three justifications for marriage. The first is the procreation of
children, the second is the avoidance of the temptations of fornication
and adultery, and the third is that there should be a lifelong
relationship based on love, affection and respect. The first
justification has been dealt with very properly by the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips of Sudbury. Many people who are young and capable of
procreating children now get married on the understanding that there
will be no children in their relationship. Does one say that their
union is less than a union of marriage? On the third point, about the
creation of a lifelong union based on love, affection, respect and
mutual dedication, is there a fundamental difference between that and
the institution of marriage, as we say now? Nothing that I have said
can prove the matter one way or the other. However, I make the obvious
point that marriage is not an immutable institution. It has become
elongated and greatly changed over the years, and will be changed
again. Is it not possible to accommodate within that change the term
“marriage” for people of the same
sex<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T15:57:03"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000125">I
make one last point with regard to union. The noble Lord, Lord Hylton,
said that there was a union of Scotland, England and Wales. It was
never a union in relation to Wales, as I am the noble Lord, Lord
Elis-Thomas, will agree. The preface to the Act of Union says the
country, dominion and principality of Wales is now and always has been

which I approach these matters. Many of those who have spoken already
come from a strong religious tradition, which I fully respect, and
which drives many of their views. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Brown, has said, the main purpose of the Bill is to enable same-sex
couples to marry, either in a civil ceremony or, provided that the

once in relation to Amendments 7, 8, 9, 34 and 46. All are based on the
idea that there is something called “traditional
marriage”, defined as the union of one man and one woman for
life to the exclusion of all others. What they mean by
“traditional marriage”—as the noble Lord, Lord
Elystan-Morgan, indicated in referring to the <I>Book of Common
Prayer</I>—is a form of marriage that is biblically ordained in
the Judeo-Christian tradition, which is a theistic tradition, although
it does not represent the thinking of many Christians or Jews or many
of those of no religious belief who are not affronted by the notion of
same-sex marriage. Under the Bill, Christian churches, Orthodox Jews,
Sikhs and Muslims are well protected from the risk of liability.
However, that does not satisfy the movers of these amendments, who seek
to write into the statute book a lesser status for same-sex marriage
than for opposite-sex marriage by calling it “civil
union” or some other term.</hs_para>

amendments of this character. They would suffer from the serious vice
of encouraging a belief in a need for a second-class status for
same-sex couples to be enshrined in English law. If the House divides
now or hereafter, I will have to vote against any of

Black of Brentwood:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support what the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood, said. He
crystallised exactly what the debate about this group of amendments is
about. The rationale behind this Bill, the philosophy that underpins
it, is the concept of equality of marriage. Without wishing to go over
the same old ground that to a large degree we went over at Second
Reading, the point is that gay people simply want the right to share in
the same institutions, not the same institutions that are qualified in
some way or another. With due respect to those who say that there is
not much in it, there is a great deal in a name and it is much more
than a matter of nomenclature, which I think is the phrase the noble
Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, referred
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000143">Words such
as “union” and “espousal” will themselves
turn rapidly into divisive terms. If I fill out one of those forms at a
bank or somewhere else and they say: “Are you married?”,
and I have to say: “No, I am espoused”, I shall feel in
exactly the same state I was in under the existing law of civil
partnerships. Therefore we do not want simply to replace one
second-division label with another. I think that the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips, was the first to raise the issue of esteem. I have to tell
noble Lords that the issue of esteem and the use of the word
“marriage”, unqualified by anything else, are
inextricably
linked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000144">I

well of our proceedings. A number of people wrote to say that we gave
them the courage to come out. That is a remarkable thing. However, this
amendment flies in the face of all that. It is a wolf of an amendment
in sheep’s clothing. It strikes at the heart of the Bill and

what same-sex couples are asking for is not permission from the state
to enter into loving, committed, lifelong relationships but the
recognition by the state that the relationships they have entered into,
or will enter into, are equally valid in bringing stability to society
and in being a right and proper place for the upbringing of the
children they take into their families. Therefore, anything other than
marriage, which we have all said is the bedrock of our society and

all that seems to be left of the definition is that marriage should be
between a man and a woman. Traditionally that has been indisputably
true. How could it have been otherwise? Until very recently,
homosexuality was punished by the full force of the law: incarceration,
a criminal record, chemical castration in many cases, and almost total
social exclusion. Of course marriage traditionally was between a man

the definition does not hold water. There is no satisfactory definition
in the amendments of traditional marriage. Going back in time, we find
that marriage was about inheritance, power, social standing and
securing property rights. Those with no power or little social standing
did it to make it easier to have sex—let us be honest. It is
only in our lifetimes that marriage has been broadly based on love and
any sense of equality between a man and a woman. Even today, there are
still many exceptions to that
rule<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:13:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000151">Marriage
has always changed its foundations. It evolves and will continue to do
so. I have considerable sympathy for many of the values that lie behind
the amendments. For instance, we have all suffered for too long from
the intolerance exemplified in political correctness. However, with the
greatest respect to many of my colleagues, we cannot base a piece of
legislation on a concept of traditional marriage that has no
enforceable
meaning.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/C8064C36CBC6EE18C2C7E4F9410E78AE47AC90B8" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 June 2013">Monday,

marriage—as it has been referred to—and same-sex
marriage, which the Government recognise in Schedule 4, Part 2 and Part
3 of the Bill. The word “marriage” is used to cover both.
The noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, may be interested to know that
I did not attach my name to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord
Hylton, and my noble friend Lord Cormack precisely because I thought
that, having been as outspoken as I was at Second Reading, I would be
accused of trying to undermine the principle of the Bill in some other

a marriage of a man and a woman and a marriage of two men or two women.
I am staying well clear of the symbolism and the aspirations. I am
simply stating a fact. My noble friend Lord Dobbs said that we must
address the political correctness which has concerned and dominated us
for too long. I want to agree with him but in a different context. When
this House and the other place have passed legislation around religious
hate crimes, racial hate crimes and the like, once the well-meaning,
carefully written legislation was subjected to general use, those whose
sense of political correctness exceeded that of most of us in this
Chamber got to work. People, employees and workers, particularly in the
public sector, were accused of all sorts of things in the name of that
legislation and in many cases it took them months and a fortune to
prove that what they were accused of was not in accordance with the law

exception taken by a number of our noble friends and others to the term
“traditional marriage”. The term “same-sex

However, there are two well known terms in the history of the Church of
England which do not carry any such connotations, each of which I think
might appeal especially to the predilections of the two confronted
parties—that is, “ancient” and
“modern”. I do not know whether he would consider

we are talking about here is legislation for same-sex marriage, and

of the legislation. That cannot be acceptable. If it were
pressed, I certainly would not vote for
“marriage” to be replaced by some other word. In fact, I
cannot think of a word that would be at all suitable, because marriage
is what we are talking about—marriage between same-sex couples,
which we have already agreed in principle with a very large vote at
Second Reading. I certainly do not want to repeat a Second Reading
speech, although one could say quite a lot about traditional marriage
because that also has been referred to in the debate. As far as I am
concerned, the wording that was before us as concerns traditional
marriage is very much based on a religious outlook, which I respect but
do not share; and certainly it has a provision for a kind of opposition
to divorce, which I do not share. Of course, I imagine that very many
people in this House at some time have been in a divorce court and
therefore would not qualify under the traditional marriage position
outlined in some of the amendments before this House.</hs_para>

started, prenuptial contracts were of little or no value. It was
considered repugnant to public policy to contemplate the breakdown of a
contract that is meant to be for life. A few years ago, the Supreme
Court decided that there had to be very good reasons not to hold a man

Higgins:</Member></B> My Lords, two themes have run through the debate.
On one there is almost universal agreement that we must seek to achieve
equality. We also have to recognise that there are differences between
the two forms of marriage. Having said that—and I am sorry that
I do not carry the noble Lord, Lord Alli, with me—it seems to me
that we need effectively to recognise both the need for equality and
the point that I have just made. I led from the Front Bench on the
Civil Partnership Bill, which was a great step forward. None the less,
it is perhaps unfortunate that its terminology did not recognise the
aspect of equality, and it has certainly not been recognised by the
country as a whole. What we need, therefore, is some recognition that
there are two forms of marriage. If we do that, marriage will appear on
both sides of the equation, representing equality. As suggested in
Amendment 34, we need to have traditional marriage on the one hand, and
same-sex marriage on the other. If we do that, we can achieve both of
the objectives we seek, and reconcile the differences which have
otherwise been apparent in the debate. One hopes that both the gay
community and the community as a whole will recognise the status of
these two forms of marriage as equal. I see no reason why this can not

Noakes:</Member></B> My Lords, normally I agree with everything my
noble friend Lord Higgins says. I am in profound disagreement with him
today. He has emphasised that he believes that marriages between
same-sex couples and heterosexual couples are different. There are all
kinds of marriages that are different: marriages between divorced
people; marriages with and without children; death-bed marriages.
However, we do not find different terms for those. Noble Lords need to
ask themselves serious questions about why they wish to continue to
emphasise sexual orientation in the names that they give certain
statuses. By perpetuating giving a different name to marriage in the
context of gay and lesbian people, we are wishing to continue to regard
them as different from us. Inclusion is what this Bill is about, and
what we should be about in society generally, because that is what will
make us a stronger

Singh of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, the legislation itself
refers to two different types of marriage. It is there in how it is
written. I am concerned that the 
<?notus-xml column=32?>attempt to find some common ground between deep divisions is being
interpreted as some sort of wrecking amendment. The idea of union is
fine; it says everything. I cannot see any difference. The English
language is very rich in giving precision to meaning, but sometimes it
is not precise enough. We do not want to make it less precise. For
example, the Indian languages Hindi and Punjabi have different words
for “uncle” and “aunt” depending on which
side of the couple they come from, the mother’s or the
father’s. These words give precision so that you know what you
are talking about. Here, if you use the words “union” and
“marriage”, that is fine; we know what we are talking
about. There is nothing to suggest that one is less equal than the
other, which would be totally

this debate, perhaps I may try to say a brief word on behalf of
children. Many gay relationships—civil partnerships—have
children within them. If anybody believes that within a gay
relationship it is simple to create a family, they should think again
and talk to some of those families. For both gay women and, perhaps
more particularly, for gay men, having children by adoption is a most
formidable task and one that is scrutinised with great care.

attempt to deal with this sort of thing in the descriptions given in
the myth busters document that was published along with the Bill did
not really look at the main objection that people have, which is the
fact that, over many centuries, marriage has signified a relationship
between the opposite sexes. That is the fundamental point which a lot
of people have grasped and held on to, in a way that is difficult for
them to accommodate in any other context. When the myth busters got
going, they used a technique which I remember being described by the
great advocate Sir Milner Holland to the effect that if you cannot
answer a point, the best thing to do is to set up a cockshy as close to
the point as possible, knock it down with a great flurry and then pass
on. That, in effect, is what has happened. The myth buster talks about
the myth of having no development in marriage over the years. Anyone
who has listened to this debate or read the volume to which the noble
Lord, Lord Pannick, referred at Second Reading will know that there
have been many developments in marriage over the years. The idea that
there have been none is not the foundation of the argument at all;
rather, it is that the fundamental distinction is between a marriage
where the relationship is between people of opposite sexes and what is
proposed in this Bill.</hs_para>

suggest that this legislation is an exercise in ideological
redefinition. The amendments before us today are designed to limit this
ideological damage. I will speak to the one amendment that probably
does it better than the others. The legislation does not address the
concrete disadvantages from which same-sex couples still suffer. It is
a matter of deep personal regret and sorrow to me that homosexual
people are still diminished, which is anathema to me and to the
Primates of the Anglican Communion. In the 2005 Dromantine
communiqué, we said that the diminishing of homosexual people is
anathema to the Christian faith. However, it still happens, which is a
deep regret for me. I want to tell them that I am
sorry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000197">The
great difference between this legislation and the reform that
introduced civil partnerships is that the latter remedied certain
concrete difficulties and disadvantages. What injustice would be
remedied by some civil partnerships becoming marriages? That argument
of remedying injustices does not seem to carry much weight; the
argument lies somewhere else. Ministers of the Crown have argued that
the legislation extends to an excluded minority a concrete privilege
currently enjoyed by the majority. What is that privilege? The
privileges that accompany marriage have already been extended to
same-sex couples through civil partnership legislation. However, since
marriage has been defined in law and practice as a relationship between
a man and woman, marriage, as so defined, cannot in law be extended to
same-sex couples.</hs_para>

an extension of something that already exists but the creation of a new

quite different from

individual freedoms in the face of a radically new ideology. The church
shares, in the best traditions of this House, a passion for justice and
a deep concern for the particular needs of minorities. These concerns
have been met in the provisions of the civil partnership legislation.
However, today, the question turns on two other interests of the
church: first, an interest in the truthful description of anything;
and, secondly, an interest in defending responsible practices of
government against the sophistic abuse of
language.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000200">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:54:27"></hs_TimeCode>

As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:54:27"></hs_TimeCode> a Christian,
I would argue that being a man or a woman is not incidental to the
human relations a person may engage in, but formative of them. In
Christian understanding, the meaning of human sexual difference is in
the good gift of God in creation. The maleness and femaleness of the
human race are given to us. It is where we are placed, in common with
the whole human race in every generation. Our role is to be thankful
for it and to understand how it helps us to live the human lives that
we are given. This task of appreciating our sexual difference weighs
equally on married and unmarried, on gay and straight, and on children
and adults—on all who have the gift of being human. Christians,
in common with Jews and Muslims, understand marriage as essentially
representative of this good gift of sexual difference. This
understanding flows from an undivided and unbroken tradition that has
sought to define the unity of the human race, uniting nations,
religions, cultural traditions and periods of
history.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000201">In
describing marriage as bound up constitutively and generatively with
male-female relations, we describe a good form of life for which we can
be unreservedly thankful. As with any aspect of creation, our
interpretation of marriage is not final. Reality is deeper than its
interpretation; there is always more to be learnt. Our thinking may be
shaped by artists, working in
whatever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:54:51"></hs_TimeCode> form,
who represent to us some fragment of reality to be recognised. It will
be shaped also by scientists, who model complex interactions and
observations in formulae that render them intelligible. It may also be
shaped by theologians, teaching us to thematise that which artists and
scientists have shown within the larger picture of the goodness of
God.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000202">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:58:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
unamended legislation uses the term “marriage” to
describe a new entity. For me this entity is worthy in itself, but it
is not equivalent to marriage as hitherto described. I have argued that
this is not an area for state intervention. The work of government does
not lie in teaching us how to interpret and think about reality. Yet we
are here. The trouble with this 
<?notus-xml column=36?>undifferentiated use of the term “marriage” is that it
will create confusion on the one hand, and erode freedom of conscience
on the other. The amendment of the noble and learned Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:55:55"></hs_TimeCode> Mackay,
seeks to remedy this. It calls both same-sex marriage and opposite-sex
marriage
“marriage”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000203">In
contrast<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>, the
legislation to create civil partnerships was, for me, a proper exercise
in formal terms of the authority of government. That legislation was
precise in its use of language. It recognised the intrinsic difference
between the loving, life-long commitment of same-sex couples and the
loving, life-long commitment of male and female couples in marriage. I
respectfully submit that those who sought to extend the scope of civil
partnerships beyond same-sex couples would have made the legislation
lack legal clarity. Its intention would have been blurred, if not
thwarted. Those who resisted the extension of civil partnerships beyond
same-sex couples were right, because it would have blurred the entire
conversation and the entire
discussion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061712000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0001.htm#13061712000204">Without<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

introduce a degree of ambiguity that is not common in law. This cannot
help anyone, because Clause 11 still refers to “opposite
sex”. We must be very careful about how we arrive at an answer.
Responsible government is government under law. A responsible
Government must prevent, as far as they can, the judgment that the law
is an ass. I believe that fracturing the law of marriage into two
alternative concepts of marriage inevitably inflicts damage of very
serious proportions on English law, weakening the authority of the law
as a whole. This damage can be lessened by the very honest amendment of
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. This amendment seeks clarity
and makes an important distinction. If it is accepted, as I sincerely
hope it will be, it will go some way towards preserving the integrity
of the law. I support the amendment, and I hope the House will have the

England. This matter will need to be discussed. Incidentally, I am one
of those who has gone on record as saying that had civil partnerships
been given enough space, the church would not have escaped the
possibility of a conversation. What do you do with people in same-sex

happened with this Bill. I support the noble and learned Lord, Lord

an attempt at reconciliation. I do not support the word
“union” for the very sensible reasons that have been

we added the words “traditional marriage” to the Bill, we

and I should like to speak to it now. I have a great deal of sympathy
with what the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said. She

comment about the difference between equality and sameness, and we
touched on that at Second Reading. What we have heard today has, very
largely, been two alternative points of view. One is that out of civil
partnership might have arisen something which itself would grow into
the dignification of something similar to marriage, and the other is a
fusion—which is what the Bill is really talking about—of
two completely different strands into the one nomenclature of marriage.
It is that point that I wanted to mention in introducing Amendment 9
and to offer a way forward—a compromise to where we are

different opinion. Much has been said about protecting churches and
individual clergy from being forced to officiate at same-sex marriages.

the Bill includes provisions that the matrimonial laws of the Church of
England will be largely unaffected. In other words, the church law of
marriage will remain in place. This is especially important because the
Church of England has a unique privilege as the established church and
a special common-law duty to provide services of marriage to people in
parishes throughout the land. I know that the church is grateful for
the steps taken by the Government in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:15:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Time
will tell whether those protections will stand the evitable challenges
of the UK and European courts. Some of us are not altogether optimistic
in that regard. Be that as it may, the Government’s intention is
that the canon law of the Church of England remains intact.</hs_para>

That is a good and right principle that has widespread support in your
Lordships’ House and in the country at large. That being the
case, should we not also apply it to the non-established churches, to
places of worship of a non-Christian faith and to couples who wish to
enter into a marriage as traditionally defined? Under the Bill, a
couple wishing to marry according to the current legal definition of
marriage can technically do so only in a Church of England church. If
betrothed couples wish to marry in a nonconformist church, a
non-Christian place of worship or in a civil setting, they will be
forced to use the new—let us call it
gender-neutral—definition of marriage. For people of faith, deep
questions of conscience arise, especially as that new definition of
marriage will be the one used in the service of worship. This is

are unlikely for the time being to be forced to marry people of the

marry people according to the new definition, which is what I want to

the non-Christian faiths and the couples themselves are being forced to
publicly declare that their relationship equates to a new,
gender-neutral definition. For many people—perhaps that 98% I
mentioned—that is absolutely not what they want. It contradicts
their most deeply held religious or philosophical beliefs. They want to
enter into a marriage that accords to their own understanding of
marriage and their most deeply held beliefs. That perhaps is not an

parties that there is no lawful impediment to marriage and that each

It may be said that some people are free to attach their own meanings
to their own marriages and can use whatever additional words or
promises they want, but that is missing the point. The key element of
marriage is that the couple are making a public declaration that they
are married. That requires a public declaration of what marriage is,

their faith or beliefs. My amendment addresses this problem in a very
simple, reasonable and non-destructive way. For marriages outside the
Church of England, it introduces an optional form of words for the
solemnisation of a marriage, which reflects the current legal
definition of marriage—that is, the definition that is currently

same-sex marriage in any way; it does not take away Clause 1 of the

to register a definition of marriage that reflects their
beliefs—which are universally respected throughout the world,
and, if I may say so, throughout history. With this amendment,
non-established churches and those of other faiths at least have the
option to offer couples a declaration of marriage that is acceptable to
their beliefs and publicly recognised. It will be a significant help to
those faith
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:21:20"></hs_TimeCode>. Put

country to follow pretty well exactly the same steps that we took in
legislating, and that two years on it is now in a position to measure
the results. The results are huge in terms of unintended consequences.

very much agree with that, too. The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of
Ilminster, wants to use the term “matrimonial marriage”
for opposite sex-marriage. All these amendments are cut from the same
cloth with the same purpose: to create inequality in the use of the
term marriage between same-sex couples and opposite-sex couples. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Black of Brentwood, that these
amendments are wolves in sheep’s clothing, designed to preserve
marriage and the use of the term exclusively for opposite-sex couples,
with the exception of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Dear, which

uncomfortable with the references we have heard to a new definition of
marriage. As I understand it, the aim of the Bill is to enable same-sex
couples to share in the existing understanding and status of marriage.
My understanding of my marriage is not primarily gender-based; it is
based on the fact that I love my wife and wish to stay with her for the
rest of my life. That has nothing to do with

I would love to find a compromise—I am a compromising sort of
person, and I very much welcome the recognition of my noble and learned
friend Lady Butler-Sloss that the word “marriage” is
essential in whatever we end up with—but I find it extremely
hard to imagine any compromise that would not formalise the idea that
there are two different forms of marriage. Therefore, I tend to agree

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, we have had a long and interesting
debate about the definition of marriage and about this group of
amendments. I accept fully that noble Lords are, with the best of
intentions, trying to find a way through. However, we on these Benches
think that the effect of all the amendments in this group would be the
same. All, in different ways, seek to enshrine in law a distinction
between what is referred to as “traditional marriage” or
“matrimonial marriage” and the new, statutory definition
of marriage that will be created under the Bill, which encompasses the
union of both opposite-sex and same-sex couples. Whether those who
tabled the amendments intended to or not, they were in effect making
two classes of marriage. Trying to find different
definitions—and in some cases, I fear, jealously guarding the
word “marriage” for heterosexual couples—suggests
that one form of marriage is inferior to another and that flies in the
face of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:36:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Shackleton, in her excellent speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes,

who tabled the amendments have a strong personal belief about marriage,

undermine those rights for individuals in relation to their belief
about the appropriate nature of marriage. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Richardson, said, its purpose is to provide for the state to recognise
equally the relationships of couples, regardless of whether they are
between members of the same sex or of opposite sexes, who wish to make
a loving and lifelong commitment to each

inserting a distinction between same-sex and opposite-sex marriage back
into statute, whether by describing one as a “union”, as
Amendment 1 would do, or as matrimonial marriage requiring special

noble Lords. I think more than 30 noble Lords have contributed to this
debate on the first group of amendments. We have covered quite a lot of
ground and I hope noble Lords will forgive me if I start by reminding
the House about the purpose of this Bill. All the amendments in this
group go to the heart of the Bill. I acknowledge the point that my
noble friend has just made and I will address his specific amendment
and others in turn in a moment. The Bill, in part, is about
safeguarding the future of the vital institution of marriage by making

of your Lordships’ House has helped create, and which younger
generations value and want to see extended.</hs_para>

here is the acceptance of gay men and lesbian women for who they are.
That means accepting their relationships on the same terms
as we accept all relationships. I hope noble Lords will
forgive me if I refer back to a couple of points I made at Second
Reading. Clearly, I will not go over all the points I made then. The
arrival of civil partnerships had a profound effect on how we, as a
society, look at and consider gay couples. Civil partnerships allowed
us to see that gay men and lesbian women want to be together for
exactly the same reasons as straight couples. I know some noble Lords
usually refer to the inability of gay couples to procreate as a way of
saying that there must be a difference there because there is a
physical difference. However, as other noble Lords have said today and
in other debates, that is not a fair distinction. There are couples of
the opposite sex for whom procreation is not an option. The longer
George Clooney waits to pop the question, the less likely it is that
that might be an option for me. If he were ever to extend his hand in
marriage to me, I would not want noble Lords to diminish my union with
him on the basis that procreation was not a
possibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061721000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061721000005">We
understand that gay couples take their union—I use that word in
the broadest sense, rather than specifically in response to the noble
Lord, Lord Hylton—as seriously as a man and a woman who want to
get married. That is why we have become accepting of them and, for many
of us, why we are so comfortable with the idea of gay couples marrying
just like the rest of us. I know many noble Lords have said today that
there is a minority—some describe it as a
majority—outside this House, and indeed there are some inside
this House, who do not feel so comfortable. Of course I understand
that. However, the evidence shows that the majority of people are quite
content for marriage to be extended to gay couples. It is worth
reminding ourselves of the speech that my noble friend Lord Norton of
Louth made towards the end of Second Reading, when he went through all
the various evidence out there. He made the very striking point that
among the younger generation there is very high support for and
acceptance of gay marriage.</hs_para>

reminding ourselves that we can see that gay men and women
do not want to change marriage. They just want to be part of something
that they, too, believe is important to our society. In terms of the
current legislation and civil partnerships, if 
<?notus-xml column=48?>someone asks a gay man or a lesbian woman whether they are married, to
be really accurate they have to say, “Sort of”. They are
not legally married, yet they want to be able to say yes. As my noble

is very important.</hs_para>

reverend Primate the Archbishop of York outlined very powerfully his
belief in marriage. I welcome him back to your Lordships’ House.
In response to him and to all noble Lords, it is important to say that
it is vital that religious faiths remain free to practise in accordance
with their doctrines. If, for them, that means that marriage is between
a man and a woman, that is their fundamental right and the Bill does
not change that. It is vital that people can believe that marriage
should be between a man and a woman and be able to say that that is
what they believe. Again, the Bill allows that, but in allowing gay men
and lesbian couples to be married in civil ceremonies or by those
religious faiths who choose to, the Government are clear that it is not
right to distinguish between their status as married from that of
marriages between a man and a woman. All of these amendments would

Amendment 1 in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and my noble
friend Lord Cormack. This has been commented on by several noble Lords.
It goes to the heart of the Government’s policy intention in the
Bill. It amends the first word in the first line so that a new
institution of “union” would be created for same-sex
couples. We disagree with that on principle but I note that it has
attracted limited support from around the House. Amendment
2, in the name of my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern,
while apparently less stark, has a similar intention of
creating a subdivision of marriage by referring to “marriage
(same-sex couples)” as a separate concept. My noble and learned
friend argued that this distinction is necessary because until now
marriage has been between a man and a woman only. My noble friend Lord
Dobbs made the important point that the reason why marriage
has been able to be only between a man and a woman until now is that
the law has not allowed otherwise and because of the way in which we
have considered gay people. I will return to my noble friend’s
other amendments on the effect of terms in law because that comes a bit

more limited, amendment, but I think it has some importance. I had
tabled it really as a probing amendment to try to get a clear answer
from my noble friend who will be responding as to why clergy within the
definition of the Bill are limited to clergy of the Church of England
and the Church in Wales. Of 
<?notus-xml column=54?>course, one understands this in the case of the Church of England; it is
the established church of the land. Welsh disestablishment happened a
long time ago. It seems to me that there is one church in this country
that deserves to be mentioned in the same clause: the Roman Catholic
Church. I know very well that there are clear and honourable
differences of opinion within the three churches. We heard eloquent
speeches both today and on Second Reading from the noble Baroness, Lady
Richardson, to indicate that she, as a former president of the
Methodist Conference, takes a line that is clearly at variance with the
official line of the Church of England and the Roman Catholic

but the Roman Catholic Church has made its position clear and
unambiguous. That deserves recognition, and the priests of the Roman
Catholic Church deserve the same degree of protection that is rightly
being accorded to priests of the established church. It is in that

this House. We have come a long way since then. I ask the Committee and
the Government that where 
<?notus-xml column=57?>there is no mischief that they can identify please do not seek to remedy

Berridge:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak briefly to Amendment
54, which is in my name, and, obviously, to government Amendment 53.
Much has been said in your Lordships’ House of the need to
preserve free speech but, as I outlined in my Second Reading speech,
the role of the state goes beyond that. To ensure free speech, there
has to be an encouragement and a protection of dissent in the public
space. I am grateful to my noble friend the Minister for bringing
forward Amendment 53, which was promised in the other place on Report,
and was a concern outlined in the recent report of the Joint Committee
on Human Rights that was published last Friday. I am a member of that
committee, and there were very divergent opinions on the principle of
the Bill, but we managed to come up with a report of the whole
committee about the concerns that remain about the Bill.</hs_para>

Government have brought forward this amendment to deal with some of the
concerns around free speech. It is particularly important when on our
statute book there are crimes that can be committed, with the force of
criminal law being brought 
<?notus-xml column=58?>to bear on them, when there is hate speech with a particular mens rea of
intending to stir up hatred against, for instance, somebody on the
grounds of sexual orientation. I draw attention to what the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, outlined: this is a necessary
safeguard when we look at what people on the ground are actually doing.
Members of the other place have already referred to an incident a few
weeks ago, when the police were called to a heated exchange around the
matters that we are considering. We have to bear in mind that the
effect of this legislation, and the potential effect on free speech,
has to be policed on our streets by ordinary police constables.
Amendment 53 ensures that they have clear guidance around what is and
is not a criminal offence. It specifically states the caveat that it is
not just about stating your belief that marriage is between one man and
one woman. It is allowing that criticism to take place and thereby not
breaching criminal law once the criticism is made. That dissent in the
public space is to be
welcomed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000010">In

place, around sexual orientation, same-sex marriage and racism. I am
surprised to see the nature of the exchanges we are having today. If
that is what ends up taking place in this debating Chamber, what will
be happening on our streets when passions get inflamed around this

Thornton speaking from the Front Bench and my noble friend Lord Alli
have argued, no doubt persuasively in their view, that the current
protections are adequate: the Equality Act is in place. However, in my
judgment that contention is belied, first, by the fact that a number of
leading counsel take a contrary view and say that the protections are
not adequate, and, secondly, by the fact of some of the cases, some of
which have already been cited. We will come to the registrar later, as
well as the chaplain to the police and other such cases. It would be
helpful if we could have a response from the Minister that these cases
would in fact have received protection under government Amendment 53

is, sometimes, the tyranny of the majority. We can refer to the
wonderful literature on this, such as by Mill and de Tocqueville. I

the tyranny of the majority. Surely, part of our duty is to
ensure—so far as we are able—that minorities are
protected. In this case, we seek to protect and to give dignity and
equal rights to a minority in our country. I would hope that those in

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My noble friend is playing on words
somewhat. At Second Reading there was much contention as to what the
majority opinion in this country was. In my judgment, the Government
carried out a fairly spurious, bogus consultation where they chose to
ignore a petition containing a very large majority which, had it been
added, would have shown a majority against the Bill. One chooses
one’s public opinion poll. My noble friend may choose one
particular poll; I may choose another, both of which bolster our
respective opinions. The point I am making is that my view of
traditional marriage—which is not just Christian marriage, but
that of a number of other confessions—is something worthy. It
should be protected, and those who espouse it should achieve
protections. That is important even if, say, 46 % of respondents to the
latest poll oppose this Bill. I do not know what overall public opinion
is.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061733000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000037">I would

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:43:03"></hs_TimeCode> shall move an
amendment later which suggests that, if the Government are so confident
that this represents majority opinion, they should hold a referendum,
given their record in other areas, such as the relatively trivial
transference of sometimes quite minimal provisions to the European
Union. This may 
<?notus-xml column=63?>not be relevant to this particular clause but, even if the views which I
and many other colleagues espouse are in the minority—and there
is some uncertainty about that—that minority deserves to be
protected. Those who have been a clamant minority and who have won
support during the passage of this Bill, should also be conscious of
the protection of other minorities, if that is what we
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:43:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

contention of my noble friend that the protections are adequate, let
him look at some of the cases that have been brought. It is sad that
there are many zealots on both sides of the argument—zealots who

ordinary, decent folk who find that they are the subject of litigation.
Not only are they in an agony of uncertainty in the intervening period
before their case comes to court, but it is also a very expensive
matter. With very limited resources, they may find that they are up
against very well-padded groups. That is the reality of these matters.
Whatever the legislative provisions, people on both sides will push at
the borders. I would urge my noble friend, consistent with the views
which he and I generally espouse in respect of minorities, to look
carefully to see that the tide has not run so far in one direction that

Singh of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendment
19, which is in my name and is part of this group of amendments. In
many ways, what I will say will mirror some of the things said by the
noble Lord, Lord Anderson. The Equality Act 2010 is meant to protect
against discrimination on the grounds of religion and belief. However,
anyone who has read about the cases that have come to court will know
that it has not always, to date, protected people with strong religious
beliefs about
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000050">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T18:56:07"></hs_TimeCode>

and sometimes ignorant authority. It is not easy to risk your career
prospects and your 
<?notus-xml column=66?>family’s livelihood. I know—I have been there. Lack of
clarity in the law adds to the difficulty. Those with traditional views
bringing discrimination claims under the religion or belief strand,
usually after being mistreated for a long time, have found that their
beliefs on sexual ethics were not covered. Amendment 19 would put
beyond doubt that belief in traditional marriage falls under the
religion or belief strand. It would not guarantee that every claim
brought to court would succeed but would simply confirm that the belief
is capable of being protected under the Equality
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000051">Millions

it comes to the issue of same-sex marriage, there is a real risk that

Everyone should be entitled to hold and express their views about this
important and sensitive issue without fear of punishment. We find
strong support for traditional marriage among politicians of all
stripes, lawyers, academics and workers from all walks of life in the
private and public sectors. We find it among atheists and people of all
religions, among heterosexuals and gay people. It would be sad if such
opinions were muffled or silenced by a lack of clarity in the law. Not
to respect and protect their ability to hold and express their beliefs
about marriage would result in a tyrannical situation where there was
only one acceptable view, with those with other views pushed out or
mistreated. Public space must be left for those millions of people.
There have already been many occasions when people who try to speak out

<?notus-xml column=67?>publicly in support of traditional marriage suffer for it, even while

should take steps to reverse the tide, here and now in this Bill. We
should make sure that mainstream traditional views are properly
respected and protected. Most ordinary people respect the belief that
marriage is between a man and a woman. This is hardly surprising. It is
what the law of the land currently states, and has stated for
centuries. It is the definition of marriage that predates both church
and state. It is the definition of marriage in many of our different
religions. It is the definition that dominates the globe.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> the 193
United Nations member states, only 14 recognise same-sex weddings. In
the 35 American states which have put it to the popular vote in the
past decade or so, 31 out of 35 voted to keep marriage as it is. Here
in the UK polls vary between 60% support for same-sex marriage and 70%
opposition to it, and they go up and down. This shows two things.
First, in polling the answer depends on the questions asked. Secondly,
we must agree that redefining marriage is controversial to say the
least, with millions of people on either side of the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000055">Clarity<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
in the law would help heal a clearly divided and fractured society.
There is divided opinion in this House and divided opinion throughout
the country. It is not a settled question; there is no consensus.
Therefore, we must ensure that those whose beliefs about marriage no
longer prevail are protected by the law. There is plenty of evidence of
the need for explicit statutory protection. Run a quick search through
Google and you will see astonishing name-calling and abuse directed at
people who simply support the Marriage Act

Lords might say that this is just name-calling, but history shows that
name-calling often leads to violent and threatening behaviour, and
worse. People who disdain those who support traditional marriage as

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, I will address Amendment 8 in
particular. At Second Reading, I said that my early life was spent in a
place where religious discrimination was the norm. It is something that
I 
<?notus-xml column=70?>managed to grow out of—after a very long time—and which I
find absolutely abhorrent. I also explained at Second Reading why, like
the noble Lord, Lord Alli, I know what it is like to suffer abuse
because of one’s sexuality. It is never so dispiriting as when
those two things are combined. Some of the most homophobic material
that is sent to me is in the name of churches. I find that more
depressing than anything
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061741000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061741000002">I was
raised in a religious household and I will defend the rights of people
to hold religious points of view and minority points of view. I will
defend their right to preach things that I find unacceptable and
disheartening. I cannot tell your Lordships how dispiriting it is to
listen to some preachers and to understand from their preaching how
little they think of their fellow human beings, but it is absolutely
their right to do that. But it is not their right to do that and to
inflame hatred and violence at the same time.</hs_para>

of your Lordships go to Gay Pride marches but I do, occasionally. Every
time I go to Brighton and have a wonderful time, there is a point when

something that I started to do many years ago, and still do as a

helpful way of getting to a universal understanding of what it means to

Stoddart of Swindon:</Member></B> My Lords, it is absolutely necessary
that some of these amendments should be on the Marshalled List. They
have been discussed at length today and will be discussed further. But
the fact remains that there is a perception that people will
be restrained from expressing their views about marriage
as a result of this Bill. The correspondence that I and many
others have received show that there is a very considerable
concern that people will be denied the freedom to criticise same-sex
marriage when this Bill goes through—I say “when this
Bill goes through” because it quite clearly will go through.
Therefore, it is right and proper that this House should ensure that
there are proper provisions to ensure free speech. There have been
instances where free speech has been guaranteed by Ministers but not
carried out by people in other walks of life and other areas of
employment.</hs_para>

concerned at the speed with which this Bill was introduced and is being
rushed through Parliament. They feel that there has been insufficient
public discussion of this very important Bill, which alters parts of
our constitution, and that it is being rushed through and their views
are not being properly taken into account. After all, we must recognise
that the percentage of gay couples is 1.5% and therefore 98.5% of the
population has to be taken into consideration as well. If people
disagree with this Bill, they must be able to express their opposition
after the Bill has been passed without fear of being dismissed or
otherwise harmed by their employers or having a policeman knock at the

wonder how much confusion there is about the fact that when we disagree
with each other, that is okay; that it is okay to disagree with each
other quite vehemently; and that it is all right to express
those vehement disagreements. Our view on these Benches is that the law
recognises that that is exactly right.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:19:53"></hs_TimeCode> took me back
to the passage of the Equality Act 2010, when the interventions of the
noble Lord, Lord Lester, made precisely the point that needed to be
made about the protections that existed. Those protections do exist.
The fact that they are tested from time to time, and that people on
both sides do silly things with them from time to time, does not mean
that they are not valid protections; they are very valid protections
indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:20:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061741000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061741000010">We
believe—and the Commons agreed in its debates—that there
is no need for additional protection under the Equality Act 2010. It is
not necessary. There is already protection for people’s
religious beliefs in law, which encompasses views about marriage. It
would also be invidious, because it would make the only specific belief
that has protection under this part of the Equality Act one that
defines marriage as being between a man and a woman. I will return to
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:20:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061741000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061741000011">It
is worth saying that Amendment 19 would make a particular viewpoint on
marriage, which could be held by people with or without religious
beliefs, the only belief that was expressly protected from
discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief, elevating it above
any other belief. This could have exactly the opposite effect to that
intended by the noble Lord, Lord Singh, since a person who believes
that the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman is
wrong would also be protected. Therefore, it may do exactly what the
noble Lord does not want it to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061741000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061741000012">As I said
during the debate, the Equality Act 2010 is a carefully considered
piece of legislation, which balances the rights of one protected group
against those of another. Sexual orientation and religion or belief are
both protected characteristics under the Equality Act, meaning that it
is illegal to discriminate against someone on the grounds of their
sexual orientation or their
religion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061741000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061741000013">The

the case of Ministers of Religion and other jobs which exist to promote

is completely clear that the law already exists to protect those views
and their expression. Religion and belief are protected characteristics
under the Act. It means that we cannot be discriminated against for

that the government amendment was necessary, as my noble friend Lord
Alli mentioned, but we understand that the Government are acting in
good faith on a commitment made by a Minister in another place.

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all noble
Lords who have spoken in this very important and helpful debate. May I
say first that I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, for
repeating what I said at Second Reading? The Bill absolutely makes it
lawful, and continues to make it lawful, for people to believe that
marriage should be only between a man and a woman. It is their right to
express that belief and the Bill does nothing to change that. I am also
grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, and my noble friend Lord
Lester for what they said about the Equality Act protecting people who
have a range of religions beliefs but in this context hold the belief
that marriage should be between a man and a woman and are free to
express that belief. It is important that I continue to make that
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000073">I also
recognise, however, that people are looking for reassurance and want to
know that it is perfectly legitimate to continue to hold the beliefs
that they have always held, and that they will not be in any
way disadvantaged because of these beliefs—or,
indeed, that it would be unfair for people to criticise them
in any way, although clearly it is free for anybody
to express an opinion that is contrary to that
view.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061733000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000074">As the
noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, mentioned, the Government are bringing
forward an amendment to the Public Order Act. I will speak to that in a
little more detail when I take the amendments in turn. We felt that it
was important for us to do this as we recognised the need for assurance
and because it was possible to make that amendment to the Public Order
Act without causing any detriment to anybody. We really do understand
that people are looking to us for
assurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000075">The
amendments have clearly enabled us to explore issues of conscience in
relation to the Bill, and it is right that we should do so. Let me
start with Amendment 5, which was moved by my noble and 
<?notus-xml column=73?>learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern. He seeks to explore how the
Bill could impact on those seeking appointment to a public
office—such as appointment to the board of a non-departmental
body. The amendment seems to be based on the premise that, should the
Bill be enacted, anyone expressing a belief that marriage should only
be between a man and a woman might somehow be excluded from appointment
to public offices.</hs_para>

can reassure noble Lords that this is certainly not the case. This Bill
is not about forcing people of faith to change their religious views,
practices or teachings about marriage. The belief that marriage should
be between a man and a woman is, and will continue to be, mainstream
and entirely lawful. Indeed, the Bill explicitly makes clear that such
a belief is legitimate and mainstream through the specific protections
it provides to ensure that religious organisations and their
representatives who do not want to participate in same-sex marriage
ceremonies cannot be compelled to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000077">Public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:27:20"></hs_TimeCode>

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I am about to come to the specific
examples that have been raised. I hope I will also give the noble Lord
some comfort by saying that we are working with the Equality and Human
Rights Commission to review its guidance and ensure that revised
guidance is issued. It is also looking at its statutory codes in this
area. I accept, as has been pointed out by noble Lords in this debate,
that we need to make sure that public bodies in
particular—although not just public bodies—are clear that
it remains absolutely lawful for somebody to express their belief in
this way. We want to make sure that that is clear to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:28:55"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Equality Act 2010 provides express prohibition against discrimination
because of religion or belief. This includes a religious or

employees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000080">I
move on to Amendments 7 and 8, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Dear. I
am grateful for his explanation although, on the face of it, the scope
of these amendments is not entirely clear. However, it would certainly
include a range of public authorities and religious organisations, and
would potentially extend to commercial service providers. Like the
noble Lord’s amendment in the earlier group, these amendments
would effectively create two tiers of marriage—a point made, I
think, by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner—with marriages of
same-sex couples on a lower tier. That would undermine the 
<?notus-xml column=74?>fundamental purpose of the Bill, which, as I made clear in earlier
debates, is to extend the single institution of marriage to same-sex
couples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000081">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:30:01"></hs_TimeCode>
course, there are circumstances in which individuals need strong and
effective protection in order for religious freedom to be safeguarded.

religious marriage of a same-sex couple against his conscience. We all
agree about that, and the Bill provides that protection through the
explicit protections already contained in the quadruple

Amendments 7 and 8 have a much wider effect. Amendment 7 would apply to
anyone exercising a function under or in consequence of this Bill, and
Amendment 8 would apply in the same terms to all public authorities and
those exercising public functions. Therefore, these amendments would,
for example, allow a housing officer to decide who should be housed
based on his or her belief. It would be quite wrong to refuse, on the
basis of a personal belief, however strongly and sincerely held, to
house a same-sex married couple or a couple where one of the partners
was divorced and remarried. Public servants should not be able to pick

what I had in mind. It was that the housing manager should not be

other religious or philosophical beliefs which people hold and which
are deserving of equal respect under the law. A belief that marriage
should be between a man and a woman is undoubtedly worthy of respect in
a democratic society. As such, it is already protected under the
religion or belief protections in the Equality Act 2010 and under
Article 9 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is therefore
unlawful to discriminate against someone simply because they hold this

determination of whether there has been unlawful discrimination under
the Equality Act is always a matter of balance, depending on the facts
of the case. The noble Lord’s Amendments 7 and 8 would, I
believe, disrupt that balance. An employer must be able to insist that
employees carry out their work in a reasonable and professional manner.
If, for example, a chauffeur for a commercial car hire company arrived
at a wedding and decided that he would not drive the couple because
they were of the same sex, that would amount to unlawful discrimination
and would leave the employer open to a claim on that basis. It would
also affect the employer’s business. It is right that the
employer should be able to take action against the employee in those
circumstances. However, Amendment 7 would prevent the employer doing so
and therefore I believe that it goes too

and 54, Amendment 53 is a government amendment, similar to one debated
in the other place in Committee and on Report. The Government gave a
commitment on Report in the other place that we would come back with
our own amendment, and I am happy to do so now. This amendment is
intended simply to put beyond doubt that the Public Order Act 1986
offences regarding stirring up hatred on the grounds of sexual
orientation do not outlaw the reasonable expression of the view that
marriage should be between a man and a woman, which remains a perfectly
legitimate view. It is appropriate to make this amendment because there
is already a similar provision in Section 29JA of that Act concerning
discussions about sexual conduct or practices. The current wording of
Section 29JA would not however cover discussion of same-sex marriage,
and that is why we are making the amendment. It is conceivable that
some people might be in doubt as to whether discussions of same-sex
marriage were to be treated differently from discussions of sexual
conduct and practices, in so far as those two topics are linked. For
example, my noble friend Lady Barker referred to the demonstration in
Brighton by a church on the day of the Gay Pride march. If the church
wanted to demonstrate against same-sex marriage, it would be perfectly
lawful. This amendment makes that clear. However, let me at the same
time be absolutely clear and reassure the House that this amendment
does not allow hate speech. If the manner in which something is
expressed is threatening and intended to stir up hatred, that would
still be an offence. The amendment refers to the content of what is
said, not the manner in which it is said. It makes clear that that
subject matter is a legitimate one for discussion and it is right to do
that only because there is an existing provision covering discussion of
sexual conduct or
practices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:42:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T19:42:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

it would be a bit unwise if we were too effusive about the outcome of
this election but that nevertheless we should all say that we welcome
that such a high proportion of the Iranian electorate turned out to
vote, and that they voted for a candidate who was not the one
recommended to them originally by the supreme leader? I have two
questions. First, can the Minister confirm what I thought I heard that
any willingness by Iran to resume the discussions with the E3+3 would
be met by a warm welcome and would be unconditional—that no new
conditions would be set for that? Secondly, do the Government feel that
it would be helpful if the US Administration made it clear that they
would be prepared to talk directly to the Iranians in addition to the
E3+3 negotiations, if that was the wish of the new Government in

negotiations have been held in an open and frank manner. A 
<?notus-xml column=81?>number of matters are on the table. I am not sure what the current
conditions are in relation to those negotiations so I cannot answer his
question directly in relation to whether any further conditions will be
set before further discussions take place. However, I welcome, with the
noble Lord, that over 70% of the Iranian public took part in these
elections, that Dr Rouhani was elected with over 50% of the vote, and
that he described his win as a victory over extremism and unethical
behaviour. This is a moment when Iran could choose an alternative

to be able to demonstrate a willingness to respond and to give
credibility to the new leadership? Does she also agree that if he is

more important that the existing nuclear powers take

we have to be positive about what could potentially flow from these
election results. However, we must also remember that more than 600
candidates were disqualified during this process, of which 30 were
women. We have to see this election in the context of the background
against which it was held. Of course, it is right for us to respond
positively to any further movements by the Iranians. That is why I said
that this is a moment when Iran can choose an alternative course of
action. However, there are still serious negotiations and questions on

rejoicing that the Iranian people seem to have elected as their
president someone who has indicated that he is at least prepared to
open windows on the outside world? Should we not do everything to
encourage him and the new Government, when they take office,
to open the doors as well? Perhaps, following the wise words of the
noble Lord, Lord Hannay, this may be an opportunity for the United
States to renew the approach that was made so splendidly some years ago
by President Obama in his Cairo speech. Given the way in which the
flawed—and much protested—election of Mr
Ahmadinejad to the presidency was carried out last time, surely the
lesson in this is that it is a great deal better to allow countries to
sort out their own problems in their own way rather than wading in with
either threats or unwise or unsustainable

proliferation of nuclear weapons by Iran. Those are matters that need

are also issues in relation to the human rights situation in Iran and

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, this order removes the restriction from
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 on a local
authority’s powers to serve a temporary stop notice in respect
of caravans which are used by the occupants as their main residence,
where there is a suspected breach of planning control. Hitherto, a
local authority could issue a TSN in these circumstances only if it
considered that the risk of harm to a compelling public interest
arising from stationing the caravan on the land in question was so
serious that it outweighed any benefit to the occupier of the caravan
of stationing the caravan there for the period of a
TSN.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061733000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#13061733000139">The
Government say that unauthorised caravans can often cause immediate and
significant impact on the local area and that this is no
longer to be weighed against the interests of the occupiers. The order
equalises the planning authority’s powers in regard to caravans
used as a person’s main residence with other types of
development. That is the point. Parliament has rightly in the past made
a distinction between a caravan which is somebody’s home and all
other types of development. There is a huge difference between stopping
ordinary breaches of planning control and depriving a family of their
home, with devastating consequences for their future. Not only do they
become homeless, but their access to education, health and other public

have generally agreed that accommodation is a key factor, not only in
dealing with unauthorised sites, but also in tackling the appalling
educational, health and other social disadvantage suffered by Gypsy and
Traveller families. Yet they have ducked the responsibility of ensuring

is another indication of the penchant of the Secretary of State for
selective indignation. For example, council tax rises are not
permissible even if they are around 2%—less than the rate of
inflation. However, council house rent increases can be twice the rate
of inflation. Indeed, that is something that the Government
do not just acquiesce in but insist on. When it comes to caravans,
which can be unsightly and cause potential problems, the Government
will produce regulations of this kind to facilitate their removal. On
the other hand, when private houses stand empty, councils cannot
acquire them or take any steps in relation to them unless
they have been empty for two years, despite a very severe housing
shortage.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I thank my noble
friend for securing this debate. Like other noble Lords who have
participated in it, I, too, acknowledge his great commitment in
furthering understanding of, and tackling and highlighting, some of the
issues faced by the Traveller community in 
<?notus-xml column=90?>particular. I also thank other noble Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady
Whitaker, and, of course, the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, for their
contributions. Both they and my noble friend have raised valuable and
thought-provoking comments.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:29:44"></hs_TimeCode>, unlike
my noble friend, I do not believe that there is a case to regret this
change. Indeed, I welcome it as part of empowering local councils to
take effective action against unauthorised
sites.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000018">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:29:53"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Beecham, talked about a recent meeting, to which my
noble friend also referred, with Brandon Lewis, who is now charged
within the department with taking forward the agenda for Travellers. I
would say, in defence of my honourable friend, that he has taken to
this particular task with great aplomb. He has met with the APPG and is
in listening mode, as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, pointed
out.</hs_para>

as an aside, the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, mentioned my right
honourable friend the Secretary of State, Mr Eric Pickles, talking
about approaches to local government. This underlines our
Government’s commitment to localism. I, for one, as a former
local councillor, actually welcome his intervention on matters such as
ensuring that councils take up the good practice of weekly bin
collections. Certainly in my 10 years in local government, including my
time as cabinet member for the environment, I never found the idea of
fortnightly collections resonated with any part of the borough and,
indeed, boroughs across London either. However, if that is the case in
the noble Lord’s area, I stand
corrected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000020">I
will set out from the beginning that the Government are totally
committed, I assure my noble friend, to respecting the rights of
Gypsies and Travellers, improving socio-economic outcomes and indeed
reducing prejudice, which does exist. I encountered this at first hand
in my own ward in local government. The Traveller site in Merton was
actually in my ward, which itself could be regarded as a very
prosperous part of the borough. Nevertheless, it was an eye-opener for
me. I visited the site, which was a permanent site, and I worked with
the local Traveller community there. I totally hear the points made and
I think it is important for government at local level to ensure that
there is correct representation for Travellers, because quite often
they are not aware of the avenues open to them to make appropriate
representations. It is incumbent on us, through our localism approach,
to ensure that councils create those avenues and ensure that they are
made fully available to all Traveller
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:32:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000021">As
we all know, the majority of Travellers abide by the law and planning
procedures. It is only a small minority that may at times seek to set
up on an unauthorised site, and that does, unfortunately,
damage the reputation of the wider community. However, I
highlight also the work undertaken thus far at the DCLG. For example,
in April 2012, the ministerial working group looking into Gypsies and
Travellers published a progress report, which included 28 commitments
from across government to help outcomes for Gypsies and Travellers.
These included promoting the improved health outcomes for Gypsies and
Travellers within the structures of the National Health Service and
encouraging authorised sites that have the backing of the local
community. 
<?notus-xml column=91?>Indeed, £60 million has been made available through the Traveller
pitch funding and the new homes bonus. I sought an update on progress
in this regard and, by 2015, as part of this scheme, we are seeking to
have in place 628 new pitches and 415 refurbished pitches across the
country. Another recommendation of the ministerial working group was
preventing hate crime, increasing the reporting of incidents and
challenging the attitudes that underpin
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:33:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000022">In
terms of specific progress, in education, for example, the Department
for Education has already recruited virtual head teachers in three
areas—Kent, Bradford and Cambridgeshire. In health, the
Department of Health’s commitments mainly concern improving the
evidence base on Gypsy and Traveller health and using the reformed
health system to improve the commissioning of health services from
April. The new legal duties as regards health inequalities will be a
key lever to improve access to and outcomes from health services.
Gypsies and Travellers are one of the priority groups on which their
inclusion health programme is

the Home Office come out of the cross-government hate crime action
plan, published in March 2012. This plan is currently being reviewed in
order to assess progress and respond to new and emerging issues. Of
course, I encourage all noble Lords—as they do; and I am sure
that my noble friend will—regularly to ensure that progress is
made on these initiatives and to hold the Government to account, as is
right. In the Ministry of Justice, another department that I represent
from the Dispatch Box, the National Offender Management Service, has
started to collect statistics on Gypsy and Traveller prisoners, which,
over the long term, will demonstrate outcomes. I am glad that I have
been joined by my noble friend from the DWP because that
department’s commitment to include Gypsies and Travellers in its
internal monitoring systems will be met with the introduction of
universal credit.</hs_para>

community at large. As is the case with all communities, our planning
policy asks local councils to plan to meet their objectively assessed
needs for development in a way that is consistent with planning policy
as a whole. Our policy promotes private-site provision and requires
councils to identify and update a five-year supply of deliverable
sites, and consider them against needs, as part of their local plan.
Legislation requires that local plans take account of this policy. From
March this year, where a local planning authority cannot demonstrate an
up-to-date supply of sites, that should be a significant consideration
in any planning application for temporary permission.</hs_parafo>

my noble friend that we as a Government have been absolutely clear that
authorised site provision is key in planning effectively for
travellers. When we look at issues such as health and education, some
of the unauthorised sites are often not located in 
<?notus-xml column=92?>a way that is reflective of the needs of the local community and the
needs of the Traveller community in terms of the provision of local
services. In turn, sufficient, well planned and well managed sites are
important in improving educational, health and integration outcomes for
travellers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306185000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000026">In
support of this, we have provided £60 million Traveller-pitch
funding through the Homes and Communities Agency to provide for new and
improved sites. Similarly we are working closely with the Planning
Inspectorate and Planning Advisory Service to promote high-quality
plans, including in respect of travellers. We are also seeing good
progress towards local plan adoption, given that seven out of 10 local
councils have already published their
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000027">However,
let me turn to matters related to enforcement against unauthorised
Traveller sites, which caused my noble to raise this debate and to
which he referred. While recent figures show that the number of
unauthorised caravans has fallen—a point made by the noble Lord,
Lord Beecham; only 14% are now on unauthorised land—the
Government continue to hear about the problems associated with
unauthorised traveller sites and with long drawn-out and costly
enforcement and eviction proceedings. Unauthorised development related
to caravan sites often happens very quickly because caravans are
mobile. Unauthorised provision is by definition inappropriate provision
that often raises public health and safety concerns for those living on
those sites, as well as for the surrounding community. Our policy makes
clear that local councils should seek to reduce the number of
unauthorised sites and make enforcement more effective. Intentional
abuse of the planning system by a small minority of travellers who set
up unauthorised developments leads to tension, undermines community
cohesion and damages the integrity of the planning
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000028">To
ensure the legitimacy of the planning system, we have already
introduced stronger enforcement measures through the Localism Act 2011
to enable local councils to deal robustly and effectively with
retrospective and misleading planning applications in relation to all
forms of development. Removing limitations on the use of temporary stop
notices will further empower local councils to take appropriate
enforcement action locally. As with other enforcement powers, temporary
stop notices can have immediate effect. In most cases, the previous
regulations prohibited local councils from using temporary stop notices
against caravans used as a main residence. The new regulations simply
remove this restriction and enable the local planning authority itself
to determine whether the use of temporary stop notices is a
proportionate response to the breach of planning control and safeguard
valuable local areas.</hs_para>

Whitaker, also highlighted specific cases and issues. It is down to the
local authority to use these powers. I am confident that local
authorities consider individual cases before they make a judgment call
on whether to proceed. The change will encourage Gypsies and Travellers
to apply for planning permission through proper channels, enabling full
consideration of individual proposals, and result in better quality and
more appropriate site provision for Gypsies and Travellers. I assure my
noble friend that in exercising 
<?notus-xml column=93?>these powers, the local councils as a public authority must have regard
to its duties and responsibilities under the Equality Act 2010 and the
Human Rights Act 1998, including to facilitate “the gypsy way of
life” with regard to the Traveller community. In particular,
they will need to consider whether taking such action could simply lead
to displacing the occupants onto the roadside or onto other
unauthorised sites which could potentially be less suitable. Again, I
reiterate the point that local authorities acting responsibly within
their legal requirements and obligations should make the decision which
is right for the Traveller community and right for the community as a
whole.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000030">Perhaps
I may pick a few other specific questions which were raised during the
debate. My noble friend raised the issue on the guidance on temporary
stop notices, a point also made by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, in
relation to legal aid. We confirm that the guidance on the use of
temporary stop notices will be published in the summer, as part of the
wider review of planning guidance. On the issue of no right of appeal
against temporary stop notices, and also whether issues of legal aid
are being tackled, temporary stop notices expire, as has been
acknowledged during the debate, after a period of 28 days. Local
councils will have to consider their duties under the equalities and
human rights legislation in determining whether the use of a temporary
stop notice is appropriate. In some cases, compensation may be claimed
where temporary stop notices are served
inappropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0002.htm#1306185000031">I
can also assure noble Lords that the Government’s proposed
reforms to legal aid and judicial review are designed to ensure that
those who can afford to pay, do so, to ensure that legal aid is not
funding cases which lack merit, or which are better dealt with outside
the court, and to target the unmeritorious cases which congest the
courts and cause delays. Nothing in the Government’s reforms
will prevent those who have arguable claims from having their claims
heard. Indeed, the whole reforms are intended to protect the most
vulnerable in
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000032">This

understanding of the Government's approach to this issue. I also hope
it has reassured my noble friend that we share the same objectives in
terms of improving outcomes for the Traveller community. The
Government’s reforms have struck a careful balance between
meeting the needs of the Traveller community while—and this is
an important point as anyone who has served in local government will
know—in considering and balancing the rights and merits of the
Traveller community, it is also important to do so in the interest of
the wider community as a whole. This particular measure will assist in
ensuring that the planning system applies fairly and equally to

they want to abuse the planning system, but because there is simply
nowhere else they can go. I must say that until we have the properly

wonder if my noble friend the Minister has considered the suggestion
made by Councillor Ric Pallister of South Somerset District Council. He
has suggested that, where it is necessary to remove a person from a
totally unauthorised and inappropriate site such as a playing field, a
temporary permission might be granted on another piece of land, which
is not unsuitable, for a period of 28 days. That would enable the
persons in receipt of the temporary stop notice to draw breath and look
around for whatever alternative accommodation might be available. It
would be helpful if the Minister could think about that. I am not

the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, had to say about Church of
England clergy. It occurred to me that this legislation may be
re-enacted north of the border and I wonder how this will affect Church
of Scotland ministers. As the Minister knows, there is a Church of
Scotland church in Pont Street—I believe it is called St
Columba’s. There is also the Crown Court Church in Covent
Garden, where Scottish Members are always welcomed at the beginning of
each new Parliament for what, north of the border, we call a kirkin. It
would be interesting if it means that there is an established
churches’ ruling down here which will not apply to Church of
Scotland ministers but the legislation that comes in north of the
border is slightly different. How might that apply to Church of
Scotland ministers who are practising in London or in other parts of
the country? I shall leave the noble and learned Lord to ponder on
that. I do not need an answer right

this amendment caught my eye was on the controlling of premises. I, of
all people, never believe everything that is in the newspapers. In
fact, I once advised a younger Member to check even the date on a
newspaper and to use some other means to make sure that it was
accurate. However, it has been recorded in at least two newspapers that
I know of that government Ministers have approached the authorities of
this House with regard to the Chapel of St Mary Undercroft, which some
of us know affectionately as St Stephen’s Crypt. The story in
the newspapers suggested that, in order to give equality to same-sex
marriages, the crypt could perhaps be turned into a prayer room rather
than being a place of worship controlled by the Church of
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000047">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:55:15"></hs_TimeCode>,
I would point out to the noble and learned Lord and other noble Lords
that I am not in the business of trying to scupper or put blockages in
the way of legislation that has come from the other House and been
approved by this House. However, I am entitled to ask questions. Those
who wish to be married in that church can get a full marriage only if
they are members of the Church of England and are seeking to have a
Church of England priest to marry them. If a member of the Catholic
Church wishes to get married in the crypt, a small service has to take
place further up the road at Westminster Cathedral and then a fuller
service can take place in the crypt. It is said that this is about
giving everybody equality, but equality is not practised currently and
I am not seeking that equality. My point in raising this is that the
Church of England has full authority in that little church, for which
we all have great affection. I understand that it is a peculiar, 
<?notus-xml column=97?>a Church of England term which means that the monarch can have some say
in the matter. If am wrong in these things, I am sure I will be
corrected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000048">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>
ask the Minister because I do not have full regard for what is printed
in the press. That is why I am on my feet tonight. If there is any
feeling that changes should be made for that little crypt of St
Stephen’s, then it should be the membership of this House and
the Members of the other place who make inquiries about this matter,
not Ministers, who are often quick when it suits them to say,
“Well, we are the Executive and there are matters for the House
and for the membership of both Houses”. I would take a very dim
view if a Minister had gone to anyone who has any authority over St
Mary Undercroft without consulting me or anyone else through those who
represent us here—perhaps the Lord Speaker or the Chairman of
Committees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000049">This
throws up another matter, on which I may be less qualified to speak.
The legislation says that the Church of England shall be exempt. If
anyone in government is able to change the place of worship of the
Church of England here in the Palace of Westminster, they would be able
to do so in any other place of worship within the Church of England. As
a Catholic, I wanted a Catholic marriage in a Catholic church when I
married 45 years ago. I do not deny anybody the right to argue with a
lot of this legislation. However, same-sex couples feel that as
Christians there is no reason why they should not be able not only to
get married within the rites of the Church of England, and indeed the
Catholic Church, but also to take advantage of the fact that they would
then be able to get married in the church itself, rather than a hotel
or anywhere
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000050">It is not

example given to me is that of a building that is primarily used by a
religious organisation, but rented out once a week to another religious

Bill, if the first organisation applies to conduct same-sex marriages
in that building then the tenant could object, preventing their being
able to register the building. I wonder whether the noble and learned

Lord Martin of Springburn. I believe that the proposal in the amendment
would be an unnecessary additional hurdle for religious organisations.
The legal protections in the Bill relating to the opt-in process,
combined with the protections under the Equality Act 2010, are in our
view perfectly sufficient to protect religious organisations that
decide not to opt in to same-sex marriage from legal
challenge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000054">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:59:39"></hs_TimeCode>
suggest that the process Amendment 6 proposes would have the effect of
interfering in the internal governing processes of religious
organisations. It would allow governing authorities to bind future
authorities’ decision-making abilities by placing additional
barriers in the way of their taking a decision to opt in to same-sex
marriage in the future. I am also concerned that such a system could
stifle the ability of a religious organisation to respond to the
changing nature of its religious community. In addition, we believe it
to be unnecessary in the light of the legal protections afforded by the
opt-in system in the Bill as well as by the existing legal

Lord Martin of Springburn, for giving us an opportunity to debate the
substance of this amendment as well as the specific points he raised. I
substantially agree with the point made by the noble Lady, Baroness
Royall. I even suggest that this would be an additional bureaucratic
burden. We believe that the provision is not necessary. There is no
need for any religious group to take any action whatever if it does not
wish to solemnise the marriages of same-sex couples. Unless a group
takes the positive step of opting in, it will not be able to solemnise
the marriages of same-sex
couples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000056">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T20:59:39"></hs_TimeCode>
take this opportunity to make it absolutely clear that there is no
requirement in the Bill to opt in. That is the position in the Bill as
currently drafted. If there was a list it could lead to some confusion
if, for some reason, a religious organisation did not apply to be
recognised on it. Therefore, not only is it not necessary, it could
have unintended and undesirable
side-effects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000057">In
answer to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, the position with regard to shared
buildings is that the requirement for all religious organisations
formally sharing a building to consent to registering that building for
the marriage of same-sex couples is a vital protection. It allows
religious organisations to choose to conduct same-sex marriages and
helps to protect those that do not wish to do so. We are giving
religious organisations the option of consenting to the registration
without having to agree to conduct marriages themselves. This provides
a way in which each organisation can respect the beliefs of the other.
The Bill is not only about choosing to conduct same-sex marriages but
about protecting religious freedom. We are seeking to ensure that the
protections provided by the giving of consent in the main opt-in also
apply to organisations that happen to share their buildings.</hs_para>

fully addresses the point but the basic structure is that if there is a
sharing arrangement—and there is statute for church buildings 
<?notus-xml column=99?>to be shared—and one religious organisation decides not to opt in
and does not consent to the registration of the building for same-sex
marriages, same-sex marriages could not take place there.
Alternatively, the religious organisation could consent to the building
being used for same-sex marriages although it would not itself permit
same-sex marriages. But I will look carefully at what the noble Lord,
Lord Alli, said and if he feels that I have not addressed the point, I
will certainly write to
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306185000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306185000059">The noble
Lord, Lord Martin, raised two very interesting issues. My understanding
is that the position with regard to marriages in the Church of
Scotland—it is not just St Columba’s, Pont Street and
Crown Court in Covent Garden; there are Church of Scotland
congregations in places such as Corby, I think—is that marriages
solemnised by the Church of Scotland in England and Wales are under the
law of England and Wales and accordingly the procedures set out in the
Bill regarding the opting-in by religious organisations would apply to
the Church of Scotland. That would ultimately be a matter, I suspect,
for the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland. Obviously, what
happens with legislation north of the border is a matter for the
Scottish Government. I understand that they plan to publish a Bill
relatively soon. Of course, there is a difference between marriage in

takes us on to the question of St Mary Undercroft in the Palace of
Westminster. The noble Lord, Lord Martin, said that his understanding
was that a marriage there could be solemnised only by the rites of the
Church of England and by a Church of England priest. That is certainly
my understanding. I had a colleague who wished to be married by a
Church of Scotland minister there and had to have a civil ceremony
beforehand and then have a blessing by a Church of Scotland
minister—so much for humanism. It would not be possible under
this Bill for the marriage of a same-sex couple to take place in St
Mary Undercroft using the rites of the Church of England. The marriage
of same-sex couples according to the rites of the Church of England can
take place only when the General Synod of the Church of England and
Parliament pass the appropriate measure; it would be a matter for them.
The Chapel could not be used for the marriage of a same-sex couple in
accordance with other religious rites unless it had first been approved
as a place of worship and then registered for the solemnisation of
same-sex marriages with the consent of the relevant
authorities.</hs_para>

today, will be amended so that, for example, a church minister who
refuses to conduct a same-sex marriage will not breach the goods and

evidence that the Equality Act has been shot through with anything or
has failed to work properly. I have already said in a previous short
speech that the Human Rights Act solves the problem but he does not
seem to have followed what I said, so I will say it again. The Human
Rights Act says that all legislation, old and new, must, if it is
possible to do so, be construed compatibly with the convention rights.
Those rights include freedom of conscience, religion and belief and
freedom of expression. If we wanted to get into a real muddle, we would
start writing stuff into this Bill which then has to be read down by
the courts. The best thing to do is to go for legal certainty and my

earlier. Miss Ladele was a registrar with a conscientious objection to
performing civil partnerships. She was subjected to disciplinary

unnecessary, because the local authority had enough registrars to cope
with the demand for civil partnerships. Her conscientious objection had

sufficient numbers of registrars are not available in any district, a

conduct same-sex marriages. Therefore, no same-sex couple would be
prevented from marrying by reason of this amendment. This tackles the
Minister’s concern that religious individuals might apply for
positions as registrars in order to conscientiously object and prevent
same-sex couples getting married—although this is unlikely. Our

have to say to that Minister, like it or not, that there are already
precedents in this country to accommodate the consciences of public

already said. Quite rightly, the conscientious objections of doctors
who are public servants and paid for by the taxpayer are respected so
that they do not have to perform abortions if this violates their
consciences. This has been operative since 1967. No one ever told me as
a doctor that I must choose between being willing to act in violation
of my conscience to perform an abortion or being sacked and losing my
livelihood and vocation. I was always rather thankful for that

legislation that will effectively say to registrars with a
conscientious objection, “Choose between either being willing to
violate your conscience or lose your job”. If it is supposed to
represent the interests of all registrars, it does not seem to be doing
a very good job. This has been underlined by paragraph 25 of the

it is a big issue because of the Lillian Ladele
case itself. The courts found against her because
they were asked to interpret a law that did not
explicitly provide a conscience exemption. It did, however,
provide scope for an exemption in practice because
registrars are separately designated marriage registrars and civil
partnership registrars. The reason why Ladele got into difficulty was
because her employer insisted that all registrars were designated as
both marriage and civil partnership registrars. If marriage is
redefined, there will be absolutely no chance of protection for
registrars without Amendment 16 because there will not be a separate

noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, said that the absence of protection
for registrars in the civil context contrasts markedly with the
protection from compulsion that is given to the clergy or others

the potential to generate conflict

always be resolved in favour of individuals because the Bill will
accord the religious freedom of individuals greater weight than the
institutional autonomy of religious organisations.</hs_para>

Bill effectively makes it impossible for religious organisations that
have opted in to providing same-sex marriage to compel their members to

broader and protected individuals in circumstances where the state is
involved, the interference would be justified. The fact that this
protection applies only within religious organisations and interferes
only with the inner workings of religious organisations seems to me
unreasonable. Therefore, the interference cannot be justified. It is to
that effect that I was very grateful that both the noble Baroness and
the noble Lord, Lord McColl, made reference to five examples—if
I was counting correctly—of exemptions already in law.

not agree with my noble friend on the Front Bench who was trying to
reduce to absurdity the idea of where we draw the line, of what happens
if someone objects to mixed-race marriage. There was not an objection.
Even in apartheid South Africa, if one were white one could find a
church in which to marry a black woman, or the other way round. It is
rather like asking what would happen if a registrar objected to
marrying someone with ginger hair. Of course, one can raise an
objection of that sort and try to draw a 
<?notus-xml column=113?>silly distinction, but there must surely be a point where reasonable
people accept that there is a substantial body of opinion which is in
favour of traditional marriage, and if it is at all possible, as in the

it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306188000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306188000056">The

the problem which the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss,

altered by statute to their detriment. This will not have been part of
their original terms and contract of employment, so they would stand
being faced with the awful choice of either going against their
conscience or losing their job. Surely there should at least be some
transitional arrangements to allow for this. Furthermore, looking at
this in a practical way, one asks how many people are likely to be
affected by this. What will the demand be for same-sex marriages? The
evidence from other jurisdictions is that demand will be relatively
small. I concede that the evidence points to the fact that there was a
more substantial demand in the initial stages, because of the pent-up
demand from those who wished, for example, to transfer from civil
arrangements to a full marriage position; but afterwards, there was a
relatively small

who seek to legislate. I am not even sure of the concession made by the
noble Baroness that someone might be compelled to officiate if there is
not someone actually available within Islington or wherever. If it is
likely to be the case that only a small number are going to be
affected, in larger jurisdictions there will be more than one registrar

negative or unfortunate effects. When it became apparent that a law
designed for and supported by the majority—this one is perhaps
supported by the majority but it is designed for a

abandon the law or put the minority outside its scope, which could

core the belief that every citizen in this country has a

for. It is something that we debated at great length during the passage

we put beyond doubt that no one should be denied equal access to

door to allow Hindus, for example, to refuse to marry people who marry

those of us who sat here as Law Lords, and then across the square as

want to draw attention to the facts found in the Ladele case about
certain local authorities. It was found practical, in some local
authorities, to respect the conscientious objection of particular
registrars. If it is possible to do that and still provide the service,
it seems to me that the provisions of the European Convention on Human

people’s religious beliefs are to be given effect except when

the idea that it should be ruled out altogether because you could

Dear:</Member></B> If I may respond, that situation is really an
exercise of emotion rather than fact. The likelihood of a registrar
suddenly seeing a gay couple in front of them and turning on his or her
heel and walking away is so fanciful as to be almost ludicrous. I would
expect to find that people signal their objection before the likelihood
occurs. A registrar in this position would signal that, from a matter
of conscience, they cannot conduct that marriage. They would make that
known to whoever runs that office and somebody else would be in place.
I certainly do not envisage—and I certainly would never
support—a registrar turning on their heel on the wedding day,
walking off and leaving the vestry or the registry office completely
open. That is not within my frame of reference at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306188000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306188000085"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T22:24:25"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Barker" PimsId="3880" UID="1306188000163" xid="1067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#1306188000163">Baroness

tell your Lordships that we were trying to put forward proposals that

Bermondsey, Mr Simon Hughes, said he had received letters from
individual registrars asking him to make some provision in the Bill.

Browne of Belmont:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to support
Amendment 16, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege. As a
former teacher, I am well aware that for many years the law has
respected the conscientious objection rights of atheist teachers, who
are not required to officiate at religious assemblies or to teach RE if
they do not wish to do so. This respect for conscience in the workplace
is despite the fact that, first, teachers are public servants, paid for
by the taxpayer, and secondly, that religious assemblies and RE are
public services. I have to say that this is absolutely right. Imagine
living in a country, the laws of which were such that they would say to
atheist teachers, “You must be willing to officiate at a
religious assembly or lose your job and your livelihood”. That
would be totally

truth is that if the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill is introduced
unamended, far from creating the difficult precedent that the Minister

about this evening. In response, I should like to make two points.
First, it does not seem very well connected to registrars. It is clear
from the judgment in the Ladele case that there are a number of local
authorities that make use of the fact that they do not have to
designate all registrars as both marriage and civil partnership
registrars precisely because conscientious objection is a concern for
at least some registrars. I find it very strange that the panel seems
unaware of, or is at least unwilling to acknowledge, this
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061815000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#13061815000007">It
is very important to remember that when, in 2005, your

I am disturbed that the panel brushes aside the hugely important issue
of conscientious objection on the basis of administrative complexity.
This is a very small price to pay for upholding our liberal democratic
traditions. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Scotland, did not take
this view of reasonable accommodation and although Islington Council
deliberately choose not to with respect to Lillian Ladele, the fact
that other local authorities have satisfactorily provided reasonable
accommodation suggests to me that it is eminently

marriage Bill before us today, however, presents a much worse threat to
freedom of conscience than the Civil Partnership Act. The truth is
that, although there was nothing in the Civil Partnership Act to stop
local authorities like Islington insisting that all registrars were
designated as both marriage and civil partnership registrars, the fact
that local authorities do not have to do this means that there is
potential for adopting a more enlightened approach. This has clearly
happened in some areas, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Scotland, rather suggested it should. There will, 
<?notus-xml column=121?>however, be no scope for this in relation to the marriage Bill because
people will continue to be designated simply as marriage registrars.
There will not be an option of being designated as a different-sex
marriage registrar or a same-sex marriage registrar. In effect, the
line adopted by Islington, with no potential for reasonable
accommodation, will be extended right across the

debate with some concern because we have heard references to conscience
in a space in which conscience may not belong at all. We have heard
about shades of grey in this debate; this evening, we have had shades
of brown. I strongly agreed with the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Brown<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T22:38:50"></hs_TimeCode> of
Eaton-under-Heywood, when he referred to the judiciary. What occurs in
these situations? Things may have changed a little since the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, was Lord Chancellor. Perhaps in
those days county court judges in Welshpool, Caernarfon or Lambeth were
able to pick and choose their way through cases they liked or did not
like. However, if I may respectfully say so, the reality is that a
judge is a very senior form of public official who hears the case that
is presented before him by an often hard-pressed and unsympathetic
listing officer. It is form of appointment, as a doctor’s
appointment might be.</hs_para>

if somebody wishes to enter into a civil marriage, what qualifications
are needed? They have to establish that they are 16 or over, free to
marry and not closely related. There is no issue of conscience involved
in that. Then they have to make a convenient appointment to attend
before the registrar who, like a judge hearing a case, happens to be on
duty on that day. They have to produce some documents—it is a
bit like opening a bank account—including their passports, birth
certificates and a utility bill or bank statement. Once the appointment
has been made with those documents, they attend and there is no liturgy
whatever. They are required to exchange promises if they are marrying,
but there is no set form. Of course, the registrar helps out if
required but they can write their own promises and exchange them
quickly and informally. Where is the conscience aspect of this? The
registrar is simply a public official providing the statutory facility
to enter on a register the names of two people who wish to be married.

you go to see the registrar. You do not walk in the front door and say,

Registrars are public servants and it is right that they have a duty to
dispense their responsibilities and to deliver services without
discrimination. The recent case of Ladele at the European
court—a registrar who wanted an opt-out from performing same-sex
civil partnerships—shows that in this respect UK domestic law
stands up to the challenge under European law. The court found that Mrs
Ladele could be required by her employer to register civil

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking my
noble friend Lady Cumberlege for introducing this amendment, which has
certainly given rise to a good debate. There are clearly some strongly
held views on both sides and some powerful arguments too. I have
listened carefully but it is important that I set out and clarify the
Government’s position. The noble Baroness, Lady Thornton, has
just quoted the Secretary of State, so it may not come as a huge
surprise but it is important to give the reasons why we take that view.
As the noble Baroness indicated, it is a view that was argued on behalf
of the United Kingdom in the European Court of Human Rights in the
Ladele case, and the court found that our law at present regarding
civil partnerships falls within what is legitimate under the European
Convention on Human Rights.</hs_para>

public officials performing statutory duties on behalf of the state. We
believe that it is an important principle that they should perform
their duties in accordance with the law, as decided by Parliament, and
without discrimination. I noted—I hope reasonably
accurately—what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of
Eaton-under-Heywood, said: that public servants should, with very
limited exceptions, serve the public according to the law as
democratically decided. That is fundamentally the Government’s
position. If this Bill is passed, the marriage of same-sex couples will
be lawful in England and Wales, so marriage registrars must perform
their duties in relation to the solemnisation of marriages between both
opposite and same-sex couples, without
discrimination.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061815000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-0003.htm#13061815000039">I
paid attention to the parallels made with areas such as abortion and
conscientious objection in religious education, which were powerfully
and sincerely argued. However, it is too simplistic to draw a parallel
between a conscientious objection regarding a doctor not performing an
abortion and one where a registrar seeks conscientious objection not to
perform a same-sex marriage. They are not comparable. For some people
with a very strong religious conviction the right to life is paramount
and in such circumstances, the argument that the state should not
require them to act against their conscience is highly persuasive. I do
not think that anyone would reasonably say that same-sex marriage can
be seen in the same terms. That was picked up by the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of
Eaton-under-Heywood, and my noble friend Lady Noakes.</hs_para>

difference in terms of the Abortion Act exception is that medical staff
do not discriminate on the basis of their patient’s personal
characteristics. They do not pick and choose which patients to treat on
that basis; for example, on the basis of a particular person’s
race or religion. The exception being sought for registrars does
precisely that, on the basis of the couple’s sexual orientation.
Moreover, for medical staff who object to taking part in abortions that
is only a small part of their daily 
<?notus-xml column=126?>duties, but for a registrar conducting marriage ceremonies, conducting
marriage ceremonies is at the heart of what they
do.</hs_para>

made, not least by the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, to teachers.
I understand that the exception there is not framed as a conscience
clause, as such. The provision relating to the ability of teachers to
opt out of teaching RE is set out in Sections 59 and 58 of the School
Standards and Framework Act 1998. These specify that if you teach at a
non-faith maintained school, you are not required to teach RE and
cannot suffer any detriment because of that refusal. If you teach at a
foundation or voluntary-controlled faith school and are not a reserved
teacher, you are not required to teach RE, and, again, cannot suffer
any detriment because of that refusal. If you teach at a
voluntary-aided faith school, refusal to teach RE in accordance with
the religious tenets of the school might well affect your remuneration
or promotion, or you might not be employed in the first place. Unless a
teacher is specifically appointed to teach religious education they
cannot be compelled to do so, regardless of whether they are an atheist
or not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T22:54:46"></hs_TimeCode>.

clear that in extending marriage to same-sex couples, the Bill should
protect and promote religious freedom. That is why, as we heard again
today, it contains a quadruple lock of religious protections. However,
the functions performed by marriage registrars are civil in nature.
This is also the case in relation to their functions when they have a
role in religious marriage ceremonies, such as taking notice of
marriages, issuing certificates and being present in cases where there
is no authorised person. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Carlile
of Berriew for describing what can happen when making an appointment,
and later with the ceremony. Some would say that the example given by
my noble friend Lady Barker would be unlikely, because by that stage
people would know what was about to happen. Nevertheless, it could
still be the case that someone would turn up for their initial

until relatively recently it was the position of the Church of England
that it would not marry divorcees. Therefore, in many cases divorcees
who could not marry had little choice but to go to a registrar. If the
registrar adopted the same religious view as that taken by the Church
of England and sought exemption through conscientious objection, it
would beg the question of how the couple could ever find someone to
marry them unless perhaps they found a non-Church of England church
that would be willing to do so. The door is open to that kind of
religious and conscientious objection. It is not a reasonable position

Government are confident that the Equality Act 2010 provides the right
balance between protecting the right of freedom of expression and the
right to manifest one’s belief, alongside the need to protect
the rights of others. As was said on a number of occasions in this
debate, the European Court of Human Rights, in the Ladele case,
supported this view. I will not go over all the details; they were well
rehearsed. The United Kingdom refuted the case put by Ms Ladele when
she went to the European Court of Human Rights. We argued that our law
strikes the right balance between an employee’s right to express
their religious beliefs at work and the rights of people not to be
discriminated against because of sexual orientation. We believed our
law was compatible with the convention and that the Court of Appeal
made the right decision under domestic law and the convention, given
the particular circumstances of the case. As has been noted, the Court
of Human Rights generally upheld that view and noted that the court
generally allows national authorities a wide margin of appreciation
when it comes to striking a balance between competing convention
rights. It held that the national authorities in this case, the local
authority employer and the domestic courts, did not exceed that margin
of appreciation available to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T22:27:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T23:00:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

marriage should be only between a man and a woman could find him or

couples. Much has been said, too, in the debate about the national

we have concerns that during the Bill’s passage there may have
been repeated attempts to insert a conscience clause to enable

registrars are local authority employees and are expected to carry out

delivering civil partnership ceremonies. We do not believe that
delivering equal marriage ceremonies will be any different and we
strongly oppose the idea of such a conscience clause. Allowing some
registrars to opt out of civil marriage for same-sex couples would be
discriminatory and would cause administrative difficulties in

before the Audit Commission is abolished. We have tabled a further
amendment, which we can debate on Wednesday, which is a more enabling
and flexible approach, adapting the proposition in the Bill for smaller

the time the key provisions of this Bill come into force, it is to be
expected that all of the audit contracts for principal local bodies
will be undertaken by private sector firms under arrangements entered
into with the Audit Commission. This will comprise some 800 principal
authorities, including local authorities, NHS bodies, police
authorities, national parks authorities, et cetera. Perhaps the
Minister might arrange for us to have a comprehensive list at some
stage. These arrangements run through and cover audits for periods to
March 2017. The contracts—I believe that there are 10 of
them—can be extended through to periods to March 2020 at the
discretion of CLG, but decisions to extend would effectively have to be
taken by the beginning of the year 2016-17 if an EU-compliant
procurement process is to be undertaken. If these contracts are not
extended under the Bill, the local public bodies

Lords will have seen the outcome of some modelling undertaken by the

options ranging from local choice to central procurement. It summarised
the outcome in its briefing to us; indeed, that briefing showed that of

central procurement was clearly the least-cost option. The conclusion

much depends on how the audit market develops over the next few years.
The outsourcing by the commission did not do much to widen
participation levels in the local authority and health sectors. The
outsourcing of the in-house commission practice went to only seven
firms—most to the big four plus Grant Thornton. Research shows
that market concentration in audit services leads to higher audit fees.
There is a credible argument that individual procurement would act
against market concentration but the major providers in the market are
large, economically powerful entities with resources to invest to
tackle new opportunities. 
<?notus-xml column=3?>One of the risks is that the larger authorities will fare well in this
because they will be more attractive clients to the big firms. Smaller
authorities will in practice have less choice, may be junior partners

market will be affected by developments in the EU and, quite possibly,
by the deliberations of the UK competition authorities to which the big
four have been referred. Procurement could be more costly. Given that
those principal bodies are likely to award contracts for five years, it
is estimated that more than 90% of them will have to follow EU

13 is a very narrow amendment. Clause 4 sets out the general
requirements for audit and yet refers to the accounts of a relevant
authority and the imperative for them to be audited in accordance with
the provisions of the Bill. The clause requires the auditor to have
been appointed by the particular authority in question. However, if the
auditor for the relevant authority has been appointed by the Audit
Commission under a contract which may not expire until 2017 or even
2020, these provisions would not seem to apply. I wonder whether that
is the intention. The new regulatory regime is due to commence, as I

believe rightly—encouraging a lot of joint working with local
authorities to deliver lots of services, in many cases allowing joint 
<?notus-xml column=4?>appointments for senior officers, particularly for smaller authorities.
As we know, in many cases it is a financial necessity to do this. As we
have discovered in Greater Manchester, which is working on the
community budgets pilot, joint working is essential if we are to
deliver the Government’s agenda of reforming public services. We
are working with 10 authorities in Greater Manchester. The three
boroughs in London and so on are also good examples of places working
very closely together. However, if joint work is going on, where is the
audit taking place? The sensible thing would be to have a joint
audit—to have someone who can audit all of the activity in a
simple and straightforward way.</hs_para>

I feel that the role of the internal audits tends not to be recognised

the work in internal audit that the local authorities are paying for.

there to be local acquisition of external auditors, I am happy to go
along with making this option available. I believe that the way that
the centralised body performs will depend on how the local authorities
react and whether they are getting a good deal. I also believe that the
wording in the amendment is right. The danger of not permitting this
centralised option is that local authorities, and the auditors
themselves, will cherry pick the audits they want, and that the local
authorities will cherry pick the auditors they want. That arrangement
could be too cosy. This issue arises and has become imperative because
of the ending of the Audit Commission. We are examining what can be
done due to that change in circumstances. The comment about taking out

require the Secretary of State to make arrangements to enable the
national procurement of external audit before the closure of the Audit

the potential for bodies to have their auditor appointed on their

arrangements suit them locally for their auditing. Many local

unsympathetic to the intention behind these amendments—which I
understand to be to secure the lowest audit fees for local bodies by
encouraging large-scale collective procurement of audit. The Government
recognise the benefits of bulk buying and the Bill already allows local

say how many local authorities or local bodies there should be or limit
them, but it allows them. It says that local bodies must be able to
choose what arrangements suit them. We do not think that it is up to
central government to dictate to local authorities how they should go
about appointing their auditor, regardless of whether they do it singly
or come together jointly. We believe that we should be careful that
provision for national procurement—if that is the way it is
going, and the LGA seems to hope that it is—does not limit local
choice and that we do not recreate the Audit Commission in another
guise. We are saying that the options must remain. Local authorities
should have the option to join the national scheme if they wish to do
so. If they do not so wish, they have the option to appoint their own
auditors or to join up with an external

allowing it under the Bill. It would therefore be not mandatory but
permissive. If we are to consider such a change, it is important that

adjusting non-auditor work under the accounting code of practice. Local

auditors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000029">The

Financial Reporting Council’s standards. These require audit
firms to have robust systems and processes in place for ensuring the
objectivity and independence of audit and addressing any issues on the
non-audit work. We are also putting in place robust protections around
the appointment and removal of auditors, and local bodies will need to
consider advice from an independent auditor panel or audit committee
before making their appointment. We will not deal with that in
today’s amendments but I am sure that we will discuss it later.

again in the context of what could conceivably be done by other firms.
It is surprising that the number of additional firms coming 
<?notus-xml column=9?>in that the Minister was able to quote is so small; it is tiny in
relation to the totality of audit work that has to be done. Central
appointment is opposed not only by me but by the Local Government
Association, and now we have a plea for provision to be made if some
local authority prefers to go through such an organisation. It is not
clear to me that that could be sensibly carried out by anyone else but
the Audit Commission, which has the

my noble friend Lord McKenzie has indicated, contracts are now out for
pretty well every local authority. The first audits that local
government will appoint will be for the period 2017-18, after the next
election. These can be extended by three years, which takes us to
2020—two general elections ahead. As my noble friend has pointed
out, local authorities not only have to negotiate a contract but, in
many cases, will be caught by the European requirements for open
contracts. At the moment only 168 of the principal bodies, 20%, have
annual fees for 2013-14 above the commission’s value, which is a
contract for the whole, not per annum. If you are on a
five-year contract, it is five years and it adds up. The present
threshold is £113,057. If there is a change, probably something
like 93%, 769, will be above the
threshold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:04:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000043">We
are not proposing to transfer a simple task to local authorities. We
are not going to just pick up the phone and say, “Hello, Harry,
you’re an accountant: will you do our audit?”. It will be
an important, time-consuming and not inexpensive
task<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:05:00"></hs_TimeCode>. What
incentive is there for any significant number of accountancy firms to
incur the costs and trouble of recruiting further auditors and training
them when there will not be any work for them until 2020? It does not
make any sense. There is no sense whatever in planning for something
that will happen that many years ahead and when we have no idea what
the economic climate may
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:05:44"></hs_TimeCode>. To extend
the contracts which exist by three years is essential. I do not see the
point in throwing away £130 million in that event when nothing
else much will happen for all those

there was a letter in the <I>Observer</I>, signed by Sir Merrick
Cockell, the chairman of the Local Government Association, his
vice-chairmen, who include both a Lib-Dem and a Labour vice-chairman,

local government expenditure. They say that by 2015 they will have
incurred 33%
cuts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:06:34"></hs_TimeCode> and can
take any more only by removing particular services. To do something of
this nature instead of applying the minds of the Audit Commission to
seeing how this can be done in the way of cuts cost-effectively seems
to me to be sheer

Commons Public Accounts Committee—I think it was last
month—pointed to dozens of local authorities on the brink of
financial collapse. The Bill will not help any of that and we really
need to think again. This is in the context of an urgent need for local
government to develop its financial management. A very different
economic climate lies ahead.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:07:28"></hs_TimeCode> position
after 2015 will not mirror the second-half of the 20th century or the
first two decades of this
century<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:07:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I sense
that in this country there is a feeling that, when we are all clear of
our overindebtedness, all will be well again. 
<?notus-xml column=10?>I do not think it is possible for that to happen. Therefore, there has
to be a major change in many areas of endeavour. That perhaps is for
another debate. What should not be in dispute is that local government,
as well as central government, are not alone by any means to have to be
able to do more with less in the face of the serious continuing growth
of inescapable demands.</hs_para>

management will be essential, and not just the financial management of
officials, who will have to convince politicians that what they are

what will last and what will serve the position. That will have to be

of the Audit Commission’s fresh mission; namely, it should
ensure that this happens.</hs_para>

find it difficult to understand why local authorities say that they
would have fewer studies. That seems to be perfectly reasonable to
suggest. They want a number—I think it is six—but I would
not want to see anything like that locked into a Bill. We must not
overlook what the Audit Commission has done since 1996. In its
value-for-money studies it identified just over £1 billion of
fraud and error. Who is going to do that? The Government have not told
us who is going to do that. That is big
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:09:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000048">I
have looked at three studies. In 2010 it found £1
billion of savings in the police services; £400 million in the
buying of equipment and services—this is an important point for
governments departments working together under whatever rules exist;
and £200 million in the Fire Service without compromising
safety. I have notes on two other studies which together could have
saved more than £400 million over the course of 2008-12. If we
have not got the Audit Commission, I do not know who will find these
savings and act with this in the forefront of
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:10:41"></hs_TimeCode>their minds. I
strongly believe that the Bill clearly endangers all this.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:11:01"></hs_TimeCode> no way will

auditors will not be able to do it. They will need to have regard to
common standards, local variations, triangular evidence and to identify
inconsistencies. I could go on. It is nonsense to proceed and toss all
this away. I am not clear what it is for. The only thing that jumps out
of the Bill is that it wants to give local authorities the freedom to
do what they wish.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:11:37"></hs_TimeCode> can find
nothing in the Bill which says, “We are going to have better
local government and better decisions than we had before”. The
greatest service this House can give, in my view, is to tell local

was a board member of One North East, the RDA, and a member of its
audit committee for a number of years. I could never understand why my
council was being audited by the Audit Commission ultimately and why
the development agency, a government department, was audited by the
National Audit Office. I always felt that there was scope for savings

managed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:13:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000054">There
is inevitably risk in any change but, if asked the question, “Do
I think there is a need for two nationally based auditors auditing the

there has to be a number of provisions to ensure that the independence
of audit and the functions undertaken by the Audit Commission are
protected as far as is

the Audit Commission was set up, I was very positive. I said at Second
Reading that it did good work in financial audit and carried out good
value-for-money studies. I said that it suffered from mission creep and
a target-based, tick-box culture, in which it set both its own
programme of work and its own fees base. I could never understand why
it was that they were allowed to do this. I am therefore quite
attracted by the idea of having an independent local audit committee
which is actually charged with overseeing some of these
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:15:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:14:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13061745000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000263">4.15

said on Second Reading, I have had a concern that the Audit Commission
was extremely good at identifying problems but not quite so good at
explaining to local authorities what the solutions to those ought to be
or what actions they should undertake to deliver solutions. I gave as
an example health inequalities, but there could be
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:15:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Audit Commission is abolished, how do we ensure that the
independence from a public-interest point of view is maintained? I want
to address the second part of my contribution on this amendment to the
public interest as opposed to the interest directly of councils, of
government or of anybody else. What is it that the general public would
expect? The first thing is that there has to be a clear role for the
National Audit Office. There will be up to six thematic reviews a year.
That seems to me to be about right; if others are needed, the rules can
undoubtedly be changed. It is important, in the context of local
auditing, that value-for-money studies continue, and important that
councils learn from each other. However, I am not sure that you need an
audit commission to do that. That there should be a clear role for the
National Audit Office in overseeing and underpinning the audit function
across local authorities seems to me to be well set out in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

another risk, which the noble Lord, Lord Christopher, is quite right to
have pointed out, and that is the risk that the Audit Commission was
perceived to be an independent body which could stand apart from local
authorities. That is a vital 
<?notus-xml column=12?>principle that needs to be maintained. The public interest needs audit
to be an independent activity, and independent in each local authority,
from any kind of party-political control. I happily support the
Government’s view that there should be a majority of independent
members and an independent chair. I am motivated in saying that by the
fact that I do not believe that any audit committee should be
controlled by the majority party in a council. Single-party control is
what we simply must avoid. I want to see a competitive system for the
appointment of auditors. Allowing all the business to go to the big
four audit companies plus one or two other slightly smaller ones seems
unhelpful in terms of competition and in driving down costs in the long
term. Therefore, encouraging regionally based and locally based audit
companies to tender for work seems the right thing to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:17:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000059">Underpinning
all this—that function of independence —a local
audit committee needs to be seen by the general public to be
independent of the offices and the councillors of that local authority
and most certainly not under party-political control. I also think that
you need an audit committee that is independent enough to ensure that
there is a regular change of auditor as well and that it is not
something that is simply voted through. It should not be that, after
five years, you simply repeat the arrangements so that the same auditor
carries on with effectively the same people and the same approach that
was undertaken in the previous five years. I would want to encourage
increasing competition and regular change of

As he himself conceded at the beginning, however, it is probably too

Second Reading, I voiced concern about the split, which is now to be
institutionalised, between health and local government at the very time
when the Care Bill is intended to bring considerable necessary
integration in that key area of public social policy. It cannot make
sense for that to happen between the two sectors. Even within the
health sector, there are to be not two sets of auditors, as the noble
Lord, Lord Shipley, said, but several, because clinical commissioning
groups—there may be more than one in a given area—will
have their own auditors. In addition, trusts will have their own
auditors. In addition to that, somebody—presumably, the National
Audit Office—will be auditing the National Commissioning Board,
which has direct responsibility for, among other things, the
commissioning of primary care and other elements of health provision.
So there will be a range of auditors in the field of health when you
would have thought that they should be brought
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000079">It
is not only in the field of health that there is a need to look across
different sectors. In local economies and arrangements for city deals,
for example, or combined authorities, you could have a series of
auditors reporting locally instead of having that overview. That is
without mentioning community budgets, the new name for total place,
where you should be looking at the pooling of public spending in an
area across a range of national and local government services. How is
that to be catered for? How are they to be evaluated? It is not simply
a question of seeing that money is properly spent in terms of
propriety; it is a question of effectiveness. After all, that is
precisely the point that the move, slow though it may be, towards
getting that cross-sectoral investment and pruning of budgets to
achieve commonly agreed ends between a range of different partners. How

not sense that the National Audit Office will have the resources to
conduct all that alongside its manifold other obligations on mainline
government expenditure. I understand that it is possible for the
National Audit Office effectively to ask for more money through its
parent body. I believe that there is a committee chaired by Sir Edward
Leigh in the House of Commons which oversees that process. I am told
that if it says that it needs more money, it will get it. That may be
the case. It would be perhaps the only case in government where that

health are among others—should be doing to avoid cost-shunting
to share benefits and, for that matter, basic overheads, back-office
services and the like and, in particular, to achieve agreed outcomes
for a given area. I do not see how that will be delivered under these

inclined to vote for it, but I fear that that is unlikely. Of course,
it cannot happen in this Committee in any event, but it is unlikely to

Christopher’s opposition to this clause standing part was
delivered in a very knowledgeable and passionate way and with some
understandable logic underpinning it. However, the Audit Commission
would maintain that it has already been significantly changed from its
prior status. Its in-house audit practice has been privatised and the
commission’s routine inspection and annual inspection of local
government has ceased, as has its work on comprehensive area
assessment. It has already incurred significant redundancy costs,
partly funded by CLG, and offices have been closed with early
termination costs incurred. The NAO is already picking up the task of
value-for-money studies.</hs_para>

today is not the same as the Audit Commission of three years ago, and
we have heard from my noble friends Lord Christopher and Lord Beecham
about some of the splendid and effective work that it used to do. It
would be difficult to put it back together again in anything like its
original form. To that extent, the Bill has been rather pre-empted. The
challenge for us in considering the Bill before we sign it off is to
scrutinise the proposed new framework to evaluate whether its proposals
are fit for purpose, can deliver an effective regime and build on what
was good about the Audit Commission, and some of our amendments seek to
do this. That process of scrutiny should particularly pursue the line
just outlined by my noble friend Lord Beecham to see how joined-up we
can be in an era when we are at risk of fragmenting
arrangements.</hs_para>

noble friend Lord Christopher is right that a significant part of the
commission’s work has been the commissioning and provision of
local audit services. As he said, the need for further commissioning
generally, other than dealing with changes in the existing contracts,
will not arise until 2017. My noble friend made a very telling point:
if the contracts are extended until 2020, what is the incentive for
those audit firms that do not have contracts at the moment to invest in
something that may not come to pass until seven years hence?</hs_para>

a subsequent amendment, we explore what is involved in the ongoing
management of these audit contracts. This raises the question of why
the commission could not be retained at least to see these through to
finalisation. Part of our task in scrutinising the Bill is to
understand whether the regulation of local audit and the respective
roles of the Financial Reporting Council, the professional accounting
bodies and the NAO are fit for purpose. The Government may pray in aid
the savings that have accrued from the closing of the Audit Commission,
but the reality is that those savings have been measured against the
2009-10 baseline. As the Audit Commission has pointed out to the CLG,
those savings had already been secured, and the annual costs under the
future regime broadly equate to the annual costs of the commission in
its current form. This is without taking account of the added ease with
which it could facilitate the future central procurement of audit
contracts. We are aware that the commission has submitted details to
this effect to CLG, particularly in a letter dated 23 May 2013. Perhaps
we can understand from the Minister how the department proposes to
respond to that.</hs_para>

noble friend’s Motion invites us to consider keeping the Audit
Commission in its slimmed-down form, at least until the end date of the

already been achieved by lifting the burden of top-down regulation from

Clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T16:38:01"></hs_TimeCode> 1 repeals
the Audit Commission Act 1998, under which the commission currently
operates, and it introduces Schedule 1, which makes provision for such
matters as the transfer of property, the preparation of final accounts
and various consequential repeals and revocations. There are amendments
tabled on all those matters, which I think that we will come to quite
soon. The clause lays the foundations for a new localist audit regime
that hands powers and responsibilities to local bodies. Other parts of
the Bill make arrangements for a robust framework that maintains a high
quality of audit and transfers necessary functions to other suitably

bodies are capable of appointing their own auditors, as charities,
companies and foundation trusts already do, and, by and large, they
have welcomed the opportunity to do so. Putting local bodies in charge
of procuring their own auditors will create greater transparency as
they will have greater control over how much they pay for their audit
services. They will

within the Bill to increase the work that it does. The expectation is
that it might undertake about six more national studies to those that
it is undertaking at the moment. It will be able to choose what it does
and, provided that it is working within existing legislation, it will
be able to look at what is going on, either across the piece of local
authorities or in individual
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000104">On

Lord, Lord Beecham, asked about the five years. His question was not
why we are asking for 10 or five years but why five years was not the
absolute limit for auditors to continue. The requirement is that they
make a new appointment at least every five years, in which case they
will have to go out to further tender. They cannot just reappoint the
auditors that are there but will have to go out through a new process.
If within that process it was adjudged that the audit firm that was
being used was the best, they would be entitled to appoint it again. We
think that five years is the right time initially but it must be
protected. We must make sure that it is not continued if that is not

questions were raised. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, talked about the
health service sector. May I duck that today? I know that we are going
to come to it later on in the Bill. It is very relevant. The auditing
of accounts such as community budgets across public bodies is
definitely germane to what we are talking about today. The expectation
is that auditors who are auditing public bodies will come together to
co-operate to ensure that they understand what is being

noble Lord, Lord Christopher, also raised the question of the amount of
money that had been saved by the Audit Commission in terms of fraud and
error. It is certainly true that there is fraud and error and it is
vital that local government and local authorities ensure that there is
no fraud in their own accounts and their own way of delivering those
accounts. I know that there is more than the local government fraud
initiative. There are strong local government fraud policies and 
<?notus-xml column=20?>processes which are beginning to identify pretty sharply the amount of
money that is being lost. With that and the national fraud initiative,
for which we are currently about to find a home, the issue will be well

noble friend Lord Shipley raised a number of questions, which again I
think will come up in the course of the rest of our discussions. I
agree totally with him that where there is a local audit panel, it has
to be seen to be independent. Under the Bill it will be because,
although it does not have to be big, it has to have a majority of
independent members on it. As the noble Lord says, it is desirable for
the audit committee not to be comprised of only one party, and that is
what one would hope and expect in local government where there is more
than one party. Again, if the local audit committee were to try to turn
itself into an audit panel to recommend new auditors, it would have to
create a situation where it had a majority of independent members. We
will come back to that because it is an issue that will come up as we
go ahead. If I have not replied to every question, I am sure that I
will have an opportunity to do so as we
proceed.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/6611FB013BE367E5A62A47037632DE4B39BD2742" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 June 2013">Monday,

encourage competition. The Chancellor has not been successful in
persuading and encouraging business to spend the billions, if not
trillions, that they have. People will invest only if there is a profit
at the end of the road. It was not an accident that 70% of
the redundant staff of the Audit Commission went to 
<?notus-xml column=21?>the firms that have contracts; they did not go anywhere else. I do not

charge—and there are nearly as many who are not given contracts

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I think that we have covered
this in some measure. I have a series of probing amendments to
understand just a little more about the scheme and what is intended.
Amendment 2 concerns the pension scheme. In the impact assessment, the
commission set out that there is a Crown guarantee in respect of the
scheme’s liability—we have just heard about
that—which avoids the potential early crystallisation of
long-term liabilities of the scheme. It is suggested that this would
enable the scheme to be run on as a closed funded scheme in future.
However, it suggests that this is just one of the options considered.
Perhaps the Minister could outline what others are on the
table.</hs_para>

impact assessment explains that CLG has sought key protections and
influence over the scheme to work with the trustees to minimise
liabilities and/or manage them in line with the department’s
method of financial planning and priorities. Will the Minister say more
about this, including the extent to which the trustees of the scheme
are being enjoined to minimise liabilities or manage them in line with
CLG’s, not the members’, wider financial planning and
priorities? I should also be grateful if the Minister could let us know

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, we touched on this briefly in the
previous discussion, but I agree with the noble Lord that the
Government need to ensure that there are proper arrangements for the
future management of the pension scheme. That goes without saying. It
is particularly important, as he notes, in the context of the Crown
guarantee that my department is given. In exchange for providing the
Crown guarantee, the Government negotiated a number of amendments to
the scheme rules that protect the interests of the Government as
guarantor. These include, for example, a requirement for the trustees
to consult my department on the scheme investment strategy; to consult
on the appointment and removal of trustees; and to seek consent to any
increases in member benefits above existing entitlements. Departmental
officials now also sit on the scheme’s investments
sub-committee.</hs_para>

an important part of protecting the accrued rights of members of the
scheme. It provides that if it were ever unable to meet payments to
members, the Government would make payments to the scheme to enable it
to meet those obligations. I think it was in reference to that that the
noble Lord was asking where the money would come from. That would have
to be built in to the department’s future liabilities, but we
certainly do not see that as a possibility of the moment. It is
optional, and if the scheme were ever to fall below 104% and the draw
on it became greater, at that stage that might become a
problem.</hs_para>

expect the cost of the Government to be very limited or even nothing as
a result of the fact that it is so well funded at the moment. The
arrangements are included within the formal rules governing the scheme,
and there is therefore no need for separate specific provisions to be
made to the Bill or within a future transfer scheme. I hope that the

It has provided the sort of information that I was seeking. I
understand that, as things currently stand, the scheme is fully and
properly funded and therefore there is no call on the guarantee. We are
seeking to understand whether the actual existence of the guarantee
itself features in any way in public expenditure. I imagine that the
answer is probably no if there is no current likelihood of a call on
it. However, I would be grateful to understand that a little better. I

position of the pension fund. If that is fully funded and not drawing

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to
Amendment 6. Amendment 5 requires that a transfer scheme must make
effective arrangements for the managing of existing audit contracts.
These are contracts that are due to expire upon the completion of the
2016-17 audits unless they are extended up to 2020, as we have
discussed. It is understood that there could be up to 10 such contracts
as well as a few separate contracts relating to smaller bodies. Any
successor body would have to manage these contracts after the abolition
of the Audit Commission, effectively for a minimum period of about two
and a half years.</hs_para>

matter, as the annual value of these arrangements is understood to be
of the order of £85 million. We look to the Minister
to share her thoughts on how this is all to be done. Presumably this is
not just a case of novating the contracts, because the successor body
will have to have some of the commission’s existing statutory
functions relating to audit. Is it not the case that, in undertaking
the management of these contacts, any body will have to set standards
of performance, monitor delivery and effect payment but will to be able
to exercise some of the statutory powers that reside with the
commission, particularly powers relating to the appointment of
auditors, the setting of scale fees, making arrangements for the
certification of grant claims and returns? It is understood, for
example, that the key functions would encompass 
<?notus-xml column=25?>specifying the terms of an auditor’s appointment; considering and
approving, where appropriate, requests from auditors to accept
additional non-audit work at audited bodies; specifying standards of
performance, including setting target dates for the issuing of

mandated work programmes—for example, quality audits or IFRS
arrangements reviews at NHS bodies; reviewing requests for new
certification work; and a whole list of other things as well.</hs_para>

is planned for the management of these contracts? There is complexity
attached to that management. Does the Minister agree that whoever does
this will need to have some of the statutory powers of the commission,
with the public accountability that goes with such powers? What does
the future hold for the additional audit-related functions undertaken
by NHS audit—functions that would include collecting information
from auditors; preparing and publishing summaries of the results of
audits in the annual auditing and accounts report for the Department of
Health accounting officer; co-ordinating requests for information from
the NAO in connection with its group auditor role; collecting
information directly from auditors and monitoring delivery; agreeing
auditor submission requirements with the Department of Health and the
NHS Commissioning Board in connection with consolidated accounts to
monitor delivery; and providing a range of guidance and advice for
auditors and dealing with technical queries from auditors on technical
issues to promote consistency. That is just a snapshot of

something we see as essential—and that auditors will continue to
have the necessary means to undertake their role. We agree that the key
function will be required to manage contracts for the remainder of
their term, but they will particularly require powers to set fees,
appoint auditors and certify grants. We are working to ensure that the
interim management arrangements will allow functions to be exercised by

Secretary of State to make a scheme or schemes to transfer the property

The scheme also includes provision for the transfer of employees, if
appropriate, under TUPE regulations. We intend to set out details of
the arrangements in transfer management of the audit contracts in such
a transfer scheme in due course. We are working on this with these
organisations, including those that the noble Lord has mentioned, and
we are giving consideration to the transfer of current Audit

of an organisation compare to others’, the latest planned

other two amendments in this group. Perhaps we may start with the most
substantive one, Amendment 9. This amendment was prompted by the third
report of this Session by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee. It drew attention to Clause 47 of the Bill relating to
regulations or orders under Clause 2. Clause 2 enables the Secretary of
Statement by affirmative regulations to include someone as a relevant
authority and to make provision about how the Bill affects them. This
is the case even though the regulations might be a hybrid instrument,
although Clause 47 requires it to be treated as not a hybrid. The

alternative means of protection. This is what Amendment 9 seeks to do,
by requiring the publication of consultation on a draft of the intended
regulation. Parliamentary counsel will doubtless be able to devise more
appropriate wording, but there is a point that needs to be addressed.
Hybridity arises when a provision can affect specific private or local
interest in a different manner from the private or local interest of
other persons or bodies of the same class. If hybrid, there is a wider
process for consideration of an instrument. Let us hope that the
Minister will accept the advice of the Delegated Powers Committee on
this, or alternatively will justify why Clause 40(7) is deemed
necessary. What situation is envisaged that would need this

reverse order, but I shall go straight to his Amendments 7 and 8. I am
sympathetic to their purpose, which is to ensure that the relevant
bodies are consulted before they are added to or taken off the list at
Schedule 2. Regulations that may be made to alter the list of
authorities in Schedule 2 will also be subject to the affirmative
resolution, so Parliament will have an opportunity to scrutinise any

the potential for hybrid instruments, I am clear that the Delegated
Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has drawn the attention of the
House to Clause 40(7) of this Bill, which provides that regulations
under the clause that would normally be considered a hybrid instrument
will not 
<?notus-xml column=28?>be so considered for the purposes of this Bill. We expect that the need
to bring forward such regulations will be rare. However, if there were
such cases, there will be an especially compelling reason for the
Government to consult, and we will address that point when we respond
to the Delegated Powers Committee, which will happen as soon as
possible. The answer is in draft anyway. The point that the committee
has made about consultation is well understood and taken up. We do not
think that it is necessary to add further legal requirements for
consultation; we believe that they are there already. With those
reassurances, I hope that the noble Lord feels able to withdraw his

address that issue more formally when they respond to the Delegated

favourably to the point that the committee has made. I have not before
encountered an issue when something this hybrid must be deemed not to

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 10 is  a minor and
technical amendment. It does not affect the intended effect of the
Bill. Its purpose is to correct a reference in Schedule 2 so that it
refers to Paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 to the Audit Commission
Act 1998 rather than to Paragraph 5. Schedule 2 lists the
relevant authorities to which the provisions of the Bill apply.
Paragraph 29 of the schedule ensures that the Bill covers any bodies
that were subject to audit provisions contained in enactments passed
before the Audit Commission Act 1998, to which the provisions of the
1998 Act were then
applied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000151">Paragraph
29 refers to Schedule 4 to the 1998 Act, which contains transitional
and savings provisions. Paragraph 7 of Schedule 4 to the 1998 Act,

enactments to earlier forms of audit, such as district audit, to be
read as references to audit under the 1998 
<?notus-xml column=29?>Act. Paragraph 29 of Schedule 2 is meant to extend this savings
provision so that bodies covered by it will be covered by the Bill when

Amendment 16. Amendment 11 amplifies the reference to the statement of
accounts that must ensue from adequate accountancy records and adds the
requirement that they show a true and fair view. Amendment 16 inserts
an equivalent into the general duties of auditors in Clause 19. It
requires them to satisfy themselves that the accounts give a true and

auditors of health service bodies under Clause
20.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000154">I am

10 of the principal regulations to prepare accounts that present fairly

Regulation 5 amends the principal regulation so as to require the

was based on the fact that from 2007 the code of practice for local

was fully compliant with generally UK-accepted accounting principles.
The drive to full GAAP compliance was twofold: pressure from the then

with GAAP, and the need for consistency of accounting practice across
the public sector engendered by the preparation of whole of government

Government’s intention to continue these requirements. These
requirements are currently achieved through the interaction of primary
and secondary legislation, the Audit Commission Act 1998 and the
Account and Audit (England) Regulations 2011. All relevant authorities
must observe proper practices in the preparation of their accounts. The
regulations require chief finance officers of larger relevant bodies to
certify that the statement of accounts presents a true and fair view of

they are required to ensure that their accounts “present
fairly” or “properly present”, which are briefer
and more proportionate forms of accounting. It is our view that that
the current split between primary and secondary legislation works, and
we intend that the interaction of the Bill and regulations under Clause
31 will continue to require larger relevant authorities to ensure that

change the scope of health authorities’ audit, or that of

been spent in accordance with Parliament’s intentions. This is
necessary because the resources available to health bodies are provided
by Parliament. Expenditure by clinical commissioning groups is
consolidated into the Department of Health’s accounts, and the
department must be able to demonstrate to Parliament that all resources
have been used in the way that Parliament intended. I hope that, with
that explanation, the noble Lord may feel able to withdraw his

There is that very clear reference to “true and fair

or the presentation has simply been chosen to be different in Clause

amendment. Clause 3 deals with the general requirements for accounts
and sets down the definition of “adequate accounting
records”. Clause 3(5)(b) enables the Secretary of State by
affirmative regulations to enable any requirement in the section not to
apply, or to apply with modifications to a relevant authority. The
requirement to keep adequate accounting records is fairly fundamental
and it is difficult to see the circumstances in which it would be
inapplicable. What use is envisaged of these provisions, particularly

regulation-making power to lift or modify the duties imposed by Clause
3 as they apply to particular bodies. Clause 3, as the noble Lord has
said, requires relevant authorities other than health service bodies to
keep adequate accounting records and prepare an annual statement of
accounts. These are fundamental duties, and I can see why the noble
Lord might question these powers. Nevertheless, there is a need for

in the structure of local bodies may mean that the production of a
statement of accounts is unnecessary or that financial accountability
would be better served by including the financial transactions of an
authority in the statement of another authority. To give an example of
this, last year the police authorities were replaced by police and
crime commissioners. In November, accountability for police finances
was better served by the commissioners producing a single statement for
the full year, including the transactions of the police authority. The
police authorities were therefore relieved of their duty to produce
published accounts for their final months, and the police commissioners
thereby took on that responsibility.</hs_para>

Earl of Lytton:</Member></B> My Lords, as this is the first time on
which I have spoken in Committee, I should declare my interests,
particularly that I am president of the National Association of Local
Councils, the parent body of parish and town councils. I am a
vice-president-in-waiting of the LGA, if that is the correct term for
the particular interregnum that I am in at the moment. I should declare
one other interest in that one of my children works as an accountant
for one of the big four accountancy firms, but they work on something
that I think is called transaction services rather than
audit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000177">I thank
the Minister for arranging at short notice last week a meeting, which
was extremely helpful in refining some things. I am sorry if, in a
sense, I am going over old territory in order to get things on the
record. I am also aware that I am in the presence of very great
experience, not only of audit but of local government management at
senior level. I certainly cannot claim to hold a candle to any of
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061745000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000178">For the
purpose of this group, in speaking to Amendment 12A, I shall speak also
to Amendments 13A and 13B, and 14A to 14C. My intention is
to probe further the Government’s intentions. I accept that a
sector with 9,500 parishes spending £500 million a year in
aggregate requires oversight, and I do not quibble with the
coalition’s intention to abolish the Audit Commission. However,
unlike large charities with many branches, or for that matter small
charities with a freestanding existence, this sector is hallmarked by
thousands of autonomous and often very small councils, a large number
of which are in this first tier of local government and benefit at the
moment from economies of scale in procuring their audit and other
routine tasks.</hs_para>

is equated with an individual duty for a separate audit appointment,
that does not sit entirely easily with the general geometry of the
sector, especially as around 80% of them have come together voluntarily
to form the individual members of the national association. Doing
things together non-politically and collaboratively is a large part of
how parish and town councils try to operate. I was heartened by the
Minister’s earlier comments about the freedom of collective and
individual audit appointment, although we may need to tease that out a
little further to determine precisely how it will work.

for audit scrutiny of some sort, tailored to the risks and proportional
to the gravity of the council undertakings, is common ground. The
question is how we enshrine that in legislation and ensure that all
those entrusted with public money are held to account to the degree
necessary. In nearly every case, parish and town councils are
quantifiably different from the scale of principal authorities. At one
end of the scale there is a town council with 78,000 electors and a
very substantial annual income, 
<?notus-xml column=34?>but that is not typical of the sector. One of the issues that we
sometimes have is that the parish and town council sector is so diverse
in terms of the size and complexity of what they do that it makes it
very difficult to legislate in a cohesive way for all of
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061745000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000181">The
proposal seems to provide for three tiers of regime, if I can call it
that: namely, an exemption for those with a turnover of under
£25,000, an intermediate stage requiring a limited assurance
audit for authorities with a turnover under £6.5 million, and
those above that which will face the full audit arrangements. According
to my information, all parish and town councils, with one or two
exceptions, will fall into the sub-£6.5 million
turnover bracket, so we are dealing mainly with the cut-off point
between total and partial exemption. So far as I know, 65% will be
exempted altogether—they fall under the £25,000
threshold—and that leaves about 3,300 parish and town councils
that will be caught. That is not a significant amount, particularly if
the sector grows as the localism agenda envisages. That means that at
the margin, at the break point, there will be a certain amount of toing
and froing in the transition, to which I will refer
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000182">I
flagged up at Second Reading the requirement for an audit panel to have
a majority of independent members. What measures does the Minister
think will be possible or practical to prevent it becoming the tail

these issues through the device of amending the suite of criteria
governing  the Secretary of State’s

purpose of Amendment 12A is simply to clarify that the Secretary of
State may, in considering the application of the requirement, also
exempt an authority. It is not clear whether there will be a facility
to exempt once it had been caught. This would apply at or around the
break point of £25,000. I say this because £25,000 is
less than half of the cost of a qualified full-time clerk, which tells
us something about what we are dealing with. I am concerned that the
bar is set a little too low here, and perhaps that ought to be looked
at.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000185">I am
mindful of barriers to the progression and growth of parishes,
particularly when the threshold represents a significant cost or
administrative impediment or is seen to do so. The Secretary of State

13A describes some of the criteria that might apply. The key words here
are “onerous or disproportionate”, which are intended to
be the guiding sentiment. However, I accept that they are relative
rather than absolute terms, and for that reason I am not sure that I
will not get the answer from the Minister that naturally
flows—that the matter is 
<?notus-xml column=35?>indeterminate. However, for the same reasons that I mentioned about the

13B seeks to drill down what we mean by “turnover” and
whether it is right to take a single year’s figure or, as my
amendment suggests, an average. I can think of a situation where one
year’s figures are skewed by a single, one-off event that could
be for reasons wholly unrelated to an authority’s normal income,
such as a developer contribution towards something or other. It would
help to avoid councils flipping in and out of the requirements if we
had an average, as my amendment suggests, spread over three years.
However, there may be technical objections to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000188">Amendment

understand what the Minister said earlier about this not being, in a

monocultural approach. However, the potential economies of scale,
savings and cost could be significant. It may well be that the Audit
Commission itself lacked competition to ameliorate its charges, but
that does not avoid the principle of giving value for money for
taxpayers. That is all that I have to say on this. I beg to

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord has raised
some important questions with these amendments. My Amendment 14
overlaps a bit with them, so I might as well get it out of the way now.
It concerns the rules that govern these various thresholds—the
£6.5 million, the £200,000 and the £25,000. This
is a boring accounting point, but there is a question about how you
actually compute them. Looking at what the income of a parish council
might be, for example, there might be a precept, which presumably gets
counted in as gross income. However, if there are things like entrance
fees, the sale of publications or the letting of premises, do you have
to deal with these on a gross or net basis for working out whether the
threshold is breached or met? I first focused on this in relation to
the £6.5 million threshold, but there seems to be a lot of
headway for authorities there so that is unlikely to be great issue.
However, if those same rules operate for the lower thresholds, then
they could be
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-17T17:47:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13061745000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000192"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="13061745000331" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000331">Baroness
Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, this may take only a little time, partly
because the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, and I have had an opportunity to
discuss the issues that he has raised today. Actually, I may take a
little

thank the noble Earl not only for the thoughtful contribution that he
has made today but for the pragmatic way in which we have discussed the
whole issue of having a central or non-central body to do this. The
regulations that the Government propose in relation to smaller
authorities need to accomplish two things. They need, first, to enable
the development of a viable sector-led body to appoint auditors to
smaller authorities and, secondly, to set up a proportionate accounting
and audit regime for small authorities that minimises the
administrative burden while ensuring accountability for the public
money that they control.</hs_para>

relation to the first of those points, I am grateful to the noble Earl
for being pragmatic about this,  and for listening to what I
said earlier about systems such as this being central but not
mandatory and giving opportunities for smaller authorities
that wish to appoint their own auditors to do so. In reality, though,
one is bound to say that for the small authorities it would be a
godsend to have a body helping them with it. While we certainly will
not change our view about the question of whether this is mandatory, we
would expect quite a large number of the small authorities to want to
join in. I am pleased to be able to offer the noble Earl the assurances
that he seeks that we will bring forward regulations in relation to the
sector-led body. I will write to him setting these out and then perhaps
we can discuss them further if necessary. The second purpose of the
smaller authorities regulations will be to set out proportionate
accounting and audit requirements.</hs_para>

statement of policy intent, which I hope is now in the
Library—it should have gone in today—which will share
with noble Lords further detail about the proposed audit arrangements
for smaller authorities. In this document, the Government confirm their
intention to retain the limited assurance form of audit. It will be
specified in the code of audit practice, which will be produced
following abolition of the Audit Commission by the National Audit
Office. As the noble Lord said, limited assurance audit is a
lighter-touch form of audit, which is conducted offsite and is
proportionate to the small amounts of public money that the smaller
authorities control.</hs_para>

intend to maintain the  current accounting requirements for
smaller authorities. In addition, they propose to exempt the smallest
authorities—those with an annual turnover below
£25,000—from the requirement to have external audit. In
the command paper published with the draft Bill last year, we said that
we would review how this level works, if necessary raising the
threshold once the system is up and running. Therefore, it is in mind
but how it is working will have to be demonstrated. The exemption will
not apply in certain circumstances. For example, where a small
authority is newly created or where an authority’s auditor
issued a public interest report in the previous financial year,
authorities exempted from external audit will be required to appoint an
auditor to undertake those public interest duties.</hs_para>

specific amendments, I think I will turn to Amendment 12A at the end.
That is what the noble Earl did and, if I may, I will follow his line.
Starting with Amendment 13A, this appears to capture the noble
Earl’s concerns most fully. The amendment enables the
Government, when making the regulations under Clause 5, to have regard
to the size of the electorate, the authority’s income, and
whether the effect of those regulations would be “onerous or
disproportionate”. The Government’s view is that the
regulation-making powers in Clause 5 allow us to do that without
additional provision.</hs_para>

purpose in taking those powers is to enable them to make regulations
that will set out a proportionate accounting and audit regime for
smaller authorities. The proportionality that the Government envisage
will be defined in relation to the higher of the authority’s
gross income and gross expenditure rather than just its income, a point
raised by the noble Earl. We do not propose to take into account the
size of an authority’s electorate because income and expenditure
are the most relevant criteria in relation to the primary purpose of
audit, which is safeguarding public money. The size of an
authority’s electorate is not material and members of a large
electorate may individually pay a very small precept and vice
versa.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061745000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000199">I turn
to Amendment 12A. One of the purposes of Clause 3 is to specify the
financial year for relevant authorities that are not health service
bodies. It does that in subsection (4) with reference to 31 March, but
subsection (5)(a) gives a power by regulation to change that period
either for all authorities or for particular authorities. Subsection
(6) allows regulations changed in the financial year to make amendments
or modifications to this legislation or provisions made under it in
their application to the bodies whose financial years are changed. The
main purpose of that power is to allow dates to be changed to such
purpose as the preparation and publication of the statement of accounts
so that they are consistent with the changed period of the financial
year.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13061745000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130617-gc0001.htm#13061745000200">I hope
that this explanation will provide a useful background to understanding
Amendment 12A. The amendment adds the words “including
exemption” after the word “application”. I find it
difficult to see what this adds to the power. If the purpose is to
confirm that the financial year can be altered even for a body that is
exempt from audit, I am happy to confirm that, but I have to say that
the Bill as it stands allows that and the amendment would not do
anything
more.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_17_PT_1/FD2B098E3A2F6B59FA19033A452340A8774214DE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 June 2013">Monday,

Amendment 14 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie,
once I have finished with the amendments in the group. Amendments 14A
and 14B would enable regulations to exempt or partially exempt a
smaller authority from the need to have an auditor panel. The
sector-led body for smaller authorities that, as we have already said,
we intend to provide for in regulations that are non-mandatory, will in
effect assume the functions of the auditor panel. We propose to exempt
smaller authorities which have opted into the sector-led body from the
requirement to have an auditor panel. By definition, the auditor
scrutiny

however, apply to smaller authorities which opt out of the sector-led
body. I suggest that these will need to appoint an auditor panel to
advise on the appointment of an auditor, which would ensure that proper
scrutiny takes place. We do not expect those auditor panels to be
large. The Bill does not set a minimum size, but Treasury and CIPFA

perhaps I could refer to Amendment 14, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord

whether an authority qualifies as a smaller authority in a financial

audit regulations to define the smaller bodies threshold and no further
guidance is given, but I see that with a duty in future being on the
relevant bodies to assess their income and expenditure against the

could be useful. This guidance need not be statutory or issued by the
Secretary of 
<?notus-xml column=39?>State. However, the Secretary of State may issue guidance on this matter
if he wishes. In addition, there is provision in subsection (5) to
enable the Secretary of State to make regulations to amend Clause 6.

such

health leads in Public Health England are currently convening a
steering group to commence work on a guidance document for local
authorities on community based oral health improvement programmes,
including those linked to schools. There are no plans to reintroduce
school screening checks. In 2006, the National Screening Committee
(NSC) advised that the routine dental screening of children in primary
