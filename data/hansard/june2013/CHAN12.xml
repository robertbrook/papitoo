Will the Minister look into the situation? Does he accept that as long

will continue, and will he consider an arrangement whereby those who
use straightforward white diesel are given a rebate and those who do

suggesting that there was any complacency about fuel smuggling, which
is a serious matter. However, the original question related
specifically to whether it was increasing. We are very
conscious—as are the Treasury and HMRC—of the need to
establish where the profits from fuel smuggling go, but the taxation

“Crisis? What crisis?” It is not good enough. As well as
the nine-year high, the number of people held in the back of ambulances
has doubled since he took office. The number of people waiting on
trolleys for more than four hours has doubled, and there are now more

last time Labour met its targets in Wales on accident and emergency was
2009. It has not met a target for four years, under Labour. Under this

is happening in our national health service; let me tell him what is
happening in our national health service. Under this Government,
in-patient waiting times are lower than at the election, out-patient
waiting times are lower than at the election, and the rate of
hospital-acquired infections is at a record low. On the number of
mixed-sex wards, they have almost been abolished under this Government.
There are 400,000 more operations being carried out every year and,
crucially, there are 5,700 more doctors. Let me tell him what would
happen if we followed Labour’s spending plans on the
NHS—there are new figures out today. There would be 43,000 fewer
nurses and 11,000 fewer doctors. We decided, because we value the NHS,
to spend more. That man there, the right hon. Member for Leigh (Andy

the Government to change course. Labour Members will be led by those

Culling makes TB worse by spreading the disease in the first two years.
The benefits across the whole culling area appear only after year 3,
but in the ring area—the edge of where the cull is carried
out—there are never any benefits. Do the farmers whose land lies
alongside the cull zones realise that? I think
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T12:40:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0001.htm#13060568000198">Labour’s
culls showed that culling badgers is estimated to reduce the incidence
of TB in cattle by 16% after nine years—84% of the problem is
still there. Sixteen per cent. is the best-case scenario based on the
TB rate being twice as high in the cull area as it is in the land
outside. However, if background TB rates are constant across the whole
area, that benefit reduces to just 12%. Moreover, this is not an
absolute reduction; it is a 16% reduction from the trend increase.
Therefore, after nine years there will still be more TB around than at
the beginning. There is 16% less than there would have been without a
cull<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T12:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0001.htm#13060568000199">I

difference with the current culls is that they do not have a maximum

scientists who conducted the cull is that hard boundaries were used

culls took place over eight to 12 days; the proposed culls will take

by a factor of 1.7, showing that slow culls, which this Government are
licensing, increase TB in badgers. If the methodology changes, so too
do the predicted results. These culls risk making TB worse. Slow
culling makes TB worse in badgers, and perturbation makes TB worse in
cattle on neighbouring farms.</hs_Para>

basis, the one thing we know is that it will drive the badgers away and
increase the problem for the neighbouring farm. That is why illegal
killing of badgers is so incredibly selfish of farmers, because it is
effectively spreading the infection around the neighbourhood. Farmers
are frustrated; I understand that. They believe that this cull is the

when the police face 20% cuts, asking armed response vehicles to go out
into the countryside will take further resources away from the cities,
where there tends to be more gun crime, for example, than there is in
the countryside. Monitoring all this is very problematic for police
forces. When I spoke to someone from the Devon and Cornwall police, I
was told that they had only a tiny number of response vehicles to
monitor the area from the end of Cornwall all the way up to Exeter, yet
they are already facing a huge challenge.</hs_Para>

vaccinating. However, when the Government’s estimate of the cost
of policing the cull—£1,429 per square kilometre per
year—is added, vaccination becomes the cheaper option. What a
pity for farmers that DEFRA Ministers cancelled five of Labour’s
six badger vaccination trials. Early results from the remaining site
near Stroud show a 79% reduction in TB transmission to unvaccinated
badger cubs, which means that they are almost certainly less infectious
to cattle and to other badgers. Two or three years of vaccination would

agreement between the political parties. That was certainly the case in
the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s, when a combination of political consensus

question but I will touch on it now. Clearly, an effective badger
vaccine has a valuable role to play, once the disease is under control.
I have discussed this at length in the Republic of Ireland, where they
have got the disease well on the way down. Once it can be got to those
really low levels—this answers the question from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T13:25:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

that, but the vaccine has to work.</hs_Para>

worry—I am jumping ahead a bit in respect of Wales
here—is that at the moment there is nothing to be gained by
vaccinating a diseased animal. Such an animal can continue to be a
super-excreter and can continue to spread disease. That is the problem
I have with the Welsh experiment. We are very interested in
it and we will watch it carefully, but from my
travels—I was particularly struck by the Irish experience, and
they have done a lot of work on this—I know that the lesson is,
“You have to get the disease down to a certain level to get
healthy badgers, and then you protect them.” We all want to see
healthy badgers living alongside healthy cattle, and the real lesson
from Ireland is that the average badger there is now 1 kg heavier than
before the cull was begun there. So the Irish have achieved where we
want to go; they are getting a healthy badger population, which is
exactly what we want, but that is the point at which vaccinations can
be deployed. I am not entirely convinced that the Welsh Government are
on the right track—I think they are going in too early, because
they have not got a grip on the disease—but we wish them

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T13:27:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Minister of State about it. It is certainly worth examining the
approach of creating rings, but the lesson from other countries is that
we have really got to get the disease reservoir down first and then we
can create a band. The problem is that with the level of disease we are
talking about we cannot gain an advantage by vaccinating a diseased
animal that is already a super-excreter—it can go on excreting
disease in huge volumes. Another of my questions revealed that 1 ml of
badger urine produces 300,000 colony forming units of disease, and it
takes very few—a single number of those—to infect a
cattle by aspiration. Such an approach will not have the effect, so
what my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T13:28:24"></hs_TimeCode> right

want to focus on a few issues, the first of which concerns estimating
badger populations. As has already been mentioned, the persistent
difficulty of knowing how many badgers are in the cull areas has not
been satisfactorily resolved and could still make the culls unworkable.
We know from the randomised badger culling trial that the only
circumstances in which the 
<?notus-xml column=1539?>spread of the disease can be slowed slightly—and even that
reduction was only by 16% over nine years—would be if more than
70% of the badgers in an area were eradicated. If the reduction were
any less than that, the spread of TB to cattle could
increase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T13:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000358">The
difficulty of knowing how many badgers there are in an area has been
raised many times, including by Lord Krebs and others. Last year, the
Government delayed plans to cull badgers as they could not work out how
many badgers there were in the cull areas. I understand that according
to the Government’s own figures, farmers in Gloucestershire must
kill between 2,856 and 2,932 badgers, but according to Professor Rosie
Woodroffe at the Zoological Society of London, the estimate of the
population ranges much more widely, from 2,657 to 4,079, and there is a
40% chance that the figure for the real population lies outside that
range<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T13:38:26"></hs_TimeCode>. Professor
Woodroffe has concluded that if the real population is below the
minimum cull target of 2,856, farmers could kill every badger in the
area, breaking the strict condition of the licence that forbids local
extinctions while simultaneously failing to kill enough badgers to
satisfy the terms of the same licence. The situation is similar in
Somerset<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T13:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000359">I
would be interested to know from the Minister whether the estimates of
the number of badgers in the area factor in the number of badgers
killed illegally by farmers. A study from the universities of Bangor,
Kent and Kingston this year found that approximately one in 10
livestock farmers in Wales had illegally killed a badger within the
previous 12 months. In Gloucestershire, there have been press reports
of allegations that at the Forthampton estate, an area of 3,000 acres
near Tewkesbury that will be one of the main staging points for the
cull, badger setts have been illegally filled in. If those allegations
prove to be true, the estate may have to withdraw from the cull, which
would affect the number of badgers killed and therefore the
effectiveness of the cull, as I have
explained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000360" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000360">My
hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) mentioned the
humaneness of the killing. The Humane Society International UK recently
obtained from a freedom of information request the heavily
redacted document that will be used to monitor the humaneness of the
badger cull. I would like to take up the concerns voiced by the
society. Will the Minister make public how wounded animals that retreat
underground will be included in the humaneness assessment? That is not
mentioned in the document. The document admits that no shooter will
have prior experience of shooting badgers. My office spoke to Pauline
Kidner from the Secret World wildlife rescue, which is based in
Somerset and has worked with badgers for many years. She said that
badgers are not an easy animal to shoot, and when injured will always
go back to their sett. So free shooting is likely to result in a slower
death as a result of secondary infections and starvation
from reduced mobility, and that will prolong the pain and distress
suffered by badgers.</hs_Para>

McCarthy:</Member></B> Yes. It is a huge difference, and there is a
debate to be had about the cost of vaccination, which I think is the
Government’s main objection to it. I do not think it is about
effectiveness; I think they are cost-driven. In the vaccination
programme that is operated in Somerset by Secret World wildlife rescue,
the cost of vaccination is much lower because the programme is
volunteer-led. I do not know whether the Minister has factored that
into his
calculations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000366" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000366">The

yet the Opposition did not suggest any alternatives. Those who

my limited remarks on vaccination. I thank all those witnesses,
including Ministers, who, in an incredibly short period, gave so
generously of their time to respond to our Select Committee inquiry,
and to colleagues for accommodating the very tight timetable. We
concluded that vaccination is no magic bullet in the search for a
solution to bovine TB. As the Secretary of State said, this is a
bacterium that affects humans, and I have had family members just one
generation ago who suffered from TB with lifelong consequences. In the
report, we warn that vaccination is expensive, offers no guarantee of
protection and will provide little benefit in the immediate
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000371" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000371">I
shall cover some of the points linked to cattle vaccination. We commend
the investment by successive Governments—the hon. Member for
Wakefield referred to her own, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State to current investment—but there are many hurdles to
overcome. The European Commission evidence before the Committee, both
in writing and orally, clearly set out that there is an indicative
timetable of a 10-year period before vaccination will be
operational.</hs_Para>

other issues. We need to change the legislation. We need to negotiate
with both the European Union and the World Organisation for Animal
Health, which is known as the OIE, so that those cattle that have been
injected, and their products, will be admitted in free circulation in
other member states. That is the dilemma that many farmers will face.
The hon. Member for Wakefield did not address the fact that when a
vaccine becomes readily available, we will need to persuade
farmers—cost issues aside—that it is in their interests
to vaccinate. We need a cross-party approach to ensure that we use all
lines of communication in those negotiations with the
Commission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000373">It
is important to factor in a cattle vaccine cost of £5
to £6 a dose. The DIVA test will cost an additional £25,
which at least will show whether an animal is reacting to the vaccine
or is infected. As regards badger vaccination, it is regrettable that
there is no evidence to date to show that it reduces the incidence of
TB in cattle. We are uncertain as yet of the implications for herd
immunity. One of the Select Committee’s key recommendations,
which I hope the Secretary of State will pursue, is that an advisory
service be set up to help NGOs and charities plan and deploy
vaccination. We also hope he will respond to our plea to allow farmers
to become trained vaccinators and inject the vaccine. We worked out
that only 25% of badgers would face a reduced risk of infection if
vaccinated, so we emphasise that Government research is urgently needed
to provide confidence in the level of efficacy to enable such a vaccine
to be used
strategically.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000374">The
development of an effective oral vaccine for badgers seems fraught with
challenges. The cost is £6 million of research since
2005-06, with another £7.5 million allocated in the
next five years, but we must be aware that no vaccine is ready for use
yet. We urge the public to be aware that there is a mismatch between
the public expectation of having a vaccine available and the current
state of scientific evidence. A vaccine must be cost-effective and easy
to
deploy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000375" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000375">I

skin test, which costs £3, and the diagnostic blood test, which

likely that a significant proportion of cattle-to-cattle transmission
of bovine TB may be going undetected, and that the role of badgers in
the spread of the disease may have been overestimated. A recent
scientific paper suggested that as many as two in 10
infected cattle might be missed by the test used to check whether
cattle are infected with TB. Other research suggests that up to 21% of
herds may still be harbouring infection after being cleared from
movement restrictions, and 
<?notus-xml column=1547?>that larger herds suffer not just a high incidence of the disease but a
faster rate of spread between cattle. In EU evidence to the Select
Committee on Environment, Food and Rural Affairs earlier this year,
reduced cattle movement was flagged as the single biggest difference
between the UK and the rest of
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000408" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000408">Improving
biosecurity must also take priority, and it would cost farmers an
average of £4,000, compared with £27,000 to deal with a
TB herd breakdown. When applied correctly, barriers, gates, fencing and
so forth can be 100% efficient, so perhaps some of the money being
thrown at culling should instead be directed towards helping farmers to
keep badgers out of their farm buildings. Steve Jones, a farmer deeply
concerned about biosecurity, urges that something be done about water
troughs, which act as a reservoir for TB, because they are rarely
cleaned out. As he

that needs to be part of a concerted effort to adopt better hygiene
standards across the agricultural industry. Of course farmers already
know the importance of immediately quarantining cows infected with TB,
of isolation areas to separate those animals and prevent
cross-infection, and of limiting contact between cattle and local
wildlife. In all those respects, we need to help farmers to be
proactive and follow the advice of, say, Natural England about on-farm
biosecurity and badger exclusion zones. I fear that farmers are being
given the impression that culling is the answer to all these problems,
when that simply is not the case. The Government’s strategy has
been reactive to the spread of bovine TB; it needs to be proactive,
with increased biosecurity and rigorous cattle movement
controls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000410" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000410">A

vaccination or TB infection. There is no evidence that DEFRA is doing
nearly enough on the test, or on discussions with the European

Well, pilots are by definition untested. Once we have evidence that the

Herefordshire is one of those counties. The number of badgers exceeds

want to say a few words about the implications of testing for farmers.
They have to pay for a vet to come, normally on a yearly basis. They
have to bring all their stock in to be tested. If there is a reactor,
within a couple of days when the vet comes back that animal will be
slaughtered. That locks down all movement on that farm for 60 days.
Yes, farmers gets compensation for slaughtered animals, but not for the
lock-down. If they were taking animals to be covered or if they were
taking animals to market, all that would stop. Some 28,000 cattle are
slaughtered, costing the taxpayer £100 million in
compensation and costs. From last January to this January the number of
reactors has gone up by 24.2%. Bovine TB is a dreadful disease and we

the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh) so I will not rehash the same

protected species under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. That is an
important and powerful fact to remember. Secondly, for 
<?notus-xml column=1551?>the cull to be effective, 70% of all badgers need to be culled. We do
not know how many badgers there are. DEFRA estimated the population in
the pilot area to be 1,300 in every 300 km area, but the randomised
badger culling trials estimated the figure to be 3,000, so will the
licence to kill be to shoot 910 or 2,100 badgers? The difference will
be dramatic. I do not understand how a 70% target can be set without
knowing what the total figure
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:22:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000436" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000436">Thirdly,
and most important to me, are the logistics of a cull. If there is a
badger sett in my back garden, does that mean that people can come and
shoot the badgers on it? I do not understand the logic of that. If a
farmer does not want a cull on his land, does he have the right to stop
the cull, or will the animals be culled if he is in a TB hotspot? As

allowed to shoot a badger with a shotgun. It must be done by a trained

thing that concerns me is that there is a budget of £500,000 for
policing. Police often spend £500,000 to secure the safety of
just one march, so that seems a tiny amount for the three culling
areas. I believe the figure will be much higher. The Secretary of State
mentioned that culls had been effective in other countries, but it is a
lot easier to shoot a water buffalo with whatever gun it is than to
shoot a badger. Badgers are by nature private, they are nocturnal and
it is hard even to see them, let alone shoot them.

these issues could be resolved, but even if they were and a cull went
ahead, the estimate is that the reduction would be only 16% after nine
years. That is a tiny amount, if all the objections could be overcome.
Surely a better long-term solution is to put all our money and
resources into a bovine vaccine. The Government cut the funding for
research into and development of such a vaccine and the funding needs
to be restored. The British Veterinary Association says that £1
billion will be wasted on TB over the next decade. Surely if a small
percentage of that could be invested in research and getting the
vaccine closer—<I>[Interruption.]</I> If so, that is brilliant,

number of badgers has doubled in the past 10 years, as the
Secretary of State said. The number of cattle slaughtered in the past
10 years is a staggering 190,000. The cost so far has been £500
million, to which another £500 million could be added in the
next 10 years if we carry on as we are. The Secretary of
State has already drawn attention to the fact that he had a meeting
with the EU Commissioner. The simple fact is that if we do nothing, the
TB-free status of this country could be put at risk. As we heard,
whether we are members of the EU or not would make not a jot of
difference if the European Union declared that we had TB and our meat
could therefore not be exported to any countries that were members of
the EU. That would cause catastrophic loss to our
farmers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:27:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000445" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000445">In
Gloucestershire, which is one of the hotspots and which I have the
privilege to represent, one quarter of the farms are under movement
restrictions. This causes a huge financial loss to the farmers. Each TB
breakdown costs on average £34,000, of which the farmer picks up
£12,000 because of all the consequential losses of replacing
those cattle, the testing and so on. Currently, all the measures to
prevent the spread of TB have been focused on cattle. As soon as a TB
reactor is found in a herd, restrictions are placed on the entire herd
and the reactor animal is isolated pending valuation and compulsory
slaughter. The movement restrictions then remain in place until at
least two clear tests have been completed. When one thinks that a
quarter of my farmers in Gloucestershire are subjected to this number
of tests, one realises just how many tests are involved and the cost
and inconvenience of those

it is clear that badgers spread the disease, it would be foolish not to
take action against this vector of the disease. There has been a pretty
good-tempered debate today and Members have generally recognised that
every tool in the box must be used to combat this dreadful and
economically devastating disease. Surely one part of that must be the
cull, but the other part must be vaccination. The problem with
vaccination is that the only sensible way to vaccinate badgers is with
an oral vaccine. In my 21 years as a Member of Parliament, I have
always been told that an oral vaccine is just around the corner. Today
we are still being told that an oral vaccine is just around the

minuscule compared with the costs to the Welsh Assembly of vaccinating

Parish</B> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):</Member> This debate has shown
that the Secretary of State and the Minister have taken a brave
decision to go for the cull, which is absolutely necessary. Farmers in
my constituency and elsewhere in Devon feel that during 13 years of
Labour Governments they were told that a vaccination was just over the
hill. When Labour came to power, 6,000 cattle had TB, but when it left
there were 30,000 with the disease. It is the duty of this Government
to take action.</hs_Para>

constituency are at their wits’ end. There is hardly a cattle
farmer in Devon who has not been touched by TB—either it is
affecting them at the 
<?notus-xml column=1556?>moment, or during several tests they have not been able to sell cattle
because TB is in the herd. All the time, we are removing cattle from
herds with TB. We are cleansing those herds of TB. We then turn those
cattle into the fields where there are infected badgers. The Secretary
of State said clearly how infectious those badgers are—they are
giving the cattle TB, so we have to take
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000473" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000473">A
badger vaccine will not cure the infected badgers. Furthermore, the
current vaccine has to be injected every year. That is not practical.
The Opposition know that, but they will not face it. It is great shame
that we cannot have cross-party support on the issue, because in the
end the farmers cannot go on as they have been. Many of the cattle
taken are heifers in the dairy herds, which provide much needed good
food and dairy products. They are being slaughtered. The world has a
population of 7 billion and rising—we need more food, but the

more interventions. I think that the hon. Lady was asking whether
cattle spread disease to areas that were uninfected. Yes, they did to a

of us are countrymen and countrywomen who would love to have the badger
around. However, we want them to be healthy. We cannot leave diseased
badgers in the field, to infect cattle and each other. Once we have
reduced the number of badgers in those red-hot areas of TB, we will see
a much healthier badger population. I also believe that we will not see
as many badgers trying to mix with the cattle; there will not be the
pressure on feed, which is paramount. We are not talking about a
national cull of badgers. Our aim is not to exterminate badgers, but to
cure cattle and badgers of TB and make sure that we have healthy food
and livestock for our future.</hs_Para>

community feels despair because of the years of inaction from the

back to the Republic of Ireland, where statistics show that herds are
half as likely to be reinfected with TB in areas where
badgers have been culled. The beauty of the system there is that it
involves badgers to cattle and cattle to badgers.
Farming practices in the Republic are very much the same as
those in Northern Ireland, which shows that a controlled cull of
infected badgers will work. The farming community is behind the cull
and I believe that, when it is explained, the public will also
understand that the issue is about disease control and healthy cattle

wildlife.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13060568002062" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568002062">2.46

Science has shown that the large-scale culling of badgers is estimated

culling trial. That is not what the Government are doing. They are not
moving quickly enough with the science. The report by the Environment,

eradication of bovine TB in badgers will not lead to the eradication of
the disease in cattle, especially in a country with extremely high
cattle movement. Cattle-to cattle transmission would continue, as
already demonstrated in low-incidence areas such as Kent where evidence
shows that that type of transmission accounts for 80% or
more of cases. No other country in the world has yet eradicated bovine
TB in cattle, and they certainly have not reduced it with culling
alone. The Secretary of State was right earlier to refer to a package
of measures, but

particular, will
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:52:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
leading scientists note that a cull will reduce incidence of the
disease by 16% at best, but even that figure is based on a long-term,
large-scale cull. Therefore, the extensive, indiscriminate culling of
badgers, three quarters of which will not have TB, will leave 84% of
the problem. More worryingly, although bovine TB is relatively confined
at the moment to certain areas of the country, a cull could lead to the
problem spreading rather than being contained. To the colleague who
told me yesterday that his farmers want a cull because they neighbour
areas with the disease, let me say that I am against such a cull in
order to protect those farmers, not condemn them. Badgers do not adhere
to county borders and disperse under the threat of extinction. The cull
will not make any significant impact in the pilot areas, but it could
in those areas close by. It is welcome to hear from the Secretary of
State that DEFRA is using other preventive measures to control the
spread of the disease in those areas, but will that be
enough?</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:54:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh), on it. Severe
criticism of departmental delays and publication of misleading
information aside, it is clear that all sides wish to see a vast
improvement in developing and providing a vaccine solution to the
problem. As Kent Wildlife Trust put it to me, instead of culling
badgers, the Government should further improve cattle movement controls
and testing, and support farmers to implement simple biosecurity
measures. They should prioritise the development of a cattle vaccine,
and divert the estimated £6 million cost of licensing,
monitoring and policing the pilot culls into a major programme of
Government-funded badger vaccination. Only then will we get on top of
this disease in an effective
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:54:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000495" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000495">I
conclude by congratulating colleagues on this side
of the House who will show their opposition to
the cull by abstaining on the motion today. Within the Westminster
village we know and understand why many feel
uncomfortable going into the Opposition Lobby on an Opposition motion
that is, in effect, non-binding. It is a nuance often misunderstood
outside Parliament, but I thank those colleagues for their support all
the same. I, however, will not be abstaining, and although it will
probably make little difference in the great scheme of things, I want
my voting record to show that I am against this barbaric,
indiscriminate and ill-thought-through cull. I would prefer a
science-led, welfare-oriented response to the control and reduction of
bovine TB that protects both cattle and badgers from this nasty
disease.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_05_PT_1/F3D0608E8F724B03865A2F0D1265F6C3A464E0E3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 June 2013">Wednesday

advantage of speaking towards the end of the debate is that
I have had the opportunity to listen it as it unfurled, and I feel that
those who have contributed have engaged with the complex issues. I
compliment the Secretary of State on a clear and thoughtful exposition
of the Government’s position, and the shadow Secretary of State
on having spelled out issues on the other side of the equation.
Listening to both speeches—indeed, many speeches today—I
thought that there is actually a huge area of consensus in this debate.
The Secretary of State spoke cogently about the need to bear down on
the disease in cattle as well as in the wild animal population, and I
hear no disagreement about that. The disagreement is about the means
used, not their aim and purpose, and there is genuine concern across
the House about whether culling will improve the situation for famers,
or make it worse.</hs_Para>

emotive response to this debate is what makes it difficult to resolve.
I agree with the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:57:58"></hs_TimeCode>

problem, however, is that the evidence is not always conclusive one way

their views on this whole saga, I urge them to talk, just for a few
moments, to one or two of the people affected, and to look at the
online videos that are available, to get a feel for what the impact
really is. While we have been having this debate, five or six farm
animals, in many cases perfectly healthy, will have been killed. That
will have come at a cost to the taxpayer, but
above all it will have come at a serious cost to the farms in
question—not just a financial cost but a big emotional cost to
people whose animals are their way of life. I urge all Members on both

want to stick to two matters—vaccination in Wales and animal
welfare. Much has been made of the Welsh experiment in north
Pembrokeshire, next door to where I live. In an area of 10 miles by 10
miles, 1,424 animals have been vaccinated at a cost of £662
each. Let us not forget that that cost comes not just once but every
year. Forty per cent. of those animals will already be
suffering from TB and will therefore be completely
unaffected by the vaccination, so it will have been carried out at the
taxpayer’s expense with no benefit whatsoever. Moreover, the
population estimates are pretty inaccurate. The Welsh Assembly’s
estimate of 1,200 to 2,500 has a pretty wide margin, and more animals
than its minimum estimate have already been vaccinated. When the shadow
Secretary of State talks about the benefits of the Welsh model, I urge
her to bear in mind that it is a long way from being anything like
definitive, and we will not have the results for some years

animal welfare, the contrast between cruelty and suffering has often
been debated here. There is a claim, which I happen to disagree with,
that aspects of the cull are cruel. They may be ethically questionable,

humanely—I am talking about instant death—do not suffer.

want to refer to comments that were made a few years ago by people who
were opposed to these proposals, particularly those involved
with the RSPCA, the League Against Cruel Sports, and the Burns inquiry

few years later, we are suddenly told that those methods apparently do
not apply to a badger cull. The RSPCA pre-empted this by suggesting
that there is a huge difference between shooting a badger and shooting 
<?notus-xml column=1562?>a fox. The guidelines given to the marksmen make it very clear that they
must have the right weaponry and the right ammunition, and they must be
at close range. These weapons are, by the RSPCA’s own admission,
in the hands of very skilled people. One or two of the organisations
that are now making a loud noise about the suffering element need to
refer to their own files to see that these are the very methods they
recommended for wildlife control not that many years ago. Apparently at
that time they expressed no concerns about the possible danger that
those methods of control might have caused to members of the public,
farm animals or people in the areas where culling was, and still is, a
perfectly routine activity.</hs_Para>

research programme on badger culling and control was brought to

tribute to it for all the work it did with farmers up and
down the country to ensure that Labour, Conservative and Liberal
Democrat MPs joined the group. We worked together on the basis of
cross-party consensus over 10 months. We interviewed experts
not just from the United Kingdom but from all over Europe and overseas,

That was achieved by using many of the processes that we are now using
to try to eliminate it. The disease is out of control in terms of the
number of farms and cattle affected. It is progressing northwards and

has been emphasised today, bovine TB is a complicated disease. Its
epidemiology and the way in which it is spread are not well understood.
One thing that we are certain about is that badgers infected with TB
can pass it on to cattle, but there are other methods of infection.
When there are diseased badgers in fields where cattle are grazing,
there is the opportunity for the disease to be transmitted. Although we
are cleaning up the disease in cattle, as long as there are infected
badgers where they are grazing, the disease can spread. We have heard a
lot about increased biosecurity, but the same people advocate natural
forms of cattle production—in other words, grazing. As far as I
know, there are no biosecurity measures that can keep badgers and
cattle apart when cattle are

every farm is currently tested every year. If a reactor is detected,
tests must be carried out every two months until there are two

vets say that there is no viable vaccine for cattle and talk about how
seriously they take the problem, but what do they really mean? They
mean that the European Commission has banned any meat that has been
vaccinated from being sold in the EU. That is because it is hard
accurately to test the difference between infected cattle and those
that have been inoculated. Instead, the Commission favours mass culls
of cattle as the solution and points to a number of countries that have
cut TB in that way. It wants DEFRA to cull a whole herd when one case
of TB is found within it. That would be a nightmare for farmers, as
many of my colleagues have articulated much better than I ever could.

Stride</B> (Central Devon) (Con):</Member> I rise to speak against the
motion and in support of the many farmers in my constituency who have
suffered most grievously over many years from the scourge of bovine TB.
I would like to make an important point at the outset. I was rather
surprised that the shadow Secretary of State appeared to imply that the
farming community was 
<?notus-xml column=1569?>heavily, or to some significant degree, divided on its opinion of the
advisability of having a cull.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:32:14"></hs_TimeCode> would advise
those who have the courage to stand up and support the Government not
to get too carried away with the notion that farmers or any other
community, or indeed the British population, are substantially against
these measures. The most recent YouGov poll on this topic did indeed
illustrate that by a small margin there were more people against a cull
than were in favour of it. In fact, the figure against the
Government’s actions was 34%. That means, however, that some 66%
were not prepared to say that they were against what the Government
were doing. Indeed, some 29% were in favour of what the Government were
doing; 22% expressed no opinion; and 15% did not mind one way or the
other.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060568000554" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000554">An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:33:24"></hs_TimeCode>
important additional question was asked in that survey: of those not
prepared to support the Government, how many would change their minds
if they became convinced that these actions would prevent the further
spread of the disease into other parts of the country? The figure was
27%. All Members should bear in mind that critical point.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>The Government
are proposing a series of trials. They will not in and of themselves
solve the problem, but they will help us along the road to
understanding the approach we should take in future.</hs_Para>

billion cost that we are likely to face if no action is taken over the
next decade. As the Member of Parliament who has the farm crisis

some time with members of that organisation and listening to the

Opposition Members have said that we suggest that this approach is a
silver or magic bullet that will solve the problem. Of course it will
not. It is one of a number of measures that need to be taken, as is
recognised by the British Veterinary Association in its support for the
action that we are taking. The Opposition have also argued that the
results of the Krebs trials show that our approach is likely to make
the position worse, but I do not believe that. I believe that the
scientific evidence that emerged following those trials, as more
information became available and more was understood about the
mechanisms involved in transmission, showed that a different approach
could lead to a different result.</hs_Para>

that the Government’s trials will take place in large areas,
measuring 150 square miles, that the cull will be pursued over a
lengthy period, and that natural barriers provided by motorways, the
sea and rivers, along with vaccination at the periphery, will ensure
that perturbation is minimised. That, I believe, will have some effect.
I suspect that those who are currently saying, in response to a YouGov
poll, that they do not support the Government’s action will
start to turn towards us when they see what I expect to be the results
further down the
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000558" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000558">Some
Opposition Members dangle before farmers the prospect of vaccination,
saying that no action should be taken now because it will soon be
possible to get it going. Let me make two points about that. First,
there 
<?notus-xml column=1570?>is currently no oral vaccine for badgers, and until there is such a
vaccine and until it has been proved to be effective, vaccination
cannot possibly be a viable route for them. Secondly, as we have heard
from many Members, there is no 100% effective vaccine for cattle. Tests
cannot differentiate effectively between cattle with the disease and
those that have been vaccinated, and the European Union does not expect
a legal or viable vaccine to be available for at least 10 years. So
vaccination will not be the
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000559" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000559">As
the Secretary of State has observed during his travels around the
world, there is no country in which the problem has been tackled
effectively without its being tackled in the reservoir of disease that
is out there in the wildlife population, and this country will be no
exception. I commend the Government for the stand that they have taken,

which I am particularly proud. We in Nottinghamshire have the
healthiest, smartest badgers that anyone could wish for, and I want to

from the hon. Member for Scunthorpe (Nic Dakin), this debate has
prompted a fair amount of emotion. I have to say, as a former dairy
farmer, that it is impossible to describe what it is like to be present
at the birth of a calf, to be there when it takes its first breath, to
be there when it drinks its first milk, and then to take it all the way
through its life; to choose the animal with which it will breed, and to
trace its family tree back through your father’s to your
grandfather’s generation. It is impossible to quantify the
importance of that experience, emotionally, to farmers, or to quantify
the extent of their attachment to their animals.</hs_Para>

Opposition Members that when our cattle are killed—when they are
slaughtered—it is our fault, because we did not look after the
biosecurity of our farms, is something very powerful which causes an
enormous amount of emotion. I believe that farmers have the highest
biosecurity that they could possibly have on their units, and it is
physically impossible to keep a grass field where cattle are grazing
badger-free. It is important for us to deal with the facts of the case
rather than with alleged misdemeanours. The hon. Member for Rotherham

we have from this Government is not evidence-based policy, but
policy-based evidence. As leading scientists have observed, the
Government have decided on the policy then sought to cherry-pick the
evidence to back it up. Bad science is worse than no science at all, so
I will try to confine my words to the science and the evidence, strip
out the politics and the polemics, and see where the science leads us.
Our argument, as my hon. Friend the Member for Wakefield (Mary Creagh)
has said, is that this cull is bad for the farmers, bad for badgers and
bad for the taxpayer. A cull could actually worsen TB in badger and
cattle populations. Field trials showed that although a structured cull
could reduce the increase—I repeat, reduce the increase; take
the top off the rise—in bovine TB by 16% after nine years, in
the 
<?notus-xml column=1573?>short term it could spread the disease further afield as badgers move
from the shooting. Hard boundaries or not, there is a risk that the
disease will spread through culling, a risk heightened by this untried
and untested approach of licensed
shooting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000581" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000581">A
cull could cost more than an alternative, such as badger vaccination,
not least because of the policing costs—the costs the Government
were reluctant to reveal, yet which were completely foreseeable. Dr
Rosie Woodroffe’s analysis takes the Government’s own
cost estimates of badger vaccination at £2,250 per square
kilometre per year, compared with the proposed culling costs at
£l,000 per square kilometre per year, but adds the
policing costs for the cull, which are £l,429 per square
kilometre per year. So vaccination becomes the cheaper option. That
analysis does not include the additional costs incurred by culling as a
result of performing expensive surveys and carrying out monitoring,
both before and after. The Government have tried to promote this cull
as a cheap solution, but we are finding out again that cheap solutions
often turn out to be very expensive indeed. It is the old adage of,
“You buy cheap, you pay twice.”</hs_Para>

vaccination could be an effective alternative to the cull. We
acknowledge the need to do more work on vaccination, but we already
know from tests that vaccination reduces the transmission of M. bovis
to other badgers and, combined with typical badger mortality of three
to five years, there is good reason to expect the impacts on reducing
transmission to cattle to be comparable to those from culling.
Moreover, because vaccination does not lead to perturbation and is
shown to reduce the proportion of infected badgers, rather than
increasing it, as culling does and is proven to do, vaccination should
have greater long-term prospects for TB eradication. In addition,
because vaccination does not prompt protest and does not incur policing
costs, it is cheaper to implement than culling. So was it not a great
and capital error for the Government to cancel five of the six
vaccination trials, instead of using them to test alternative ways
forward? We should be fast-tracking the development of oral vaccines
now. It is a bad decision, Ministers, and it is bad
science.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000583" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0002.htm#13060568000583">We

across rural Britain, and large amounts of policing with extra costs
are not required. The only reason for extra policing costs will be if
there are people who are determined to break the law and put themselves
and others in

the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams), I hope that we
can reach consensus on a comprehensive strategy, but no country has
ever successfully borne down on TB without doing something about the
reservoir 
<?notus-xml column=1577?>of infection in the wildlife population. I believe that what we are
proposing will achieve healthy cattle and healthy badgers. Our
objective is clear: to remove this devastating disease from this
country. We want to get back to having official TB-free status for this
country. That will be good for farmers, good for wildlife and good for
the taxpayers of this country, and I believe that the policy should
commend itself to the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:59:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568000607" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0003.htm#13060568000607"><I>Question

this House notes that bovine tuberculosis (TB) has, as a consequence of
the lack of effective counter-measures, spread from a few isolated
incidents to affect large parts of England and Wales, resulting in the
slaughter of 28,000 cattle in England alone in 2012 at a cost of
£100 million to the taxpayer; is concerned that 305,000 cattle
have been slaughtered in Great Britain as a result of bovine TB in the
last decade and that the cost is expected to rise to over £1
billion over the next 10 years; recognises that to deal effectively
with the disease every available tool should be employed; accordingly
welcomes the strengthening of biosecurity measures and stringent
controls on cattle movements; further welcomes the research and
investment into both cattle and badger vaccines, and better diagnostic
testing, but recognises that despite positive work with the European
Commission the use of a viable and legal cattle vaccine has been
confirmed to be still at least 10 years away; further notes that no
country has successfully borne down on bovine TB without dealing with
infection in the wildlife population, and that the Randomised Badger
Control Trials demonstrated both the link between infection in badgers
and in cattle and that culling significantly reduces incidence; looks
forward to the successful conclusion of the current pilot culls in
Gloucestershire and Somerset; and welcomes the Government’s
development of a comprehensive strategy to reverse the spread of bovine
TB and officially eradicate this

House is concerned about the growing pressure on Accident and Emergency
(A&amp;E) departments across the country over recent months; notes this
week’s report from the King’s Fund which concludes that
waiting times in A&amp;E recently hit a nine-year high; further notes
that in the Labour Government’s last year in office 98 per cent
of patients were seen within four hours; believes that a combination of
factors lies behind the extra pressure on hospitals but that severe
cuts to social care budgets are one of the most significant causes; is
further concerned that one in three hospitals in England say they do
not have sufficient staffing levels to deal safely with demand on
services; further notes that over 4,000 nursing posts have been lost
from the NHS since May 2010 and that a recent survey by the Health
Service Journal revealed that a further round of front-line clinical
job losses are planned for the coming year; further believes that the
Government has failed to show sufficient urgency in dealing with these
problems; and calls on the Government to bring forward an urgent plan
to ease pressure on hospitals by, amongst other things, re-allocating
£1.2 billion of the 2012-13 Department of Health underspend to
support social care in 2013-14 and 2014-15, and ensuring adequate
staffing levels at every hospital in
England.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:29:27"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13060568001714" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0003.htm#13060568001714">Since
the turn of the year, the Opposition have been warning the Government
about building pressure in A and E departments, and yesterday there was
confirmation of just how bad things have got. This year, waiting times
in A and E hit a nine-year high, according to the King’s Fund.
The pressure is not confined to A and E, however, and wherever we look
we can see warning signs: hospitals operating with close to 100% bed
occupancy, way beyond safe recommended levels; a treatment tent in a
car park; long queues of ambulances outside A and E, double the number
waiting longer than 30 minutes; a huge spike in the number of A and E
diverts, where ambulances are turned away from units that cannot accept
any more patients; reports of some hospitals issuing more black alerts
in the past year than in the previous 10 years combined; more cancelled
operations than for a decade; and a 30% increase in bed days lost to
delayed discharges because care plans cannot be put in place, leaving
older patients stranded on the ward and A and E unable to admit
them.</hs_Para>

line with such confidence, given that a freedom of information request
from his Department revealed that the first time he went to an A and E
as Secretary of State was on 3 April—a full six months after he
was appointed. Even then, it was the A and E within walking distance of
this building. Did he just repeat back on camera what the first person

before his first visit to A and E, he told us that hospitals were
“coasting”. What an unbelievable statement. Would he have

to the spin. He continued to blame the GP contract, even when experts
queued up to tell him it was not the cause of the problem. The NHS
Confederation, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the

injuries units were added to the figures. If he read the King’s

My hon. Friend is absolutely right: the loss of simple support in the

alternative but to go to A and E or the hospital as the last resort.

clinical commissioning groups on 9 May. What is going on here? They
were all in the chaos of reorganisation until then—no one could
have received a letter, because CCGs were not in place. In the crucial
period between January and March, when the NHS was under intense
pressure, primary care trusts were on the way out and CCGs were not in
place. As a result, the NHS was in limbo; at the precise moment that it

answer the right hon. Gentleman’s point directly, the money that
I was talking about would come from the underspend. It is part of the
allocated budget that his Government gave to the Department of Health
for 2012-13. The Department did not spend the whole budget so there was
a £2.2 billion underspend. As he knows, the practice has been
that Departments can take forward that resource to meet new pressures
in later years. I am asking the Secretary of State please to ask for
access to that money to relieve the pressure on social 
<?notus-xml column=1592?>care. Simply handing it back to the Treasury when there is an A and E

Direct. Contracts have gone to the lowest bidder, and they are saving
money by having inexperienced call handlers working to a computer

come now to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow
West (Mr Thomas)—there is good evidence to show that NHS walk-in
centres have diverted pressure from A and E units. In 2010-11, there
were about 2.5 million visits to such centres from people who might
otherwise have gone to A and E. Analysis by the House of Commons
Library shows that 26 of them closed in the last year alone, and that
the number is down by a quarter. The Government have let that happen,
but at least Monitor has intervened and set up a review of the loss of
walk-in centres. Will the Secretary of State halt all further closures

brings me to my fifth and final point, which concerns A and E closures
and downgrades. At least 25 A and E units—one in
10—are under threat or have recently closed. The trouble with
these plans is that they were drawn up in a different context, when A
and E was not under the pressure that it is under today. Let me say
this to the Secretary of State: if a clinical case can be made in
support of closures—if there is evidence that lives can be
saved—the Opposition will not oppose the plans. However, we
cannot accept the pushing through of proposals that have not taken
enough account of the latest evidence, and cannot show that extra
pressure can be safely absorbed by neighbouring units. That is
important, because the public will rightly ask this simple question:
how can it make sense to close A and Es in the middle of an A and E
crisis? To reassure people, will the Secretary of State personally
review all the ongoing A and E closure or downgrade proposals on a
case-by-case basis, in the light of the very latest evidence of

have given the Secretary of State a practical plan, and he either needs
to accept it or put one forward of his own. Right now, his complacency
is one of the biggest dangers facing the NHS. He has failed to act on
warnings about the collapse of social care. He has sat on his hands
while front-line jobs are cut in their thousands. He has presided over
the disastrous 111 service. He has closed NHS walk-in centres and
downgraded A and Es without a convincing clinical case. It is no good
his standing up today and blaming everyone else: this is a mess of his
making—his first real test as Secretary of State and he has been
found badly wanting. People want answers and action, and he needs to
start providing them right

of the root causes of the problems that many A and E departments talk

to do that, so let me give him the figures. I have the figures provided
by the Department of Health finance department, based on the latest GDP
deflators, as published at the Budget. Spending in the NHS—not
the budget—in 2009-10 was £99.7 billion and for 2012-13
it is forecast to be £106.6 billion. That is a cash increase of
£6.9 billion and a real-terms increase of £0.6 billion,
so there is a real-terms increase in the NHS budget. The shadow
Secretary of State does not agree with the real-terms increase of
£600 million in the NHS today; there would be a Labour cut in
NHS spending and I suggest that he might want to correct the record, as

shadow Secretary of State wrote to me at the weekend, asking me to
relieve pressure on A and E by using the health underspend to put extra
money into social care. There is a way of releasing resources into
social care, but it is not that, because the underspend he talks of
sits largely with NHS trusts and clinical commissioning groups, which
are allowed to keep their underspends and roll them over to subsequent
years. If we took away that money and put it into social care, we would
therefore have to take it away from hospitals, where it is needed most
to help tackle pressures in A and E and other

a Labour party that wants to be a Government in waiting, this is not
good enough. It is against a cut in NHS spending that did not happen,
but when there is a real cut in Wales it says nothing. It is against
hospital reconfigurations in England, where we are hitting the A and E
target, yet says nothing about reconfigurations in Wales, where Labour
is missing the A and E target. It says it is against reorganisations
and it has just proposed its own huge structural reorganisation to
merge the health and social care system. Why is that? It is because in
the end it is more interested—we have seen this today—in
party politics than the right policies. I think we can expect better

and E pressures are not the only thing that happened to the NHS this
winter; we also had the Francis report into Mid Staffs. That tragedy is
also relevant to A and E pressures, because at the height of its
failures in care, Mid Staffs, unbelievably, was actually hitting its A
and E target. In fact, between 2004 and 2009, there were only three
quarters in which Mid Staffs failed to see 95% of people within four
hours—hitting the target and missing the point. But in
Labour’s NHS, hitting the target was all that counted, because
Ministers ignored three reports, 50 warning signs and 81 requests for a

complacency on that issue is revealed as even more shocking when we
look at the root causes of pressures on A and E departments, because
nearly all of them involve issues that Labour either failed to tackle
in office or made a great deal worse—for example, the IT fiasco,
so heavily criticised by the National Audit Office. It is completely
unacceptable that A and E departments are not able to access, with
their consent, people’s GP records. Last year, there were 30,000
wrong prescriptions in the NHS and 11 deaths—something we know
would be significantly improved with e-prescribing in hospitals. The
Government have addressed that, with a fund that I announced last month
and an ambitious programme to make the NHS paperless by 2018, learning

been distracted from their jobs, and money—£3
billion—has been diverted into that reorganisation. Some of that
has been spent on redundancy for nurses who work in accident and
emergency. The Government have been proudly saying, “We have hit
our new target.” Well, they reduced it and made it easier to
hit. The 111 line has referred more cases to A and E than NHS Direct
did. There have been cuts in social care, which have two effects on A
and E. First, it means that more elderly people go to A and E for
treatment because they are not getting the attention that they were
from social services. Secondly, it means that there will be delays in
patients going home, both from A and E and from ordinary hospital beds,
and that causes delay, too. Walk-in centres have closed, and the
Government have given the surplus money back to the Treasury, yet they
deny that any single one of their policies has had any effect on A and
E services. They have had three years in power, and they are still
blaming other
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568001872" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0003.htm#13060568001872">The
Government claim that the increase resulted from the change to the GP
contract. They know full well that that is not true; they know that it
was because walk-in centres and minor injuries units were counted in
the figures for the first time. If the Secretary of State expects
people in the national health service to respect him and take any
notice of him, not just regard him as the Catherine wheel of spin, he
has to come clean. He is telling people that if they get things wrong
in the health service they must come clean and be honest with the
public. If he does not apply that to himself he will be a bit like the
dad who has told people not to give their kids a leg up, but who turns
out to have employed both his daughters: he did not apply to himself
what he said everybody else should do.

tone to this debate. May I tell
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T17:30:39"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) that if we want to develop party points
in the House and convince the electorate that there is something in it,
it is not a bad idea to begin by establishing where the real
differences exist between the Government and the Opposition? If we look
at the evidence for why we have experienced increased service
difficulty in the health service, we see that it is not the differences
between the Government and the Opposition that are striking but the
fact that there is a shared analysis. However, there is an apparent
unwillingness to apply that analysis and work it through in the
necessary large-scale service change that we require.</hs_Para>

only once, so we must spend it in the right place, and that often means
that we need to spend more of it within social care. That is why I
welcome the fact that some of the health budget has been shifted to
social care, and that is very important. I also commend Torbay. My
constituency covers Brixham and Paignton, and Torbay has been
nationally and internationally recognised for its work on integrating

place because the expertise is there to keep them at home. There needs

huge number of readmissions in casualty departments involve people with

Pugh</B> (Southport) (LD):</Member> The last time I was in A and E I
had hit myself on the head with a 300 lb iron bar—don’t
ask why. I had a lump the size of an egg, but no lasting damage,
apparently. The time before I was involved in an accident on the M1. I
was not driving the car, but I ended up in North Hampshire A and E. My
latest visit was with my mother-in-law who had a suspected heart
attack. I use those cases to illustrate that although nobody wants to
go to A and E, people end up there for a whole range of reasons. Either
they have a genuine accident and emergency, or they fear that they have
had an accident or emergency and need informed triage, or they have a
problem and simply do not have anywhere else to go. I suspect that we
are looking not at increased pressure because of a huge number of
accidents and emergencies—although there are many elderly

note that the situation is not inferior to that before 2004, but in
relative terms I am prepared to admit that it is a crisis. So far the
debate has been about whose fault that crisis is. We cannot say that
the situation is entirely due to the GP contract and the extraction
from out-of-hours service, but we could say that that will not help. We
cannot say it is down to the strange decision to replace midstream NHS
Direct with the 111 service, but that will not help. We cannot say it
is all down to a massive reorganisation of the NHS and the siphoning
off of millions into redundancy payments, but clearly that will not
help. We cannot say it is due to the closure of walk-in centres. They
were often paid for by the PCTs of the past and are not necessarily
popular with GPs, but their closure will certainly not help. We cannot
say that the situation is due to the absence of strategic health
authorities, although in the past those authorities often forced
ambulance trusts and hospitals to work seamlessly together, not just
gaming their own targets and looking at performance indicators. They
helped to stamp out trolley waits, parking up and needless diverts, but
the absence of a strategic oversight is clearly not going to help. We
cannot say that the failure of our system to deal with chronic alcohol
abuse is the sole reason, but as

is striking that nobody has mentioned the report that was published
today by the NHS Confederation and the Academy of Medical Royal

that the funding model for health care in this country is not

have been encouraged by some of the contributions from the Back Benches

increased drug and technology costs. As was mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:09:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ealing North, there has also been a significant change in attitude,
which is difficult politically. Essentially, the population is becoming
a bit softer. The generation that survived the war, a more stoic
generation, would not think or dream of calling their GP in the middle
of the night unless their arms were dropping off, but they are passing
away and are being replaced by people who think it appropriate to call
their GP at midnight because they have had a sore throat for a couple
of hours. Clearly, that is not sustainable.</hs_Para>

fact that change is inevitable and that hospital closures and
reconfigurations will have to take place. My conclusion on how to deal

fund it going forward. A financial legacy is also relevant. A recent

conclusion, I agree with Members who said that we should take the party
politics out of this debate. I would like to see a plan of where
hospitals should be in the future. We need a hub-and-spoke model for
acute hospitals; there has to be a national plan, so that we do not see
some hospitals unfairly closed and others retained for various legacy
reasons. The plan needs to be cross party; otherwise it will not pass.
We need to reflect, too, on GP out-of-hours provision. I think GP
surgeries should be open for longer and more appointments should be
available for about 12 hours a day. I am not so sure that the current
out-of-hours service is sustainable or, indeed, advisable in the longer
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Above all,
we need a proper informed and rational debate with the British public

an intervention during the speech of my right hon. Friend the Member
for Leigh (Andy Burnham), I raised the plight of many of my
constituents who formerly used Alexandra Avenue polyclinic, an
extremely popular walk-in centre which used to be open from 8 am until
8 pm, 365 days a year, to people who were genuinely
concerned about their health and did not feel that they could wait to
see their GPs. It was opened by Ara Darzi some five years ago.
Amazingly, its opening was opposed by my political opponents in Harrow,
but it quickly came to be greatly appreciated by, in particular, people
living in the south Harrow and Rayners Lane area. Those people have
noted with considerable regret that, after the last general election,
the primary care trust decided to restrict the opening hours of their
walk-in centre, but not those of the walk-in centre in Pinner, in the
constituency of my other neighbour, the hon. Member for Ruislip,
Northwood and Pinner (Mr
Hurd).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568001972" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060568001972">As
a result of the cuts that the primary care trust decided to make, the
walk-in service now operates only between 9 am and 3pm on Saturdays and
Sundays. The fact that it remains open at all is entirely due to the
scale and strength of feeling about the loss of what was an excellent
service, and the campaign that we were able to run in order to save it.
Perhaps some of the £3 billion that the Prime Minister spent on
what was—as others have already pointed out—a completely
unnecessary reorganisation of the NHS could have been invested in
keeping Alexandra Avenue polyclinic open, and some of the pressure that
my constituents are imposing on Northwick Park hospital’s
accident and emergency unit could have been
alleviated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568001973" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060568001973">Staff
at the excellent Pinner ambulance station in Rayners Lane do an
extremely good job, generally spending all their shifts out on the
road. It is clear that they, like the rest of the staff of the London
Ambulance Service, are under extremely heavy pressure. On occasion,
ambulances have been used as temporary reception or holding areas at
Northwick Park when patients cannot be admitted to A and E as they
arrive because of the pressure on that department.</hs_Para>

concern about the district nursing service in Harrow. My personal
experience of that service has been mixed. An elderly relative and,
more important, that person’s carer have found it difficult to
gain access to it by telephone when problems have developed. It has
been slow to respond, and has demonstrated poor co-ordination with
other parts of the local health care system. Again, funding was cut by
the primary care trust.</hs_Para>

service are to be sorted out. Meanwhile, to those who are
aware—as many of my constituents are—that the district

the question of staffing in A and E. People talk about crisis and

properly qualified emergency specialist consultants working in A and Es

point.</hs_Para>

this information comes from the doctors working in my A and E at the
Royal Lancaster. This issue was also flagged up in a College of
Emergency Medicine report, “The drive for quality”. The
problem, which has been building over many years, is that ever fewer
doctors want to move into the A and E specialty. That is largely
because of the pressures of the work and the long and unsociable hours,
including high-pressure weekend shifts that do not arise in other
specialties. In turn, that leads to even more pressure on the few
qualified consultants that remain, who have to work longer shifts and
take on ever more responsibilities, and many of whom therefore
eventually choose to go into other specialties as well. As a result,
there is always a shortage of
specialists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:21:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568001981" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060568001981">To
see how bad the problem was, I submitted a series of freedom of
information requests last year, asking hospitals how many consultant
emergency physician vacancies they had and how many people had applied 
<?notus-xml column=1619?>for posts when they were last advertised. There seemed to be some
regional variations—and my area, the north-west, seemed to be
having particular difficulties—but there were some worrying
general trends. Without naming individual hospitals, here are some
examples: one hospital advertised for a senior clinical fellow on three
separate occasions over the course of nine months, but there were no
suitable applicants; another hospital advertised for three consultant
emergency physicians, but no one applied; elsewhere, seven consultant
vacancies were reported in one hospital, representing some 33% of its
planned consultant staffing
rate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:22:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568001982" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060568001982">Even
when there are applicants, competition is fierce. One hospital
advertised for six vacancies and received four applications, but three
of them withdrew prior to interview, presumably because they had been
poached by employers elsewhere. Worryingly, sometimes the quality of
applicants is not up to standard, as in the case of the hospital which
advertised for five consultant emergency physician vacancies, only to
conclude that none of the applicants was appropriately
qualified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:22:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060568001983" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060568001983">I
again stress that, according to the College of Emergency Medicine, this
issue has been worsening over many years. We need to work
constructively to ensure that emergency physician status is better
recognised and rewarded within the NHS, so it can recruit and retain
the required quality staff. This might not all be about money, by the
way, but we definitely need to do more to tackle the issue and to give

feels as though we are telling the public that somehow they are being
irrational by attending A and E. They are being entirely rational,
however, if they live in urban London. They are being rational because
they cannot get access to their GP services. Their GPs have
contracted-in times and their walk-in clinics have been closed, so
their only alternative is A and E. The 111 service is also,
in effect, A and E, because it is so risk-averse. Our current system is
not based on what is best for the patient; it is based on what is going
to cause the least legal damage to the NHS if things go
wrong.</hs_Para>

told and implored to see things differently. How can we see things
differently when consultations do not include the public and when
consultations are held over the school summer holidays rather than at a
time when people and halls are available, and those of us who rely on
voluntary assistance in making our arguments can get people to provide
it? Better Services Better Value in my constituency intends to start
its consultation at the end of the month and run it over July and
August, dismissive of the arguments of 
<?notus-xml column=1620?>the public that they cannot meet that timetable. Better Services Better
Value has meetings without announcing where they are or what time they
are at, and it does not even use microphones. I have been a publicly
elected politician for more than 30 years and some of these NHS
meetings I have attended have been the worst I have ever encountered
during that time. If we wish to bring the public with us in difficult
decisions, we have to be reasonable, fair and straightforward in our
proposals. Nobody in my constituency understands why the solution to
longer A and E waits is the closure of A and Es that are effective and
actually work.</hs_Para>

It will be fully open in autumn 2014. I visited the building
about a month ago and I can tell hon. Members that it is
almost twice the size of the current one. It will have a range of
fantastic facilities and services; we have doubled the equipment and
doubled the number of people. The staff have been involved every step
of the way in designing the new facility with the builders, even
pushing the carts around the building to understand the best way in
which they can achieve what they want. It will also have a dedicated
adult section and a dedicated child section. The Lister hospital and
its A and E are doing a great job in my constituency for people every

College of Emergency Medicine suggests that the initial recruitment to
the discipline is quite respectable and that retention is the problem.
Emergency medicine 
<?notus-xml column=1623?>involves long hours, with a 24-hour cycle of shifts, and is an intense
and stressful form of medical practice. I hate to accuse anyone of
mercenary motivation, but of course those who work in emergency
medicine cannot moonlight in private practice, either, which makes it
less attractive from that point of view. So we do need a rethink
nationally. I welcome the urgency with which the Government are now
addressing that. It should have been done years

the trust even tried to pay more for emergency medical posts, as it has
the freedom to do so as a foundation trust? Could it have looked more
seriously at overseas recruitment? Why has it not been prepared to wait
for the Keogh review, or the Secretary of State’s urgent review
of recruitment, before making the changes permanent? Why was it not
prepared to trial changes just for a year, as Liberal Democrat members
of the health overview and scrutiny committee requested yesterday? I
deeply regret the fact that Conservative councillors on that committee
from all over Gloucestershire voted down that very modest compromise
proposal and backed the downgrading of A and E in
Cheltenham.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000035">In
my detailed evidence I raised issues of increased mortality, and of
possible increases in health inequalities resulting from these changes,
but I have no evidence that my submission, or the thousands of petition
signatures that we gathered locally, have been properly considered at
all. The primary care trust consultation website actually disappeared
halfway through the consultation process because, of course, the
primary care trust ceased to exist and handed over to the new clinical
commissioning group. The obvious suspicion locally is that this was a
foregone conclusion, and that it is only a matter of time before the
trust proposes the outright closure of the A and E at
Cheltenham.</hs_Para>

suspicion was strongly reinforced yesterday. Within hours of the health
overview and scrutiny committee meeting, the trust issued a joint
statement with the new clinical commissioning group, instantly
announcing that the changes would now be going ahead on a permanent
basis, despite the fact that the trust has not actually considered the
outcome of the consultation exercise at either its board or the
CCG’s board. That is not open, accountable and transparent, and
it must be in
future.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_05_PT_1/C51BE268306C40BC1C055F998293C1D4D9345997" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 June 2013">Wednesday

in A and E; that is clear from this afternoon’s debate. The

information on A and E from the chief executive of Salford Royal NHS
Trust, comparing the third and fourth quarters of 2011-12 with those in
2012-13. He 
<?notus-xml column=1624?>found that there are 10% more ambulance arrivals every day. We actually
have sicker patients, with more arriving by ambulance. There has been a
13% increase in admissions of people staying longer than 72 hours, and
fewer are staying for shorter periods. There are 25% more triages into
the hospital’s resuscitation area, and there has been a
significant increase in risk and co-morbidity among patients and
increased admissions into critical care. There is something going on
there.</hs_Para>

the rising demand for A and E is particularly concentrated in those
aged over 85, and cuts in social care budgets are now widely
acknowledged as the contributing factors. My local authority of Salford
must make £24 million of cuts this year. It is the third year of
cuts, and now the authority, having held on to services meeting a
moderate level of eligibility, is moving to meeting only substantial
levels of eligibility, taking £3.5 million out of adult social
care this year and £3.5 million next year. Our former
Salford primary care trust had already cut the two walk-in centres that
we had, and axed the pilot of active case management for people with
long-term
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000040">How
is that affecting people? What do carers say? Carers UK has carried out
a survey of 3,500 carers, 55% of whom are caring for a person who has
been admitted to emergency hospital services in the past three years. A
significant percentage of those carers referred to areas where
additional support could have prevented those emergency admissions.
What types of care were needed? Six per cent. said that they, the
carer, needed replacement care because they were ill themselves; 21%
per cent. needed a higher quality of care and support for the cared-for
person; 10% needed adaptations in the home, and 7% would have been
helped by telecare and telehealth. Those findings tie in with some of
my casework in recent weeks, when I have heard some very similar
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000041">The
King’s Fund report tells us that the prospects for adult social
care are bleak. Councils are planning to reduce their budgets by
another £800 million a year. That is a cumulative cut since 2010
of 20% in adult social care. My local hospital tells me that patients
are coming in sicker, they are admitted for longer stays, they require
more time and attention and they are now heavy resource-users. It is
time that Ministers stopped making excuses and started dealing with
this
crisis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000042"><B><Member ContinuationText="Madam Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="243" UID="13060586000715" xid="484" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000715">Madam

care assistants who provide extraordinary and professional care in our
A and E departments. They are there for us when we need them most and
we owe them a huge debt of gratitude. It was apparent from the
Secretary of State’s speech that he has absolutely no plans to
deal with the disastrous situation in A and E that is entirely of this
Government’s own creation. We know that, since this Government
came to power, there are 4,000 fewer nurses, the disastrous NHS 111
service is in meltdown, walk-in centres are being closed and social
care is in crisis. All those factors contribute to the current crisis
in our A and E. We have all seen the news reports of ambulances queuing
outside hospitals, with unacceptably long waits and some people even
having to be treated in tents in car parks. It is time for Ministers to
stop blaming others and to get a grip on the crisis in A and
E.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000049">Bluntly,
what we are seeing today in A and E is the culmination of three full
years of mismanagement of the NHS, with a needless top-down
reorganisation and the waste of billions of pounds that could and
should have been spent on front-line care. The truth is that there is
no grip on the NHS in England. No wonder things are going so wrong so
quickly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000050">When
Labour left office, A and E was performing well, with 98% of patients
seen within the four-hour target time. Since the election, the number
of patients waiting more than four hours has nearly trebled and
ambulance queues have doubled. Only yesterday, in a report by the
King’s Fund, we saw that A and E waits are at their worst for
nine years, with more than 313,000 patients waiting more than four
hours between January and 
<?notus-xml column=1626?>April this year. Simply put, under this Government more people are
waiting longer. The proportion of patients attending A and E who have
to wait longer than four hours is at its highest for 10 years. What
more proof do Ministers need to understand that A and E departments are
under real pressure and that action is needed, and needed
now?</hs_Para>

cannot even get through the doors of our hospitals. We have
a shameful situation in which growing numbers of patients
are waiting in ambulances to get into A and E because those departments
are full. Equally shameful is the number of patients experiencing the
indignity of waiting for hours on trolleys in A and E before they can
be found a bed on the main hospital wards. It is almost as though we
are back to the future—back to the bad old Tory days of the
1980s and ’90s.</hs_Para>

many other factors that have pushed A and E into the danger zone.
Indeed, A and E is a bellwether for the overall state of the NHS and
social care. The Government’s cuts to local authority budgets
have seen £2.6 billion taken out of adult social care since the
election alone. As a result, many older and vulnerable people are
having services withdrawn that could have helped them to stay healthy
and independent in their own homes, and many others face rising charges
for the care that they need. That is a major cause of the A and E
crisis, as fewer older people get the care that they need at home, and
ever more have to be admitted to hospital. It also means that there are
delays in ensuring that appropriate support is available at home, or in
the community, which delays a patient’s discharge. That has a
knock-on effect right through the hospital: with no free beds on the
wards, A and E staff cannot admit patients to the hospital wards, and
with A and E full, ambulance staff cannot hand over
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000053">As
we have heard, under-staffing is also causing huge problems in the
health service. Since the election, more than 4,000 nursing posts have
been lost from the NHS, and the Care Quality Commission has warned that
one in 10 hospitals is failing to meet the standard for adequate
staffing levels. Hospitals are continuing to make severe cuts to
front-line staffing, with many operating below recommended levels.
Under this Government, right across England, we are seeing the closure
of well-used NHS walk-in centres, meaning that more people are having
to go to major A and E departments when they could be helped
elsewhere.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000054">Lastly,
there is the meltdown of the 111 helpline; NHS England identified the
poor roll-out of 111 services as one of the main reasons for the
deterioration in A and E department performance. As the 111 service
uses staff who do not always have clinical training, they are more
likely to play it safe, meaning that more people are being directed
towards A and E departments. Over Easter, callers in 30 areas waited
for more than an hour for a call back, and in some regions more than
40% of calls were abandoned by patients. One patient waited
11 hours and 29 minutes.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:50:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) rose to speak, it was going
rather well. There was almost an outbreak of consensus after a number
of thoughtful contributions from Members on both sides of the House.
Unfortunately, as ever, the hon. Gentleman had to fall back into the
old ways of cheap party political points and cheap partisan comments.

justice whatsoever or credit. Let me explain to her—I was here
for the debate, and she was not—that I did not in any way blame
women doctors. As someone who has worked as a woman professional all my
life, I really do not want to hear any lessons from Opposition Members.
What I did was echo the comments of the president of the Royal College
of General Practitioners, and I paid tribute to all our GPs for their
hard work and dedication to our NHS, and to their patients.</hs_Para>

are immense pressures on the NHS as a whole, and on A and E in
particular. Our A and E departments are dealing with 1 million more
people than they did when the previous Government were in power. The
causes of that increase in demand are complex: a long, cold winter; an
ageing population; and more people with long-term conditions. The
system itself, let us be honest, has not helped, from poor integration
between health and social care to the lack of public confidence in
out-of-hours primary care services. We can have an argument about the
2004 GP contract, but as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:52:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Southport (John Pugh) rightly said, it has not helped. Today, we
have a situation in which, if people do not know where to go, or they
are not sure that they will get a good service, they go to A and E. In
a recent hearing by the Select Committee on Health, Dr
Patrick Cadigan, a registrar from the Royal College of Physicians, set

each of the past five weeks, the four-hour waiting time target has been
either reached or exceeded. The average wait in A and E is currently 50
minutes. More importantly, we are making the NHS fit for the future: a
future where care is designed and delivered around the specific needs
of an individual patient; where care is integrated across primary and
secondary care and across health and social care; and where local
clinicians, not national politicians, decide what is best for their
communities. The Government have taken tough decisions that will create
a strong and sustainable NHS, now and for generations to come. The
Health and Social Care Act 2012 has finally brought local health and
social care communities together to design integrated services around
the needs of their patients, building in strength for the future. So if
more services are needed outside hospitals, local clinicians working
with community partners can make those decisions, without having to
wait for a Minister to tell them what to do.</hs_Para>

reduce pressure on A and E. The NHS Medical Director, Sir Bruce Keogh,

the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy), who spoke briefly about
his local experience in his constituency and brought those experiences,

that is in any way disparaging to
him—the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>

conclude, in challenging circumstances, and with this

Steve Reed</B> (Croydon North) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for this
opportunity to raise an issue that is of great interest to my residents
in Croydon North and to many other people across London and in other
parts of the country that were affected by the riots in the summer
of 2011.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060586000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000622">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:14:55"></hs_TimeCode>
is almost two years now since the riots hit Croydon. Businesses were
burnt to the ground, shops were looted, and homes were destroyed. The
Prime Minister and the Mayor of London walked along the devastated
London road in the central part of Croydon and promised people that
they would not be forgotten and that, while the state had failed to
protect them during the riots, it would stand by them as they tried to
rebuild their lives.
Since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:15:21"></hs_TimeCode> becoming
the Member of Parliament for Croydon North last November, I have met
business owners and residents whose lives were damaged by the riots.
They feel completely abandoned by a Government who promised to help
them when the TV cameras were on but walked away when the media glare
died down.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060586000623" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000623">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:15:42"></hs_TimeCode>
is instructive to know how much has actually been paid out compared
with the amount that has been claimed. I put in a freedom of
information request to the Metropolitan police and found out that that
now, nearly two years after the riots took place, only one seventh of
the £250 million that was claimed had been paid out—that
is, £35.8 million. The Metropolitan police rejected outright
half of all claims that were filed, yet the Government continue to
claim, and I fear may claim again tonight, that the majority of cases
have been settled. The Government might have closed the files, but the
cases have not been settled to the satisfaction of the people who were
affected. They feel very strongly that the Government have given up on
them and walked away. It is no wonder that the chair of The High Street
Fund, Sir William Castell, has described the Government’s
compensation schemes as a “disgrace” because of how slow
they have been at paying out to people who need and deserve that
additional
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:16:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000624" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000624">I

a gentleman called Mr Mumtaz Hassan and his wife ran a dry cleaning
business on the London road in west Croydon. Their business was burned
down by a mob and as a result their livelihood has been destroyed. Two
years later, they have not been paid a single penny in compensation.
All they have been offered is like for like. It was an old business
that they had taken over. They cannot afford, with what is on offer to
them, to pay for new dry cleaning equipment. As a result, that family
risk losing their home, because they have no livelihood or income to
maintain their mortgage payments. Two years later, the riots are still
creating new victims and it is time that the Government stepped up and

Miss Charlene Munro is a single mother who at the time lived in a flat

they saw rioters rushing down the London road, smashing and looting
their way through the shops, they fled their home. They returned the
next day to find the shop and the flat where they lived burned down and
all their possessions destroyed. Absolutely everything they owned was
gone. She put in a not unreasonable claim of just £6,000 for all
her possessions. She received a paltry £2,500 in payment, which
is absolutely inadequate to replace all the possessions, clothes and
electronic goods that the family owned. She is unable to replace them.
In her attempt to build a new home for her three-year-old son, she had
to go into debt and is now so burdened with debt she has been forced to
file for bankruptcy. The Government say that her case has been settled.

uninsured claims were later received by the Metropolitan police. These
were largely made after insurance companies had repudiated claims. Only
six of that latter group of claims are unresolved, which is again
around 1% of the original

the riots, the Government made a commitment to back the costs incurred
by police forces in meeting Riot (Damages) Act costs, because that was
another potential problem. We have provided that backing, and will
continue to do so until the few remaining claims have been settled. So
far the Government have paid some £30 million to forces to meet
Riot (Damages) Act costs, as well as meeting the operational costs of
policing the riots, which totalled £97

Department has them, I will write to the right hon. Gentleman and place
a copy in the Library. I assume that he is referring to insurance
claims rather than to Riot (Damages) Act claims. When it comes to
insurance, there are three distinct classes. First, there are the
people who are fully insured and who may over-claim, As we know, there
are people who always over-claim. Secondly, there are the people who
have insurance but subsequently find that they are underinsured. I
consider many of those cases to be among the most complex and
difficult. Thirdly, there are those with no insurance. It is the second
and third groups who are eligible for compensation under the Riot
(Damages) Act.</hs_Para>

to individual cases, but let me draw his attention to the overall
statistics. The total amount claimed was £250.1 million, and
nearly two years later only £35.8 million has been

lower proportion than would normally apply to claims for damages, even

adjustment?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060586000662" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586000662"><B><Member ContinuationText="Damian Green" PimsId="3546" UID="13060586001267" xid="236" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/debtext/130605-0004.htm#13060586001267">Damian

small. 
<?notus-xml column=1641?>Ideally, of course, we would have resolved all the claims by now, but I
think that that is the key statistic. One of our main aims is to secure
a complete resolution of the remaining few cases, but when there is a

said, many of the outstanding cases relate to claimants who were
underinsured. It took time for the insurance element of those claims to
be settled before the underinsurance element was submitted to PCCs or

focus specifically on what I take to be the hon. Gentleman’s
central point, which is that some people have received smaller amounts
of compensation. It is important to bear in mind the fact that such
compensation is ultimately paid by the taxpayer, and that claims
therefore need to be properly substantiated. All uninsured claims were
reviewed by loss adjusters using standards applied in the insurance
industry. All victims were dealt with sympathetically. Where documents
such as receipts for goods purchased were destroyed, secondary evidence
was requested, such as bank statements, to substantiate
lifestyle.</hs_Para>

addition to losses that cannot be substantiated, there are other
reasons for individuals and businesses receiving less compensation than
they sought. A number of claimants sought compensation for things not
covered by the Act, such as personal injury, vehicle damage and
business interruption. Excluding the costs associated with the
reinstatement of buildings, adjustments were made downwards because
claims made under the Act were assessed on an indemnity, rather than a
new-for-old, basis. I take on board the point that that causes much of
the disappointment, but that is the way the law is
framed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:40:30"></hs_TimeCode>. In some

starting point is that I believe that the 111 telephone service could
be a useful tool for out-of-hours services and patient treatment, but
that some alarm bells have already been set ringing in areas where it
has been rolled out. It is not my intention to go through all aspects
of the general practitioner contract and out-of-hours services; I want

my view, the service might offload problems on to accident and
emergency and, indeed, the ambulance service. A lot depends on the

to nurses and medical advice for those in palliative care, terminal
care and other regular patient care, such as catheter patients. The

we used the service in relation to my father was on Sunday 4 November

religiously to the script—asking whether the patient was

was not reporting an accident but a regular condition, the symptoms of
which were extremely plain, and asking whether I could, please, just be

minutes into the call, because I could tell that I was not getting

ambulance was dispatched immediately and attended to my father within
half an hour. The paramedics confirmed my suspicion that the condition
was an infection, and said that the patient was too ill and frail to
travel some 25 miles on country roads in an ambulance, so that was not
an option. They used their direct line to call a doctor, but even then,
it took three hours for one to attend. In that case, from first calling
111 to the doctor’s arrival, about three and a half to four
hours had

father subsequently died on the Thursday of that week, 8 November, and
I believe that the infection had obviously taken such a grip that his
death would have been very difficult to prevent. He had lived to a very
grand age, and we were just grateful for the treatment he did receive.
However, that example shows the pressure points that need to be
addressed and which, I regret to say, have not been addressed, even

the 111 service to work effectively a degree of flexibility has to be
built into the system and the script. It would be helpful if the

worked all hours: he worked every other night on call and every other

be diverted to nursing or other medically qualified staff as early as
possible in the process. In North Yorkshire, the intention is that that
will happen when the service is rolled out, but I want confirmation
that, now the problem has been identified, it is being addressed in all
areas, including pilot areas and ones opting for early roll-out. That

Apparently, when these problems occurred, 111 asked all GP out-of-hours
providers to return to their pre-launch call-handling service. However,
that was not an option for us in Salford, as our previous call handlers
had transferred all their staff over to 111 under TUPE arrangements. So

Keeley:</Member></B> Indeed. We talk a lot about integration, but the
feedback that I have received from both my local CCG and my local NHS
trust is that we have just taken a backward step. We had a nurse-led
service that was working fairly well, although it was not as integrated
with other services as it should have been. We have now got a system
that is led by computer scripts and non-clinicians, in which the
patients calling the service—if they get through to it—do
not have confidence, and as a result, they are falling back on visiting
their GPs or going straight to A and E. So my point was that that
single, integrated urgent care service—the single service that
the hon. Gentleman just talked about—should include
responsibility for GP out-of-hours triage, and at the moment it does
not. The system could have been set up that way, but it was not.

prop up the service during its few weeks in places such as Greater

hon. Member for Isle of Wight (Mr Turner) was present earlier. The 111
service there went live on 25 October 2011. The area has had a long
time to address teething problems and to ensure that the service
operates properly. What has A and E performance looked like over the
past few months? Since the end of September, almost 2,000 patients have
waited more than four hours, and the trust has missed its target for 23
out of 35 weeks. That is hardly a ringing endorsement of the system,
even when it has had a chance to bed
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:16:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000102">Consultants
on the Isle of Wight have even said that although patient numbers would
be falling and the pressure would be easing if NHS 111 was working as
intended, that is not happening—patient numbers are rising, and
the pressure on the NHS is increasing. Indeed, Chris Smith, the
director of NHS 111 on the Isle of Wight told the BBC that the service
is fragmented and that that has led to problems.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:17:18"></hs_TimeCode> response to
the hon. Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), the Minister said that
every NHS 111 provider is able to handle inquiries from any part of the
UK, but I would challenge her to repeat that assertion today, given Mr
Smith’s comments. If a system is fragmented, and CCGs are
commissioning different providers, it will be almost impossible for
those trained to handle calls to work within different systems. For
example, the process for referring people through the system in an area
with which they are unfamiliar will be totally alien to them, and that
is bound to cause further
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:17:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000103">That
brings me to my final point about the system. Following Labour’s
A and E summit in Westminster last week, it was revealed to us that 111
call handlers do not necessarily have clinical backgrounds, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:17:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) said. Even
more shockingly, it was revealed that some areas have an enforced
threshold on how many calls nurses can answer, and that that was as low
as one in five. The fragmentation of the system means that the figure
varies from area to area, because it would have been negotiated in
local contracts. Therefore, the service provided is not universal. That
is in stark contrast to NHS Direct, under which 60% of calls were
directed  to nurses. Under 111, however, the figure stands at
less than 20%. Does the Minister believe that the low level of
engagement between trained medical practitioners and patients in the
service is contributing to A and E pressures?</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=214?><hs_Para UID="13060561000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000104"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>The
chaotic reorganisation of the NHS is clearly
producing a deteriorating experience for patients. In the last week of
March, one patient in the south-east waited for 11 hours and 29 minutes
for a call back. In the area covered by NHS Gloucestershire and NHS
Swindon, 43% of calls lasting longer than 30 seconds were abandoned by
the patient before they were answered. Will the Minister outline the
lessons that have been learned from that experience and explain what
measures will be put in place to ensure it is not repeated on a
national
scale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:18:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000105">In
four weeks, the 111 service will be live across the whole country, and
the Government need to be more honest about how the service is
performing before wider implementation. Royal colleges, patient groups
and other stakeholders have long warned the Government that the health
and social care reforms brought about by the Health and Social Care Act
2012 would be distracting and cause chaos, and that such top-down
reforms would stop the clinically driven reforms needed to help address
the crisis in A and

pay tribute to all GPs. There are huge difficulties with the GP
contract, which was introduced in, I think, 2004. The consequences have
included the loss of the sort of out-of-hours service that I enjoyed as
a child, teenager and young woman. With few exceptions, we have
wonderful general practitioners, and many whom I know, including my
own, and others who are friends of mine, work long, difficult hours. It

you know, Mr Robertson, during the recess, far from enjoying holidays,
as the popular press makes out, we go back to our constituencies and
use the time to make or renew contact with, for example, our local

people.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:29:56"></hs_TimeCode> One of

hospital in my constituency of Broxtowe in Nottingham. The head happens
to be one of my constituents, and they tell me that there is much
improvement at the Queen’s medical centre, as I know from the
stats and so on. I also talked to GPs, and the 
<?notus-xml column=217?>CCG in my constituency now opens its doors for Saturday morning
surgeries, which do not replace any other surgeries; they are extra
facilities. The CCG has done that for two simple reasons: first to
improve the service it gives to its patients, and secondly in
recognition of the need to reduce the pressure on the A and E

think it is right and fair to say that many GPs look with concern at
what is happening in many of our A and Es, and with 111, which is
commissioned in some areas by CCGs and in other parts of England by
clusters of GPs. They are by no means fools. What motivates anyone to
enter the medical profession, in my experience, is a real desire to
serve people. They want to help and treat people. They are motivated by
the very best of motives, so of course our GPs are concerned about the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000129">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T10:39:33"></hs_TimeCode>

urban myths and anecdotes, but it is a fact that many GPs have already
said that, far too often, people who come to see them in their

specified, however. There is no prescription that it must be 4:1. As
111 is locally commissioned in the way that I have explained, it is for
local commissioners to decide whether to change that ratio, depending
on the particular needs of the people in their area. One of the great
benefits of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 is that we have enabled
local commissioners, either as a CCG or as a cluster, to commission
services to meet the specific needs of their patients. I hope that will
mean that a cluster or CCG in a rural area, obviously knowing that its
patients live in a rural area, will ensure that its service is
tailor-made to suit the needs of those patients, which may be different
from the needs of patients in, say, a city and its surrounding suburbs.

conceded, and one should not make party political points from it.

want to talk about strengthening the UK manufacturing sector through
innovation. UK manufacturing is going from strength to strength. We
have a rich heritage of advanced manufacturing, companies in a range of
sectors that are competing with the very best internationally and a
world-class reputation for quality innovation. There is certainly
widespread recognition by business and Government that research and
innovation are essential to global competitiveness and future economic
growth. Despite the obvious global economic challenges, the Government
stepped up to the plate and invested in science, research and
development, infrastructure and skills—all the things that
innovation needs to flourish. I also hope to expand on how the
Government could use their enormous purchasing power to help draw the
most economic benefit from such
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:01:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000158">Most
manufacturers understand that their future success depends on the
ability to be innovative in their thinking, ways of working and
approach to business, as well as in their new product development. It
is all about changing, adapting and anticipating the demands of their
marketplace and their customers. Huhtamaki is one of the biggest
employers in my constituency. It has a dynamic attitude towards
innovation—which it has to, because its industry makes paper and
plastic cups, loads of them: a staggering 2 billion a year for many
well-known coffee houses and fast-food establishments. Its business
motto is to “lead change before you have to”, and the
company is continually innovating to maintain its position as a market
leader, which means embracing new print technology, experimenting with
colours and textures and introducing products that are recyclable,
renewable and even compostable. The managing director told me that that
philosophy gives the company the edge in such a changing
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:02:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000159">Innovation
can be the key to a virtuous circle: investment leads to growth and
efficiency, which generates revenue that can be used to achieve change
and to support further innovation. The difficulty is that innovation
not only requires long-term investment, but introduces a certain
element of risk that some manufacturers find difficult to justify,
particularly in a tough economic environment. In fact, forward-thinking
innovators might even put themselves at a disadvantage in the short
term compared with their competitors, who let others take the lead and
then hang on to their coat
tails<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:02:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000160">For
the UK to remain a world-class manufacturing hub, it is essential for
the Government to do all they can to support the innovators. Where that
works best is where Government and business work together in the
development of and support for new technologies, and that has made a
big difference in some sectors. Thus, since 2007 successive Governments
have invested support in the space sector, helping British companies to
become the world-leading innovators in the field. For example, Astrium,
a major employer in the Portsmouth area, specialises in the
mind-blowing satellite technology that has made it No. 1 in Europe and

other catalyst for business innovation is the pull effect, and I want
to say a little more about how public procurement could be used better
to drive the demand side of the innovation equation. This is an area
where the strategic spend of public money on goods and services has the
potential to drive innovation and to create more efficient,
cost-effective, high-quality public services, as well as to unleash
economic benefits. The Associate Parliamentary Manufacturing Group
recently held a seminar on this issue, where it listened to the
manufacturing sector’s concerns about how the Government buy
products, as well as hearing about current academic work on procurement
as a tool to drive innovation. Many bodies, from the CBI to the

greater desire to be cutting edge, or are they simply less risk averse?
Either way, it seems highly inefficient to invest heavily in a
knowledge base at the start of an innovation process and not
capitalise  on the potential economic benefits. With that in
mind, will the Minister tell me what efforts we are making to learn
from other nations about maximising the economic fruits of our
innovation? It is something the US invests heavily in—it is the
virtuous circle again. Demand for a product creates more jobs; more
science, technology, engineering and maths-based graduates; more
high-value-added companies; greater economic prosperity; and in theory,
more tax returns.</hs_Para>

Treasury clearly recognises that, which is why, in the 2013 Budget, the
Chancellor of the Exchequer announced that all Government Departments
must engage in the Small Business Research Initiative process and has
vastly increased the amount of money available through it. The
Technology Strategy Board’s SBRI encourages the private sector
to develop solutions to problems identified by the public sector. So
far, it has had great success: 120 competitions have awarded
1,200 contracts to a value of £100 million. Those
have involved 40 public sector bodies. SBRI therefore shows that in
identifying new problems, the public sector has a mechanism through
which it can procure innovative solutions.</hs_Para>

despite its great success and even greater potential, the programme has
not fully solved the procurement puzzle. It appears to be asking for

me give an example: QinetiQ has a subsidiary company called OptaSense,
which has developed a way to use fibre-sensing technology to deliver
real-time information to monitor assets such as pipelines or railways.
In layman’s terms, that means turning fibre-optic cables into
thousands of highly sensitive microphone devices capable of
distinguishing between human footsteps and animal tracks. They are
capable, in fact, of hearing someone walking alongside a railway track
and then sawing through the railway cable, enabling the transport
police to catch them red-handed before the damage has been done. That
seems a good solution to all those wasted commuter hours as a result of
rail cable theft.</hs_Para>

German railways and the north American oil and gas industry seem to
think so. The technology has secured significant export contracts, and
the number of employees has grown from three to 160 in the past few
years. In fact, 99% of the company’s revenue comes from
overseas. The problem is that, given that those countries are spending
the money that is effectively sponsoring most of the ongoing research
and development, OptaSense is under increasing pressure to move both
that and the manufacturing overseas. The UK’s competitive tax
regime for R and D is one of the main things keeping them here.

the power of procurement to effect change in industrial competitiveness
is a big challenge. It represents a step change in the way public
bodies and Departments think about their budgets, and I think it is
fair to say that risk taking—and as a result,
innovation—are not encouraged in public procurement. Public
procurement still has a tendency to opt for low-risk solutions and
mature technology, and innovation is not routinely welcomed or
rewarded. In part, that is due to the competing objectives and

risk-taking.</hs_Para>

should not be surprised that the current procurement system produces
the results that it does. If the discussions around procurement remain
too closely linked to buying, without being linked to interaction with
the private sector and horizon-scanning, procurers will simply keep
buying as they always have. That behaviour has been compounded by the
positioning of austerity policies against procurement; in the mission
to try to cut costs, procurers should include in their calculations
how, through the pursuit of innovation, money may be saved long-term,

that, following a survey of 800 businesses, two thirds believe that

first question that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:22:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gosport asked was about tax credits. Research and
development tax credits are providing the single biggest Government
financial incentive for business investment in R and D, and take-up has
increased steadily during the 12 years of the scheme. In the last
financial year for which I have figures—2010-11—tax
relief claims of £1.1 billion supported approximately 72% or
£10.9 billion of all R and D revenue expenditure by business.
Additionally, the patent box allows companies to claim a reduced
corporation tax rate of 10% on profits from qualifying patents and
certain other
innovations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000212">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend’s precise question, as I recall it, was whether we
would guarantee to go on doing that. Nothing in this life is certain,
but I am determined to go on supporting research and development tax
credits. We have made some of the qualifying rules easier. What I think
is more important now about R and D, in addition to committing to the
funding, is ensuring that those credits work further down the company
sizes, so that small businesses realise that they are just as eligible
for them as much larger businesses. I do not think that tax reliefs
naturally are things that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
would market, but certainly we need to spread the word that all kinds
of business can qualify for help with research and
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:24:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000213">My
hon. Friend’s second question was a really good one: how much
are we learning from other countries about translating some of the
innovation into commercially applicable projects? We do learn from
other countries. For example, the German Fraunhofer centres provided
much of the model for the Catapult centres that we have now
established. We are not too proud to learn from or to pick up on what
is happening in other countries, 
<?notus-xml column=229?>particularly Germany, which has always had a much higher proportion of
its GDP in manufacturing. There are things that we can learn from other
countries, and I assure my hon. Friend that we continue to do so.
Ministers continue to visit other countries and to pick up on ideas,
although of course those other countries have picked up on some of our
more imaginative ways of funding as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:25:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000214">The
third question posed by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:25:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
was on the small business research initiative. I am very glad that she
asked about that. It provides 100% R and D funding for technology-based
companies that develop potential solutions to specific problems faced
by the public sector where there is no readily available solution on
the market. That is done on a much larger scale in the United States;
it is fully supported through federal funds. That is another good
example of where we can learn from the success of a scheme in another
country and apply the lessons
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000215">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:25:57"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend will recall that in the most recent Budget—Budget
2013—we announced that we would substantially expand the SBRI
among key Departments, so that the value of contracts through this
route increases from £40 million in 2012-13 to more than
£100 million in the current year and more than £200
million by 2014-15. I hope that she will welcome that, but I fully
accept that we have more to do to spread knowledge and use of the SBRI
right across the Whitehall landscape to ensure that those Departments
that have not yet thought of it as a potential route to solving some of
the problems that they face do so. A number of Departments are already
making very good use of the SBRI, but I would like all Departments to
consider it automatically as a source of particular
strength<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000216">I
hope that my hon. Friend will forgive me if I have not answered all the
other questions that she posed, but I want to conclude by saying a word
or two about what is happening on skills. She suggests that we should
learn from other countries. There
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T11:27:41"></hs_TimeCode> no doubt that
countries such as Germany have been able to draw on a much wider pool

serve under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea, in this vital debate on the
future of the east coast main line. I am sure you will keep us on track
and on time. Debates between hon. Members on nationalisation and
democratic control of industry often stall due to an obstinate
adherence to our political prejudices. All of us, on both sides of the
House, have political prejudices about the relative merits of private
and national ownership of basic industries. At the outset, I invite
Members to disregard all preconceived theories and consider the future
of the east coast main line objectively, as a technical problem with
hard
facts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000224">According<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:31:34"></hs_TimeCode>
to a written answer from the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:31:11"></hs_TimeCode>then Minister of
State for Transport in 1996, the total gross proceeds to the taxpayer
from selling off our rail infrastructure were £5.28 billion.
Adjusted for inflation, that would be slightly more than £8
billion today—equivalent to only the past two years of taxpayer
subsidy. According to the Office of Rail Regulation, the east coast
main line is the only line in the country that comes close to paying
for itself. Government subsidy makes up only 1% of East Coast’s
income, against an industry average of 32%. The total cost to the
Exchequer of the east coast main line was only £9 million in
2011-12; by comparison, Northern Rail, jointly owned by Serco and the
Dutch Government, cost the taxpayer £685 million. Since the UK
Government put the franchise under the publicly owned Directly Operated
Railways, financial stability has been restored. The total premium,
plus operating profit, amounted to £647.6 million in the four
years to 31 March 2013; that is more in both cash and real terms than
any previous franchise on the line, and all of that money is available
for reinvestment in our railway
network.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000225">East<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:32:36"></hs_TimeCode>

east coast main line:</hs_Para>

that the whole story, it would be extremely concerning, but East Coast
during the latter half of 2012 achieved the best train punctuality on
the east coast franchise since records began in 1999. In recent months,
some challenging external circumstances, such as the weather and
overhead wire problems on the southern part of the route, affected
performance, and East Coast is implementing a joint action plan with
Network Rail to ensure that operational performance on the line returns
to the record levels that were achieved in the autumn. The results the
Minister cited are completely atypical. One only has to look at Network
Rail’s moving annual average for punctuality, which puts the
east coast main line in the top three of the seven long distance
franchises, to see that. The encouraging performance improvements in
period 1 and to date in period 2 of this year are an early reflection
of that collaboration with Network Rail. The latest available figures
show that nine out of 
<?notus-xml column=233?>every 10 East Coast trains were on time, according to the
industry’s public performance measure—up considerably on
the previous quarter and up year on
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:37:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000238"><Member ContinuationText="Alex Cunningham" PimsId="5668" UID="13060561000573" xid="1209" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000573"><B>Alex

improvements are reflected in two key metrics. First, under public
ownership East Coast achieved a record-breaking 92% overall customer
satisfaction rating in the autumn 2012 national passenger survey
conducted by the independent transport watchdog, Passenger Focus. That
is the highest score on the franchise since the survey was launched in
autumn 1999. It is 5% ahead of the score achieved in 2011 and three
percentage points higher than the 89% average for all long-distance
train operators. Indeed, in 2012, East Coast received the highest
customer satisfaction score of any long-distance franchise
operator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000241">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:39:37"></hs_TimeCode>,
complaints stand at a rate of 150 per 100,000 journeys according to the
Office of Rail Regulation’s latest available figures—down
considerably on the previous quarter and back to the level prior to the
disruption from the end of last year.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>Although that
figure is relatively high compared with those of other train operating
companies, it is just one third of where it stood when the east coast
main line was in private ownership in 2007-08. A higher-than-average
complainant rate might be due, in part, to the nature of the line
regardless of its ownership, but since it is the publicly owned and
publicly operated London Overground that has the lowest rate, at just
two complaints per 100,000 journeys, it is difficult to claim a direct
relationship between public ownership and
complaints<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:40:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000242">In
addition, perhaps because of the unprecedented investment in staff that
I have mentioned, there has been a 78% reduction in threats to staff in
the past year. The apparent contradiction between a rise in customer
satisfaction and a relatively high complaint rate dissolves entirely
when we look at the Office of Rail Regulation’s breakdown of the
reasons behind the grievances. Complaints about train service
performance are down, year on year, from 38% to 29%, but what are on
the increase and make up more than a fifth of all complaints are
criticisms of the quality of the trains themselves. That comes directly
from the fact that the rolling stock, which East Coast inherited from
National Express, is eight years older than the industry average, at 27
years as opposed to
19<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T14:41:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0001.htm#13060561000243">That
East Coast has achieved better customer satisfaction than any of its
long-distance rivals, while running the oldest rolling stock of any
franchise bar Merseyrail Electrics, is a testament to the workers and
the management, and that the trains are still running at all after 30
years or more of continuous use is a testament to the brilliance 
<?notus-xml column=234?>of the engineers of British Rail Engineering Ltd who designed

elements of on-train comfort have also seen a marked increase. Of
particular interest to certain hon. Members will be the new first-class
complimentary at-seat food and drinks service, which has reversed
historical losses of £20 million per annum and which contributed
to a 21% rise in the number of first-class journeys in 2011-12,
compared with the preceding 12 months. East Coast now serves
a million meals per annum, which is a tenfold increase on the previous

have admitted in the House of Commons that new investment in both rail
infrastructure and new rolling stock on the east coast will come
through taxpayer-funded support and not from franchisees. Funding for
the 2014-19 upgrade of the east coast main line will be delivered
through the Office of Rail Regulation approving a £240 million
increase in the value of Network Rail’s regulatory access base.
Regardless of whether the refranchising of the east coast main line
goes ahead, the public, through Network Rail, will still be paying for
the track. We will still be paying for the rolling stock, and we will
still be paying for any upgrades, extensions or electrification that
might ensue. None of the upgrades is dependent on whether the trains
going along the track are painted Virgin red or Stagecoach orange.

Doncaster. The station at Thornton Abbey—in a beautiful, idyllic

the Member for Middlesbrough (Andy McDonald) on securing this important
debate. The east coast main line is a vital artery for all of us,
running between London and Aberdeen. My principal interest is of course
Aberdeen. In the debates that we have had on this issue, it is clear
that the east coast main line is generally thought to run simply from
London to Edinburgh, but it runs another 130 miles further north. When
the line was completed in the 1880s, it was part of the Victorian
engineering miracle, producing both the Tay bridge and the Forth
bridge. It allowed royalty to get away for their summer holidays,
brought to London the fish and the textiles that were produced in
Aberdeen and opened up the whole country to tourism in the highlands.
It was an important line then, but it is even more important now, which
is not always recognised.</hs_Para>

is now the hub of the oil and gas industry in Europe. Over the past few
decades, it has poured billions of pounds into the Exchequer, but we
have a railway line, certainly the last past of it from Edinburgh to
Aberdeen, that has been forgotten about. I have raised that issue in
the House many times. There has been a failure to construct proper
infrastructure to support the oil and gas industry. The same can be
said, I think, of Norfolk, which has difficult contacts as well, but
perhaps not to the same extent.</hs_Para>

have done a little bit of arithmetic for the debate. The journey time
from London to Edinburgh, which is about 400 miles, is four hours and
20 minutes at an average speed of 92 miles an hour. Edinburgh to
Aberdeen is only 130 miles, and it takes two hours and 39 minutes at 45
miles an hour. When I have raised those issues in the past, they were
usually coupled with problems on the road network and with air
transport. I used to be able to say that someone could travel from
Aberdeen to 
<?notus-xml column=240?>Rome by car and find only 70 miles of single track, which was on the
road between Aberdeen and Dundee. That has now been sorted. Air
transport has improved dramatically as well, but we still have the same
problem on the rails. One part of the east coast main line, just north
of Montrose, is single track. The Minister will rightly point out that
the responsibility for that lies with the Scottish Government, but for
a couple of centuries it was the responsibility of Westminster, and
nothing was done about it.</hs_Para>

relates not just to this particular line, but to High Speed 2. In the
economic evaluation for HS2, there is a suggestion on page 9 that the
Government are retaining an option for removing through-trains from
stations north of Edinburgh to London once phase 2 of the new

mainly considered the National Express failure, which was a familiar
story of unrealistic bidding, poor due diligence, poor contracting and
wasted taxpayers’ money. Since then, the Department’s

themselves. By the end of this financial year, East Coast estimates

the freight off the main east coast line. The Minister and I have
discussed that at length. The proposal would have the added bonus of
providing the means to extend the Tyne and Wear Metro to Washington, in

those improvements are made, they do need to be made, and that will
require money. The benefit of keeping the franchise in public ownership
is that that investment can be made by ploughing the generous profits
generated—£800 million so far—back into the
service, instead of giving them to overseas shareholders. Our network

private companies every year, despite the fact that those companies
receive state subsidies to keep
going<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:14:25"></hs_TimeCode>. East
Coast’s performance over the past three years has shown us the
folly of that model. Why send profits generated from British passengers

rail fares in their own countries? We could and should use those

people have said that the private sector ethos is not something we want
to introduce into East Coast. In May 2011, I was fortunate enough to
persuade East Coast to increase the number of services stopping in
Stevenage by 18 per day. The number of services rose from 40 to 58 a
day, which means an extra 9,000 seats a year. That all sounds
great<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:19:36"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
the biggest rise in services to any location on the east coast main
line. I did an awful lot of work on that. The individual I spoke to,
who was the chairman of East Coast at the time, was previously the
chief executive of First Capital Connect, and she took the private
sector ethos that she received and learned at First Capital Connect and
introduced it on to the east coast main line. The reason First Capital
Connect is important is that it shares the Stevenage station,
effectively, with East Coast, and one of the main problems on a
franchise that is 960-odd miles long is that it deals with so many
other local operators. The point has been made that an interaction with
local services would be hugely important and beneficial to many of our
constituents. Fortunately for us, it works well in
Stevenage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:20:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0002.htm#13060561000327">As
I have mentioned, Stevenage is only 30 miles from London, and the
debate seems focused very much on services between London and the
constituencies of some Opposition Members, and London and my
constituency. A couple of years ago there were almost 40,000 journeys a
year from Stevenage to Newcastle; a year ago there were nearly 50,000
journeys from Stevenage to Leeds; there are 11 services a day from
Leeds to Stevenage and back. Stevenage is the capital of the UK space
industry. We employ more than 10,000 scientists and engineers and build
25% of the world’s telecommunications satellites. A couple of
days ago a satellite built in Stevenage went up, which will be
responsible for broadcasting everything back to the UK. Interacting
with a high-technology area such as Stevenage is important. People who
engage in debate about this issue always seem to focus on the idea of a
long-distance operator running the service, with Peterborough as the
closest place people could get to—where they would have to
change. As my hon. Friends have explained, that gives rise to the
question whether it is cheaper to do that, or just to go on a plane or
drive. Many of my constituents will drive to Heathrow airport and fly
to Scotland, because that is cheaper than going by East Coast train.
That is ridiculous. Sadly, it is faster. That is another
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:21:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
debate and our efforts should focus on passenger satisfaction. Whether
the service remains private or becomes public, or a mutual, that should
be the whole idea.</hs_Para>

privatisation delivered on those dimensions? On fares: no, it clearly
has not. On the return on investment, track charges now being obtained
by Network Rail are lower than they were 20 years ago. The East Coast
train company is giving the Government a higher return than its
predecessor private companies. In round terms, it turns over
£650 million a year, and it gives the Government a profit of
£200 million. In the middle of a downturn, for East Coast to

franchising system works, such as the relationship between Network
Rail, the train operating companies and the rolling stock leasing
companies, and about the failed diffuse franchising model established
by the Tory Government from 1979 to
1997.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000346" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0002.htm#13060561000346">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:29:34"></hs_TimeCode>
are promised new rolling stock on the east coast main line, but
initially only the diesel trains will be replaced, and that will not
happen until 2018. No one denies that the line suffers from chronic
under-investment, particularly as there is now very tired rolling
stock. However, let us not forget the burden that East Coast inherited
from the privately owned rail firms, GNER and then National Express.
Those problems were exacerbated, given the limited amount of rolling
stock available on the line, by the Hatfield and Selby rail crashes.
When full train sets are taken out of a service of that nature, it
means that the operator is operating on very tight margins
indeed.</hs_Para>

somehow so urgent to put the east coast line out to franchise now, when
East Coast is working well and when the franchise process for the west

answer is
ideology.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000350" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0002.htm#13060561000350"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:31:34"></hs_TimeCode>A
couple of misconceptions have arisen in the debate so far. One of the
previous speakers suggested that refranchising would fund improvements

made infrastructure investment from public money. It is clear that
refranchising will not bring about that kind of investment. I also say
to the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:31:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Redcar (Ian Swales) that, instead of perpetuating the notion
that somehow East Coast is uniquely expensive, if he took his
Government’s advice to benefit claimants and became
“digital by default” he could considerably reduce fares
by booking in advance. That is no different from the situation with any
of the other rail operators.</hs_Para>

“Oh, but the Labour Government were going to
refranchise.” We 
<?notus-xml column=248?>learn from experience, and we have learned that there is no inherent
reason why a publicly operated railway company cannot make a success of
things. One reason for that is that such a company will be operated not
by some anonymous Government Department but by rail professionals; it
will not be run from the Department for
Transport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:32:57"></hs_TimeCode>. Those

have only three minutes to speak, which does not give me much time to
consider the privatisation or nationalisation of the east coast main
line; I would need a lot of time to do that. Quite simply, I will focus
on saying that the privatisation of the railways—some might even
say the theft of the railway infrastructure—is totally
unacceptable. It has been an unmitigated disaster, and franchise after
franchise on the east coast main line has been a shining example of
that.</hs_Para>

have looked at the results of the east coast main  line. Since
it has been in public ownership, it has  been absolutely
outstanding and there have been  some things that private
companies would be absolutely delighted with: increased passenger
numbers, profits, premium payments and passenger satisfaction, and
better  turnover and punctuality. Also, passenger fare revenue
has increased by 34% to £820 million. In 2012, turnover was
£665.8 million, which was an increase of £20 million,
leaving a profit before tax and service payments to  the
Department for Transport of £195.7 million, which was an
increase of £13 million. Passenger journeys with 
<?notus-xml column=249?>East Coast, which runs trains from London to Yorkshire and from the
north-east of England to Scotland, increased by 2.1% in
2012.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:36:07"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

addition, there is another important point, which I think has been
agreed on by Members of all parties today. Customer satisfaction with
East Coast has risen by 2%. Also, the company’s latest
punctuality figures are the best since records began in 1999. What a
credit to East Coast that is, and why on earth the Government are
hoping to privatise the east coast main line quite frankly beggars
belief. Again, it is about absolute ideology and absolute dogma, and
who will benefit from this privatisation? It will not be the passengers
and it will not be the work force; the financial bonanza will be
distributed between shareholders.</hs_Para>

have twenty-five seconds left to speak. I ask the Minister why on earth
National Express—a company that threw the keys back at the
Government because it could not cope with privatisation last
time—will be allowed to bid for the east coast main line for a
second time. If it could not cope the first time, why is it even being
allowed to put itself forward a second

In fact, a report by Just Economics showed that UK rail services were
less affordable, less comfortable, slower and more inefficient than
publicly owned rail services in Germany, France, Italy and Spain.
British train tickets are now the most expensive in Europe. A typical
season ticket in the UK now costs 14p per kilometre, compared with just
8p per kilometre in Germany, Holland and France, which are the next
most expensive countries in Europe. So, if we are making comparisons on
price or value for money, the privatised franchise model that we have
here just does not stack up.</hs_Para>

East Coast has made real progress since Directly Operated Railways

time. The two previous franchise holders failed, with one operator
walking away from its obligations entirely. Yet East Coast, run as a
not-for-dividend operator, has achieved what its predecessors could
not: stability and constantly improving services. This

know from my own region how better services have made a real difference
to passengers. In the east midlands, more services now stop at Newark;
direct trains have been established daily between Lincoln and London;
and two weeks ago a new commuter service was launched from Grantham.
Bearing all this in mind, it is difficult to recognise the
Government’s description of East Coast’s performance.
Indeed, the Minister has said that punctuality on the east coast has
plateaued. He even said that East Coast was the worst operator for
punctuality when he 
<?notus-xml column=252?>appeared before the Transport Committee in April. He was then quoting
from a very narrow, four-week window. Will he acknowledge today that
this picture is not representative? According to Network Rail’s
most recent punctuality figures, East Coast outperformed Virgin in both
the last quarter and over the whole year, without the benefits of a
£9 billion upgrade of its
infrastructure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:47:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
So this privatisation cannot be about punctuality, given that the
Government have announced an extension to the operator’s
contract on the west coast main line, where delays are more
common.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060561000387" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0002.htm#13060561000387">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:47:25"></hs_TimeCode>
has been said that the Government are seeking a commercial partner to

of upgrading the east coast main line and procuring new rolling stock
will be met through public spending? In April, the Minister said that
franchises should be

improvements in all those areas and grown the business, on a route that
was last upgraded in the 1980s. The operator has developed a five-year
plan and could deliver further success, if only the Government took the
sensible step of backing it. Instead, we have seen an ideological
decision to re-privatise the service.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:48:12"></hs_TimeCode> is a

collapse of franchising has cast a long shadow over the rail industry.
The fiasco has cost the taxpayer at least £55 million. Orders
for rolling stock are on hold and the supply chain has been hit,
threatening jobs and skills. The Government should be putting their
house in order. So it is worrying to see Ministers devoting their time
to this unnecessary and unwanted privatisation instead, which suggests

have an average annual household net income of more than four times
that of citizens in Bulgaria and Romania, so why will the Bulgarians
and the Romanians not come to the United Kingdom in large numbers from
next January? Apparently, there are already about 1 million of them in
Spain, so it will not be very expensive for them to get here from Spain
if they want to do so, and once they get here, unless something is done
to the existing rules, they will basically have free access to as many

get work. Even if they are unsuccessful at getting work, they can say
that they are trying to get work and then access our benefits system.

will assure us that the Prime Minister is serious about trying to do

are rightly concerned that our rules on migrants’ access to
benefits should be robust. We already have strong rules to protect the
taxpayer and the public purse from abuse and fraud. Those rules are
fair and just, and I think they are entirely consistent with the
freedom of EU citizens to work and to look for work here—I will
come back to the issue of those who come here with no intention of
working and the controls that are in place in that regard. The rules
rightly ensure that migrants cannot get benefits if they have never
worked here and have no intention of doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:48:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060567000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0002.htm#13060567000027">Let
me set out a bit of the background to assist my hon. Friend. European
law says that an EU citizen can move to another member state if they
are a worker, self-employed or a student, if they are seeking work or
if they are self-sufficient. When EU nationals come to work in the
hotels and guest houses of Bournemouth and Christchurch, it is that
right that they are exercising, in the same way that UK nationals
exercise their right when they go and work in other European Union
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:48:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060567000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0002.htm#13060567000028">European
law also says that we must treat EU nationals who come here to work in
the same way as we treat British nationals. We comply with that
principle. EU nationals who work here and then lose their job can claim
jobseeker’s allowance and housing benefit and, if they are
temporarily unwell and unable to work, they can claim employment and
support
allowance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060567000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/halltext/130605h0002.htm#13060567000029">EU
nationals who come here to seek work are expected under EU law to be
actively seeking work and to have a genuine chance of getting a job,
and if they do, we say that they can claim jobseeker’s
allowance. When people try to claim JSA, we apply a fair test to assess
whether they are genuinely here to seek work—the habitual
residence test. That test is applied to jobseekers whether they are EU
nationals or UK nationals.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend is absolutely right that no member state can afford to
support migrants who have no intention of working and contributing
economically to the community in which they choose to live. There is no
requirement under EU law to provide such support, nor should there be.
EU law has not sought to harmonise benefit regimes, nor should it. As
he rightly points out, those are matters for national Governments.
Member states have their own benefit regimes, some of which are more or
less generous to their citizens than ours. It is easy to see why some
people feel that they can move, not to work, but to take advantage of
what they think is more generous welfare support in another
country.</hs_Para>

law sets out rules for co-ordination between member states to ensure

move just to take advantage of different benefit regimes, and the

Hoban:</Member></B> I just say to my hon. Friend that when someone
seeks to claim jobseeker’s allowance, they go through vigorous
tests to identify whether they are looking for work. The only basis on
which people receive benefit is by demonstrating that they are looking
for work, which is why we have the habitual residence test. It tests
not whether someone has popped across on holiday and decided to sign on
while they are here, but whether they have any real intention to be
here and work. That is why we ask a range of questions and why we are
trying to strengthen the test, which I shall come on to in a moment. It

When we ask people to satisfy the habitual residence test, we do so not
on the basis of their nationality but on the basis that they have moved
to the UK from abroad, even if they have previously lived here. We do
so to protect our system from abuse. Why would a member state not want
to protect its benefit system from abuse by checking that someone is
legally resident before they make a claim? The advocate-general of the

habitual residence test does not discriminate on the grounds of

public finances of the UK and prevents benefit claims by people who
have no intention of working here at all. My concern and that of the
Government, and the reason why we are fighting the case, is that if the
Commission is successful in arguing its interpretation of the rules, it
will open a new door that will mean that member states can no longer
check that migrants meet national residence laws, thus extending free
movement to inactive migrants who believe they can move to any member
state and get social assistance benefits soon after arriving. That
cannot be right, which is why the Government, the Secretary of State

Dobbs J, and the Recorder of Redbridge) in <I>R v Christopher Killick

process for victims to request a review and how the review will be
conducted by the CPS. Victims will be notified of their right to review
when a CPS prosecutor decides not to charge or to terminate criminal
proceedings involving that person as a victim. If the victim requests a
review of the decision, a different prosecutor will consider the
decision afresh and determine whether or not the decision of the
original prosecutor was wrong. The decision on whether to reinstitute
proceedings as a result of that review will be made at the level of
deputy chief Crown Prosecutor or

to protect the audiovisual industry by maintaining existing EU

support, and reserving future policy space for new technologies. France

Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. For the
UK, I welcomed the Commission’s commitment to securing these
vital cultural protections, but argued that this trade agreement

Experts can add most value. In January 2013, the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague), announced initial deployments to countries
including Bosnia, Libya. South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo
and to the Syria Border. A number of other countries are now engaging
in PSVI at both a practical and political level, taking into account
existing national and international efforts. Over the summer, the
British embassy in Rangoon will be scoping options to expand the
initiative to
Burma.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13060582000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/text/130605w0001.htm#13060582000040"><B><Member PimsId="1550" UID="13060582000137" xid="1012" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/text/130605w0001.htm#13060582000137">Naomi

Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) through UNSCR 1279 of 30 November
1999. Like its predecessor, MONUC the current force (the UN
Organisation Stabilisation Mission—MONUSCO), has a primary
objective to protect civilians. UNSCR 2098 of 28 March 2013 saw an
extension of the mandate of the UN peacekeeping operation in DRC, with
the new element of an Intervention Brigade charged with helping to
stabilise the region through neutralizing armed groups and contributing
to reducing the threat posed by them. The Intervention Brigade, under
the same mandate as the rest of MONUSCO, is in the process of deploying
to the region. Britain fully supports the work of the whole of MONUSCO.
We remain confident that MONUSCO's presence contributes positively to
peace and security in eastern DRC. We will continue to monitor the
situation, and MONUSCO’s operations, through the UN Security
Council and via our representatives on the ground in DRC.</hs_Para>

relation to the funding of support for victims of sexual violence, the
Ministry of Justice has improved funding for rape support provision
across England and Wales. Rape support centres provide independent,
specialist support to victims of both recent and historic sexual
violence. Previously, funding for such centres was short-term and
piecemeal, leading to the closure of a number of centres and the loss
of vital support for victims. As a result, rape support centres are on
a secure financial footing for the first time, with 78 centres around
the country receiving total grant funding of nearly £4 million a

leadership; supported by improved management capability; with access to
better, local, high-quality accredited occupational health services;

Swinson:</Member></B> Blacklisting is an abhorrent practice. That is
why, in response to the findings of the investigation by the
Information Commissioner's Office into the Consulting Association, and
subsequent consultation, the Government legislated in 2010 to prohibit
the use of blacklists. The Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists)
Regulations 2010 make it unlawful, subject to certain exemptions, to
compile, use, sell or supply 'prohibited lists', ie a blacklist.
Individuals who believe they are being excluded from employment because
of a blacklist should seek redress in county courts in England and
Wales, or Court of Session in Scotland. Other rights under the
regulations can be enforced in employment tribunals.</hs_Para>

supply or use of a blacklist is also likely to amount to a breach of
the Data Protection Act 1998 as information about the individual's
membership of a trade union is sensitive personal data. The Information
Commissioner has the power, increased in 2010, to impose fines, up to
£500,000 for serious breaches, on data controllers who
unlawfully process data. This can include not only the individual or
company that created the blacklist, but any employer or agency using it
for employment
vetting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060597000896" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/text/130605w0002.htm#13060597000896">It
is also unlawful under the Trade Union and Labour Relations Act 1992 to
refuse to employ a person because they are a member or not a member of
a trade union, or because they refuse to join or leave a trade union.
It is equally unlawful for an agency to refuse employment services on
those grounds. An individual can bring an employment tribunal claim
within three months of the offence taking place, or longer if the
tribunal decides it was not reasonably practicable to bring the claim
in
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060597000897" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130605/text/130605w0002.htm#13060597000897">To

TB and from over 18 months down to four months for drug resistant TB.
Shorter treatment regimens result in increased adherence and help
prevent the development of further drug resistance. It has been

but there was insufficient evidence to prove that the deceased
deliberately intended to kill themselves. However, this cannot be

via Home Office Police Forces (HOPF), which have direct and routine
access to Local Safeguarding Children Boards. This type of engagement
takes place as a matter of routine and is referred to in Home Office
Circular 028/2008 (a protocol set up in 2008 between the HOPF and the

claims. From 2011-12 onwards this work was taken over by the Vehicle
and Operator Services Agency at an annual cost of £100,000 as
part of an increased emphasis on enforcement, and is excluded from the

Simon Burns:</Member></B> The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) obtains
the funding it requires to cover its running costs from the fees and
charges which it levies on the aviation industry for the range of
services which it provides. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is
currently undertaking a classification review of the CAA, which will
report soon. The review is focused on whether the CAA's charges should
properly be regarded as taxes. Should the ONS find that some or all of
the CAA's charges should be reclassified as taxes and that, as a
result, the greater part of the CAA's income is derived from taxation,
the CAA itself would be reclassified as part of central Government for
accounting purposes. We would not however expect the outcome of this
review to affect the charging structure which CAA has in
place.</hs_Para>

fees, the total income from driver licensing transactions is expected
to be in the region of £125 million to £130 million for
each of the years 2013-14, 2014-15 and 2015-16. This total
estimates £50 million for first applications for driving
licences, £50 million for driving licence renewals and
£20 million for duplicate driving licences. A number of other

Baker:</Member></B> The most recent review of the collection of road
casualty statistics (STATS19) added a requirement for police forces to
record whether a mobility vehicle had been involved in an accident on
the public highway. Individual police forces are able to choose when to
implement the review requirements. This allows them to modify their
procedures and data systems in the most cost-effective way. As the
system updates have not been completed across all forces, data on the
involvement of mobility vehicles in accidents are not available yet. I
expect more comprehensive data to become available once all police
forces have implemented the changes.</hs_Para>

electrification of the Midland Main Line which will deliver cleaner,
greener and faster trains between London, Corby, Nottingham and
Sheffield. Electrification of this route has a sufficiently strong case
that there is no net cost to Government. It will boost economic growth,
improve connectivity and reduce the cost of running the railway to the
Department. Where a scheme 
<?notus-xml column=1200?>leads to a saving to Government overtime, the BCR is a potentially
misleading indicator, and the Department does not use them in these

For example, a non-dependant working 30 hours per week at the national

IT payment system update went live in April 2012. All outcomes prior to
this were recorded clerically and uploaded to the system during April
and May 2012. The outcome date for these is based on the date the
information was uploaded to the system. For job outcomes recorded after
this, outcome dates are based on the date that payments were made to
providers following pre-payment validation processes to confirm job
outcomes. The manual pre-payment validation checks may take time to
conduct resulting in a delay between the job outcome being claimed and
the date the payment is made to providers, and hence recorded in the
statistics. Validation procedures continue to improve to streamline the
process as issues are identified. For further details around issues and
delays to job outcome payments please see the information note

formal collaboration. We have therefore ensured the regulatory
framework exists to enable maintained schools to federate, should they
wish to do so. We believe that the benefits of schools working together
can generally be most fully realised through the freedoms and autonomy
offered by academy status. Our focus is on improving guidance and
resources and promoting the growth of strong academy chains and
sponsors so that no school feels ill-equipped to take on
academy
