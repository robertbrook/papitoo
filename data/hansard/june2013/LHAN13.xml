early last year the Government’s own care quality inspectors
found, in a number of abortion clinics, piles of forms signed by
doctors authorising abortions for women they had never seen, let alone
examined? Was it not also reported that other abortions were being done
for non-medical reasons such as that the child coming was a girl? Why

place procedures to identify pre-signing or other instances of
non-compliance, and they are confident that these would now be picked
up during inspections. However, my noble friend is right; there was a
concern early last year that this pre-signing was happening. Since
then, however, the CQC has been working directly with providers who are
registered to provide termination of pregnancy services to ensure that
they are complying with the requirements of the Act. It is beginning to
explore how it can strengthen the registration process alongside its
regular inspection activities. I therefore suggest to my noble friend

signed by more than 50 Members of another place, drawing attention to
the need at least to collect the data where the gender of a child is

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am aware of all the initiatives
mentioned by the noble Lord. The issue of the sex selection of foetuses
is, of course, extremely serious. However, as I mentioned in my earlier
Answer, following extensive investigation and analysis we do not
believe that there is any evidence that this is happening in the UK.
That is the prime reason why we do not agree with the noble Lord that
measures should be put in place to collect data regularly on the sex of
the aborted foetus. Were we to do that it would require changes to
legislation. It would also require changes to clinical practice, and it
has ethical implications. I hope the noble Lord will understand that we
have thought about this very
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000008"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:10:14"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mawhinney" PimsId="4891" UID="13060650000674" xid="1893" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000674">Lord

England and Wales has been static since 2009. The good news is that the
abortion rate for women under 18 has gone down. There was a
9.6% decrease in the rate between 2010 and 2011. On repeat
abortions, the news is not so good. The proportion of repeat abortions
for women who had abortions in 2011 was 36%. The figure was higher than
it had been the previous year, which is a matter for
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:12:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Royall of Blaisdon" PimsId="485" UID="13060650000678" xid="1719" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000678">Baroness

figures that the Minister gave on the number of abortions going down
for younger women, and regret the figure for repeat abortions.
Naturally, we must do everything possible to stop illegal abortions.
However, will the Minister confirm that it is important 
<?notus-xml column=1275?>that women who need abortions should not be impeded in any way, and that
sex education and education about relationships are terribly important?
I hope that the Government will be open to accepting amendments to the
forthcoming education Bill on that

Howe:</Member></B> I am sure that those issues should be discussed very
thoroughly. I agree that young people should be taught about
relationships. However, I also believe that access to contraception is
very important. Our data show that there has been no decrease in the
number of women using contraception, and that more women are turning to
extremely effective measures such as long-acting contraception. It is
encouraging that the abortion rate for the under-18s is coming

the House that I do not seek to suggest that I should be admitted to
this great order. However, since there are no fewer than 24
vacancies, it is rather tempting to propose the names of admired
friends—men and women from all parts of the

include anyone from the government Front Bench, even my noble friend,
for the following reason. Does he agree that anyone looking at the
composition of the order today might well think that it is designed
primarily for politicians, who constitute no less than half the current

recipients, but should not the order reflect more fully the glorious

of Honour is only one of the orders of honour in the British honours
system. Service to the state is, after all, one of the central
principles under which the various orders have been created.
Politicians who belong to the Order of the Companions of Honour have
all provided considerable service to the state. Indeed, 16 of them are
Members of this House. However, as the noble Lord has also noted, there
are a number of people who have made considerable contributions in the
fields of music, theatre, fiction writing, history, science and

some 6,800 warships, auxiliaries and merchant ships landed British,
American and Canadian forces in Normandy, and that 5,500 of those ships
were British. I have to say we are not quite in that position today.
Four years before—some 73 years ago this
week—Operation Dynamo finished, in which we had expected to
manage to withdraw some 80,000 troops of the beaten British Army from
Europe, but ended up taking out more than a third of a million. In the

We are very conscious of the imbalance in gender terms of almost all
the orders and honours which are awarded. Only four of the 41 members
of the Order of the Companions of Honour are women. However, nearly
half the honours awarded in the latest New Year Honours
List—47%—were awarded to women, although the majority of
those were at what one has to call the lower levels of honours, not the
higher. That, of course, partly reflects the continuing imbalance in
society and the economy. Since John Major’s changes in 1993, it
is open to all British citizens to nominate people for honours. There
were 3,000 nominations last year. I encourage everyone to think very
actively who else, particularly among distinguished women, might be
nominated for orders.</hs_para>

we have to look actively at that issue. Again I would say to everyone
here and to all those whom noble Lords know outside, we encourage
public nominations. Perhaps I may also add, as someone who lives in
Yorkshire, the English regions are underrepresented. If you live in

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the reasons why it
has taken much longer than we intended to produce a statutory register
of lobbyists is because the definition of who is a lobbyist is
extremely difficult. The Labour Government before this Government also
struggled with that. As all who have studied this area will know, the
issue is whether one simply limits the register to third-party
lobbyists—those who are professional lobbyists working on behalf
of someone else—extends it to the category of lobbyists for
for-profit companies such as the entire public affairs sector of a
major company or beyond there to those who lobby for non-profit
organisations such as Oxfam, Christian Aid or the RSPCA. That takes one
into an extremely wide area which is difficult to

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I awoke this morning to find out
from Twitter that the Secretary of State, Ed Davey, has just made
another one of his grand bargains, this time with DCLG on onshore wind.
I have to say that my heart sank. Yet again, it is a terrible bargain.
In return for changes to planning laws that will undoubtedly make it
more difficult to build wind farms, he has won an increase in the
amount of money that communities can receive. Can the Minister explain
what the benefit of that money will be if this pandering to a vocal
minority ensures that planning laws are changed so that none of them
gets built? Will these new rules also apply to planning applications
for shale gas

noble Baroness took me by surprise. I want to make it clear that this
is not a change to the National Policy Planning Framework; it is an
underscoring of what that policy has always said about the involvement
of local communities in the development of local plans. Wind farms fall
into the capacity of local plans and local structures. We are therefore
making sure, for any wind farm development, that developers must talk
to the local community before they put those plans forward and that the
local authority also takes that into account. At present, it is not
mandatory, and this will make it

that that is one of the aspects that will need to be taken into

National Planning Policy Framework lays out at the moment. It advises
that local people should be consulted about major
planning applications. The Statement says that it will be amended so
that they must be consulted. That then makes it a material
consideration for the decision on planning applications and must be
taken into account. Whether that increases or decreases the number of
approvals given will become clearer, but, one way or the other, it
seems to us essential that local people, who will feel the impact of
wind farms—indeed, who already have experience of
them—have a proper say on any future

have obtained this debate on this subject, which is not just tax
evasion and tax avoidance but the social and economic consequences of
that tax evasion and avoidance. I must say I am disappointed that no
Conservative Members have sought to participate in the debate; it might
have added an interesting angle—some spice—to it,
although I understand that some of the things that they might try to
defend are not easy to defend. Tax is a question of a real moral
imperative as well as having profound practical consequences. Those who
dodge their legitimate tax obligation commit a severe moral breach, but
they also deprive our schools and hospitals of much needed investment
and create problems for responsible businesses that pay their full
share of
taxation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000093">Tax
evasion and avoidance is not new. Plato—I see that the Convenor
of the Cross-Benches is looking astonished that I am quoting
Plato—said that when there is income tax, the just man will pay
more and the unjust less on the same amount of income. How true that
is. However, what is new about the current crisis in tax is the scale
of the issue and how far out of control we have let it go. The amount
that we lose in the United Kingdom in uncollected taxes is a third of
the deficit. It dwarfs the personal tax allowance, and it is more than
twice the size of the bill for housing benefit—and how often do
we hear about all those? That is nearly £40 billion. It is a
cash sum the size of the budgets of some government departments, which
are being asked to make cuts that are causing tremendous problems. We

all the difficulties that are being created for our departments. It is

people pay tax will come because of moral outrage, so we must continue

out of business by online operators, based offshore, that can get away
with not paying tax. Reputable companies such as John Lewis
are struggling to compete with global firms that can spirit their
profits out of the country. The status quo of allowing large-scale tax

we need an HMRC with more bite. Tax avoidance is itself an industry.
The big four accountancy firms make £2 billion a year, In order
to challenge that kind of vested interest, HMRC needs to be given
significantly more muscle. The £154 million so-called
“blitz” that the Chancellor recently announced simply
does not match up, especially—and I hope that the Minister will
deal with this—against a backdrop of overall cuts to HMRC that
will diminish it to its lowest staffing level ever by 2015. For every
£1 invested in HMRC, £9 is returned to the Exchequer.
That is a real investment. For every 10 cases of tax evasion brought by
the Crown Prosecution Service, nine end in a conviction. So we have
some of the tools, but we need more and we need to make them
tougher.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000105">We
also need an HMRC that is more transparent. While HMRC is of necessity
a big part of the solution, it is also currently part of the problem.
With no proper ministerial oversight, it has become a closed community
that cuts deals with big business. Noble Lords will have heard the
stories of Vodafone having £8 billion in tax waived, which
appear to go largely unchallenged. We need to be able to put a
spotlight on HMRC. We need it to disclose the deals that are being done
with big business. Every year HMRC writes off £5 billion that it
knows that it will not collect. We need to be able to hold it
accountable for that and for it to become substantially more
transparent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000106">The

overseas territories and the EU G5 is welcome, it is just a small first
step. We need agreements that go further and draw in a greater number

need to be brought within the fold. Rampant tax-dodging means that many
of them are unable to capture the benefits of the foreign investment

Cameron, the Prime Minister, was right to call on our overseas

which the UK should lead from the front. At present, we have no formal
obligation for companies to register their beneficial owner, so front
companies are set up, and it is difficult to know who is the ultimate
beneficial owner. We need to pull back the curtain and see who is
really benefiting from tax scams. We must change that and set the kind

I shall try to anticipate one of the Minister’s defensive

circulated in the memos we have see from government: “Asleep at
the wheel”, and so on. I am happy to have a conversation with
the noble Lord, Lord Newby, and any other Minister at any other time,
but that is not the subject for today. Today we are challenging the
present Government, who have been in power for three years, about what
they are doing. Therefore I ask the Minister, first, whether he will
agree with me, and more importantly with the Public Accounts Committee,
that cuts of as much as £2 billion to HMRC have hindered our
ability to collect tax, and will the Government think again about those
cuts in the coming spending review. Secondly, will he commit the
Government to a public register of beneficial ownership? Thirdly, will
he encourage the Prime Minister to lead a multilateral automatic
information exchange that is much broader and much more ambitious than
any that has gone before and that includes, above all, the developing
countries? I hope that his answer to each of those questions is
positive. Unless he does so, he will not have answered the challenge
that I put at the start, and he will have failed the people who are
losing because of the tax dodging. I hope that today we can have a
positive response from a Minister who I know deep in his heart is
sympathetic to the cause that I have been putting. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_06_PT_1/552CC9261AED8FE75B67ADAEB95008C3EB05FB21" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 June 2013">Thursday,

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble

timely and important debate, and on his characteristically robust
speech of introduction in which he covered quite a lot of the
waterfront. He constantly promised that others would add to it. I am

is disappointing that so few Members of your Lordships’ House
consider this issue important enough to make a contribution to the
debate because it is hugely important. The scale is mindboggling in the
United Kingdom, as my noble friend has already said. According to Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, the tax gap—the difference
between what Revenue and Customs believes should have been paid and
what it received from the entire economy—amounted to £32
billion in 2011-12. One can disaggregate that, and it is interesting to
see that it is not all corporation tax. Quite a substantial part of it
is VAT, there is some customs and excise avoidance and a comparatively
smaller amount is income tax. It is a significant amount of money. As
my noble friend said, it is a third of the deficit for 2012-13. If this
money were brought in, it would obviate the necessity for any further
spending cuts; it would deal with that issue. While I accept the
remonstrations of the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, that we should be
careful not to conflate tax avoidance and tax evasion, I do not think
that there are any positive consequences from either of them for our
community.</hs_para>

industry is clearly damaging the interests of developed countries,
including our own; there is no question. It is almost certain, however,

everyone does not, but he makes a very important point. This is exactly
the case in many of the world’s poorest countries. Because of
the way in which businesses approach their tax affairs, many of these
countries do not have these basic services that we can continue to
sustain. It is estimated that countries in the developing world lose
three times more money—three times more—to tax dodging
than they receive in aid every year. The estimate is that they lose
about £160 billion a year through tax dodging. If that money
stayed in those countries, rather than being spirited away to the
offshore accounts of multinational companies, it could be
transformative. These tax havens—to which I will come back in a
moment—are the life support system for that tax dodging, and the
plug needs to be pulled on them. They play no useful role in the global
economic system.</hs_parafo>

through tax havens. That is 50% that at some stage passed through a tax
haven, even though these jurisdictions contributed then only 
<?notus-xml column=1292?>3% of the global GDP. Recent ActionAid research—which I believe
is the research that my noble friend held in his hand while making his
speech—reveals among other things that the taxes lost to Zambia
from tax haven transactions from just one United Kingdom Company,
Associated British Foods, was a sum 19 times greater than the United
Kingdom’s aid to Zambia for hunger—19 times

this for a significant time when we were in power, and we have to live

obligation is to avoid paying fair taxes and to challenge that
directly. I ask the Minister, and I am sure that he will find it easy
to answer this, whether he agrees with the Prime Minister or with the
chairman of the CBI that this is a moral issue. If it is a moral issue,
does the Minister agree that we in the United Kingdom, because of the
position that we occupy in the world and our relationship with many of

make one final point to the Minister. There is a deeply corrosive
effect of the structures that have been created by tax avoiders and tax

structures of which the crooks of this world are taking advantage. We
discovered recently, because of the uncovering of money-laundering
through a legitimate process of international banking in cyberspace,
exactly what crooks are able to do. That is exactly what is happening
in this environment. If the Minister wants evidence for that, he should
look at the World Bank’s recent report, which showed that there
were 800 corporations involved in the 150 examples of serious
money-laundering and crooked use of money, all of them taking advantage
of structures that were otherwise legitimately created. We are allowing
crooks and deeply tainted money to get into our legitimate exercises

Lord, Lord Foulkes, however, that when I started to make some notes for
this debate I had little intention of making more than a passing
reference to the history of Labour Governments in this. However, his
comments have forced me to do so. This kind of amnesia, wherein what
happened in the past is irrelevant, is a very uncomfortable position
from which to pass. He talked about “new in scale” as if
we are suddenly coming across problems which had not existed in the
past, and had now forced themselves on to our attention. I remind him
that even his own Labour Party was in 1997 sufficiently aware of tax
evasion on the domestic scale to look at a GAAR—a general
anti-avoidance rule or anti-abuse rule—which it rejected. This
Government have now brought that back into the frame; I will talk about
it in a minute. Also, however, the US Senate thought this was such a
crucial issue that it started its major hearings in 2001. 
<?notus-xml column=1295?>That put into the public arena so much of the information now being used

noble Lord, Lord Browne, drew attention to the culture in which
businesses, and those such as the CBI who speak as the trade bodies for

grew out of what they saw as a very long period of complacency and a
rejection by Government, who had the power to intervene, to make those
interventions. Those years of neglect have played a very significant
role in the culture that we now have to turn around. In the end, we

at looking at a principles-based approach to sit alongside a
rules-based approach. I suspect that in future years we will have to
look at whether or not anti-abuse is sufficient, and whether we need to
move into anti-avoidance. However, I will bring to your

is also crucial that we understand that the measures we take that
affect our domestic tax framework do not tackle the international,
multinational tax issues. I sometimes think that when people talk about

the multinational and international problems. This report also reminds
us of that,

frustration, particularly with the capacity of multinational companies
to use their offshore reach to avoid or minimise their
tax—effectively, not to pay tax—is in part because of the
impact on public spending. Other noble Lords have talked about that. It
is also because of the way in which it destroys the level playing field
for many of our businesses, and in particular our domestic and small
businesses. I note that in my own community, Qbookshop, which is one of
a chain of three, has a notice in its window reminding the public that
the taxes it pays support at least one nurse in the local hospital. The
reality is that Amazon, for all its reach, does not do a lot more than
that with the corporate taxes that it
pays<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:30:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000134">As
I look for ways to do my purchasing from companies that have a proper
approach to tax—as others do—I find that it is
extraordinary how few exist. There are times when you are
simply forced back to Amazon to carry out a transaction. This
basically shows that the advantage of being able to avoid
tax payments has subsidised those players in growing and squeezing out
the competition that otherwise would naturally occur. We as a country
are suffering from the destruction of that kind of level, competitive

also note that when small businesses in the UK begin to grow, they are
frequently sold to a foreign owner, and sometimes the owner is
essentially a Luxembourg-based shell. Once again, it is almost
impossible for a company to continue to compete unless it tries to
enjoy the tax advantages that others in its field can access. One can
see the temptation of many an investor to buy a company and move its
activities or quasi-activities simply from a tax motive. I wonder how
much the issue that we have often addressed, which is why we cannot get
our small companies to grow into medium-sized and large companies based
in this country, has a tax motive somewhere at the bottom of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000136">I,
like many people, have a real frustration that the kinds of rules of
which these large companies take advantage were written by Governments
on the understanding that it was unfair for companies to pay tax on the
same economic activity in one, two or three locations. It is an
entirely fair request for a company to say that it should pay tax only
once. However, to take advantage of that, to work around it and to use
it in order to create an environment where tax payment is in effect
zero strikes me as the most extraordinary abuse and contempt, and it is
absolutely necessary that we should bring it back under
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000137"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T11:52:57"></hs_TimeCode>I
am looking very much at the G8 to begin to make strides in that

to look very differently at online companies, which can move their
profits, domicile and activities in such a significant way. I wonder
whether we should look at whether online companies should pay tax on

I finish—I am not going to use my full time—I will say
one thing quickly to the Government. I was struck by the fact that one
of the important instruments that the United States uses is the Foreign

<?notus-xml column=1297?>Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires individuals, or corporations
as individuals, to report the financial accounts that they hold
overseas. It also requires foreign financial institutions to report to
the IRS on American clients. The UK is one of the countries that are
co-operating with FATCA. It was designed primarily to combat offshore
tax evasion and to recoup federal tax revenues. I would like to know
whether we could have a UK version of this, because
transparency—the kind of exposure that comes with
FATCA—can be a very important basis for trying to challenge both
tax avoidance and tax
evasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:34:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000139">Finally,
I will say that many people, like me, would like to shift their
economic activities—their business, their trade—to
companies that play by the rules, but it is very difficult to find out
which they are. I wonder whether there is any way that the Government
could assist us: a way that would enable us to understand, when we walk
into a shop, deal online, or, through our corporate lives, look at
setting up relationships, whether we are working with a company that,
as it were, has the kitemark of paying its taxes in an appropriate way.
I admit that my ingenuity on this issue is limited, but it would be
very helpful, and it would allow the public to do what they have done
on many other occasions, which is to use their spending power. In that
way, the Government would not have to deal with the issue simply
through legislation and through enforcement by HMRC, but would have the
public on their side. I note that Starbucks at least decided to make a
voluntary tax payment—I think that we all agree that taxes
should not be voluntary—in large part because when it was
exposed as a company that paid virtually no corporate tax in the United
Kingdom, its customers decided that they could go to a very nice coffee
shop just down the road that did actually pay
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:36:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_06_PT_1/D21F3977E40B23E758E70C2CD78EB93AB63BD239" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 June 2013">Thursday,

is the key test? It seems to me that it is credibility. Businesses,
especially publicly owned ones, must be credible. They go to great
lengths and great expense to appear so. Yes, it is credible to locate
production where skills are available. Yes, it is credible to locate
services where costs are lower. But is it credible to sell, package and
ship a book—not an e-book—from a UK warehouse, and for it
to arrive at my house with a UK stamp on the parcel, and then to say
that really the transaction took place in Luxembourg—where,
incidentally, many of our roaming 
<?notus-xml column=1298?>telephone charges are located? Is it credible that the intellectual
property rights for a product should lie in the Cayman Islands, when
the science, engineering, design and technology, and all the brain work
were done in Europe, Asia and the USA? The Cayman Islands played no
part in generating the value, and nor does it provide the patent
protection that is so highly valued in these
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T12:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
Is the transfer pricing credible that goes on with coffee, metal ore
and minerals? As the American Senate committee asked, is it credible
for a company to have no domicile at all? In the <I>FT</I>, Robert
Shrimsley put it rather well when he said that these companies were
domiciled somewhere on a cloud. Equally, it is not credible that HMRC

particularly important for our economy now that digital technology has
opened up so many new possibilities, markets and opportunities for

the Government’s efforts in this regard. Meanwhile, we can do
other things on our own. The noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, spoke of the
general anti-avoidance rule—GAAR, as she put it. Will this
enable HMRC to be more assertive and aggressive in challenging these
arrangements, which are just not credible? I found what the noble
Baroness said rather disappointing because I expected it to be much
more powerful. I join other noble Lords in asking whether there is the
expertise, staff and will within HMRC to fight the tax avoidance

Journalists, tax experts and campaigners have been exposing some of the
tax chicanery perpetrated by big business for far longer. My noble

accounts reveal that its corporation tax bill amounts to less than it
gets in grants. It appears that most of those grants are for the
company’s new operation in Dunfermline. How can the Government
clamp down on the likes of Amazon and Google when the accounting firms
used by these companies actually second staff to advise the Treasury on
new tax legislation? To be blunt, the more that you can afford to pay a

review period wants further to expand anti-avoidance and evasion
activity focused on offshore evasion, and this investment, it is
claimed, will secure a further £2 billion in that
period. Yet, as the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, mentioned, there are
hundreds fewer HMRC staff now than there were in 2011 due to total cuts
of around £2 billion. How are these two positions to be

that, when it comes to paying tax, they are finally determined to take
the issue as seriously as business has for many years. We are hearing
some encouraging words but those words must be translated into
action—action on an international scale—if it is to be of

opening, the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, regretted my party’s lack
of participation, but I have been in the Chamber throughout, just as I
was for all but 40 minutes of the 12 hours we devoted to the same-sex

argument. I did think of speaking because of having participated in the
debate on the Second Reading of the Finance Bill, following the
Question for Short Debate last December on international tax
implications, in which the noble Lord, Lord Browne, also took part.
Unlike the noble Lord, I do not think that I received a briefing from
ActionAid this time, so I make a plea, which no doubt will be read
outside, to the charities and lobbyists on this subject that they keep
a full list of the usual suspects in this area and send us a briefing

Foulkes, said that the debate concerned the present Administration and

the Minister will be prepared to say a word or two about the Charity
Commission and its willingness to challenge the charitable credentials
of a handful of black sheep where the charities have spent far less on
charitable purposes than they have received in tax compensation, as has
recently been reported in the press. This Government have taken some
actions in this area already, whereas I think that the previous
Government were less involved. It would also help if the Minister would
indicate whether the Charity Commission needs any technical help with

stage to congratulate the noble Lord who has secured the debate on
doing so and on his introductory speech. On this occasion, I do so with
exceptional enthusiasm. We heard an outstanding speech from my noble
friend Lord Foulkes. As my noble friend Lord Browne indicated as the
second speaker, everything that needed to be said had at least been
referred to by my noble friend Lord Foulkes in his all-encompassing
speech, in which he made the points that were emphasised in subsequent
speeches. We have of course all found other emphases to make and
develop out of the original contribution.</hs_para>

want to return to the opening point. My noble friend Lord Foulkes
indicated that he sought this debate because society is suffering at
present from grossly irresponsible conduct by people with enormous
power. That was reflected, first, in the financial sector and the
collapse of revenues for the Government—something that all
significant nations suffered. That is why every nation has been looking
at how to boost returns to their finance departments or treasuries. One
thing that has stood out in every review has been that the
capacity to raise taxation, certainly against declining production and
the dip in production that all countries have suffered—and this
country significantly so—has meant that government revenues have
been under stress. Therefore, it is not surprising that the emphasis
has shifted somewhat to who is making a contribution to those revenues
and to whether everything is being done to see that fairness obtains.
It is clear that a great deal has been revealed about the immoral 
<?notus-xml column=1306?>conduct of a large number of our major companies, particularly
multinationals. It is immoral not to make a contribution to a society
that provides all the necessary infrastructure for successful
operations and yet seek to deny to that society the resources that
sustain these essential
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:10:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Foulkes emphasised, it is ordinary people who have been paying the
price of these collapses, not those who have awarded themselves huge
bonuses in both the financial sector and at the top of industry. This
has created such a disparity in income as to produce an unfair society
in very dramatic forms over these past few
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:10:41"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
essential, therefore, that we seek to recreate a fair society, and that
means the Government need to act. If ordinary people are paying the
price in lower wages, in lost jobs, in reduced public support for
people on low income and in young people having great difficulty in
obtaining a start in life with a job, it is essential that we ensure
fairness in society, not only in the burdens but in the
contributions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:11:27"></hs_TimeCode>.

noble friend Lord Browne identified one dimension of the unfairness. It
is not only advanced countries that are suffering because of the gross

multinational companies have come to the fore. There has been not only
a series of revelations at a parliamentary level in this country but,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer—the only speaker until the
last intervention from the coalition Benches—emphasised, the
Americans have taken a clear lead in this field. Not only is there the
examination that has been going on in Congress for more than a decade,
to which the noble Baroness referred, but, as is now appreciated,
President Obama has been effective in taking an early lead in striking
bilateral arrangements with countries to ensure the essential

Americans were greatly concerned about Apple when they discovered the

number of my noble friends. Companies want to sustain their
reputation—they make their sales on the basis of how they are
thought to provide services by the public—and we know the
assiduous amount of effort and colossal resources that companies put in
to burnishing their reputations. That is why Starbucks felt obliged to
make a belated contribution. However, this is tokenism: it is not the
response of a major company to the obligations it has. As my noble
friend Lord Browne emphasised, given the obligations that it has, it
will not do for it to make a token contribution when it has been
exposed and therefore fears that there has been damage to its
reputation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

identification and enforcement with regard to tax to ensure that these
matters are dealt with fairly. My noble friend Lord Watson referred to
the progress that is being made in Europe on this front and he

identification of what was going on in the Liechtenstein bank accounts

Newby:</Member></B> My
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:19:58"></hs_TimeCode>, I begin
by thanking the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, for initiating this debate.
It is a very important subject and this is a timely point at which to
be discussing it. I reassure noble Lords that despite the tenor of the
debate, the vast majority of UK taxpayers do not avoid or evade tax.
They pay the tax that is due and they pay it on time. However, some do
not, and that is what we have been discussing today. The economic and
social consequences of tax avoidance and evasion are not insignificant.
A number of noble Lords referred to the tax gap, which is estimated to
be around £32 billion, in total of which the amount due to
avoidance and evasion was estimated in 2010-11 at £19 billion.
This tax gap exists everywhere, and it is rather lower in the UK than
it is in most other countries. Furthermore, it has been falling over a
period both before and since this Government came to office, but it is
still significant and too
big.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000190">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:22:08"></hs_TimeCode>
a number of noble Lords have said, the money that we are not collecting
in taxes is money that we could be spending on services, something that
I am sure we all wish we were able to do. The social consequences of
failure to collect the right amount of tax are in many ways as
significant as the economic ones. Many individuals and companies up and
down the country are honest and pay the tax they owe on time, and it is
not right that they should shoulder the burden for those who dodge or
completely evade their responsibilities. It generates a huge sense of
unfairness and anger, and erodes confidence in the tax system. At a
time when the Government are facing tough spending decisions, it is
even more important that the right amount is
collected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:22:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has a moral dimension. Failure to pay tax that is reasonably due
weakens the bonds that hold society together. I also accept that while
there is a moral element to this, there are some companies whose moral
compass is, by common consent, lacking. This has been attacked in a
number of ways. The Companies Act 2006 lays on directors a range of
duties that go beyond fiduciary ones. It is a statutory obligation for
directors to have regard to the impact of their company on society as a
whole. In my view, sometimes they put less emphasis on that than they
do on some of their other duties. However, they already have this
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:23:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

translate our moral outrage into effective action. Before coming on to
what the Government are doing, I will take up a comment made by my
noble friend Lady Kramer about a potential kite mark, and the remarks
made by a number of noble Lords about the effect of consumers. There
are some things that consumers can do more effectively and quickly than
government, and it seems that some of the actions that have been taken
against some well-known companies have had more of an impact in a
matter of days or weeks than anything that government, with the best
will in the world, could do in the same 
<?notus-xml column=1309?>length of time. I do not have a suggested kite certification body, and I
do not think that such a body should come from government, but it is a
good idea that should be
pursued<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:24:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government have a strong track record on tackling both tax avoidance
and evasion. That is demonstrated, for example, in the 33 changes to
tax law that have been made since 2010 to close down numerous tax
avoidance loopholes, and illustrated by the 1,560 individuals who have
been prosecuted for tax crimes by HMRC since then. We have shown a
similar willingness to confront those who try to hide their money
offshore. Some 50,000 taxpayers have already come forward in response
to all the offshore disclosure facilities, of which Liechtenstein
disclosure facility was the first. To date, these have generated over
£1 billion of tax in penalties and interest, and in the years to
come there are many billions more to come from that relatively narrow
source. That activity reflects a wider transformation in the way HMRC
now tackles avoidance and
evasion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:25:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000194">Since
2010, some 1,000 additional staff have been deployed to tackle
avoidance, evasion and criminal attack, and to cut back on tax debt. I
shall deal head-on with the issue of how cuts to the overall HMRC
budget have reduced the focus and effort being put into this area.
Nothing could be further from the truth. One of the main reasons it has
been possible to cut both the budget and the staff at HMRC while
increasing effort and resource in this area is that the way people pay
their taxes has changed. A huge number of companies and individuals
used to pay their taxes using paper tax forms, but now virtually no one
does. That has enabled HMRC greatly to reduce the number of people
whose job was essentially to manage bits of paper. I do not know if
there is a figure for it, but the amount of paper that goes through
HMRC is a very small fraction of what it used to be. It means that we
have already been able to allocate around an extra £1 billion to
this area. So in answer to the first of the questions the noble Lord
put to me, I can say that I am pretty confident, indeed very confident,
that HMRC has the resources to tackle this issue more effectively than
it did in the past, and we have said that we shall look at whether
there is scope for putting more resource into it in the future.
However, there is something to consider with regard to further
resource: you cannot do it too quickly because we are talking about
highly trained staff if they are going to be effective. We have put in
a lot more and we are keeping the position under
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:27:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

HMRC, the noble Lord asked about it cutting deals with big business. He
was concerned about that. The settlements he referred to were reviewed
independently by a judge and found to be satisfactory. However, HMRC
has put in place robust new assurance and governance rules for settling
large cases, so I think that some lessons might have been
learnt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:28:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000196">In
the Budget, we vowed to do more to tackle avoidance and evasion. We
announced the signing of major new automatic exchange agreements and
disclosure facilities with the Isle of Man, Jersey and Guernsey, and I
shall come back to that later. We also announced the introduction of
the first general anti-abuse rule, 
<?notus-xml column=1310?>which will shortly be legislated for through the Finance Bill. This will
target effectively the most abusive forms of avoidance and provide a
strong deterrent against using such schemes in the first place. Is it
strong enough? We shall see when we review it. Is it something against
which the last Government set their face? Yes, it is. I would not want
to get into too much retrospection, so let us leave it at this: having
made the case in your Lordships’ House for an anti-abuse and an

Laundering sets standards on anti-money laundering and these issues.
The FATF standards are at a high level and are implemented at EU level.
EU action is driven by the money laundering directives, a new one of
which will be negotiated this year. The standards on beneficial
ownership place the requirement on countries to ensure that there is
adequate, accurate and timely information on the beneficial ownership
of companies, which can be obtained or accessed by competent
authorities. Member states are now implementing those standards. The
Treasury is working with BIS, and BIS is currently drafting a
discussion paper on corporate transparency, which includes beneficial
ownership. This will be published over the summer. The measures agreed

concerned with these matters have been promoting the multilateral
information exchange for a long time. There has been the most
extraordinary acceleration of activity in this area in recent months.
The key starting point—the stone, if you like, that started the
avalanche—was, as noble Lords have pointed out, the US Foreign
Account Tax Compliance Act, which requires non-US financial
institutions to report extensive information on US customers with
accounts overseas to the US authorities. The US is saying, “We
want to know from you what our companies and citizens have in your back
accounts”. This has been in operation for only a relatively
short
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000200">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>
an example of how that standard has really become an international
norm, I will go through the following year. In June last year, the UK,
France, Germany, Italy and Spain agreed a model information exchange
agreement with the US to implement FATCA. In September, the UK and the
US signed an agreement on that model. In December, the UK announced
that we saw it as a new standard and would look to build on it
ourselves and internationally. In January, the 
<?notus-xml column=1311?>Prime Minister announced that tax transparency, including this, would be
a priority for the G8. I confirm that it is. In February, the Isle of
Man agreed to a FATCA-type regime with the UK. In March, Jersey and
Guernsey agreed to the same thing. In April, France, Germany, Italy,
Spain and the UK agreed to develop and pilot multinational tax
information exchange based on the FATCA model and we made it clear that
that was our priority for the May council. Last month, the overseas
territories and Crown dependencies made a commitment to join the pilot:

is hugely significant. It means that, for the first time, places that
have become a byword for tax avoidance will be required to make
information available to other tax authorities. Also in May, another 12
European member states agreed to join the same process, while the
European Council supported the creation of what it calls a new global

and the problems that they face in not being able to collect the tax

that. One is that we do our bit to make clear what is happening in
those countries in relation to multinational companies. That is why we
support the extractive industry transparency initiative and why the EU

helping those countries themselves improve the efficiency of their tax
collection. HMRC has been putting money into support for the tax
administrations in those countries. In Ethiopia, where we have been
doing it for a number of years, tax revenues have risen by as much as
40% in a year. In Zambia, to which the noble Lord referred, although we
are committed to spending £235 million between 2011 and 2015 on
reducing poverty, we are also committed to building their tax
collection capacity, and HMRC has been supporting the Zambia Revenue
Authority to build its own tax collection. Obviously, the quicker they
can raise their own proportion of tax, the less reliant they will be on
aid. In the Budget, we announced a programme of capacity building,
which DfID and HMRC were going to promote in many of those countries. I

Luxembourg, and others talked about Liechtenstein and the Cayman

new point that I want to finish on, for which I give credit to the

great apartheid debates we had and how the boycotts really had an
effect in South Africa. The noble Lord, Lord Brooke, made a plea to
NGOs to keep us briefed. Perhaps a collective of NGOs could get
together and produce a list of companies that they feel are the most
outrageous and that we ought to avoid. That was very encouraging. We

One-third of private renters are now families with children. What is
alarming is that for so many of them, short-term tenancies are the norm
and they keep having to move. Government research shows that renting
families are nine times as likely to have moved in the past year as
families who own their own homes. We know what sort of dislocation
there can be for families with children if they have to move, and how
it affects their schooling and their general well-being. Rents in the
private sector are rising and eating savagely into household finances.

given a number of examples. Let me just cite one. Oxford City Council
is a Labour council and an example of good practice. It has a planning
application for the development of about 900 homes at Barton West,

housing in an area where there are housing shortages. However, Oxford
City Council has also identified land outside the local authority area
in adjacent local authorities, which are mainly
Conservative-controlled. It is finding it very hard to get the go-ahead
to develop the land because the Conservative authorities do not want
more housing there. Perhaps the Minister will have more information on

want briefly to mention the difficulties of under-occupation. Yes, of
course, there are people who are under-occupying their homes. For
owner-occupiers, it is easy. They sell and move to a smaller property,
make money in the process and someone else gets a larger property. That
is easy for owner-occupiers, but we have an entirely different system
for those who are in public housing. Now that they have the bedroom
tax, families will have to move, but they have nowhere to move to,
because there are not enough smaller units available for them to move
to—at least, not without a move, let us say, out of London into

remind the House of the dislocation to families and children if they
have to move to different areas and different schools and have to make
different friends. It can be very upsetting and
can damage schooling and the happiness of the family. It is not
surprising that there has been a rise in homelessness. Statutory
homelessness is increasing, and local authorities are under pressure to
find temporary accommodation to stop families having to sleep on the
streets. Of course, that is a temporary measure, and councils have had
to put homeless families in hotels and bed and breakfast
accommodation. We know that a number of them are breaking
the law because they are leaving 
<?notus-xml column=1316?>families there for longer than the six-week legal limit. A large
proportion of local authorities are now in that

long debate about social welfare at the moment, the benefits cap should
surely take account of differences in housing costs from one region to
another. We know the enormous differences between London and the
south-east and other parts of the country. Shelter has demonstrated
that local authorities which cannot source emergency housing in their

away.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000229">I turn
briefly to the situation of young people looking for housing. It is
bleak for them. There is a massive housing shortage in properties that
would be suitable for young people. They are increasingly priced out of
buying or renting a home of their own. That is a struggle for people
from all walks of life and particularly difficult in London and the
south-east. From personal experience, I talk about mortgages and easy
or difficult lending. Many years ago, when I got a mortgage before the
first house that I bought, my wife and I had to demonstrate that I was
asking to borrow only two and a half times my salary, I could borrow up
to only 70% of the equity of the house and I had to produce an
employers’ reference that I was good for my salary and was not
likely to be fired quickly.</hs_para>

in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:54:18"></hs_TimeCode> more recent
years? Mortgages went up to 120% of equity and 10 times the salary. It
is no wonder that we had the terrible crash and the housing bubble. The
danger is that we are moving back again. If borrowing money to buy
houses is too easy and there is no increase in housing stock, it does
not take an idiot to realise that prices will go up. That is what has
happened in Britain over many years. Unless there is an increase in
supply, making borrowing easier does not help. It may help the lenders
of the money, but it does not help the people who want to be housed.
That is why I am worried that the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s
Help to Buy scheme—it has gone through a number of different
names—will be no help at all if there is no significant increase
in supply, but it will help some people who want to be second-home
buyers. That is a sign of
inequity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T13:55:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000231">In
a more general sense, I say this about owner-occupation.
Owner-occupiers in our country have managed to make enormous capital
gains through holding a property. I have benefited in that way. It is
quite unfair that the process of owner-occupation in our housing market
has led to enormous increase in inequality in this country. Okay, I
cannot sell my house and move into a tent, but, at some point,
somebody—a family or whoever—will benefit from that. It
seems quite unfair that that has happened. It has happened partly
because financial services have made it so easy to borrow, and the
danger is that we are going back there. Of course I want people to be
able to borrow money for their homes, so there has to be a balance, but
the danger is that if the money is too easy to come by, there must be
more houses, otherwise prices will
rise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000232">Of
course, we all know that on top of that, there are significant
north-south differences in this country. We have much greater housing
stress in London and the 
<?notus-xml column=1317?>south-east than elsewhere. The trouble is that in the parts of the
country where houses are incredibly inexpensive, there are no jobs.
There is no economic base, so there is no demand to live there because
people cannot earn money. I know that because I am lucky enough to have
a home in Cumbria, but looking at the property prices in the Cumbria
coast in places such as Workington and Maryport, I can get you a
three-bedroom house for less than £100,000—in fact, for
quite a lot less than that, but there are no

north-south differences are important, because they affect our
perception of housing and what should be done to help. There is another
problem, particularly in London and the south-east. If it will be
increasingly difficult for relatively poor or not very well paid people
to live—I am talking about the C2s and Ds; about people who keep
many of our public services going; about local authority workers,
cleaners, nurses, other NHS staff and teachers—or they cannot
find anywhere to live, how are those services to be continued? It will
be very damaging. It is all very well saying that you can get these
people at the moment, but it is getting harder and harder for them to
find somewhere to live. They do not earn enough to buy into the housing
market, and they cannot get accommodation. I find that a very serious
situation indeed.</hs_para>

do something to make more housing available so that we have a proper
social mix, and so that various jobs can be filled. I know that we have
people from other EU countries who come here, but some of their housing
conditions are intolerable and they do it only temporarily while they
try to keep their families going in their home country. That does not

construction programme has knock-on benefits throughout the economy in

seeing a generation who are finding a decent home of their own out of

Whereas I welcome, up to a point, making the planning system more
efficient—there are arguments against it as well—that

forward. Fundamentally, I believe that we need to get local authorities
building again—and if not local authorities, then local
authorities in tandem with housing associations. We need to ensure that
we can develop a proper public house-building programme. That would
give people an opportunity and boost the economy. I am afraid that I
missed some of the discussion in Questions today about garden
cities—I apologise, but I was working on this speech and I did
not switch my screen on in time to hear what the Minister said about

Griffiths of Burry Port:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to be
part of this debate. There was a very impassioned debate earlier this
week in this House. When 538 people voted on Tuesday, I was
not able to because I had to attend a rather important and
long-standing event in the North of England. However, the passion that
I heard on Monday and the sense of urgency expressed again and again
from all the Benches around this House is something that I would wish
to conjure up for the issue before us. I wish that we could sense the
passion that is invested in this question of housing and feel the
urgency for meeting the needs that are undoubtedly there.</hs_para>

speaking in such a debate, I am surrounded by people who are experts in
their field, who have been or are in government and who have run big
organisations and the rest of it. I come to most of the debates in
which I speak in this House simply as a hands-on operator—a
street-level worker. I work in communities with people; in their
surgeries, Members of Parliament frequently refer some of the cases to
which the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, has just mentioned to people like me.
I must thank the noble Lord for bringing this matter to our attention
today on two grounds. First, he gave me a respectable excuse for
leaving the conference for which I was in the north of England, since I
prioritised being here and, secondly, because of the importance of the
issue before
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0001.htm#13060650000241">Over the
years, I have been involved in meeting housing need in a variety of
ways. I have served as director of two or three housing associations.
For a while, I was responsible for a day centre in west London at the
time when, as some Members of the House may remember, local authority
housing was being exchanged and dealt with for political purposes in
the City of Westminster. An awfully long shadow fell from that. I was
also part of the London homelessness network of organisations meeting
housing needs, largely but not entirely for the street homeless.
One-to-one referrals have also been part of what I have done.</hs_para>

is starting to build up again. What do I see in the part of London
where I live? There is lots and lots of building going on. From the
roof of my house, I think I have counted eight large cranes, busily
building for the future. Someone is investing in the future, which they
think is rather rosier 
<?notus-xml column=1319?>than the present. What kind of building am I talking about? First,
obviously, there are premises to house the burgeoning businesses coming
to what they call Silicon Roundabout. It is happening all around us
with the start-up companies and their technology, and it is good to see
that business in this sector will bring new life to the community I
live in. Then there is student accommodation. There are large amounts
of it with, we have to say, its limited usefulness. Nevertheless, I am
glad for the students. Then there are hotels of various kinds. The
final category is that of luxury flats.</hs_para>

sails—that is what they look like—on the roundabout, with
these luxury flats in them boasting at street level that their prices
started at £750,000. A building that once belonged to the
Methodist church just the other side of the roundabout, and which we
sold in 1989, is selling its luxury flats at roughly the same price. I
see all that building and none of it would I really object to, as long
as there were certain other things happening in the world of
construction. What I do not see is a real and systematic programme to
build affordable and social housing, although there are some units. Do
not get me wrong: there is a policy in the inner city to make it a
requirement on developers to put a certain percentage of the units into
what are called affordable categories. However, even that does not
begin to scratch the surface of the need of which I am aware.</hs_para>

indeed, a Member of your Lordships’ House. Why not? We find
scholarships and financial help for them at university. We try to open
up some kind of new future for them. Sometimes, when I push them,
asking them to consider things they had not even imagined before, they
come back to me and say, “Why should I bother? Even if you help
us with £1,000 or £2,000, we will still have to incur

within homes, security, well-being and health automatically flow. I do
not see why we cannot see that; it is a no-brainer. The eight
millennium development goals have preoccupied me for the past 15 years
or so, and I have always wondered why housing—a shelter, a roof

share concerns and indeed many views about how to address them. I know

now it is rising again at our weekly surgeries—not particularly
because of the welfare reform changes, which I suspect are yet to bite
really seriously, but more because of the economic situation in which
many people find ourselves. In my ward we have, for an outer London
Borough, a relatively high proportion of social housing. Much of the
ward’s housing was built in late Victorian times. When I first
became a councillor in 1974, much of that was privately rented, by
predominantly older people. As they moved

provided to meet the demand. I was struck when the noble Lord, Lord
Dubs, referred to Harold Macmillan’s commitment in 1950 to build
300,000 houses a year—obviously as part of the post-war
recovery. Remarkably, although I am not sure why, I still have a
boyhood memory from the 1950s of hearing the annual announcement of how
many new houses had been provided. I do not know why, but clearly it
was of far greater significance then than it is now, otherwise as a
child I would not have been aware of such things.</hs_para>

agree that, on coming into power in 2010, the coalition Government
faced both a housing crisis and a financial crisis—not really
the best circumstances in which to reverse a trend of 30
years or more. For the Liberal Democrat part of the coalition, tackling
that crisis is a very high priority. I am sure that that is equally
true for our coalition partners. Our priorities in tackling it may be
slightly different but nevertheless the determination to tackle it is
the same, and perhaps the combination of the two different priorities
may turn out to be more effective. I assume that the Minister will
elaborate on the many measures that the coalition Government have
already taken to tackle the crisis—investment in affordable
homes, investment to support the increasingly important private rented
sector, tackling the scandal of so many empty homes, Help to Buy and so
on. Much has been done, in spite of the very difficult financial
circumstances, but there is much more that we could and should be doing

the nation’s GDP. This is a measure strongly supported by pretty
well every organisation involved in any way with housing as well as by
all political parties in local government. Indeed, most recently the

each of the 32 London boroughs. As I heard this only last night, I do
not know to what extent it is correct, but it is what the big
housebuilders believe. As a localist, I am clearly not calling for
central government intervention, but it seems to me that local
government should be talking with the bigger builders about this issue,
especially in London where London Councils plays such a useful role in
representing all the London boroughs. It is right that local
authorities should be able to decide for themselves but, speaking as a
London borough councillor for 39 years and a council leader for 13 of

face a worsening housing crisis due to a very serious lack of public
investment over recent years, the absence of a long-term strategy and,
more recently, the financial crisis. As my noble friend Lord Dubs said
in his excellent speech, around 230,000 new households form annually,
but in the 12 months to March 2013 there were fewer than 102,000 new
home starts. Housebuilding has dropped to its lowest level since the
1920s. Housing completions in England fell from 175,000 in 2007 to
115,000 in 2012, an astonishing 34%
drop<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>. Instead of
proposing credible ways of reversing this decline, the coalition
Government reduced the budget for the provision of affordable housing
by 63% in the 2010 comprehensive spending review. That is the
biggest single cut to any capital budget right across

Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000274">We

all the main political parties acknowledging this housing crisis, the
lack of a political solution suggests that the Government have not
fully grasped its scale. The first fundamental policy change that is
needed is a shift from subsidising rents to capital spending. Housing
benefit is currently costing £23 billion a year. That
is unsustainable and does nothing to address the root cause of the
housing crisis, which is that demand for housing far outstrips supply.
In 1975, more than 80p in every £1 of public spending on housing
was on supply-side capital funding, with only about 20p going on cash
benefits to help people pay their rent. The composition of spending has
changed dramatically since then. At present, for every £1 spent 
<?notus-xml column=1326?>on housing, only 5p is spent on capital funding, while 95p goes on
housing benefit. This is a ridiculously inefficient use of public
resources. Without a rebalance, the Government risk fundamentally
undermining their own aspirations, which I fully acknowledge, for a
housebuilding-led recovery. Perhaps the Minister will comment on how
the Government intend to reach a more sensible balance between capital
and revenue expenditure.</hs_para>

far, their main solution—perhaps the Minister will say that it

allows anyone, not just first-time buyers, to access a government loan

properties, not just new-build ones. The IMF has raised concerns that,
by boosting demand without addressing the supply side, Help to Buy may
actually drive up prices and put home ownership further out of the
reach of most renters. One high-profile City strategist, quoted in
yesterday’s <I>Guardian</I>, said that the scheme will
artificially prop up the market and prevent prices falling to
affordable levels. He said that buyers need cheaper homes, not just
available debt to inflate house prices even further. His quip was,

there is a need to find ways of reducing the large bill for housing
benefit, there has also been justifiable criticism of the so-called
bedroom tax. This was referred to by my noble friend Lord Dubs but I
want to underline what he said. There is concern over the impact and
likely hardship that some households will suffer as a result due to no
fault of their own. Even if a household wants to move, as my noble
friend said, there is often very little prospect of doing so due to the
unavailability of suitable smaller properties. Where people move into
the privately rented sector, the cost to the Government in housing
benefits is simply likely to go up because of higher rents there. Does
the Minister accept that a full evaluation of this policy is needed,
and that, if it confirms that not only are the savings from it
negligible but it is causing hardship to households that are unable to
access alternative accommodation and cannot meet their additional
costs, the Government should then withdraw the

way does not address the real causes of the vast increase in spending
on housing benefit. While unemployment and low incomes clearly
contribute, the root of the problem lies in the failure to increase the
supply of affordable housing, which drives people into the more
expensive privately rented sector. What is needed is a new commitment
to a long-term housing strategy, which focuses on at least a five-year
programme, giving both local authorities and housing associations a
chance to plan their capital expenditure. The IPPR’s recent
paper proposes a new affordable housing grant for local authorities,
with a legal duty to use these resources to improve access to
affordable homes. Its goal would be to increase local authority scope
to get housebuilding going, with a longer term outcome of keeping rents
more affordable, which would, in turn, reduce the cost of housing
benefit. I do not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Tope, who is a

time. They are deeply embedded, with demand outstripping supply for
many years. There needs to be some radical new thinking in Whitehall to
get away from the lack of a joined-up approach across several
departments. We need a medium to long-term strategy with a very strong
focus on supply. For too long, central government has believed that it
holds all the keys—and noble Lords will forgive me the metaphor.
Can we now move towards more local solutions as proposed by the IPPR
and touched on by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, while focusing on making
home ownership a real possibility for the many who aspire to it but
currently cannot 
<?notus-xml column=1328?>attain it? We need to be careful not to neglect those who rent, whether
in an under-regulated private sector or in social housing, which should
be seen as a genuine alternative and not just a fallback for those who
cannot own. Above all, we must now focus on increasing supply to reduce
the unmet need to which my noble friend Lord Dubs has so rightly drawn
attention.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_06_PT_1/966AA6F4D575DB0CBD5B39063F651432C06C4721" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 June 2013">Thursday,

any introduction, formal or informal, the first two questions are
nearly always the same: “What do you do?” and
“Where do you live?”. Sadly, for an increasing number of
our fellow citizens, the answer to those two questions is very simple:
“I do nothing, I am unemployed, and I live nowhere because I am
homeless. I can’t get a job because I don’t have a home,
and I can’t get a home because I haven’t got a

both chair housing associations and our source of information is
broadly common. We know from our individual experience that house
prices almost doubled between 1995 and 2007. In recent years, we have
seen no significant increase in new-build housing. While I note the
Government’s Funding for Lending scheme, the only visible
outcome is the incentive for lenders and the creation of a possible
financial bubble in the housing market. Indeed, the noble Baroness drew
attention to the comments of the Governor of the Bank of England, who
warned against making policies designed to boost the housing market
artificially. Boosting the housing market is important, but we also
want to boost housing

except the Government accepts that social housing providers have a
critical role to play, particularly at a time of austerity when demand

with the number of households in temporary accommodation standing in
excess of some 60,000. Social housing providers accept that they have a

the associations built only about 4,800 houses. That is a fall of
approximately 9% on the previous quarter. However, the really bad news
for those on the waiting list is that completions have decreased. The
reality is that families and individuals are simply unable to access

will talk first about the supply of council housing. Council housing
demand was outstripping supply towards the end of the 1990s. Even the
hardest to let high-rise properties were taken by families in desperate
circumstances. The national figures bear this out. By 1997 the number
of families on housing waiting lists had reached just over 1 million.
Sadly, in the years of the previous Labour Government—which the
noble Lord, Lord Dubs referred to as the next Labour 
<?notus-xml column=1330?>Government—the waiting lists rose to around 1.8
million while the number of affordable homes fell by some
420,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000296">A big
help towards solving this will be the housing investment programme
promised by the coalition Government. Over the lifetime of this
Parliament, the coalition Government are investing to build some
170,000 affordable homes—a much needed increase that will
benefit those most in need. Overall, if this is met—and I
believe it will be—this will be the first Government in more
than 30 years to deliver a net increase in social housing
stock.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000297">With
regard to investment in social housing, investment in the condition of
stock was linked arbitrarily by the Labour Government to ownership and
management models instead of need. Decent Homes funding was restricted
to boroughs able to persuade their tenants to transfer out of direct
council ownership and management, either to other stock transfer or to
an arms-length management organisation, or ALMO. I was a founder member
of Barnet Homes and for many years a director of that company. Barnet
Council took the money and improved the property under the Decent Homes
schedule. Many other local authorities did not want to do this and kept
their housing, so by the end of the Decent Homes programme, more than a
quarter of national council housing had not been improved to meet
government
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000298">Large
transfers of council housing to housing associations, together with a
programme of mergers, have led to much larger housing associations in
recent years. The best of them have developed their governance to
engage and involve their tenants and residents, and this good practice
must be spread across the whole sector. Many of us perhaps come across
housing associations where the governance is not as good as that. When
I, as a local councillor, seek to speak to someone in some of these
local housing associations, the staff have all changed from top to
bottom, and I cannot use the contacts I used when just talking to the
borough housing
department.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000299">One
of the biggest problems faced at the end of the 2000s was the grinding
to a halt of the housing market and the building of new homes. Some
estimates say that there has been an annual shortfall of more than
100,000 properties being built despite the growing number of households
in Britain. Turning around the mortgage market has been a challenge to
reversing this crisis. This was referred to by other noble Lords. The
Government have been innovative in promoting schemes to kick-start
mortgage lending. However, I worry about this policy. It will increase
the prices of homes because the money will be chasing fewer properties,
and this will mean that the properties are more expensive in
London—more expensive than anyone at the lower end of the scale
can afford. It will also mean that if the housing market does not keep
rising, the owners of those properties will have negative equity and
find it difficult to sell them. If there is a shortfall—of 20%,
or the 120% referred to by noble Lords—that risk will be covered
by the Government rather than by the banks, because that part of the
loan has been financed by the Government. That is not a sensible
policy, and I ask the Minister to comment on how we can ensure that 
<?notus-xml column=1331?>this boost to mortgages does not mean a big rise to existing properties

turn to what is called a bedroom tax, which seems to be what we have to
call it nowadays, although it is the extra bedroom in people’s
properties. While there are understandable concerns from
tenants—which I have heard from tenants in my own ward who are
affected by the changes in housing benefit—the debate about
subsidies for spare rooms might be improved, or better understood, if
we were prepared to accept that the Labour Government first introduced
this measure for private sector tenants claiming housing benefit as far
back as 2007. You got the benefit for only the number of rooms that you
needed, so that concept was there before. They did not make any
exceptions to that policy, for example for disability, carers, military
families and so on, which are at least in the present policy. However,
that policy is not quite right and, in particular, while it is all very
well to introduce the policy, it is completely wrong to say, as my
Government did, that it should all come in on 1 April, which it did,
when there are no one-bedroom properties for those people to transfer
into. Such a policy should have been graded in and we should try to
make some exceptions for people who would be willing to live in a
one-bedroom property, if only there was such a property to which they
should be
transferred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T14:59:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000301">On
the impact of universal credit, it is understandable that people, while
welcoming the principles behind universal credit, are nervous about
some aspects of the detail. However, I think I speak for many people
who support the aim of making work pay and making the transition from
benefit to work manageable. Converting benefits to a monthly payment
from which we will ask people to budget sensibly would seem to be a
necessary conclusion. However, if housing landlords cannot continue to
collect housing benefit directly from the Government, we will see that
some tenants, strangely, will decide that their priorities are buying
food and other things rather than paying their rent, and we will get
back to a stage where there are large underpayments of rent because the
money is being paid directly to

I said, we are building 100,000 fewer homes than we need each year.
Over the next 10 years, approximately 230,000 more households a year
will need properties, and we are not meeting demand. As my noble friend
Lord Tope said, there is a housing crisis—but it is not new.
There has been a crisis for a long time, and we have to build our way
out of it. All noble Lords have said this in one way or another.
However, the proposed reforms to planning law to permit sizeable
extensions without planning restrictions are a recipe for neighbour
strife. The idea that you can build over the larger part of your garden
and not have to go through the normal planning regulations, and that
your neighbour will have only a certain amount of time to object, is a
recipe for disaster. Under the present planning system, in my borough
the majority of planning decisions for houses—we are not talking
about big developments—are delegated to officers, so the
resident who needs an extension is already dealt with pretty swiftly.

probably smaller than the people who frame their legislation would keep
their dogs in—should give it up to a lodger or another family or

Hill Housing, of which I was the chairman for a number of years, has
drawn my attention to the impact of universal credit on some of its
larger families who are particularly hard hit. In one case, a single
mother with eight children will lose over £350 a week. She is
desperately worried about what will happen to her and her family.
Housing associations, such as Notting Hill, and councils want to do
more but the cuts in capital funding for new build restrict what can be
built. There are 1.8 million households on the waiting list. Many
private landlords are exploiting the situation by raising their rents
or neglecting to do repairs. Often tenants have to compete with sealed
bids over the asking rent just to get into a home, or have to offer to
take a much longer contract to get occupancy of a flat or house. Can

talked about the housing shortage. That must be a given, particularly
in London and the south-east. In Brighton—where I have cause to
live on occasion—the council is using shipping containers to
house the homeless. That may be considered a solution by some people
but it is not really a solution at all. What is really needed is a
unifying national campaign. We do not need a strategy but a campaign

disappointed and the various interest groups might not always agree but
we need to cut through some of this stuff and get on to build the homes
that people need. If we do not do so, we will be standing here in
15 years’ time talking, as I have done, about the

there but not actually tackling the big picture. We need a big picture

unlike in my time. Without parental help it is just about impossible
for these people to buy in London or in some of our more expensive

mortgages. This group needs government help. Schemes like shared
ownership help quite a few families, and some other initiatives might
help, but I am afraid that for many their only option for the

there will be new thinking in a world where we can create a more viable
private rented sector whereby individuals who want to invest in the

invest in buy-to-let properties are not investing in properties for
people but in investment vehicles and are looking to realise their
capital gains and rental benefits from private houses. They do not care
about the young people, even their own children, who have to pay these
rents. We have to talk about that question. Why is our generation
charging our children such enormous rents to live in houses because we

crisis for poorer people, not only in London but more generally. On 4
March, I asked the Minister in this House what the Government would do
to assist families who face homelessness as a result of the housing
benefit changes introduced last April. I said that it had been reported
that 600,000 households would be affected by the changes, and those
unable to meet the requirements under the changes would get into
arrears and face eviction. The changes involved the so-called bedroom
tax. The Minister, however, insisted that there should not be an
increase in homelessness as a result and that local authorities could
make discretionary payments to deal with any serious cases. It would

tenants in social housing have been receiving letters threatening them
with eviction. This has happened to tenants in Brighton and Leeds. In
Nottingham, Bradford, Portsmouth and other cities, notices of arrears
have been sent to tenants. Housing associations in Manchester and

required. The discretionary fund that the Government have said would

I understand, are £14 extra for an additional room

problem—in my opinion as a former trade union official—is

the debate, it will also have other perverse outcomes. If people are
pushed into the private rented sector, there is the potential for rents
to be higher, which increases the housing benefit bill and the
potential for greater homelessness. There is growing and disturbing
evidence of the potential of this now to have an impact on new
builds—on supply—because of the write-off of bad debt and
the burden of cost being imposed on housing associations and local
authorities. As chair of a credit union myself, and as the noble Lord,

housing starts collapsed from 49,363 in 2010-11 to only 15,698 in

Government’s Affordable Homes Programme, let at 80% of the
market rent, are not affordable in many parts of the country. I would
also point out to the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, that it is a bit cheeky
to claim that the proposal to provide 170,000 affordable homes was
realised as a consequence of this Government’s actions when the
National Audit Office has made the very good point that 70,000 of those

failure to tackle this problem is devastating for many families and,

innovatory forms of funding the housing supply. The Communities and
Local Government Select Committee of the other place was right to
advance a debate that we badly need to have about a housing investment

greater savings than an individual can get on their own. Ed Miliband

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Hanham):</Member></B> My Lords, the
contributions to housing debates in this House always come from
experienced people. It has been an extremely wide-ranging debate and I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for having introduced it because it is
good for us, every so often, to be able to rehearse the issues. I do
not think there is any disagreement between us that we need more houses
and more housebuilding. We are all in accord with that. It would also
be fair to say that it is recognised that this did not start in 2010
and that this is a long, historical problem. It may even go back as far
as Harold Macmillan and his 300,000 houses following the war. We have
never seriously caught up in all that time. We are not going to reverse
history within a decade but there is a general expectation and
understanding that we need to make solid progress where we
can.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000346" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000346">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:38:28"></hs_TimeCode>
recognise at once that housing is inextricably linked to the wider
health of the country. We know that it is linked to the economy and the
financial markets, and leads to confidence in the economy and the
confidence of housebuilders. There is a huge pot here of things that
need to be done to get the bricks built on the ground. This Government
are committed to seeing a major increase in the supply of new homes
where they are needed and wanted. We all recognise that this is a local
problem in many respects. Local authorities know where they need
housing and have in their hands—through their housing
strategies, their local development plans and the arrangements they
come to with developers on what affordable housing is provided under
Section 106 requirements—a certain amount of
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000347" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000347">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T15:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>
need also to provide the confidence that housebuilders need, which is
very gradually coming to fruition. We are beginning to see that
housebuilders are more confident about moving forward. I accept that
the economy has held some of this back but, once again, that did not
start in 2010. I also recognise that the hopes and plans of young
people, families and older households across the country are affected
by all of this. Our aim is also to help people achieve their aspiration
to live in a home that gives them security to plan for their future. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, that there is a particular
problem in London. We are all seeing investment in very expensive
properties that are not immediately available to other people. But I go
back to my point about Section 106: where permission is given for these
rather grand glass buildings, which are then sold off for horrific sums
of money, within that there has to be a Section 106 agreement that
recognises that affordable housing is
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000348" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000348">The
Government are already committed to investing more than £11
billion in housing programmes during this spending review period.
Concerns have been raised 
<?notus-xml column=1341?>about a bubble being created by giving help to the private
sector—if only. If there were a bubble of anything we would be
quite grateful. We have to ensure that the movement is there and that
housing continues to be provided in all sectors: social housing,
affordable housing, the private rented sector and assistance with
mortgages. The Government are doing all of that. One noble Lord said
that we had made 300 announcements over the past three years. That
ought to indicate that we are doing a very great deal to try to ensure
that this sector is motivated and action is
generated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000349">We
believe that this action is starting to have an effect. As noble Lords
have said, we have reformed the planning system to support the delivery
of new housing. There are early signs of progress; for example,
20% more new homes were given the green light in 2012-13
compared to the previous year. We are all trading figures here. They
may come from slightly different angles. I am going to give noble Lords
mine and if they do not totally accord we can argue that out
afterwards. Housebuilding starts in England were 15% higher
in the March quarter of 2013 than in the same period of the previous
year. As the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, said, in the first 18 months of
this affordable homes programme, we have delivered almost 63,000
affordable homes of the 170,000 we expect to provide within the
spending review

large sites programme is already being successful, with investments of
£76.7 million of recoverable loans to accelerate developments,

that I have spoken about in this House before, which is that public
sector land is being released, pretty quickly now, to enable more than
100,000 new houses to be built on that land. Work is starting on large
sites. I drew attention earlier today to Cranbrook in Devon but there
are other examples across the country of larger-scale developments
taking place. Some of those developments, particularly in Cranbrook,
are already completed and people are moving in. So there is an

removal of the cap from local authorities to give them the head room to
provide social housing. It is worth remembering that local authorities
already have £2.8 billion head room within the cap, much of

cavalier about ensuring that it is properly used. The situation is that
there are more than 1 million spare bedrooms in the social housing
sector at present. Housing benefit for the social rented sector is
being paid for accommodation regardless of its size, even when
considered too large for a household’s 
<?notus-xml column=1343?>need. This is really about the fairness of the use of social housing
stock and fairness to people. It is not expected that they should be
forced to move. We expect that some people may want to move. They may
get a job or increase the hours that they are working, while some may,
for example, take in a lodger. However, by and large we do not think

briefly go through some of the questions. I think I have covered some
of the points that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, raised in his excellent
introduction. He said that the welfare benefit cap should take account
of different rent levels in different parts of the country. Average
earnings, by definition, determine the level of the cap. People receive
benefit according to the cost of the property they are in. We think
that there has to be a maximum level of support which benefits will
pay. Indeed, it is good to note that in the past couple of days the
party in opposition has at last been able to recognise that welfare
payments have to be controlled in some way.</hs_para>

Dubs, also raised the issue of Oxford City Council. This is a matter
between local authorities, but it is perfectly possible now for local
authorities to have developments that go across 
<?notus-xml column=1344?>boundaries. The Growth and Infrastructure Act enables developers to
submit major planning applications and, as I say, they can straddle
local boundaries if the will is there. It may be that there is a bit of

referred to housing for older people. I know that a number of very
influential reports have been issued recently. The National Planning
Policy Framework requires local authorities to plan for a mix of

Hannay of Chiswick:</Member></B> My Lords, the report of the European
Union Committee, <I>The EU’s Global Approach to Migration and
Mobility</I>, otherwise known as “the GAMM”, which is how
I shall refer to it during this debate, was published as long ago as 18
December 2012. It would be normal to deplore the long delay in bringing
this report forward for debate and, indeed, it is deplorable as a
general proposition, but in this case the overall context of the public
discussion of migration issues has changed so much in the intervening
period that one could regard a debate now as of greater topicality and
value that it would have been earlier. I am bringing the report to your
Lordships’ House for debate in my capacity as chair of the EU
Sub-Committee on Home Affairs, Health and Education which conducted the
inquiry.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060650000372" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000372">The
debates taking place in this country and across Europe on illegal and
legal immigration, the global competition for talent and access to
social welfare and other benefits by migrants are, rather like
migration itself, not new. They have been taking place for decades, if
not centuries, and Europe in the early 21st century is no exception.
But recently, the tone has sharpened and there is a risk that a
rational and measured discussion of complex issues will be drowned out
by cries of populist outrage riding on the back of the stress caused by
recession.</hs_para>

that the EU today is home to approximately 23% of the world’s
estimated 214 million international migrants. This makes it second 
<?notus-xml column=1346?>only to North America as a destination region. Within the EU, however,
there is a mixed picture. More than 75% of non-EU nationals living in
the EU are in one of the five largest member states: Germany, Spain,
Italy, France and the UK. What proportion of these migration flows is
made up of illegal migrants is, of course, difficult to determine.
Estimates in 2008 placed the figure at between 1.9 million and 3.8
million in the EU
27.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000374" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000374">The
catalyst for our report was the publication by the European Commission
in September 2011 of a communication setting out the EU’s
general approach to migration and mobility in the period ahead and
proposing four pillars of activity: on legal migration; on irregular
migration; on asylum; and on development. Our report emphasised that
the EU has limited legal competence to act in this area, although many
of the decisions continue to be the responsibility of member states.
The treaties of Maastricht, Amsterdam and Lisbon and the incorporation
of the border-control-free Schengen area into the EU framework support
this shared responsibility. None of the witnesses—I emphasise
“none”—nor our report itself pressed for any
change in that division of responsibility. The committee’s view
was that, given the current and prospective demographic challenges
facing Europe—and they are really quite severe—EU member
states, particularly those with skills shortages, need to be flexible
in the operation of legal migration from third countries in order to
secure economic growth and competitiveness. For the EU, or for any of
its member states, to lock itself into a long-term, restrictive posture
on immigration could be a costly
error<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000375" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000375">I

of responsibility to the EU of the management of the scale of legal
migration is beyond any political horizon I can envisage. It was
interesting that neither the Commission officials from whom the
committee took evidence nor the members of the relevant committee of
the European Parliament had a different view. This conclusion is borne
out by the current varied situation, with very high levels of
unemployment in some member states, but signs of skills shortages in
the EU’s largest economy,

the biggest preoccupation in the UK is with stopping irregular migrants
from reaching these shores in the first place. Although the UK, as an
island nation, has opted out of the Schengen area and many aspects of
its legislation, it plays an active role in the work of FRONTEX, the
EU’s external borders agency, and in the development of EUROSUR,
a networked border surveillance system. Our report concluded that it is
in the UK’s national interest that these operations are
efficient, effective and well resourced; that was, in fact, the
conclusion of the national security strategy that the coalition
Government brought forward shortly after they took
office<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:06:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060650000377" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000377">It is important to note
that the majority of irregular migrants in the EU actually enter with
authorisation—that is to say, they enter legally—and they
then overstay 
<?notus-xml column=1347?>their visas. With this in mind, EU member states should consider, we
believe, a more balanced and comprehensive approach to overstayers,
including the selective encouragement of legal migration channels. One
example is that of EU mobility partnerships. These are voluntary
agreements where the third countries in question discourage irregular
migration and improve their border controls in exchange for EU
financial and technical assistance. Another example is that of EU
readmission agreements. These are also voluntary agreements where third
countries help to facilitate the orderly return of irregular
migrants in exchange for assistance and possibly better visa
facilitation arrangements for their nationals. In the
committee’s view, it is regrettable that the Government, in
their response to our recommendation that they should opt in to all
these EU readmission agreements, stated that they prefer
to,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13060650000605" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000605">“weigh

basis. However, if bilateral nations were ever to weaken between the UK
and a particular third country, and thus to undermine any bilateral
readmission arrangements we might have, an EU readmission agreement
could well provide a useful safety net. We therefore call on the
Minister to consider joining the EU readmission agreements with Belarus
and Armenia and all the subsequent ones that may be
negotiated—there are quite a few under negotiation
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:08:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060650000378" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000378">The
GAMM is not just about stopping economic migrants from coming to the
EU; it is also about improving the economies in the source countries of
migration. As one of the witnesses in our inquiry put it, “It is
about buying more Tunisian tomatoes”; and reducing the
EU’s trade barriers against non-EU countries could assist the
EU’s aims in the migration context. Furthermore, the EU could
use the GAMM as a framework to carry out projects and programmes to
promote development and mitigate the effects of the brain drain on
countries of origin—for example, by facilitating the cheaper,
more secure and more rapid transfer of remittances from the diaspora,
by supporting microfinance schemes and by engaging with and assisting
diasporas to transfer skills to their country of origin. To carry out
the activities that I have just mentioned, our report suggested
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:09:59"></hs_TimeCode> a more
integrated approach to migration should be adopted, both at national
and at EU levels. Migration policy cannot and should not be the sole
responsibility of an interior ministry, or the Home Secretary in this
country, or of the Commission’s Directorate-General for Home
Affairs. A more holistic approach is highly
desirable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000379" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000379">Previous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:10:28"></hs_TimeCode>
and current British Governments have chosen to exercise the British
opt-out with regard to the majority of both legal and irregular
migration measures brought forward by the Commission in recent years.
So while the GAMM had its genesis in a UK initiative, frequently
forgotten, and enjoyed a lot of early support, the UK’s
participation is looking increasingly patchy. For example, the UK
participated in the first phase of measures to create a Common European
Asylum System, but participated in only two of the five measures
proposed in the second 
<?notus-xml column=1348?>phase. We believe that this partial participation risks undermining the
UK’s influence in shaping these important areas of EU policy
without bringing any commensurate
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:11:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000380" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000380">Looking
to the future, our report called for a full and detailed evaluation of
the GAMM’s different pillars and the EU funding instruments that
support their objectives as part of any continuing effort. Over time,
the committee believes that the GAMM will need to adopt a more focused
approach, concentrating on the EU’s geographical and strategic
priorities, as well as focusing on a smaller number of key objectives
and instruments, which have a sound evidence base. We believe Turkey to
be one of these priorities, especially in terms of tackling irregular
migration, but also alongside more general engagement in tackling
terrorism, transnational organised crime and promoting judicial
co-operation on civil and criminal matters. The recent signs of a
cautious thaw in the EU’s often troubled relationship with
Turkey could provide a mutually beneficial opportunity to make
progress.</hs_para>

final chapter of our GAMM report focused on a specifically UK policy
choice, the Government’s inclusion of international students in
their current policy objective of reducing net migration to the UK to
the tens of thousands per year. My Committee was one of the five Select
Committees of this House and the other place that have now concluded
that that policy is mistaken and whose chairs wrote to the Prime
Minister last January to argue that this has created the perception
that overseas students are not welcome in the UK and risks serious
damage to what is, after all, one of the UK’s most valuable and
successful invisible
exports<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:12:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
latest figures from Universities UK for 2011-12 admissions validate
that concern, with sharp drops in figures from undergraduates coming
from one of Britain’s main higher education markets, the Indian
sub-continent, and a major overall drop in postgraduate overseas
enrolments, one of the most lucrative features of our industry.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:13:30"></hs_TimeCode> could not put
it better than it was put in a letter recently written by a very
academic leader in this country, Professor Malcolm Grant of UCL, who
said, “The flow of overseas students and highly talented staff
has been the life blood of British universities, which are one of the
great success stories still of the UK, and that is a matter which we
all hope to be able to continue to
foster<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000382" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000382">Whatever
the statistical rights and wrongs of treating university students as
economic migrants, and this debate is not principally about statistics,

Government to be handicapping what should be a major growth industry
for us—and it is globally a rapidly expanding market—in
comparison with our main competitors. Again, the latest figures point
towards us losing market share to our major competitors, in particular
to the US. The Government frequently remind us that we are competing in

committee’s report contains a number of other pertinent
conclusions and recommendations. We hope that the Government will
continue to give appropriate consideration to those recommendations. We
look 
<?notus-xml column=1349?>forward to comparing our report’s findings with those of the
Government’s review of the balance of competences regarding
asylum and immigration, for which a call for evidence was published by
the Home Office recently. The Home Office at the same time published a
call for evidence on the free movement of persons.
While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:15:11"></hs_TimeCode> this
concerns migration from within rather than from outside the EU, it is
touched upon in our GAMM report, which notes the ending of transitional
controls on migration from Romania and Bulgaria at the end of this
year. We concluded that the free movement of persons is fundamental to
the structure of the EU and an integral part of the single market. We
also concluded that it would be neither desirable nor feasible to seek
to revise its terms. However, we did support efforts by the Government
to tackle benefit fraud as long as they comply with our obligations
under the treaties. I note that, in part, the immigration Bill
announced in the gracious Speech will aim to achieve this. No doubt
this House will scrutinise that Bill carefully in due
course<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:16:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

plea to the Government. In drawing up the detail of that immigration
Bill, particular care surely needs to be taken to not accentuate
further the chilling effects on the recruitment of university students.
This cannot be an empty risk, frankly, since the sort of issues that
will be addressed—access to health provision and
housing—are just the ones that concern students, researchers,
academic staff and their parents in the countries of origin. I hope
that the Government will take very careful steps to avoid any further
damage to the higher education sector. I beg to

noble Lord, Lord Hannay, on his speech and on the comprehensive nature
of his report. I will refer to only one subject, which he almost
finished on: international students and net migration targets, which is
covered in the last section of the report, particularly the
recommendations and the government
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:17:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

follow up on the debate we had in this House on 31 January this year,
when the subject was well covered. We had 26 speakers, nearly all with
very impressive backgrounds, in one way or another, in the university
world. All were unanimously critical of the impact of the
Government’s immigration and visa policies on non-EU students.
As the noble Lord has just said, there have been five Select Committees
of both Houses which have published their criticisms, along the same
lines, and proposed changes. There is a debate in the other place this
afternoon, of which I was able to watch a bit: all the messages seemed

the widespread understanding, fully recognised in government, of the
huge benefits that international students bring to this country. I will
touch on them very briefly, because they were well covered in our
earlier debate. The economic benefits are not only the contribution to
the wider economy, but to local economies; I understand that the Mayor
of London has estimated that the economic benefit is £2.5
billion in London alone. There are various local estimates in other
university towns. In particular, there 
<?notus-xml column=1350?>are benefits to universities from the fees and other income brought in
at a time when university finances are under considerable pressure.
There is the major export contribution that this sector brings to this
country. It gives our own campuses an international dimension for our
own students. The soft power aspect was well delineated in the previous
debate. Particularly important is the aspect that non-EU students bring
to the postgraduate sector, to which the noble Lord has just
referred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:18:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

students enrolled in UK universities in 2011-12 came from outside the
EU, in that year the figure rises to an astonishing 49% for
postgraduate courses in engineering, mathematics and computer science,
and 31% in postgraduate courses in technology. Indeed, in that year,
27% of postgraduate students in these subjects were non-EU students. A
diminution in the flow of students to these courses would have a
serious effect on many of them.</hs_para>

these points because the public concern about immigration has nothing
to do with postgraduate students coming to this country, contributing
to our economy and spreading the good word about the United Kingdom
when they leave. I do not believe that the public are concerned about
that at all. In so far as they were concerned about some abuses in the
university and further education sector, that has rightly been well

debates reflected two particular concerns: the impact of some of the
actions and procedures of the United Kingdom Border Agency and the

Immigration, in mid-April. It was a most helpful and constructive
meeting. The Minister outlined to us the initiatives he was taking with

Secondly, and much less satisfactorily, we stress that the step that
would make the greatest difference to overseas perceptions would be to
remove non-EU students from the net migration targets in exactly the
way recommended by the report we are discussing this afternoon. This is
where the Government’s response to the Select Committee’s
report is so disappointing. Effectively,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:22:15"></hs_TimeCode>ir response
is

States, Germany, Australia, Canada and many others, are very actively
promoting and expanding their intake of such students, we risk having a
diminishing share of that growing market because of the overall net
migration
target<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:23:18"></hs_TimeCode>. The
total number of non-EU students has dropped for the first time in 10
years. Overall, demand is sustained by rapid growth in the number of
Chinese students, but numbers from elsewhere are declining. One small
indication has just come to my attention of the sort of way in which
actions by the Government, or by UKBA, affect very considerably the
perceptions of individual countries. This relates to
Brazil<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:23:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000396" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000396">The
Brazilian Government’s student exchange scheme, Science Without
Borders, fully funds high-achieving Brazilian undergraduate and
postgraduate students to study at the best universities around the
world, including in the UK. A group of 2,143 Brazilian students who
wanted to come to the UK to study as part of this scheme have been
prevented from doing so by inflexible visa rules. These are
high-achieving students who want to study undergraduate STEM courses,
but they needed to improve their English before starting their degrees.
The current rules prevent their staying in the UK after completing an
English language course. These students would have been required to
return to Brazil and reapply for a new visa before starting their
degree courses. As a result of these rules, and the refusal of the Home
Office to change them, 1,100 of those students are now going to the
United States and 600 to Australia, which are happy to let them come to
study English and then stay for their degree course. Of the original
2,143 students, approximately 43 have applied to come to the UK for
September, and approximately 400 to come to the UK in March 2014. The
value to the UK of the entire cohort was about £66 million, but
as well as lost earnings there is probably a perception that the UK is
not worth applying to among many who otherwise could have been very
successfully received here. I do not expect a response this afternoon

therefore, despite the Government’s pledges, is a different
perception growing in so many non-EU countries? Is it perhaps because
the Government have not tackled head-on, or responded to, the well

reducing net migration to the tens of thousands by 2015, somehow a
reduction in non-EU student numbers of 87,600 between 2012 and 2015
will be required? My noble friend did not respond to that point in the

apologise that I, too, will speak in particular on issues around
international students. I support the view of the report, mentioned by
the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that the Government’s policy
creates the perception that overseas students are not welcome in the
UK. This harms both the quality of the UK’s higher education
sector, as the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, pointed out, and its ability
to compete in an increasingly competitive global market for
international students, especially when we are competing with other
English-speaking

demand for graduates is growing, and many of our economy’s
promising areas rely on the research output, ideas and highly skilled
workforce generated by universities. However, the UK invests only 1.3%

Japan, Korea, Norway and Ireland all have a higher proportion of 35 to
34 year-olds with a higher educational qualification than the

universities in the region, with a worldwide reputation for excellence
both in teaching and research, I agree with the report that the
Government’s target of reducing net migration to the tens of
thousands per annum by 2015 can be achieved only by making considerable
cuts to the numbers of international students coming to the UK. Again,

to visa policy to date have already impacted on the number of
international students hoping to study in the UK. Some universities
have experienced problems with numbers. I am pleased to say that so far
Essex University has not. However, across the sector, visa applications
for study are flat and evidence suggests that the UK is already
becoming less attractive as a destination for study. Universities UK
has called on the Government to remove university-sponsored
international students from net migration targets. I support that call,

international students are temporary, not permanent, migrants, with
strong visa compliance. They are enormously important to UK
universities. One of my most pleasant memories of my university days

are extremely important to the economy, especially the local one, and
to the towns and cities in which they study. A recent report on the
University of Exeter estimated that GDP generated by international

universities create more than 670,000 jobs, directly and indirectly,

Colchester<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
universities are efficient and deliver an impressive return on public

approximately £600 million. They are responsible for

disappointing, however, that they did not agree with our recommendation
to opt in to the family reunification directive, simply asserting that
it is not in the UK’s interest to do so. It would be very

comments yesterday that the Government are very much aware of the
problem of overstaying. Can the Minister give his views on the approach
to handling this problem, both in terms of those migrants here now and
those who will arrive in the future? I was sorry that the Government

tools for the EU’s external migration policies. Yet, so far,
only one of these partnerships has been evaluated and that evaluation
was close to worthless. In my long experience of evaluation reports, I
have rarely seen one that was so inadequate, so amateur and so directly
misleading. The evaluation’s conclusion that the Moldova
mobility partnership had been “a clear
success” was not supported by the evidence adduced and was
directly contradicted by the evaluation’s account of
its own shortcomings. The general sloppiness, lack of rigour and
misleading conclusions regarding the Moldova mobility
partnership evaluation matter. The EU proposes these partnerships as
the key mobility and migration tools. If they are to be the key tools,
they should not be progressed without a grown-up evaluation framework
being built in to them from the very start. The Government surely have
a role to play here, if only to prevent a further waste of

Government’s disagreements or qualifications in their response

this matter and I am sure we will hear more from other speakers. The
Government rejected the recommendation that international students be
removed from the public policy implications of the Government’s
policy of reducing net migration. The reason given in their response is

there is some implication that I have not spotted in the phrase

friend and the committee on the report, and particularly on Chapter 6
on the development impact because I think that that is the most
difficult area of all. However, I, too, shall concentrate today on
students, which although last on the list of contents is perhaps the
most urgent topic and therefore justifies a second or third

we have heard, the Government are sticking to their view that they must
tighten their grip on immigration but that genuine students continue to
be welcome. I shall examine that paradoxical statement again in a
moment, but I recommend the Government’s response to the Commons
BIS committee report, which is a good summary of the position. It
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13060650000583" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000583">“The

may be welcome as a statement of intent but it hardly corresponds to
the situation at present and it shows that wishful thinking is being

answer to the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, I think that Universities UK
may have lost the narrow technical argument on definition, because the
international UN definition has to apply. Nevertheless, it should go on
making the case that students are not migrants but visitors, and that
they must, as far as UK policy is concerned, be treated entirely
separately. The words of the committee on this
are:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13060650000584" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000584">“We

a favoured destination—remembering that we start with a huge
advantage as the home of the English language—has already taken
a blow and we have to redress the balance. Relatively few students
become overstayers and the number who reside permanently is negligible,
perhaps 1%. I urge the Government, yet again, to recognise the
importance of foreign students to our future international diplomacy as
well as to a business which has been valued at at least £8
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:45:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

MacGregor, has said, one area of disagreement is the discrepancy
between the HESA figures for applicants versus those for entrants. The
Government cannot claim that the numbers of non-EU students are going
up because while the HESA figures show an overall increase,
Universities UK has shown that these are inflated by new entrants from
previous years. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has also made that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:45:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000427" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000427">At
another level, there is the difference between universities on the one
hand and colleges and language schools on the other. UKBA
understandably came heavily down on the colleges because most bogus
students came from that sector but, having eliminated the bogus
colleges, they are continuing to come down on the genuine ones which
have proper accreditation. A high proportion of non-UK students used to
come from these colleges and this number is fast
decreasing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:46:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000428" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000428">As
the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, added, language schools are also an
important sector feeding in to higher education. We want to keep those
students but they are also suffering. Language students who want to
pursue their courses are told to go home and reapply, which of course
drives many of them elsewhere because there are plenty of welcoming
arms. The Home Office must surely by now have seen the knock-on effects
of its tier 4 visa
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:46:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000429" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000429">The
Minister already knows that I intend to raise some of these concerns
with him next week. He has kindly agreed to see me in relation to the
position of South London College, which has suffered no less than an
80% fall in its tier 4 recruitment in the past 18 months, including a
100% loss of all of its Indian students. I mentioned in our previous
debate that I am on the advisory panel of a related college in Nepal
which has several links with colleges in the UK, and I am well aware of
the drastic effects of visa control on applications all over the
sub-continent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:47:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000430" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000430">After
the number of Indian students fell drastically last year by 23%, the
Prime Minister had to make what one might call a coalition statement
during his India trip in February. Perhaps he was prompted by the Mayor
of London, who regularly has strong views on this subject. He said that
this country welcomes Indian students, even though on the evidence we
were turning them away. I am not denying that the majority of these in
the past had failed the new tests but, judging by the evidence I have,
it seems that many more genuine students are being turned
away<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:48:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000431" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000431">I
can understand the Fresh Start group and others raising concerns about
immigration—it is a big concern—and the Prime Minister is
steadily moving towards their position. The latest Conservative Party
bulletin that I have seen shows how hard it is working to avoid
becoming a “soft touch” among its supporters. I accept
that the UK, in this as in its foreign policy, is punching above its
weight because it is a net importer of migrants and we have a high
number in proportion to our population. However, this must be seen as a
positive and not a negative. Britain has built up an international
reputation for receiving migrants. What would have happened to so many
of our Nobel prize winners who came here destitute in the 1930s and
since if they had been turned away, refused visas or denied
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:48:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

reduce absolute numbers and the events in Sweden are a current warning
to all of us as to what could happen in the EU. However, I repeat, we
must not make students and our reputation suffer because of our
immigration
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:49:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000433" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000433">I
said last time that colleges which had passed all the eligibility tests
and had acquired the correct certificates were still being harassed,
and this remains the case. The UKBA or its successor even requires them
to act as agents and informers, opening files and reporting on the
movements of students as though they were potential enemies of the
state. The BIS Committee, Boris Johnson and many others have already
made the point that current controls on student migration are hitting
our exports hard, and we cannot afford to lose our status
internationally when so many other countries are increasing their
numbers of
students<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:49:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, it is good news that the Chinese are sending more students,
and it is also good that completing PhD students are being allowed to
stay for up to 12 months after graduation, and that more MBA graduates
will be allowed to remain. The Minister may well be able to give us
more examples of how the present trend can be
reversed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

committee’s other conclusions, although this is a vast subject
that we cannot cover today. I agree that while the Government make
obeisance to the wisdom of the EU’s global approach, the report
describes it as “too diffuse” and recommends that the
Government should co-operate still more closely with Schengen and some
of the useful European agencies such as FRONTEX. Again, the threat of
opting out, as in the European arrest warrant and the whole of the
justice sector, seems to be an important part of the Conservative
Party’s solution to its internal troubles. One wonders what
price it ultimately will pay within the coalition. Many people would
like to see more genuine participation in Europe and less of what the
Government call “exercising influence on decisions” of
other EU members. We cannot get away with that attitude. I urge the
Government to pay more attention, for example, to implementing as well
as signing and ratifying the trafficking and domestic worker
conventions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:51:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

programme and the gateway programmes, I recall that the UK was one of
the slowest to co-operate with UNHCR’s excellent resettlement
work. Can the Minister tell us what the current position is? What is
the annual UK resettlement quota, and will the Government use one of
the UN or EU programmes to accommodate the 600 Afghan interpreters, to
whom we owe such a lot?</hs_para>

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome
the opportunity to debate this report and I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Hannay, and his colleagues for their work and insights. I want to shift
the focus away from education a little and draw on my local knowledge
in Derby and Derbyshire to look at what paragraph 71 of the report
refers to as the “valuable role” played by
“voluntary and private sector” in what it calls
“civil society” in helping to formulate and implement
policies of integration. As we know from other debates in the House
this week, integration is the great issue of our time. It needs careful
work both face

framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:52:51"></hs_TimeCode>. For

welcome that, and I want to give an example of what I am involved in in
Derby, with voluntary groups and civil society trying to lead
integration—some of the good things and some of the problems we
face—and ask whether the report might point in directions that
could be helpful to us. With colleagues, I have been involved in
initiating something we call “Growing Communities” in
Derby. As the provision of welfare and local authority investment in
care systems and the social fabric of our city have been withdrawn
through the cuts, I have convened a group of faith leaders, voluntary
groups and the local authority to see how citizens can work together to
grow communities in the city, using our various resources, initiative
and ingenuity. As the report recognises, we bring to this good local
knowledge, face-to-face contacts and a realistic assessment of what
might be done so that integration is acted out between real
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:54:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

examples of things we are doing that are particularly affected by
migration into our city and our need to handle it creatively. Tomorrow,
we will hold in Derby Cathedral a food summit, as part of the
preparations for the G8 meeting. This is not just about the IF campaign
and global hunger, it is about hunger in our own city. One of the
things that will happen at this food summit is the launch of an
integrated and co-ordinated approach to food banks. Over the past year,
there has been an enormous increase in the demand for them. This is not
just from the normal homeless people on the street, this is from
families who, by the end of the week, do not have enough money to buy
food to feed the children. Many of these families are from migrant
communities. We are trying to create a co-ordinated response around
food banks from voluntary and faith groups, to include a proper
integration strategy, which will involve many needy migrant
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:55:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000439" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000439">There
is a second thing that we are trying to do. We have a great influx of
people from eastern Europe, especially Roma people. Their young people
not only have language problems but also find it very difficult to
integrate. It has been the faith groups, especially the churches, that
have set up youth and evening activities and provided resources and
space for young people, first to get integrated among themselves as
Roma and then to begin to connect with others in the
community—local, face-to-face and on-the-spot
integration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:55:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000440" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000440">I
could give lots of other examples but those are just two: hungry
people—migrants who have no work and no resources—and
young people who are finding it very hard to not just seek security in
their own little grouping. However, what we are trying to do
is essentially reactive. There is no clear frame for us. We are trying
to work with the local authority, and it is trying to work with us, but
grants are given and they end after the year. There is a lot of
confusion. A lot of good work is done and then does not bear the fruit
that it
might<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:56:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

by what I am afraid is a frighteningly buoyant and developing industry
in our city, which the report mentions, that of human trafficking.
Sadly, we were in the papers for a case last year. There is an enormous
demand for prostitution, not just in our city but in many cities. This
is an issue for government as well as for those on the ground. This is
not a nice, free sexual market for consenting adults, it is women and
girls being traded in an oppressive, abusive and wicked way. Just in
the past two weeks, my colleagues on the ground have told me that a
busload of women have come down from Manchester. They are not put on
the streets anymore, they go into brothels, because it is below the
radar. After a few months, they will probably be bussed on somewhere
else. It is seriously and highly organised crime, which is abusing
migrant people and women—most of them brought in illegally, I
suspect—as part of a terrible industry that many migrants get
drawn into, including as pimps and organisers of this kind of work.
That creates an atmosphere in cities such as Derby and others that
makes it very hard for us in those areas trying to create integration
and good healthy relationships. It creates a dark side, especially to
the night-time
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000442" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000442">Through
our efforts in civil society, we can deal with the surface issues, such
as people who are hungry or young people on the streets plainly needing
to be better integrated. However, we cannot deal with the highly
organised professional international crime of trafficking, with rogue
landlords or with the pressures on schools that come and go. Roma
people, especially, keep moving and you cannot make very good
calculations. There needs to be a bigger frame for those kind of
things. Although civil society is a very neat phrase in the report, in
my experience on the ground, civil society means really a ragbag of
resources struggling just to make some little impression on integrating
legal and illegal migrants into a human kind of
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>. Civil
society has to be recognised as needing to be involved in a much richer
and more detailed framework locally. We are trying to work on that, but
Governments must take a lead in requiring local authorities to work at
these frames and tap the resources of people, money and energy that are
there to deal with some of these
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T16:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000443" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000443">I
want to end by asking the Minister about a couple of things. Do the
Government have any further thoughts about access to public funds for
vulnerable people such as trafficked women and those who are perhaps
below the radar of official migration? It is very hard to draw these
girls and women out through our support groups if no public funding is
available. Our resources are very
limited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000444" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000444">Secondly,
in my experience of working with these oppressed women, the police and
border agencies tend to crack down on them, the victims, because they
can get hold of them, and not on the pimps and perpetrators. We have to
be much more energetic in trying to crack down on the people who
organise this terrible crime.</hs_para>

macro issue, which we see in Rochdale and all over the place, about
prostitution becoming a highly organised and profitable industry for
many people, and migrants being drawn into that and trafficked into it
across Europe. Certainly, the great majority of the people drawn into
trafficking in 
<?notus-xml column=1361?>our city in the past two or three years are from eastern Europe. We have
to work across the European Union on this, and we must take a bolder
stand and not just allow a kind of free market in this kind of

spent a lot of my political life in London, I tend to look at a lot of
what we do from a London perspective. Yesterday at a lunch I sat next
to a retired Permanent Secretary, who was reminiscing that when he was
working as a civil servant, London’s population was 8 million.
The population now is 8 million, approximately the same as it was in
1961, and indeed in 1931, but as he recalled, when the population was
falling in the 1960s and 1970s, we thought the world was going to come
to an end; now we think the world might come to an end because it is
getting too
big.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000450" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000450">Of
course, concerns about London reflect concerns about students. I am not

confidence of our business community is affected by the difficulties in
this area to do with process. The concerns among people to whom I talk
about immigration are often as much about process as they are about
policy. One hears examples such as, “My clients decided not even
to bother to try to get visas for particular people to come to work in
this country. They are just going straight to Frankfurt”. I
think that my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones will speak about tourist
visas. That is one concern that the London business community has drawn
to my attention and, no doubt, to that of other noble Lords. It
mentions that the UK has improved its position in its overall
competitiveness as a tourist destination from seventh to fifth in the
recent WEF rankings, but we have dropped 24 places in the
competitiveness of our visa requirements. We have slipped from 22nd to
46th. London First comments that competitor destinations are doing
better at forging relations with new high-value tourism markets, such
as China, with Paris, for example, attracting between five and eight

clear to me that a lot of policy is driven by the effectiveness or

difficult to suggest that discretion should be applied to immigration

assess information is very important and does not seem to be in
oversupply in the entry clearance system. I have no idea the result

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by
congratulating the members of Sub-Committee F on this very interesting
and challenging report. Until a year ago, I had the privilege of being
a member of the Sub-Committee so should have known that a committee
chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and with Michael Torrance as
his clerk would produce a report that was rigorous, evidence-based and
clear. I found myself applauding much of it, particularly the actions
that could be taken to help speed up the economic development and
increase the political stability of source countries. Yet as I read the
report, an element of doubt crept into my mind and it is that element
which forms the basis of my remarks today.</hs_para>

debate” is an appropriately measured phrase. In my remarks today
I am seeking to be similarly measured because this is an issue that, as
the 
<?notus-xml column=1364?>noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said in his introduction, can all too easily be
hijacked by groups for their own purposes, some of which are not
altogether pleasant.</hs_para>

statistics. Today the population of the United Kingdom is just over 63
million. For the record, England, with a population density of
383 people per square kilometre, has just overtaken the
Netherlands to be the most densely populated country in Europe, leaving
aside city states such as Monaco. England is now the sixth most densely
populated country in the world after Bangladesh, Taiwan, South Korea,
Lebanon and Rwanda.</hs_para>

is just the beginning of the challenge that we face. As I said, our
population is just over 63 million, but the mid-range projections from
our Office for National Statistics suggest that the UK’s
population will reach 70 million by 2027, 15 years from now.
That is an increase of 7 million people. What do 7 million people look
like? The city of Manchester has 500,000 people in it, so think
14 Manchesters. The larger Manchester conurbation, including
Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford, Stockport, Tameside, Trafford
and Wigan, has a population of just over 2 million. So, to house this
increase in population we may have to build the equivalent of three
Greater Manchesters by 2027. This increase in population will surely
not be spread evenly across the country. The bulk of the increase may
well take place in the south-east, where we may have to build two of
those three Greater Manchesters to which I am referring. It will be
something of challenge for future government Ministers to explain all
this, not least to those who live in shires and leafy
suburbs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000463" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000463">At
this point, some noble Lords may be tempted to reach for the exemplar
of Thomas Malthus, who in the late 18th century said that at some date
in the future a global famine would take us because of a rising
population. Such noble Lords are inclined to say that Malthus has so
far been proved wrong, and we should not worry about these issues now.
However, we are not talking about Malthus or about some date in the
future but about the output of a respected government agency giving
predictions for only 15 years from now, well within the lifetime of
people in your Lordships’ House
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000464" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000464">Should
we worry about this? I have already referred to our present population
density of 383 people per square kilometre. Bangladesh has about 1,400
people per square kilometre, 3.5 or four times as dense, so we can
certainly fit the people in—but at what cost to the quality of
life? Sir John Sulston, who recently chaired a Royal Society inquiry on
people and the planet, said that our target should not be to cram as
many people as possible on to the planet. He went on to
say:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13060650000590" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000590">“We

particular edge in the context of this debate on the EU is the unique
position of the United Kingdom in this regard. The report rightly
points out that France, with 102 people per square kilometre, is about
25% as densely populated as we are while Germany, with 226 people per
square kilometre, is about two-thirds as densely populated. No less 
<?notus-xml column=1365?>importantly, though, both those countries and Italy have falling
populations. Germany’s population today is 83 million, compared
with our 63 million. On present German trends, that will fall to
between 70 million and 74 million by mid-century. At some point in the
2030s, the UK’s population will overtake Germany’s, and
we will become the most populous country in
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000466">The
question that I have to pose today is this: if these current trends
persist, can we continue to allow the completely untrammelled movement
of labour within the EU without imposing increasing and unwelcome
strains on our civil society? The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Derby touched on some of the first signs of how this issue may pan out.
At the heart of this debate, which is faced by all EU member states, is
the moral significance attached to a particular birthplace. In other
words, does a country or any aspect of it belong to its inhabitants, no
matter what their colour or creed? Do we follow what has been called
the “cruise liner” theory of the nation, in which people
come together temporarily and have no ongoing relationship, or should
the fact of being born in Britain—the accident, if you prefer to
use that phrase—automatically entitle you to your
country’s collective heritage? These are deep philosophical
waters and beyond the terms of our debate today, but they none the less
provide the background against which this report has to be
considered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000467" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000467">On
a more practical level, it is perhaps worth reflecting on why the
UK’s population might be growing so fast. Some may say that it
is about the social security system, which is universal and
means-tested, as opposed to being primarily contributory as on the
continent. It may be, but I rather think that is only a minor feature.
I think there are two more potent forces at work. The first is the
point made by my noble friend Lord MacGregor of Pulham Market about the
ability to learn English. For better or worse, English has become the
world’s lingua franca and, in particular, it has become the
lingua franca of technology, so how better to fit yourself for the
modern world than by coming to the UK to learn English?</hs_para>

anecdotal issue of EU citizens coming quite legally to this country to
undertake work that our fellow citizens appear unwilling to do. Every
Member of your Lordships’ House will have anecdotes about this
and the challenges it presents: this is mine. I have a house on the
Shropshire-Herefordshire border. Every year, thousands of eastern
European citizens perfectly legally come to pick fruit, yet there are
many unemployed people in the city of Hereford and in Herefordshire.
The special and specific challenge that we face is to see what we can
do in Hereford and elsewhere to encourage people to take responsibility
for their financial future and so to give them the self-respect that
will follow. That is why I so strongly support the conclusion of
paragraph 46 that immigration can be no panacea. If it is seen as one,
we risk creating a disaffected, disengaged, sullen minority of what the
late Lord Dahrendorf christened the underclass. If this is true in this
country, how much more pertinent must it be on the continent in Spain,
Greece, Portugal, Italy and even France, where unemployment among young
people seems to range between 20% and 45%?</hs_para>

congratulate Sub-Committee F on addressing this issue. The challenges
of absolute population size, age balance, equality of access to
economic opportunity and the extent to which the UK and the EU open
their doors to all comers are great. As my noble friend on the Front
Bench prepares his reply, he will no doubt be thinking with relief that
this all goes well beyond his brief and pass swiftly on. That is part
of the problem. These challenges affect every aspect of government and
every government department, but they are the responsibility of no
government department. David Goodhart, the director of the think tank
Demos and previously a senior correspondent for the <I>Financial
Times</I>, has recently published a fascinating book on this topic
called <I>The British Dream</I>. He describes himself as a public
schoolboy leftie with an instinctive sympathy for those seeking a
better life for themselves, but he none the less concludes that Britain
has had too much immigration too quickly, that its economic benefits
have been oversold, that it has demoralised the indigenous
working-class population and, most importantly, that it threatens to
undermine the contract between the generations and the consensus on
which our entire welfare state rests. He is writing about Britain, but
looking at his book and hearing on the news about other EU countries,
one cannot help but be drawn to the read-across from the situation here
to that elsewhere on the continent.</hs_para>

uncompromising, unwelcome and unfriendly, and no doubt some noble Lords

real privilege to work on this report under the leadership and
chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. It really has been a good
experience to be there with him on that committee. The second thing I
want to say is that I passionately believe that we in this House,
whenever we discuss the issues of immigration, should never miss an
opportunity to say thank you to all those immigrants who have made such
a fine, positive and desperately important contribution to our life in
Britain and to the life we take for granted. It is true that all of us,
every day, experience it in our families and with our friends when
using the health service and it is true every day when we take our
trains up and down the country. We know that we have received
tremendous benefits in this country from immigration. That is why so
many of us are ashamed of the myopic, cheap opportunism—that
comes from educated people who should know better—of trying to
seize negative emotion and work up passions, where we should be

there was an issue that requires international collaboration and
international policies to deal with the huge issues that arise from it,
it is the issue of migration. We simply cannot solve the issues of
migration as a nation on our own. European co-operation is vital. The

brings me to the issue of higher education, which has been fully
debated today. As we debated it, I could not help feeling that if the

point that I want to make, and I declare an interest because I am
involved on a voluntary basis in three universities in this
country—the London School of Economics, Lancaster and Newcastle.
We talk about the economic consequences of policy towards overseas
students, for the universities themselves immediately and the long-term
consequences for the country as a whole. These are very central issues
for our debate. There is one other point that needs to be emphasised.
The first reality of existence for all of us on planet earth is that we
are totally interdependent, and how history—if history is there
to judge us—will judge political leaders of the time in which we
live is on the success or failure that we make of handling that reality
of international interdependence. I simply do not understand how you
can approach education, let alone higher education, without that
international reality being central to the deliberation in virtually
every discipline being
studied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:31:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000477" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000477">It
is absolutely crucial that in our fine universities—we have some
very fine universities in this country—there is a real, living
community of scholars, not just from these islands but from the world
as a whole. It is going to be the interplay of cultural experience and
of different perspectives that will help students to become educated,
as distinct from trained, and to understand the nature of the world in
which they live and the scale of the issues that confront them. I know
that when I was an undergraduate I was learning all the time from
people who came from very different backgrounds from my own. I greatly
appreciated that. It is true of Britain, 
<?notus-xml column=1368?>but it is much truer of the world as a whole. What we do not emphasise
enough in our considerations about higher education is that the quality
of our universities is related to the presence of an international
community central to their activities. Whenever that is diminished, the
quality of education itself is being diminished. It is disturbing that
current policies are leading to a decline in the number of students
wanting to come to study here, because it is perceived that it is not a
welcoming place and it is not a good place to spend a lot of trying to
get to when you can get elsewhere. That point has to be taken very
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:33:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000478" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0002.htm#13060650000478">There
are a couple of other points in the report on which I want to dwell for
a moment. They have been referred to in the debate. One is the issue of
integration. I was very impressed by what the right reverend Prelate
said about his work and experiences in Derby. It is clear that civil
society is crucial to making a success of integration, but not just
civil society in terms of the NGOs, although they are very important,
but even in the more established parts of civil society, if that is not
a contradiction in terms. The chambers of commerce have a very
important part to play and trade unions have an absolutely crucial part
to play in the issue of integration. But then the NGOs themselves are
vital. As someone who has spent a great deal of my life in NGOs, I
worry that we are slipping into an era in which they are seen as an
extension of public administration to deliver
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:34:38"></hs_TimeCode>. I want
good quality public service and I am sure, therefore, that NGOs will
have an important contribution to make, but that is to miss the point.
In a vibrant society, NGOs are there to contribute to the debate. They
are there to learn from their engagement and experience and to bring to
the quality of the public debate the depth of their experience and what
they are discovering every day, on the front line, with real
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:35:09"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
get the feeling, under any Government in recent times, that the views,
attitudes and experience of the NGOs have been central to the
development of policy on integration in immigration matters. There is a
lot of work to be done on that.</hs_para>

is also important to realise that, if we are talking about successful
integration, we must face up to the pressures on many of our relatively
deprived communities which find themselves grappling with the largest
elements of immigration and the movement of people. This is why we must
make sure that, in areas where immigration is more concentrated than
others, the schooling, hospitals, public services, housing and
employment are given real priority. It is in these areas that the
frustrations build up and the idiots who demean the whole quality of
public debate start deploying their
opportunism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:36:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

say to all our political leaders, please realise that you are never
going to buy off that kind of opportunism. It had to be challenged and
confronted. One has to talk about the values which are central to our
society and in which we believe, and about why, with rational analysis,
we must make a success of this interdependence about which I am talking
and the inevitable movement of people. How can you talk about free and
open markets if there is not to be the movement of people? It is a
fundamental contradiction if you say you have a free and open market
but people cannot move about to follow the

However, we know that it is not currently

offer warmest thanks to our chair for having led us in preparing the
report. I hope that we may have many opportunities to go on discussing
this issue, but not just as a sort of Greek chorus wringing our hands
about it but as part of a process that is making sure that we are doing

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I was quite encouraged by the
direction of government policy on migration last week. I remember
landing a couple of years ago at Stansted Airport; I was coming from
somewhere in Europe—I cannot remember where. It was soon after
the UK Border Agency was formed. I came into the immigration hall,
which had black and white signs saying, “You are about to cross
the border of the UK”. It was menacing. I was afraid. I was very
afraid. It was as if we were there, whether we were British citizens,
visitors or—heaven forbid—“irregular”
migrants trying to come in, and we were going to be found out and that
would be
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

from Estonia, a country that is suffering from net migration of much of
its population. However, we would not want to stop that because, during
its Soviet occupation, the one thing Estonia’s citizens could
never do was to get out. Their great freedom is that they now have
mobility. I came back to Gatwick Airport and, as I came into the
passport hall, there was a pull-up sign that said, “Welcome,
international students”. The only trouble was that I walked past
it without noticing and my wife, who is also interested in these
affairs, had to draw it to my
attention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:39:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lords, I thought this was a very good report, mostly because it is very
factual—it is a myth-buster—and brings out a number of
issues that are important to understand. A couple of them were what we
think of as problems we have with migration; the noble Lord, Lord
Hodgson, was absolutely right in certain areas of his analysis.
However, if we think in terms of refugees and that Pakistan has
1.7 million within its borders, that may put some things
into
perspective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:40:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000486" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060650000486">We
must understand that most irregular migration is the result of
overstays rather than people coming in clandestinely in boats,
aeroplanes or in similar sorts of ways. However, I was quite astounded
by the figure of what the report calls the dependency ratio, which
effectively is the number of retired people in relation to the
workforce, and by the fact that in 2008 that was some 25%—hardly
anything at all—but by 2060 it will have risen to 53%, as
predicted in the UK and
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>. I say
to the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, that perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=1370?>one problem is that without migration we would be building old
people’s homes but with absolutely no one to help us in our
dotage and old age. The way in which that dependency ratio threatens
our future and that of the next generation is a real
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000487" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060650000487">I will
concentrate on a couple of areas. First, something that is often
forgotten but, I was delighted to see, is mentioned in the report, is
the fact that we have two travel-free areas within the European
Union—and indeed they creep outside it. One of them, of course,
is Schengen, but we also have the common travel area which includes not
only the UK and the Republic of Ireland but the islands which are not
part of the EU—although we should remember that Schengen
includes a number of non-EU states as well.</hs_para>

I had not thought about before, but which would be very sensible in
terms of future government policy, would be to try to align the
policies of those two travel areas far more carefully. Whether you are
a tourist, a visitor, in business, a business manager or director, a
high roller or whatever, you have to go through two visa procedures to
visit a country in the Schengen area and the UK and the Republic of
Ireland. That is understandable, but if those visa procedures were
similar or pretty well the same, it would solve many
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:43:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000489" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060650000489">The
other issue was on the readmissions agreements and treaties with third
countries. Again, we as the United Kingdom—whether we just give
the impression that we do it or whether as I believe we actually do
it—try to cut off our nose to spite our face to prove something
in terms of being distinctly non-core EU, while prejudicing and harming
our own national
interests.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:43:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:43:37"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

briefly on the issue that I feel is most important from an ethical
point of view. That issue of the reunification of families is in the
report. I, like my noble friend Lady Hamwee, have received a certain
amount of correspondence about British citizens who are unable to do
three major things these days. First, they are unable to bring their
proper spouse—not one from an arranged marriage—to join
them in the UK. Secondly, UK citizens living abroad who have been
married abroad are unable to come back to their home country, and the
rest of their wider family are unable to enjoy their marriage together
because the partner, who may be non-EEA, cannot come back. Then there
is even the not unusual situation where the spouse outside the UK,
without UK or EEA citizenship, is the person who primarily looks after
the children, who are probably British citizens as well, who are then
also unable to come to the

fundamental British DNA that, as regards a real marriage, under no
circumstances should the state be able to determine that a husband and
wife—or a wife and wife, or husband and husband, or wherever we
get to with the other Bill—should not be able to live together
in family life? That to me is a fundamental, English—probably
British, but certainly English—principle of life that we must
protect, yet we are now failing to do so. That problem will get worse,
as I know from my own extended family. In the next generation, some
members of my extended family are married to Singaporeans, while others
live and work in Argentina. They travel abroad and often meet their 
<?notus-xml column=1371?>future spouses abroad, and these multinational families and marriages
will happen more and more. What we are doing through our migration
policy is saying to them, “I am sorry, you cannot live together
in your country of birth”. All sorts of people are able to do
that, but the thresholds are far more difficult than often we

ancestors migrated from, I think, Denmark around the first millennium

married a spouse of their choice, they were able to reside in Suffolk
for however long they wanted to, and consequently I was able to migrate
to the Celtic nation of Cornwall, where there are no such divisions.

percentage of the leading figures responsible for the crucial
high-water marks and components of our culture, to whom we owe an
enormous debt, were penniless migrants from Europe during a very
troubled century. That essay was recently reprinted in a book called

a matter of soft power. Higher education contributed £8 billion

think that the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, used the word

Indeed, there is a certain evasiveness about it. Technically,

objections of the university sector—that we do know that the
vast majority of people who come to this country to study
courses leave once they have completed those courses. As I say,
technically, there is nothing wrong with the reply, but I
fully accept that it is slightly evasive. It is abstracted

is another aspect of this issue that we in the university sector have
to take into account. The media exposure to bogus colleges has been a
crucial development in the past couple of years, whereby one saw
basically a vast network of Potemkin villages revealed to the dismay, I
think, of the British
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T17:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Even the
university sector itself has not been immune to practices which appear
to be not particularly impressive. I remind your Lordships of the
<I>Daily Telegraph</I> sting in Peking about a year ago, which seemed
to show that one of our most respected business schools was offering in
China diluted qualifications for entry. All these things have an
impact. Within the university sector people will say, “Actually,
if you look at the qualifications of people coming in, they are on
average higher than those of more locally based candidates”. One
could say that the Chinese sting is unrepresentative, but I speak in
your Lordships’ House on a day when we await the
“Panorama” coverage of a sting of Members of this House.
Once these things come out in this way, it is not enough to say,
“We all know that this is unrepresentative and not

established to which we have to respond more decisively than by saying

than the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, was about the Prime
Minister’s remarks in India when he addressed this question very
directly. A lot of the statistics in this area are a little unclear.
The exact extent to which students are discouraged by the fact that
they are included in net migration figures is not clear. There seems to
be a slight falling off of enthusiasm to come to the United Kingdom,
but it is pretty small. What is not in doubt is the very significant
drop of 24% in the number of those coming from India. This was pointed
out by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and the noble Lord, Lord Hannay.
That is the one figure which is not in dispute. There are reasons for
it but it is a serious drop and something which has to be addressed. It
is a very regrettable phenomenon. That is why it was important that the
Prime Minister made it clear in India that genuine prospective
international students are welcome and that there is no cap on 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>numbers. He also made the very important point that there are
opportunities to work for a period during and after study and that the
UK wants and values international students. It was very important that
he spoke in that way in
India.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060650000499" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060650000499">The
truth is that the vast majority of students from outside this country
will make their decisions not on the basis of whether students are
included in the government target but on the quality of the course. All
the evidence shows that. This country is second in the world in terms
of its attractiveness to international students. There is no reason to
believe that that will be challenged but we have to be vigilant. That
is why I was particularly disturbed by the example of the Brazilian

the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said at the beginning of his speech,
migration will be always with us. Anyone who doubts this—they
will not include any Member of your Lordships’ House taking part
in this debate—should be familiar with a study by Felipe
Gonzalez, a former Spanish Prime Minister, who forecast that by 2050
the European labour force would decline by 68 million and that this gap
would need to be filled by the immigration of some 100 million people,
including dependants. This statistic should be read alongside my noble
friend Lord Hodgson’s comments about the impact of population
growth in the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060650000503" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060650000503">Immigration
into the EU is not out of control, as some commentators would have us
believe. In 2008, for instance, legal migrants into the EU numbered 3.8
million. In the same period, those emigrating numbered 2.3 million.
More tellingly, between 2006 and 2007, immigration decreased by 6%
while emigration increased by 13%. It is another popular myth that
illegal immigration forms a large part of total immigration into the
EU—a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and others. In
fact, the largest proportion of illegal immigration is by individuals
who outstay their visa entitlement. Nevertheless, irregular immigration
cannot be ignored. Over the past few years, considerable progress has
been made in tightening the EU’s borders. The so-called weak
point has in recent years been the land border between Greece and
Turkey. However, following intensive diplomatic contact with Turkey,
this has been brought largely under control. However, I visited Greece
recently and was made aware of considerable illegal landings along
Greece’s long coastline. This problem is of course shared with
Italy. In Greece, which has so many problems 
<?notus-xml column=1374?>of its own, there are distressing scenes at Patras, where immigrants are
violently and desperately seeking to get out of the country.</hs_para>

to the four pillars of the GAMM—legal migration, irregular
migration, asylum and development. The report also highlights the need
for the European Union to reach out to third countries to enable both
sides to work towards a consensus on numbers and skills of immigrants
from those
countries.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060650000505" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060650000505">The
establishment of mobility partnerships—the agreement between the
EU and individual third countries—is a constructive first step
in that direction. We must, however, recognise that existing mobility
partnerships are not at present with major third countries. These
partnerships are an evolving process, and much valuable work can be
done with looser, more informal forms of co-operation. These should be
developed with important third countries, leading on to more formal
agreements. My noble friend Lord Sharkey gave us an account of the
evaluation process, and I hope that it is not too frivolous to say that
the department might cut its teeth on the evaluation of the smaller
countries before moving on to the more important ones, which I hope in
the not too distant future will include Turkey. Indeed, the report
makes important recommendations that Turkey and Pakistan, as major
corridors for irregular migration into the EU, should be priorities for
future mobility

a few words about readmission agreements. These are negotiated between
the EU and third countries to facilitate the return to their country of
origin persons who are illegal immigrants. The UK Government have not
participated in all such agreements, and it is the recommendation of
the committee, ably reinforced by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that the
UK will opt in to as many of these as possible at a later stage. The
opt-in with Turkey is particularly important, and it is seriously to be
hoped that the current unrest in Turkey will not prejudice the
effectiveness of the EU’s current relations with Turkey

of the United Kingdom and Ireland put them apart from mainland Europe,
and their absence from the Schengen agreement reflects this—a
point made by my noble friend Lord Teverson. However, we must not lose
sight of the important common practical benefits that we enjoy through
membership of the EU, and here I particularly mention those relating to
law and order. The European arrest warrant and Europol have produced
results which I suggest to your Lordships are not fully appreciated in
this country, particularly by those advocating unconditional withdrawal

database is of huge benefit in fighting international crime, while
under the European arrest warrant the speed with which international
criminals can now be arrested and extradited is also of great 
<?notus-xml column=1375?>benefit to this country. I shall give two examples. It took 10 years to
extradite from the United Kingdom a man wanted by French police in
connection with the Paris metro bombings, while in the past few weeks
Andrew Moran, a notorious escapee from justice in the UK, was arrested
in Spain, immediate extradition proceedings were instituted, and the
extradition has been postponed only because Moran faces criminal
charges in Spain. Therefore, these aspects of law and order are of huge
value to the United Kingdom. I understand that both are subject to
negotiation between the Commission and member states. Your Lordships
may be aware that Sub-Committee F is currently engaged in examining the
implications of the opt-out provisions available to the UK under the

has been said about student visas and I would just add a point about
the competitiveness of higher education in the UK. It is faced by
increasing competition not only from English-speaking third countries,
such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, but from
other EU member states, where an increasing number of universities are
offering courses in English at prices significantly undercutting their
counterparts in the UK. I should not like to give the impression that
on reading the excellent report from Universities UK one should go
straight to the visuals, but there is a significant graph produced by
ICEF in that document which shows that, in a survey by ICEF education
agents rating countries as attractive, in 2008 the UK was top at
71%, followed by the United States at 68%. By 2012, only
four years later, these percentages were 73% for the United States and
64% for the United Kingdom, with Canada, incidentally, showing the
fastest growth, from 49% to a position exactly matching the UK’s
of

sharp fall in the satisfaction rating of the United Kingdom’s
higher education bodies should be a cause of no little concern to the
Government. I would welcome an assurance from the Minister that,
whether or not students are included in the net migration figures, no
bar will be placed on appropriately qualified students to study in the
United Kingdom. My noble friend Lord MacGregor referred to no cap and
this must mean actions, not words, and it must be clear. If this means
an increasing commitment in time and effort by those universities in
the UK that are defined as highly trusted sponsors, so be it. No effort
must be spared to safeguard the outstanding reputation of the United
Kingdom in higher
education.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_06_PT_1/9395C10C8D98F2DEAAA3B914A11191E4D3A82C86" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 June 2013">Thursday,

strong and clear recommendations on the specific issues. I declare a
past interest as an alumna of Churchill College, Cambridge; I worked at
Cambridge University for 10 years and subsequently ran the
Association of 
<?notus-xml column=1376?>Universities in the East of England until I joined your
Lordships’ House. Interestingly, that last organisation did an
impact assessment on universities in the regional economy. It found
that the contribution of international students was significant, and
higher than that of domestic students, because they had to find
accommodation, travel more and remain in the holidays. That is
certainly a point worth

Lords will have gathered that I am yet another speaker who wants to

report refers to the perception that overseas students are not welcome
in the UK. This time a year ago I was talking to a professor at a
highly trusted sponsor university—a member of the Russell group,
not Oxbridge—who had recruited a PhD student in his speciality
in biology, one of the best students, he felt, in the world. The
student had complied with all the university’s requirements and
he had created a financial package that included teaching within that
university. For some bizarre reason, UKBA suddenly decided that that
did not constitute a financial guarantee. There was then a four-month
debate, during which time the professor lost that PhD student to
America. The PhD’s undergraduate university has said that that
is the last time it will recommend that one of its top students applies
to the UK. The professor was absolutely furious. I have raised this
matter in your Lordships’ House before and I know that UUK and
other bodies have been chasing it. However, this is the kind of soft
influence issue that is doing real damage. As we all know, you need

Whitsun Recess in France and it was evident that the French Government
had realised that they had not been able to attract the best
international students because all university courses are taught in
French. There is therefore now a proposal that some courses should now
be taught in English for at least the first year, alongside French
language courses, to help France get back into this competitive market.
Unsurprisingly, the Académie Francaise was outraged, but in
newspapers and on TV, academics and politicians lined up to say that
this market was not open to France while it failed to use English as
the teaching base language for at least the first year. After all, they
said, English is the lingua

academic friend told me that this move has been sparked in part by the
recognition that international students are saying loud and clear that

Staff at universities regard the closure of the tier 1 post-study work
route to be the single biggest factor in reducing demand from
international students. While the UK Government have highlighted that
working in this country after graduation is still a possibility for
students able to meet the criteria, there is real confusion regarding
the new schemes because of their complexity. This has resulted in some
of them being undersubscribed, despite high demand. I return to my

the moment, the General Medical Council is able to provide registration
for all undergraduates—those graduating after receiving a
primary medical qualification from any of the 32 recognised medical

qualification. There are about 160,000 such individuals on the GMC

qualification from a recognised institution in the European Union; they
can then register without the General Medical Council testing their
language skills or their professional competence. In general, that has
worked reasonably well, although there have been incidents where
language skills have been wanting and patient safety has been
jeopardised. Her Majesty’s Government have agreed that under
forthcoming legislation it will be possible in future for the General
Medical Council to test the language skills of doctors who have
qualified and who are registered in the European Economic Area if there
are concerns at the time of registration, or afterwards, about their
language skills—but not their other professional skills, which I
still think is an area of

third category of registrants are known as international medical

have to demonstrate to the council that their primary medical
qualification is satisfactory and that the content of their
postgraduate training meets 
<?notus-xml column=1380?>requirements in the United Kingdom. The GMC is able to make very careful

been raised recently about this category of clinician, specifically
those coming from a third nation outside the EEA who have settled in an
EEA country and then choose to come and work in our country. There the
situation is much more confused because it relates to enforceable
community rights that exist for these individuals. They may have the
right to remain in the European Economic Area but the ability of the
General Medical Council to have clarity in terms of testing their
language and professional skills with regard to registration if they

from outside the European Union without an enforceable community right,
the General Medical Council is still able to treat them as
international medical graduates and look at both their language and
professional skills. However, for those third-country nationals with an
enforceable community right, where their qualification has been
recognised elsewhere in the European Economic Area, that right for the
General Medical Council to test language and professional skills no
longer exists. For third-country nationals who have an enforceable
community right but no recognition of their qualification, those
individuals are still able to seek registration by the General Medical
Council, and the GMC is not able to test language and professional

have seen in this important report, the changing demographics in the
European Union may require us to have to count upon larger numbers of
healthcare professionals from third nations to come and work in the
European Union and in our own country if our healthcare system is going
to be able to continue to meet the demands of an ageing population with
chronic disease. To ensure that the people of our country enjoy the
confidence, at times of anxiety and vulnerability, that the medical
practitioner in front of them, whoever it may be and from whatever
background, has the same skills as any other doctor that they may come
across, there needs to be a single and clear process for the
registration of all doctors in our country and indeed in all other
European nations. It will be important for all member states in the
European Union to be able to satisfy these requirements for their own

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I declare an interest as a
member of the council of University College London and, yes, I will
join the queue. My main purpose today is to speak briefly on and
commend 
<?notus-xml column=1381?>the recommendations of the committee on international students, in
particular the recommendation that international students should be
removed from the public policy implications of the Government’s
policy, as so widely known, of reducing net migration to the tens of
thousands by 2015. We now know well that higher education students
really are temporary migrants. Home Office evidence shows that of those
students who entered in 2006, only 1% had settled permanently by 2011.
It would give us all a great deal more confidence if the e-borders
system was fully up and running and if the exit checks
promised by 2015 were already in place. I hope that the Minister can
confirm that we are at least on target for those exit checks
to be in place by
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000002">Many
noble Lords have, over the past few years, asked a great many Questions
relevant to international students with the aim of removing students
from the Government’s net migration target. We have had debates
in both Houses. In a superb speech, the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor,
mentioned the debate that took place in another place today. The noble
Lord, Lord Hannay, referred to five Select Committee reports, including
a report of the Home Affairs Select Committee in 2011. We have had
letters from chancellors of universities to the Prime Minister last
May. We had an open letter last July from senior business people as
part of a major campaign by London First. However, disappointingly, we
have seen little progress or change in the Government’s thinking
on the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000003">I
sincerely hope, although I am not optimistic in the light of the
Government’s response, that the Home Secretary will finally sit
up and take notice this time. As the committee states, if the
Government genuinely support an increase in bona fide students from
outside the EU, they should make that clearer and ensure that all
policy instruments support that objective. The committee rightly states
that the current policy creates the perception that overseas students
are not welcome in the UK. From a recent education agent survey, we
appear to be becoming a less attractive destination in which to study.
From a briefing which several of us have received from Universities UK,
there are worrying signs that some of the numbers from the Higher
Education Statistics Agency, particularly for postgraduate courses,
seem to show a decline in non-EU
students.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000004">As
many noble Lords have mentioned, we have already seen a dramatic fall
in the number of Indian students coming to study in Britain—24%.
That may well spread to China, with which I am extremely familiar. The
Government seem to believe that they will provide an inexhaustible
supply of higher educational students, but, as my noble friends Lord
Sharkey and Lady Brinton said, the recent survey demonstrates that
there is a growing lack of confidence there as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000005">I hope
that the Government are not tempted to put all their eggs in a Chinese
basket. At the least, it looks as though we are suffering a fall in
market share. The committee rightly believes that such a policy harms
both the quality of the UK’s higher education sector and its
ability to compete in an increasingly competitive global market for
international
students<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T18:29:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000006">Noble
Lords have mentioned the competitors in this field. Canada and
Australia, in particular, are making concerted efforts to increase
their share of the 
<?notus-xml column=1382?>international market and, as we know, Australia has lifted certain visa
restrictions and introduced a much more generous post-study work
option. All in all, the 300,000 overseas students represent more than
11% of our higher education numbers. There have been various estimates
of their contribution to the UK economy, but none of them seems to go
below £8.5 billion. The inclusion of these students as temporary
migrants in the target is not only a risk to much-needed income from
tuition fees for our universities but is threatening our eighth largest
export market. The Government’s response is that they insist
that they welcome international students; nevertheless, they state that
they will continue to include them in their figures on the grounds that
they “have historically included students”. That seems a
somewhat circular argument.</hs_para>

says, rightly, that current policies risk damaging the UK’s
international reputation and influence in the longer term. Educational
links are a vital part of so-called soft power, as a number of noble
Lords have said. The UK is currently the second most popular
destination globally for students. I strongly believe that the
sub-committee is entirely right in supporting the exclusion of
international students from the public policy implications of the
Government’s policy of reducing net migration. They should be
removed from the migration reduction target. I believe that the growth
in overseas student numbers has already been much less than it would
have been, were it not for the withdrawal of post-study work route
visas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060664000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000008">The
Government could still learn from their European counterparts on their
approach to post-study working routes in order to retain the skills and
knowledge that international graduates have gained in the UK. Holland,
for example, operates two processes specifically designed to retain
educated foreign graduates: a residence permit for the purpose of
seeking employment after graduation, and a residence permit for
recently graduated highly skilled migrants. The Government, and indeed
the Minister, may think that we are all a bunch of Cassandras but may I
remind my noble friend that her predictions came true?</hs_para>

tourism, improving the tourist visa application process is absolutely
vital. My noble friend Lady Hamwee mentioned our position having moved
from seventh to fifth in terms of our overall competitiveness, but set
against that we have to look, as she said, at the fact that we have
slipped from 22nd to 46th in the competitiveness of our visa
requirements. A recent report by the UK Chinese Visa Alliance revealed
that the vast majority of Chinese visitors to Europe are discouraged by
needing to apply for two visas—one for the UK and one for the 26
Schengen countries—and that only one Chinese visitor in
10 applies for both
visas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000010">This is
estimated to cost the UK £1.2 billion in lost revenue. I think
that figure is an underestimate but it is set to rise to £3.1
biIlion by 2020, when China is forecast to be the world’s
largest outbound tourism market. While the Government have tentatively
begun to look at measures to streamline the UK application process in
isolation, the biggest improvement would be felt by working more
closely with our European counterparts to encourage more Chinese
visitors to 
<?notus-xml column=1383?>include the UK on their European tour. In this context,
I very strongly agree with my noble friend Lord Teverson on
the absolute imperative to work closely on the administration of the
visa process together with the Schengen countries. That would make a
huge difference.</hs_para>

clear that the UK still wants to attract genuine students,

mount.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060664000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000021">We
have also heard in today’s debate that the impact and
consequences of these messages and complex processes is very evident. A
survey of agents in 2012 by the international Agent Barometer has shown
a drop of 8% in UK attractiveness as a destination for students while
other countries have benefited, with New Zealand’s
attractiveness increasing by 4%, Australia’s by 6% and
Canada’s by 16%. As we have also heard, the Higher Education
Statistics Agency has shown that the number of Indian students is down
by 23%, including 28% fewer postgraduates, the number of
Pakistani students is down by 13%, including 19% fewer
postgraduates, while the total number of postgraduate students is down
for the first time in 10
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000022">Non-EU
students support the provision of many key subjects, especially in
science, technology and engineering, so this decline is worrying. A
thriving postgraduate sector, supported by international students, is
vital for ensuring that the UK remains at the forefront of
international research. The Government could argue that visa
applications for study at higher education institutions are up by 4.7%
in the year to March 2013, but they are still lower than their peak in
2011, and they are applications rather than enrolments. More
importantly, in the recent context of a rapidly growing and highly
competitive international market, the low overall growth over recent
years is likely to equate to a loss of market share.</hs_para>

attractive as a destination of study, while our competitors are making
concerted efforts to increase their market share. Issues of economic
benefits, international students as a source of soft 
<?notus-xml column=1385?>power and our influence in the world have been well argued in debates on
this subject in this House and elsewhere. In this context, I underline
the Select Committee’s recommendation that migration policy
cannot and should not be the sole concern of the Home Office and that a
more integrated approach to migration should be adopted and should
involve ministries such as the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills and the Foreign Office. In his response to our report, the
Minister said that that is the case, but that does not ring true when
you see how different policies are pulling in different
directions.</hs_para>

January this year, I said that now that the Government have dealt with
so-called bogus students, the time has come to move on. Does the
Minister agree that we need to work with partners, such as Universities

we get positive messages across and begin to take some constructive
steps because turning perceptions takes much longer than good stories?
In his response to this debate, will the Minister tell us if the

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I am not sure how I have
offended the powers that be but I speak today as the 17th of 19
speakers, and on Monday night I was the 90th of 91. It does not leave a
superabundance of points to make, but I can make one without any
fear—which is to thank the committee for the work that it has
done. This is an unyielding subject and the report of the committee,
under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, is extremely
useful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000026">I must
declare an interest as having for the past 10 years been
chancellor of the University of Essex, and I will say a word or two
about that later. My noble friend Lady Gibson of Market Rasen is a
distinguished graduate of the university and referred to it. The other
interest that I need to declare is that my firm, Bates Wells
Braithwaite, is heavily involved in the immigration and asylum field;
it has a team of lawyers who do nothing but. Long past are the days
when I could—as I did over 30 years ago—dabble in
immigration. It has now become an absolute forest, a jungle of
regulation, law, precedents and guidance. Indeed, one of the things
that I would like the Minister to contemplate is whether there is any
prospect of clarifying the bureaucracy surrounding immigration. I do
not for a minute underestimate the difficulties. The myriad
circumstances with which the immigration and asylum laws have to
contend make certain that the matter will be complicated, but, believe
me, it is now extraordinarily complex. Of course, it is also
extraordinarily expensive for an ordinary citizen to find out where
they or incoming relatives may stand with regard to it.</hs_para>

about my noble friend Lord Hodgson’s speech. He said that he was
brave. I think that he was in a way, because it is very easy to be
misunderstood in talking the way that he did. I thought that some of
the statistics he produced were totally 
<?notus-xml column=1386?>germane to this subject and reminded us, if we needed reminding, that
there is no more politically hypersensitive subject than immigration in
the country at large. The sensitivity is to some extent built on
misunderstanding, but sensitivity there is. For my own part, I tend to
underestimate the consequences to some peoples and communities of the
downside of immigration. We have heard of the upsides, which are great
and considerable—the noble Lord, Lord Judd, with whom I always
agree, made that point very forcibly—but there is a downside.
When people are competing for scarce, cheap housing and for jobs, we
must not underestimate the potential there for difficulty and worse. So
again, I sympathise with my noble friend the Minister and his
colleagues in all of
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T18:45:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000028">Education
has been this afternoon’s principal theme, which is a measure of
how strongly represented this Chamber is in the higher education and
university world. I will make a few remarks in that regard, although I
will steer well clear of the economic benefits of our universities,
which have been well discussed. I hope not to repeat any statistics,
but I will give a couple that have not been given. One is the striking
statistic that in the <I>Times Educational Supplement</I> world table
of universities we have three of the top 10 and seven of the
top 50. That is an astonishing record when you consider that France has
not even one in the top 50. Similarly, in terms of world university
education, of those who study abroad, the United States has 30%, while
we have 18%—although, as a proportion of the size of those two
countries, we should be top of the pile. Then you have Germany with 13%
and France with

will just say a word about the cultural, or invisible, benefits of the
university sector, to which virtually everybody has referred. I am
proud to say that at the University of Essex we have a higher
proportion of overseas students than any other university in the United
Kingdom except the London School of Economics, which has the advantage
of being in the middle of this great capital city. More than
130 nationalities are represented on our campus. That has
been a permanent feature of the university and I am happy to say that
our numbers have not fallen in the recent two years that we have been
talking about particularly, although there is no complacency about
that—I will say a word about that in a moment. I emphasise to
the Minister—if it needs emphasising—that it really is an
astonishing own goal for us to do anything that impedes incoming
students.</hs_para>

economic advantages are patently abundant, but I think that we
underestimate the invisible advantages. The fact that we have on our
campuses a disproportionate number of brilliant academics from abroad
is hugely advantageous to our students and to overseas students. The
fact that we have a massive enrichment of both educative and social
life by having a large number of foreign students cannot be
underestimated. It adds considerably to the enjoyment—the fun
factor. We must never forget that fun is important in higher education.
If people enjoy their universities, they go away and say, “I had
a hell of a time” at wherever it was. They go back to Greece,
Hong Kong or wherever they are from and say, “I had a wonderful
time at the University of Essex”. That is far more important
than 
<?notus-xml column=1387?>saying that the professor of gynaecology—no, I must not say that
with my good friend, the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, sitting there. We all
know what I am trying to say. The impression of the life that they led,
the fun that they had and the friendships that they made, is, I
suggest, as important as the purely academic side of university life.
So let us hang on to that and, as far as we can, enhance
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000031">I

an important section of the report on that

extremely difficult tension to negotiate in attracting more and more
students to our own shores while not damaging the countries from which
they come. I wonder whether my noble friend the Minister might take
away the thought that he should consult universities to think through
whether we can do both things at once—that is, to have the
advantage ourselves of having incoming bright, if not brilliant,
students, often from extremely disadvantaged countries, and at the same
time to give something back. There may be programmes as yet unformed

I utter a word of caution. Whatever difficulties we have faced over the
past couple of years, the challenges have scarcely begun. The prospect
for recruiting overseas students to our wonderful universities will get
relentlessly more challenging and difficult, because the number of
universities being formed in every country is growing, in some of them
exponentially. In the University of Essex 20 years ago, we had a huge
number of students from Greece. The primary reason was that there were
few Greek universities and there are now many more, and we have many
fewer students coming. That pattern will be reproduced throughout
Africa, South America and the whole wide world. The universities that
exist will get keener themselves on attracting more foreign students to
their shores, for all the reasons we want—economic, cultural,
and so

we need to face the fact, mentioned by some noble Lords, that English
is being deployed even in some French universities. Can noble Lords
imagine what a crisis that must be for France? Teaching in English
offends every French scruple—but they are doing it, and they
know why they are doing it. Every other university in the world will
start to teach in English, if they are not already doing so, for the
same reason. I was in Tunisia in the spring and went to the biggest
business school there, which is going to open elsewhere in Africa. They
are deciding to teach their African courses in English. All those

more and more of our universities are going to want to open overseas

addressing migration of improving the economies of the source countries

questions have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T18:54:37"></hs_TimeCode>
been raised about those responses, and one response in particular,
including by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, in opening the

respond to points made about the Government’s responses. It took
the Government a couple of months to respond to the committee’s
recommendations. It is a pity that it has taken just under twice that

impact needs to be fair for all. Diversity makes our country stronger,
but we need to build common bonds, including more emphasis on speaking
English and effective integration policies and approaches for
communities. We need effective action to tackle exploitation of migrant
workers, which also undercuts local people. That means stronger
national minimum wage regulations, more enforcement with heavier
penalties, and a register to tackle rogue landlords. Proper training
programmes are required to help the young unemployed for the sectors
that are recruiting most from abroad and should be doing more to train

Pulling out of the Social Chapter and out of co-operation on policing
and justice, as the Government appear to want to do, would, however,
make it harder to manage European migration. We 
<?notus-xml column=1389?>need proper co-operation with other European countries to make sure that
migration is not abused. The new Schengen information system will share

More needs to be done to cut illegal immigration and more needs to be

concerns have been expressed by parliamentary committees that
government policy is putting at risk the benefits that university
students bring to the economy, benefits which it is estimated run to
some £8 billion with the potential to more than double in value
by 2025. The concerns are that the growth in university students is
being held back by government policies and the impression given out by
those polices. Figures from the Higher Education Statistics Authority
show that the number of non-EU first-year students at UK universities
is down from 2010-2011. There is also a drop in postgraduate
enrolments. One suspects that these reductions also reflect a drop in
market share in this highly competitive field.</hs_para>

net migration target is not targeting many of the right things. Well
over 50% of the drop since 2010 comes from British citizens: more
leaving the country and fewer coming home. Much of the rest is falling
numbers of foreign students and entrepreneurs. Yet illegal immigration
is outside the target, with fewer people stopped, more absconding,
fewer deported and backlogs of information on cases not pursued. On top
of that, student visitor visas have increased considerably under this
Government, and the independent borders inspectorate has warned that
they are open to abuse by bogus students actually coming here to work.
Unlike full, tier 4 student visas, these visitor visas are not used by
university students and are not counted in the net migration figures.

immigration and student visitor visas, which are excluded from the net
migration figures, appear to be being overlooked by the Government as
far as effective action and control are concerned even if they cause
serious problems. Everything included in the net migration figures is
treated the same, as the Government seek to bring the figure down, even
though it is leading to a squeeze on university students to the
potential detriment of Britain, and highly skilled global experts and
entrepreneurs are adversely affected by the visa delays that deter or
hold them back from coming—visa delays which certainly do not
impede progress in bringing down the declared net migration figure. The
system for legal migration needs addressing as it is subject to
significant delays, including doubling visa delays and long waits for
businesses, asylum seekers, spouses and
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000045">In
its report the EU Committee says that it considers that flexibility by
member states in the operation of the European labour market to legal
migration from

essential to securing economic growth and competitiveness. The report
says that member states should continue to have the right to choose the
number of migrants from third countries they wish to admit to their
labour markets, depending on their needs. I do not think that that view
will be contested, but it highlights the importance of our having fair,
coherent and effective policies, processes and procedures for
addressing the issues surrounding migration. Those policies, processes
and procedures should not, in their application, have some continuing
consequences contrary to Britain’s interests and they should
address all the relevant issues, not just those aspects of migration
and mobility which impact on a net migration target figure that has
been set, while effectively ignoring or failing to address equally
important aspects of migration and mobility which are not reflected in

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach):</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an interesting
afternoon—indeed, evening—spent in discussing a
high-quality report. It forms another chapter in this House’s
dialogue with the Government on migration policy, and if most of the
paragraphs have been on international students, so be it. My honourable
friend Mark Harper has been dealing with a debate on this subject in
another place today. The Government are very aware of the points being
made by noble Lords on the
subject<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T19:03:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000047">I
will begin by congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, both on the
report and on getting the debate today. As I said, it is a high-quality
report, and I congratulate all those noble Lords who participated in
its production. I thank all noble Lords for the strong contributions
made in today’s debates. I have spoken to the noble Lord, Lord
Hannay, about this, and I will, if I may, do as I did in the previous
debate and give a commentary on the debate, taking points made by noble
Lords and giving a proper answer. It is very difficult at the end of a
debate like this to give proper consideration of all the points made.
Of course, in cases where I do not have the information that noble
Lords would want, I will make sure that an answer is sent to all noble
Lords who participated, and a copy put in the Library. I hope that this
will enable me to concentrate my words in the main on the report and on
the reasons we welcome
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T19:04:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000048">There
were some key insights in our debate. One important one came from the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby, who showed us the
consequences of this policy on local communities. It is one of those
important aspects that we have to bear in mind when we discuss systems
and processes: that at the end of the day, policy impacts on people and
on communities. It was good to hear not only of the work that is being
done in his diocese but of the way in which he is aware, and has made
us aware, of the problems that can
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T19:05:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000049">I

of the most interesting speeches came, rather out of the blue, from my
noble friend Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts. We have to accept that we
have a consensus. We are all badged with different political beliefs
and party allegiances, but I felt that my noble friend’s speech
was sobering. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, referred to it as a
challenging speech. It made us realise that there is no room for
complacency in this area, that our policies have to be addressed to the
real anxieties of our fellow citizens, and that we have to draft policy
with that in
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T19:07:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000051">I
turn to the report. The EU’s renewed Global Approach to
Migration and Mobility, which was the principal focus of the inquiry,
was published in 2011. It provided a welcome renewal of the EU’s
external migration policy framework, which was established in 2005
under the UK presidency. As my noble friend Lord Sharkey made clear,
the Government welcomed many of the proposals set out in the
Commission’s communication on the GAMM, including the
incorporation of international protection, alongside existing
priorities, in order to broaden the geographical coverage of the global
approach. The intention is to ensure a more strategic and coherent
approach, to work with third-party countries in the area of migration,
and to enhance links to wider development and foreign policy
efforts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T19:08:32"></hs_TimeCode>.
Alongside other member states, we agreed the Council’s
conclusions on the renewed global approach in May
2012<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T19:08:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000052">Unlike
the EU’s more general approach to migration policy, which
perhaps has placed too much emphasis on legislation and on a common
approach—some noble Lords supported that approach today, but it
is not the Government’s position—the GAMM is
centred on a framework for practical co-operation
between the EU’s member states and third countries. The
Government particularly welcome this focus on practical co-operation;
the pragmatic approach is perhaps part of our political
tradition. Alongside the GAMM’s non-binding and voluntary
character is an approach that allows member states to decide how they
can best contribute to joint initiatives in this area, in their own
national interests and in those of the EU as a
whole.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_06_PT_1/9ED1227F4A7979480A97761153F2625BDB20AB17" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 June 2013">Thursday,

the Council’s agreement, this flexible, practically-oriented
approach has allowed the UK to explore possibilities for working with
our EU and third-country partners under the renewed GAMM, assessing
whether and how we will participate in line with
the UK’s broader immigration policy. The national interest is at
the heart of this decision-making process and, alongside our
migration objectives, the Home Office works closely with
other government departments, in particular the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office and DfID, to ensure that wider home affairs,
security, foreign policy and development implications are given due
weight in deciding when and where to participate in GAMM initiatives. I
think that the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, emphasised that the
responsibility for these initiatives is not just for the Home Office
but is pan-government. Indeed, 
<?notus-xml column=1392?>noble Lords have pointed to the implications of immigration policy for a
number of other aspects of government
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000054">Given
the range of factors involved and the specific considerations with
regard to any given country or region, we make these decisions on a
case-by-case basis, albeit that our decisions are informed by a set of
overarching principles and principally by the Government’s
objectives with regard to controlling migration. Following such
considerations, we have announced our intention to take part in a
number of new initiatives under the GAMM. For example, the Home
Secretary will tomorrow join her counterparts from a number of EU
member states in signing a new EU mobility partnership with
Morocco. The flexibility afforded by the GAMM has allowed us to offer
to work with Morocco in the area of border management, where we feel we
have useful experience to share, rather than needing to participate
across the whole of the proposed partnership. This includes areas such
as legal migration or the portability of social security benefits,
where other EU partners are better placed to lead, or where proposed
initiatives would not be in line with our national
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000055">Indeed,
the UK has remained a leading voice in the development and
implementation of the renewed global approach. We have played a leading
role in the development of the new Silk Routes Partnership, identified
in the Council conclusions on the GAMM as a key strategic requirement
in the EU’s work with key countries of transit and origin. At
April’s ministerial conference in Istanbul, which launched the
Silk Routes Partnership, my colleague the Minister of State for
Immigration, Mark Harper, announced the UK’s financing of a
bridging project for the new partnership, ensuring that momentum will
be maintained on concrete, practically-oriented initiatives in the silk
routes countries ahead of the commencement of EU funding for these
projects in
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060664000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-0003.htm#13060664000056">However,
it will not always be in the UK’s interests or, given limited
resources, within our abilities, to participate in GAMM initiatives.
Therefore, while we continue to maintain good working relationships
with other member states and the EU institutions in this area, and
while we welcome the increased capacity and added leverage provided by
working alongside our EU partners, the Government will always consider
whether it might be more appropriate, or more effective, to work
bilaterally with third countries. For example, the Government’s
policy is not to opt in automatically to EU readmission agreements,
which are increasingly linked to mobility partnerships and other
negotiations under the GAMM. Rather, we will weigh up the benefits of
participation in each agreement, including an assessment of the impact
of such decisions on wider bilateral relationships, exercising our
opt-in where we believe participation will benefit the UK, or where the
UK’s participation will strengthen the readmission agreement
overall. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that these decisions are
carefully considered. This is consistent with the UK’s
case-by-case approach to the application of our JHA opt-in. We believe
that this is right. The noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, mentioned this issue,
as did the noble Lord, Lord Teverson.</hs_para>

right to consider our relationship on a case-by-case
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-06T19:14:50"></hs_TimeCode>. We make

will have an opportunity to talk about family reunification, and my
noble friend Lady Hamwee has clearly worked hard at producing her
report, which will be a subject for debate. The UK did not opt into the
directive because we wanted the ability to set our own family migration
policy. The UK is concerned about the potential for abuse of the right
to family reunification, in particular by third-country nationals. In
view of that, we maintain the view that it is not in the UK’s
interest to be part of the

sense of regulations in this area and make the procedures as
straightforward as possible, that I am the Minister for Deregulation
within the Home Office and I have an extremely good and productive

Kakkar, rightly reminded us of another subject, the contribution of
migrant medical professions to the healthcare of this country. He was
right to mention the debt that we owe to migrants in this country, to
which a number of noble Lords alluded. That is why we do not have
closed borders. We have not turned our back on the talent of the world,
nor do we want to cut ourselves off from the ability to share our
talent through soft diplomacy throughout the

debate has been dominated by international students. Scarcely a noble
Lord has failed to mention them in some way or another. That board at
Gatwick stating, “Welcome international students”, summed
up the Government’s policy. The noble Baroness, Lady Prashar, is
shaking her head. Noble Lords have asked for reassurance on what the
government policy is. I am giving that policy. There is no limit on
numbers. We want to work in partnership with the universities of this
country to build our student population.</hs_para>

whole issue of where the statistics lie is, to my mind, a red herring.
The task is not about the compilation of statistics or even their
interpretation. What matters is the partnership between the Government
and the universities themselves, and going out there in an increasingly
competitive world to get the students from which this country can
prosper here to our universities. The noble Lord, Lord Bew, was honest
on this point. He turned the argument towards the universities to make
them aware of the need to take a positive role in this. It is not
enough to wait for students to arrive. If I may say so, I sometimes
wonder how much the negative talk on this issue by universities has
become self-fulfilling. I wonder about the extent to which the campaign
to get these statistics removed, the use of the association of student
numbers as part of the immigration policy of this country, and the
suggestion 
<?notus-xml column=1394?>that the Government are seeking to reduce those numbers and that that is
part of our migration policy are all false. I think that in many cases
those things have added to the impression that this Government do not

Harper’s commitment is genuine, and it was repeated today in the
House of Commons. I share his enthusiasm for advocating international
students as being of enormous importance to our universities.
Yesterday, I went to a celebration in the Speaker’s residence,
where it was announced that 11 new universities have been recognised by
this Government. We have a valuable—if I may say so, it is
incapable of being valued sufficiently—resource in our
universities, and I think that we make a mistake in arguing that the

calculate the figures for ourselves. However, in terms of public

However, I have a note here on the Brazilian students. I am very

in Brussels on 29 and 30 May 2013. I represented the UK for internal
market and industry items on 29 May and Shan Morgan, Deputy Permanent
Representative to the EU, represented the UK for research items on 30

main internal market and industry issues discussed on 29 May were:
auditing; Single Market Act I and II; smart regulation; industrial
policy; modernisation of EU copyright law; and state aid modernisation.
Outside the chamber, there was a lunch discussion on industrial
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060644000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-wms0001.htm#13060644000051">Council
began with an orientation debate on Commission proposals to regulate
statutory audits. In a full roundtable, most member states were
prepared to accept the principle of mandatory rotation, with some
arguing for a longer period before mandatory rotation, or for a
narrower scope. I intervened on a similar vein to this. Some member
states remained opposed. On non-audit services, all member states
supported the principle of a blacklist only of prohibited services, but
with many stressing the need for the list to be more limited, with some
pushing for alignment with international standards. I agreed with the
principle of a blacklist only, though expressed reservations on any cap
in non-audit services. On a final point on the role of the European
Securities Markets Authority (ESMA) in pan-European audit regulation, a
majority of member states supported the European Board of
Auditors’ Oversight Bodies (EBAOB) solution already proposed by
nine member states, citing cost and independence as key concerns. I
argued this solution was more appropriate and less
expensive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060644000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-wms0001.htm#13060644000052">The
next substantive item concerned Single Market Act I and II, with the
presidency and Commission outlining progress made over the past six
months towards adaptation of the legislative proposals arising from
Single Market Acts I and II. This was an information point only and I
did not intervene. Other substantive morning items included council
conclusions on smart regulation, which were adopted without

lunch discussion focused on industrial policy. Shan Morgan took the UK
seat and represented the UK for the rest of the Competitiveness
Council. The discussion over lunch followed on from discussions at a
dinner the previous evening on the same subject, which I attended. The
main UK messages highlighted the importance of creating the right
environment for industries to be competitive, while questioning
the need to set a 20% target for industry’s share of
the economy. The presidency summed up the discussions in the first
agenda item after lunch, reporting on the consensus of the importance
of reindustrialisation as a means for employment, and that technical
change had opened up various new opportunities which the EU is well
placed to benefit from. There were also comments on the importance of
energy costs and the revolution caused by shale gas in the
US.</hs_para>

agenda item was an exchange of views on the modernisation of EU
copyright law, with the council updated on progress under the Irish
presidency on collective rights management, the Commission updating the
council on its ongoing licences for Europe dialogue, and finally a
presentation by Antonio Vitorino on his recent report on private
copying and reprography levies. There was a general consensus among
member states that the copyright framework needed to be updated to
better suit the digital age and that this work should be based on sound
evidence, guided by the principles of technological neutrality,
promoting legal offers and providing the necessary protections for
creators. Response to the Vitorino report was varied, with the
UK’s view that any work in this area should commence after the
pending European Court of Justice rulings in this area. This was echoed
by many member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060644000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-wms0001.htm#13060644000055">The
final substantive agenda item was a general approach on state aid, with
the presidency presenting the current text of the two proposed
regulations as a finely balanced compromise. Most member states
endorsed the current text, though with some opposing the procedural
regulation. Other member states intervened to seek further detailed
changes, though were not met with much support. In a broader debate on
modernisation, a wide-ranging discussion took place. A significant
number of member states asked for further flexibility regarding the
Commission’s proposed ban on regional aid to large enterprises
in “C” regions. The UK intervened strongly on this point,
and also to welcome the regulations as a useful contribution to
improving state aid procedures, saying that state aid was to be used
only to address genuine market failure. The presidency concluded that
agreement had been reached on the regulations as proposed and noted the
concern of member states concerning regional
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060644000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-wms0001.htm#13060644000056">Several

LeaderSHIP item, where the Commission outlined its communication
considering how to reinvigorate the European shipbuilding sector. The
UK did not intervene, though some did to, for example, welcome the

French delegation, the Commission introduced its proposals to modernise
EU trade defence instruments. In a short discussion, there were

research and space issues covered on 30 May were: EU space industrial

space items, the council adopted conclusions in response to a
Commission communication, “EU Space Industrial Policy: Releasing
the potential for economic growth in the space sector”. The
council took note of a proposal for a space surveillance and tracking
support programme. Under AOB, the Commission briefly presented its
proposals for the funding and operation of the European earth
monitoring programme (Copernicus) 2014-20 (previously known as GMES).
The latest proposal reflected the agreement made at February’s
European Council that Copernicus should be funded from within the
Multiannual Financial Framework (MFF). It would provide a solid legal
base from which to launch the next set of satellites in the Sentinel
series and support the delivery of downstream applications that would
foster economic growth. The Commission emphasised the importance of a
swift negotiation on the regulation in order to ensure that the
programme could launch at the beginning of 2014. The space discussion
closed with a short update from the Commission on work to re-evaluate
the relationship between the EU and the European Space Agency (ESA).
The Commission argued that reciprocal access to the respective
decision-making bodies was essential for the relationship to function
effectively. The UK intervened to insist that the issue of the
Commission role in ESA governance was one that required careful
analysis before decisions could be taken by
Ministers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060644000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130606-wms0001.htm#13060644000065">On
the research items, the council adopted conclusions in response to the
Commission communication “High Performance Computing:
Europe’s place in a Global Race”. These highlighted that
HPC is an important asset for the EU’s innovation capacity. The
council then adopted conclusions in response to the
Commission’s communication “Enhancing and
focusing EU international co-operation in research and
innovation”. The Commission undertook to closely involve member
states in the implementation of multi-annual road maps for co-operation
with selected countries. Council subsequently adopted without
discussion a 
<?notus-xml column=121?>resolution on the advisory work for the European Research Area (ERA).
This resolution agreed that the advisory committee ERAC should be

council on progress in negotiations with the European Parliament on the
Horizon 2020 regulation and associated rules for participation
Regulation. The presidency noted that seven trialogue meetings had been
held with the European Parliament, and that negotiations were now
entering a critical phase if a deal was going to be delivered by the
end of June. It believed that a compromise package could secure an
agreement which did not alter the council’s agreed position on
the reimbursement model. The Commission reiterated the importance of
simplification; this was essential to make life more straightforward
for participants and to widen participation by reducing barriers to

discussion the council reconvened. The presidency concluded without
further discussion that a large majority of member states had
subscribed to its proposal that simplification and the flat rate
funding model should be defended and that in exchange the council could
show flexibility on other issues, such as widening participation, a
fast track to innovation instrument, some ear-marking in favour of
renewable energy research, and stronger support for SMEs. As a result

debate then took place on joint programming initiatives (JPIs). The UK
intervened to underline the strong UK support for JPIs. These were
