Governments of central Asia to promote a stable region. We do, however,
assess that there are a number of challenges to stability in central
Asia, in particular transnational threats, including those from
Afghanistan, inter-regional issues such as ethnic tensions, and
bilateral disputes. We are working with central Asian Governments on a
number of initiatives funded by the tri-departmental Conflict Pool to
help them meet these challenges, and we continue to monitor

agree that security and stability in the strategic geopolitical
priority region of central Asia, including Afghanistan, are paramount.
However, trans-boundary upstream/downstream water issues and disputes,
industrial pollution, population demographics, drawing on limited
resources, the aftermath of the withdrawal from Afghanistan, an
underlying trend of extremism, and hard drug transit along the northern
routes supplying the northern and western markets, all compounded by
areas of poverty and human rights concerns, are challenges and

matters with great expertise and knows the region incredibly well. The
Government believe that to help the central Asian states, the best
thing we can do is help to strengthen their political
institutions  
<?notus-xml column=498?>to improve governance, increase accountability and support the rule of
law. The noble Lord has asked a wide-ranging question and I shall
probably have to write to him in some detail in order to answer it
fully. However, I can assure him that in opening our embassy in Bishkek
in 2012, for example, we are now one of only three EU member states
with embassies in all five of the central Asian states, and therefore
we have the reach that will enable us to deal with some of these
incredibly difficult issues.</hs_para>

As the Minister with responsibility for central Asia and human rights,
I do not think it is a question of either/or. It is important that the
economic foundations of these countries are strengthened. It is
important that issues around poverty are dealt with and that civil
society too is empowered to raise these challenges. In every country
that I visited in central Asia, of course we discussed the potential
opportunities for them and for us, but in every country human rights
was right at the top of the agenda. As the noble Lord said, both
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are countries of concern in our annual

question. These countries are going to be the first to suffer any
consequences of what might happen in Afghanistan in the coming years.
They are already feeling the effects, for example, of extremism. We are
working with a number of countries, both on cross-border support so
that they can secure their borders and in wider work on extremism. A
number of these countries have also played a vital role in our securing

communication, it is also the northern route, tragically, for drug
trafficking and crime. A large amount of those drugs end up in Russia,
but we feel the consequences of these drugs on our own streets. We are
working with a number of the central Asian countries to improve border
security through training, and there are Conflict Pool-funded projects,
for example to train Uzbek customs officers to secure borders in
Uzbekistan and Tajikistan. As I said earlier, we are specifically

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the cost of reducing the additional rate
of income tax is estimated at around £100 million per year. This
takes account of the significant behavioural response associated with
changes in personal tax rates. Details were set out in an HMRC report
published alongside Budget 2012. The Government believe that it is not
efficient to maintain a tax rate that is ineffective at raising revenue
from high earners and risks damaging

that the Government always have a tricky task in maximising tax
revenues, particularly at a time of austerity and when people are
looking for tax changes to be fair. In that context, at the same time
as the Government reduced this tax rate they introduced changes to
stamp duty land tax and anti-avoidance measures on residential property

buying Treasury bills and collecting interest on them. The Treasury was
paying the interest to the Bank, which was then sitting on the

broadly the same scheme, is ensure that that money, which amounts to
some £19 billion to date, has been transferred back to the

looking at that. We are hopeful that as economic conditions improve,
lending to SMEs will increase in any event, but I have been surprised

The Equality Act allows occupational pension providers to ignore the
service and contributions of gay employees prior to 2005 when it comes
to paying out survivor benefits to civil partners. This stemmed from an
original exemption in the Civil Partnership Act that I argued against
at that time. This Bill would see the same thing happen to same-sex
spouses.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062413000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000074">I
will say from the outset that the majority of occupational pension
schemes have ignored this provision and pay out fully to survivors.
They do this because they believe it to be fair and I recognise that
and thank them for it. However, there are those that do not. Their
reason is mostly cost. This is odd, as the Office for National
Statistics calculates that it would cost only £18 million to the
private sector.</hs_para>

the publisher of a magazine with the snappy title of <I>Pensions</I>.
In case your Lordships are interested, I also published <I>Planned
Savings</I>, <I>Insurance Age</I>, <I>The Savings Market</I> and a
statistical compendium called <I>Rateguide</I>. So I am pretty
confident that no pension provider can accurately predict how many 
<?notus-xml column=508?>individuals within a pension scheme will be gay, how many will marry
under this Bill when it becomes law or become civil partners and how
many will outlive their partners, husbands or wives by a significant
period. I am also pretty confident that for the one-third of schemes
that do not pay out, the actuaries who run the numbers probably have
already built in the additional costs associated with this amendment.
Pensions actuaries—and I have met many of them—deal
constantly in uncertainties around the length of life, the possibility
of illness, the number of scheme members who are likely to marry and
many more issues. Given that two-thirds of schemes already do, I do not
understand why we cannot insist that the rest treat same-sex couples
who marry in exactly the same way as heterosexual couples who marry.
They have all paid in the same pension
contributions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000076">I
know from the other place that the Government think that this is a
matter for the schemes themselves. However, in debating amendment after
amendment we have discussed the rights of those who disagree with
same-sex marriages to be able to do so, and we have resisted giving
public servants the right to pick and choose what services they will
give to whom based upon their deeply held beliefs. That is effectively
what we would be doing here with employers and pension scheme
trustees—we would be allowing pension fund trustees who
genuinely believe same-sex marriage to be wrong to have the right to
create two classes of spouses in their schemes. This legislation would
permit it.</hs_para>

with pensions, which are boring and complicated, but some other form of

is nothing. These changes were made for the public sector in 2004. I
ask the Minister not to let the subject matter perpetuate an injustice
into this Bill that is completely unnecessary. It is not a huge
issue—£18 million does not set the world
alight, but it is a kindness that we can give to a few people at the
most difficult time in their life. I cannot demand that the noble

those who have asked me to take up this issue, to take it away and see
if we can do something about it. We should have solved this issue in

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, treating a gay employee less
favourably than a straight colleague under an occupational pension
scheme purely because of the gender of his or her partner, is direct
discrimination 
<?notus-xml column=509?>on the grounds of sexual orientation. This was the conclusion of the
employment tribunal when giving judgment in the case of Walker v
Innospec. Rather than heeding these conclusions and reflecting on the
inherent injustice that this case addressed, the Government have
applied to be joined to John Walker’s case in support of his
employer and pension provider. They also seek to legislate in this Bill
to extend the discrimination so that it applies not just to civil
partners but to same-sex spouses, too.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062413000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000080">As we know, this issue
is not new. During the parliamentary passage of the Civil Partnership
Bill, we considered the position of public service schemes. Initially,
the then Labour Government claimed that benefits under such schemes
should accrue only in relation to future service, arguing against
imposing retrospective burdens. Thankfully, on that occasion the
Government had a change of heart and recognised the need to secure
equal treatment. The situation was similarly equalised for
contracted-out schemes, while the law in relation to the state pension
was also changed to allow civil partners to draw on the contribution
record of their civil partners. These were welcome concessions but,
sadly, the discrimination ultimately banished from other schemes
remained in the case of contracted-in occupational pension
schemes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062413000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000081">That
this inequality remains on the statute book will surprise and sadden
many who believed that the Civil Partnership Act gave civil partners
all the same legal entitlements as spouses. The reason that the
Government have given for extending rather than remedying this
discrimination is a reluctance to impose retrospective costs on pension
schemes. The fact that this discrimination has already been rectified
in relation to public schemes rather undermines the Government’s
objection to retrospection. It is far from unprecedented to take such a
step but perhaps it is the Government’s position that in
relation to public schemes, for which they have more direct
responsibility, the basic demands of equality prevail over concerns
about retrospection. I would argue, however, that the Government should
not only refrain from discrimination but refuse to sanction direct
discrimination by the private sector. This is the principle which
underlines much of the substance of all our equality
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000082">A
society in which the state refrains from discrimination but in which
you can be turned away from a restaurant or hotel because you are gay
is not a fair society. For decades, the love and commitment shared by
gay couples was not afforded any form of recognition by the state.
Prior to the Civil Partnership Act gay couples did not have access to
the legal benefits available to straight couples in so many areas of
life, from property rights to pensions. If this Bill is, as I believe
it to be, about correcting these injustices, why are we relying on
historic discrimination to justify real, ongoing inequality?</hs_para>

argument goes like this. Before 2005 we did not formally recognise gay
relationships, therefore gay couples cannot expect to receive the
benefits they would have received had we awarded their relationships
the respect they deserved at an earlier juncture. Discrimination should
not beget discrimination in this way. It is surely wrong, and against
the whole spirit of the Bill. I

the Joint Committee on Human Rights has said on this and to the oral
evidence that the Minister gave to the committee, where he talked about
wanting to find the fairest place to put same-sex married couples
within the pensions framework. What we have heard this afternoon shows
that this is not the fairest place. I would be very interested to hear

he gave evidence to us, the Minister gave some large sums and made it
all sound incredibly complicated. He talked about £3 billion to

from. It would be helpful if the Minister could clarify why such large
sums are being bandied around. The committee called for a full review
of pension provision in relation to survivor pension benefit
entitlements of same-sex married couples and civil partners to ensure
that there is no unjustifiable discrimination in pension scheme
provisions. What we have heard sounds like unjustifiable

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:22:27"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I rise
briefly to support this amendment. When the Civil Partnership Act went
through, it was interesting to note that employers were already ahead
of the law and that a number of private schemes already recognised
partners. When the civil partnership law was enacted, many more then
did so. It is fair to say that in this House there are people who may
have forgotten more about pensions than I will ever know. However, in
the greater scheme of things, this is not very much money in terms of
the overall pension contributions, yet it means an immense amount to
individuals; those people who are doing all the things that we would
encourage others to do, like being judicious in provision for their
later life. It seems to me wholly wrong that they are not rewarded in

base forecasts on a wide range of assumptions which are not necessarily
proved to be correct. In its report on the Bill, the JCHR also noted:

on the provisions of the scheme, pension rights of same sex spouses may
not be the same as pension rights of opposite sex spouses, which may

has already been noted that the Government are currently fighting an
appeal against the decision to uphold this view in the case of John
Walker. However, if legislation is not amended to take account of the
Walker judgment and the reliance on the European Court findings, it is
likely that further action will be taken by same-sex married partners.
One cannot blame them. They will seek similar redress in the courts to
ensure that they, too, can access pension rights in an equal way. That
would be
regrettable.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062413000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000095">Of

how significant those burdens are is unclear. The House of Commons

the total value of assets under management in the pensions industry it
amounts to just 0.006%—as was pointed out by Mr Mike Freer on
Report in the Commons. I accept that for a handful of small employers
or charitable schemes this may have a disproportionate impact. However,
the Government have accepted that around two-thirds of schemes already
treat opposite-sex marriages

Lord, Lord Alli, and all others who contributed to this debate. I

and as I have said in other contexts and in our other debates on the
Bill, in making it possible for same-sex couples to marry we have
sought to build on existing legislation and not amend the structure of
marriage law. The point is that we focused on allowing same-sex couples
to marry. In the context of pensions, we are following what already
exists for civil partnerships, as has been referred to by several noble
Lords in the debate. The introduction of civil partnerships was, as we
have acknowledged several times over the last few weeks, a fundamental
change in our society. It was a huge step forward. The Act was complex
and covered a wide range of different issues. The Labour Government at
the time decided to provide this exception for defined benefit pension
schemes which are not contracted-out of the state second pension. They
clearly did so for a principled reason: Governments do not generally
make changes to pension schemes retrospectively. That is the general
approach that is taken. That decision was made in 2005 during the
passage of that Bill. The noble Lord, Lord Alli, referred to the
Equality Act 2010 and suggested that it had then been open
to this Government to remove the exception. It is worth reminding the
noble Lord and the House that the Equality Act was passed under the
previous Government. It was not a Bill that we were still debating and
deciding after the election—it predated this

me get to the specifics of the point in hand. I would like to remind
noble Lords listening to this debate who may not have been following it
in detail 
<?notus-xml column=513?>that we are discussing defined benefit schemes and survivor
benefits—quite a specific aspect of pensions. As has been
acknowledged, defined benefit schemes are struggling to survive. They
are decreasing in numbers in terms of how many are still open to new
members. The current economic climate has put companies sponsoring such
schemes under great financial pressure. Clearly, we have to be mindful
of that when we consider adding anything extra to their costs. As
regards survivor benefits and this particular point, it is worth saying
that while the impact of the change that the noble Lord, Lord Alli, is
putting forward might be small for some large pension funds, it could
be quite significant on a small pension fund. We would need to be very
clear about who is being affected by such change.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Alli, and the right reverend Prelate have
acknowledged, some of the defined benefit schemes in existence are very
generous and go beyond the statutory minimum in terms of what they
provide for survivor benefits. That is a matter for those individual
schemes, and the benefits provided by pension schemes are very much
decided by the schemes themselves. Some schemes do not provide survivor
benefits for any members—they are not always offered to
opposite-sex
couples<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Lord, Lord Alli, said that trustees may be able to decide which
rules to apply to survivors based on their own personal belief. It is
important to say that the decision about which rules to apply to
survivors is based on various financial assumptions and not on their
beliefs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000101">It
is difficult to make a detailed estimate of the cost to pension schemes
if this change in different treatment were made, because we do not have
all the relevant data and information. However, using the 2009 ONS
survey and other information, we have estimated that removing this
exception could increase scheme liabilities by around £18
million in present-day values. The noble Baroness, Lady
Lister, referred to remarks that were made by the Pensions Minister
when he was giving evidence to the Joint Committee on Human Rights and
the additional costs that may be effected by changes to pension
schemes. The point he was making was that while there is a specific
cost associated with the amendment that we are discussing today, a
range of different measures fall under the heading of equalisation that
could potentially extend the right to civil partnerships to
opposite-sex couples. That is how you could eventually get to an
estimated cost of £4 billion; it happens as you move from one
thing to the

noble Baroness, Lady Royall, asked about contracted-out schemes and the
estimated cost of making changes to them. The statutory survivor
requirements do not apply to all the benefits provided by the scheme.
Therefore, our conservative estimate is that the direct costs for those
schemes would be in the order of £70 million. If you
add what we estimate for the contracted-in schemes, you get to
£90

has been suggested that the Government should undertake a survey to
obtain more exact information on the potential costs. Although we might
be able to reconfirm which schemes go back before 2005 in terms of
their accruals, obtaining the detailed data for those that do not to
enable us to calculate the costs of removing the exception would be
complex. Although I 
<?notus-xml column=514?>referred to the 2009 ONS survey, the kind of survey necessary to be able
to identify the different schemes that might be affected in different
ways has not previously been carried out. A survey has not been done

be fair, however, regardless of the scale of the cost, the Government
believe that we should not impose the additional unforeseen obligations

funded by the Government, and it was the previous Government’s

with the financial consequences. It was not for the Government to
impose that on other schemes for employers. When all of this was
considered in great detail some years ago, the Government accepted the
costs and liabilities for the public sector schemes but did not feel

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 46ZA I
will also speak to the other amendments that are grouped with it. These
are a bunch of somewhat technical amendments that deal with a very
difficult situation. Until now, if a person was to change their gender,
there was no way in which they could remain in the marriage in which
they had lived until that point. For some people in that situation,
that was extremely difficult because they continued to love the person
to whom they had been married. Some couples, in particular those to
whom their faith was very important, found that the inevitable move to
divorce was wrong. There is a widespread welcoming of the fact that in
this legislation it is now possible for two people in that situation to
remain in a marriage, albeit one that is now
same-sex.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000112">However,
in the process of doing that the Government have, in this Bill, set up
another problem. Previously, under the Gender Recognition Act 2004 and
the Civil Partnership Act 2004, when a person was going through the
process of changing their gender, they could apply for what was known
as an interim gender recognition certificate. A panel would recognise
that they were going through the process of transition, and as I
understand it it was almost like the equivalent of a heterosexual
couple receiving something like a decree nisi because it was one step
towards what would inevitably be a divorce. If a spouse indicated that
they were in agreement with that, the matter could simply go
ahead.</hs_para>

problem arises when a non-co-operative spouse wishes to put a block on
that process. For understandable reasons, spouses may be deeply unhappy
with the situation in which they find themselves, and they can in
effect block the process. I should say that I am 
<?notus-xml column=516?>deeply indebted to the people who have explained this to me at
considerable length, and I apologise to them if I am not putting their
case as well as I
might.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000114">An
important piece of information for me was that a spouse cannot prevent
a person from having gender reassignment surgery. They can only stop or
hold up the process of recognition of somebody in their new gender, but
they cannot prevent them from having the surgery. Therefore, sometimes
when spouses are upset and angry they block the process of gender
recognition. A common way to do that is by initiating divorce
proceedings and then taking no further action so that the whole process
is stopped. That can lead to a lot of difficulty, not least with the
legal recognition of a person in transition, their ability to work and
some aspects of their finances, although not child maintenance

amendments would allow a spouse to maintain a veto—they do not
seek to get rid of the veto—but limit the amount of time over
which it could have effect to approximately six months. This would mean
that a spouse could stop the process going ahead but not indefinitely.
If a person is going through gender reassignment, they can apply for a
gender recognition certificate. If they get an interim certificate,
their spouse is notified and that in effect starts a clock ticking for
six months. If at the end of the six months there has been no action,
the person going through the transition can apply for an
annulment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:45:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000116">The
amendments would do two things. First, they would give a spouse the
right to be notified. I understand that at the moment the first time a
spouse may receive any notification that a partner is going through
gender reassignment is when court papers are delivered seeking an
annulment. These amendments would provide that the person going through
the transition is obliged to notify their spouse of that. Secondly,
after six months both parties would have an equal right to initiate
divorce

does all this mean in non-technical language, and why should we do it?
It would mean that a very difficult and painful situation could be
brought to an earlier conclusion after six months, although in practice
I think it would take about two and a half years, rather than be left
to get worse indefinitely or for a very long period. This measure is
the equivalent of what the Government have tried to do for heterosexual
people in encouraging them to seek mediation and reach agreement
between themselves as far as possible rather than their having to rely

Gould of Potternewton:</Member></B> My Lords, I put my name to these
amendments, having initiated this debate at Second Reading, because I
believe that the Bill is morally wrong. I appreciate that these are
complex issues—the issue that we are discussing is particularly
complex, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, illustrated—which
are difficult to resolve, but the difference they can make to a
transperson’s life cannot be underestimated. I illustrate this
by referring to an e-mail I received after my speech at Second 
<?notus-xml column=517?>Reading. It was from a transperson who said that she cried tears of joy.
I am sure that she was not crying tears of joy at my speech but at the
fact that somebody had addressed an issue about which she felt so
strongly and which was affecting her life. That is terribly
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000119">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>
the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, also said,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:48:41"></hs_TimeCode> Bill
identifies two anomalies which govern transpeople’s lives. The
legislation provides for the removal of the requirement for married
transpeople who wish to apply for gender recognition to be single at
the point of gender recognition. Further, a concession has been made as
regards spouses’ survivor pensions, which removes a further
major concern for many
transpeople.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000120">The
passing of this amendment would get rid of a third anomaly for
transpeople in existing marriages. As it stands, the Bill removes the
obligation on a transperson being in an existing marriage, although it
does require a civil partnership to be converted to a marriage before
application, as otherwise an opposite-sex civil partnership would be
created. However, the Bill has now introduced the concept that the
non-transitioning spouse must give formal consent. It adds the
requirement that spouses now have to consent to the change of their
partner. No other area in law—this is a change to the
structure of law—requires spousal consent to any change within a
marriage. There is no need for spousal consent to end a marriage, move
abroad, financially destabilise the family, apply for distant jobs, or
for medical treatment. Formal spousal consent that can veto a
partner’s gender recognition is a new concept in
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000121">The
assumption in marriage law is that spousal consent is assumed. If the
spouse does not consent to the partner’s actions, the spouse has
the opportunity to initiate divorce proceedings. What we have now
certainly goes against the view of most spouses. It may have been
objected to by some but until 2003-04 it was routine for gender
identity clinics to require spousal consent for the treatment of
married transpeople, until it was pointed out that this was potentially
a breach of the transperson’s human rights. We have the same
problem again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000122">The
amendment has been carefully crafted. Its value is that the
determination of someone’s gender will be a matter for the
individual concerned and the state. No other individual is involved. A
spouse may choose to expedite the applicant’s full gender
recognition by including a statutory declaration of consent. However, a
spouse cannot prevent an applicant’s full gender recognition by
more than a year by withholding that consent. That is important. They
still have rights but they are limited. In respect of interim gender
recognition certificates, the Gender Recognition Act currently allows
the gender recognition panel to issue interim gender recognition
certificates to those transpeople who were married or in civil
partnerships at the point of
application<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:54:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:51:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:51:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000123">The
amendment allows an applicant in an existing marriage or civil
partnership to apply for an interim gender recognition certificate,
which would allow annulment or divorce proceedings to commence if
required. Further, it would allow an individual who has been granted an
interim gender recognition certificate to change their
gender under the Act, after a predetermined period has elapsed. The
Bill makes 
<?notus-xml column=518?>no distinction between marriages where both spouses wish it to continue
and marriages where divorce proceedings have commenced. Therefore, we
seem to have created the ludicrous situation that in the absence of a
decree absolute, the divorcing spouse will still be required to give
consent to the transperson’s gender recognition, no matter how
long it has taken to get to that point in the
divorce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:54:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:52:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
Marriages can break down when a transperson reveals themselves to be
trans. There are many points at which either spouse may decide that the
marriage can no longer continue, such as the point of revelation, when
treatment commences, when the transperson goes public, the point of
name change or when transformation surgery occurs. All these can result
in acrimonious proceedings that can drift on for many years. Known
cases have gone from 17 months to six years. The amendment would avoid
that
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:54:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000124">The
requirement for spousal consent creates one further flashpoint for
couples in what is already a difficult situation. The amendment
overcomes that problem as spouses can no longer obstruct but only delay
by a known timescale someone’s gender recognition. That is the
crux of the amendment. All the objections raised in the Commons seem to
have been satisfied. It is fair to both partners and does not
disadvantage the spouse. Again, it is utterly wrong in principle to
hand someone’s right of identity to someone else who may be
hostile to that person. It is irrelevant whether it is a widespread
problem or not. That argument should not be used when talking about
justice and fairness for any individual. I trust that it will not be
used as an explanation for opposing the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:54:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
I approached this amendment with some hope, and I have enormous respect
for the way in which the Minister has responded to opposition to the
Bill. She has listened and responded to many of the points raised. But,
on this occasion, I feel that that listening has
stopped<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:54:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
people, not only transpeople, will feel betrayed and discriminated
against, and there will certainly be no tears of joy if this amendment
is not accepted. It is discrimination in a Bill that is designed to do
just the
reverse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:54:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Recognition Act was passed in 2004, there was no mention of spousal
consent. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell the House why
this has suddenly emerged. Can she give evidence of spouses having
requested a veto? I understand that some spouses have said that they
want to be informed, but being informed is substantially different from
consent. It would also be helpful to know the view of the gender
recognition panel, because now there will be additional documentation
for the panel to process, and that will certainly have financial
implications<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

potentially gains significantly by gender recognition and therefore may
lose significantly by not being able to achieve it. The spouse loses
nothing by their partner gaining gender recognition and gains nothing
by withholding consent. Does the Minister not see that this is really
to do with equity of rights? Leaving the Bill as it stands and without
this amendment will mean that the Government are saying to the trans
community, “Somehow or other, you seem to be second-class
citizens”. It will establish a precedent which may be used
elsewhere. I appeal to the Minister to rethink her opposition to this
amendment because I 
<?notus-xml column=519?>am sure that the issue will not go away. It is a matter of principle,
and if her opposition has anything to do with the wording of the
amendment, we would be very happy to bring it back on Report with new

Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> I, too, support these amendments. When I was
a family judge, I tried a number of what for me were the saddest of all
cases: where one spouse had entered into a transgender situation,
particularly before the Gender Recognition Act brought justice to those
people. However, that left the other spouse confused and distressed. I
remember a particular case in which the wife sat at the back of the
court in floods of tears when what was being discussed was how the
father could become an auntie because he was in the process of changing
his
gender<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:57:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sad cases for both parties, but particularly for those who are left
behind under the Gender Recognition Act. I agree totally with the noble
Baroness, Lady Gould, that those who change their gender require
fairness, proper human rights and recognition, but this House also
needs to remember those who are left behind. However, in doing that,
there is no point in retaining a marriage that cannot exist unless it
exists in a new
dimension.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000129">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:57:59"></hs_TimeCode>
two points made to me by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, shortly
before the House sat today are extremely important. The first is that
there should be a notification of the fact that the gender recognition
spouse is making this application. I understand that the spouse who is
left behind does not necessarily know that the application is being
made. That is an injustice to that person, and it is one of the
important elements in this group of amendments. The second point is
this: if people cannot bring themselves to be married as a same-sex
couple, as they will be able to in the future when this Bill becomes
law, because the left-behind spouse cannot tolerate that, they really
should not allow the marriage to continue indefinitely. It does not
help either party that it should run on. The suggestion in this group
of amendments—that there should be a cut-off point at six
months, as there is in every other part of this—seems only just.
People can then get on with bringing the marriage, which would by
definition have failed, to an
end<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T15:59:23"></hs_TimeCode>. For these

Thornton:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the Government on
meeting two out of the three issues that the Bill has raised for
transgender people, and doing so in a sensible and calm fashion. The
only outstanding issue left is the proposal being tested
here—that same-sex marriage legislation gives spouses the power
of veto over whether a transgender partner can have legal recognition
of a change of gender. The noble Baroness, Lady Barker, my noble friend
Lady Gould and the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Slo<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:00:11"></hs_TimeCode>ss,
have explained the issues perfectly well. I do not think
they are complex; they are very straightforward. This is an unfairness

great shame that, when enacted, the Bill will affect the human rights

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend Lady Barker for introducing this group of amendments and also to
all who have spoken in the debate today. It is an incredibly sensitive
issue, and I am mindful of that in responding. The noble Baroness, Lady
Gould, made a powerful speech and I want her to know that I was
listening carefully to her arguments. The Gender Recognition Panel has
been consulted throughout as we have been drafting the Bill and it has
not raised any concerns or matter that we have not been able to

detail of the amendments, let me be clear from the start—in a
way it is a response to a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Thornton—that our concern in the Bill has been to ensure that as
many couples as possible are able to stay married if they wish to do so
following one or both spouses obtaining gender recognition. We are
proud to make that possible in the Bill and it is something that we
very much support.</hs_para>

Bill allow the spouse of a transperson to agree and consent to their
marriage continuing as a same-sex marriage after gender recognition. It
is not a block or a veto; they cannot prevent their spouse obtaining
gender recognition. It is important that I make that point. I will
explain in a little bit more detail, but nobody is able to stop anybody
getting their gender recognition certificate—of that I can be
very clear.</hs_para>

strike a fair balance between the Article 8 rights to respect for the
private and family life of both spouses. The trans spouse has a right
to be granted their gender recognition without unnecessary delay, but
the non-trans spouse also has a right to have a say in the future of
their marriage following their spouse gaining gender recognition. We
have, during the passage of the Bill, listened carefully to interested
stakeholders from the trans community. I have been glad to meet some
representatives with my honourable friend Helen Grant, the Minister
from another place. I am grateful to those who have been involved in
the preparation of these amendments, and for the time and effort that
have gone into them because I know that has been

specifically to what the amendments seek to do. The first aspect is the
limit of six months in proposed new subsection (3A), relating to both
spouses’ power to initiate annulment proceedings following the
issue of an interim gender recognition certificate. The point is that
there should be a limit of six months for annulment proceedings to
start. In response to a point made by my noble friend Lady Barker and
the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, I want to make it
clear that if a spouse refused to commence 
<?notus-xml column=521?>annulment proceedings, the trans spouse would be able to do so. In the
Bill as it stands, either spouse in the marriage is able to start
annulment proceedings. It is not just in the hands of one
spouse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062420000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062420000008">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:05:34"></hs_TimeCode>
terms of the second time limit of 12 months in proposed new subsection
(3A), once annulment proceedings have been commenced, it is for the
court to bring the marriage to an end and, upon that occurring, to
issue a full gender recognition certificate to the applicant. To
require the Gender Recognition Panel to issue a gender recognition
certificate while court proceedings are ongoing would be to require the
panel to usurp the functions of a superior court. Where one spouse is
deliberately delaying the annulment process, the courts already have
the power to deal with this. I will be absolutely clear: either spouse
is able to bring forward annulment proceedings and once they start,
they are in the hands of the court. Most annulment proceedings take
three months—or, from the very outset, six months I
think—but it is the court that will ensure that they continue in

is another element to the amendments, which I am not sure my noble
friend covered in her introductory remarks, but to which I will
respond. Proposed new subsection (3B) relates to civil partnerships.
The Government do not believe that removing the right of spouses to
have a say in the future of their marriage following conversion and
gender recognition strikes the proper balance between the rights of
both spouses. The agreement of a non-trans civil partner to the
conversion of their civil partnership to a same-sex marriage is one
thing—it is not the same as their agreement to the resulting
marriage continuing as an opposite-sex marriage following their
spouse’s gender recognition.</hs_para>

situation where a couple are already in a civil partnership and one of
them has gender reassignment. If the non-trans spouse agrees to
transfer the civil partnership to a marriage, to allow their
certificate to continue, that is not the same as the non-trans spouse
agreeing at the same time that they want to continue to be married to
somebody who would then be of the opposite sex but who was of the same
sex when they first entered into a civil

Government and I are always prepared to listen and to take great care
in responding to points raised in debate. It is probably worth
mentioning that we have already made an amendment to the Bill to
protect the pension rights of transpeople who receive a gender
recognition certificate and are then in a same-sex marriage, so that
they retain the same rights as if they were married to somebody of the
opposite sex. Following the debate in the other place on the fast-track
procedure, we have been considering this carefully, and I hope very
much to bring forward something positive in that area on
Report.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062420000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062420000012">The
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and other noble Lords
asked whether a spouse is currently notified at the point of

can be issued. The process, as it stands, requires somebody to have
annulled their marriage 
<?notus-xml column=522?>before it is possible to get a full gender recognition certificate.
However, I have only just been made aware of that issue and would like

Thornton:</Member></B> I do not think the noble Baroness has actually
addressed the issue of one spouse having the right of veto. I think
that is very important. Spousal vetoes are spousal consents, which we
got rid of in this country many years ago. A husband actually had to
consent to his wife divorcing him, for example. I ask the noble
Baroness to look at this most carefully. At the moment the Bill is in

because we are clear that one spouse is not vetoing somebody
else’s rights. If the transperson in the marriage wants to go
for full gender recognition and receive the certificate, they are
absolutely entitled to do that. However, if the person to whom they are
married does not want to remain married to them, then they have to make
a decision about the future of their marriage. We argue that for the
non-transperson, whether they wish to remain married to somebody who
has gone through gender reassignment is quite a fundamental thing to
have to consider. This is not saying that somebody who wants to
reassign their gender is not able to do so. The issue is whether they
are able to remain in the same marriage. The person to whom they are
married also has some right to decide whether they want to remain
married to somebody after that person has changed their

saying that if someone wants to go ahead with gender reassignment and
their spouse does not agree to remain married to them, then it is open
to them to start annulment proceedings, as indeed it is to the spouse
who no longer wishes to remain married to them. Both of them have the
right to start an annulment proceeding, and the person who wishes to
change their gender and receive a full certificate can do that. It is
not about them being unable to change their gender. They have the right
to do that, and nobody is stopping them doing that. However, if the

notification. Clearly, nothing can happen until the interim certificate
is provided. I understand that at the moment it is possible for the
spouse not to know anything about the gender reassignment application.
The sooner the other spouse knows about it the better, because
mediation may be required. One does not want the parties to be in
dispute, if possible. The shock to the person who finds that, for
instance, her husband is no longer going to be her husband is enormous.
The quicker she knows about it the better, in order to help finish the
marriage decently and quietly. I understood the Minister to say that
this could not be done because other proceedings had to come first. I
am asking only for notification at the earliest possible stage that an
application is being made. There can be nothing wrong with that,

think that I would like guidance, which I would be happy to take in

on religious conviction, for example, although other objections are
possible, too. Equalities cases such as those of Ladele have shown that
Article 9 rights need to be balanced with other rights. In this

take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell, that this not

the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights. The court held
that marriage was different. With respect, the judgment was
unsatisfactory not only because of the narrow defeat in court but for
the lack of logic. The Government took down the barriers between
marriage and other forms of association by enacting advantages for
same-sex couples entering a civil partnership and now, shortly, gay
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000164">The

security on the death of a spouse or partner. The lines drawn by the
court in that case will no longer exist. All will be redrawn by the
passage of the Bill. The unions or marriages that the Government seek
to bolster will no longer have to be heterosexual, will not have to
involve sex or procreation, but need only to be stable, loving and

gay marriages or civil partnerships. Any two family members or carers
who stay together for decades as an act of self-determination and

otherwise be involved in taking care of them and giving them benefits

rights that are granted on the grounds, inter alia, of birth or other
status. There is a clear case here which must urgently be addressed in
the review of civil partnerships, ideally by an amendment to the Bill.
Why should consanguinity be any less important than the relationship
between married and civil partners? The state should not prefer sexual
relationships, which may be short-lived and serial, over blood
relationships that have proved to have endured decades. The Government
should show—they cannot logically—that it is reasonable
or necessary to exclude carers and related couples from the new
marriage. I cannot resist quoting from Irving Berlin’s

imagine that we all can think of couples who fall into one or other of
these two paragraphs. As regards family members, I remember a much
loved bishop, a Bishop of Lewes. It was many years ago. I believed him
to be a happily married man. It was only after he died that I
discovered that the woman who I had believed to be his wife was his
sister. I can conceive of no reason, as the noble Baroness, Lady Deech,
has said, why those two should not have enjoyed the benefits of a civil
partnership. The same applies to the unpaid carer. In our village there
is a man who suffered a severe riding accident many years ago, as a
result of which he is paralysed. He has been looked after with the
utmost loyalty by the young man who previously looked after his horse.

short points. First, as the previous two speakers have said, the door
is now open. It is very interesting that on previous Bills the
suggestion was made that this was not the right place. However, of all
places, a review of civil partnership actually opens the door for what
this House very properly voted in favour of before I joined it.
Secondly, the effect on the Government of the day—I appreciate
that there have been two Governments of opposite views, who have gone
the same way on this—would be to defer the inheritance tax and
not necessarily to lose it. It would not necessarily cost the
Government very much money in the end. I hope that this will be looked

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support the amendment moved
by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. Indeed, it was the rejection of the
sisters amendment that led me to vote against the Third Reading of the
Civil Partnership Bill in another place. I thought it was
discriminating and unfair to concentrate entirely on sexual
relationships and not to recognise the sort of close relationship and
affinity to which the noble Baroness has
referred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000176">Nine

nine years have gone by and the commonly recognised discrimination,

not been put right. We have an opportunity in this Bill to put it
right. Although I hope that we do not come to a Division in Committee
on this, if we do not have a satisfactory answer from my noble and

Alli:</Member></B> I wonder whether the noble Lord and the noble
Baroness would accept this point. I stand by those words in relation to
carers. I was deeply passionate about the issue and I offered the noble
Baroness any assistance that I could, not only at the time but after
the debate. I believe that carers are an undervalued group of people in
our society and I have no quarrel with that proposal. However, to
prosecute the case for carers by devaluing the nature of a civil
partner relationship is where our paths divert. Considering the
countless civil partnerships that have gone on, with the types of
celebration and the nature of the relationships, does the noble Lord
not accept that there is now a significant difference between civil
partnership as we understand it and what the noble Baroness and the
noble Lord are
proposing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Cormack:</Member></B> Clearly, that was meant to be an intervention so
obviously I will respond to the noble Lord. I said at Second Reading
that I accepted that civil partnerships were now a permanent part of
our social fabric. Indeed, I went much further. I will not repeat what
I said then as the noble Lord was in his place and heard it. I made
similar comments during the debates in Committee last week. However,
that does not in any way invalidate the basic justice of the case
enunciated by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and supported by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. I support it too and I
say to the noble Lord, Lord Alli, that surely he and I are concerned
with justice and equity for everybody. Although I have my reservations
about the word “marriage” being applied right across the
board, I have tried to make it plain in my brief interventions in
Committee that I accept that he and those who share his beliefs
thoroughly deserve a better recognition than they have had in the
past—better even than in civil partnerships.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:41:05"></hs_TimeCode> saying that,
however, I can also say, and I do, in supporting the noble Baroness,
Lady Deech, that there are others in our society—siblings and
carers have been named, but there are others—who deserve, if
they have made a life-long commitment to each other, as have those
sisters and as has the young man with the gentleman who was so severely
injured in a hunting accident, a recognition of the personal sacrifice
and commitment that they have made which is at least equal to the
recognition that we have given to civil partnerships. I hope very much
that my noble and learned friend Lord Wallace will be able to encourage
us today when he comes to respond to this debate.

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, it is surely not difficult
to construe the meaning of Clause 14. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick,
said, we know that the Secretary of State has agreed to arrange for the
“operation and future” of the Act to be reviewed and for
a report following that review to be produced. We know also, in
subsection (2), that such a review is not prevented from dealing with
other matters. What is absolutely clear from the debate thus far is
that everyone who has spoken—those in another place,
too—recognises that there is a particular injustice and anomaly
in the case of siblings and carers. I congratulate the noble Baroness,
Lady Deech, on raising this question yet again. She has been a
consistent campaigner in this regard. She spoke eloquently and
elegantly, as the noble Lord, Lord Cormack,
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000186">I
would find it anomalous if the Government were to say that they cannot
take this further because of the European Court of Human Rights
judgment. That 
<?notus-xml column=531?>would be a little puzzling because obviously they have not adhered
slavishly to the judgments of the European Court in respect of
prisoners’ rights, for example. They have shown that they can be
quite selective about that. Perhaps the Minister will, as in the past,
draw on the manual available to all Ministers. I am sure there must be
a little book of various forms of objection. One of them is:
“This is not the appropriate vehicle”. That may well be
relied upon in this case. It may not be appropriate but at least the
review can include matters that Members of this noble House deem
important because we feel that sense of
injustice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000187">The
genesis of the review provision is of interest. Perhaps in their
desperation to get the Bill through speedily and strike a deal with the
dissidents, the Government came up with the idea of accelerating
the review. Historians will no doubt find of interest the
bargaining that lay behind those deals. Clearly, there was an initial
contradiction in the Government’s position. They placed
everything on the altar of equality. Equality was worshipped and all
other considerations were pushed aside. It is hardly equal if
homosexual couples have the choice of either a civil partnership or
marriage whereas heterosexual couples do not have that choice and must
be content with traditional marriage. There is a basic contradiction
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000188">To
end, my own judgment is as follows: one thing I have learnt over very
many years is that the British people have a fundamental sense of
justice. Of all those who have spoken, I commend particularly the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. He gave some telling examples
from his village and his own experience. His questions need an answer
and should be addressed at some stage by this House and Parliament
generally. It is surely anomalous that, following the passage of this
Bill, homosexual couples with perhaps a deathbed marriage will be in a
far more advantageous and favourable position relating to inheritance
tax provisions and tenancy than people who have looked after sisters or
brothers or cared for others, as the Burden case has shown. People who
have perhaps been together for decades will continue to be
disadvantaged. It may well be that nothing substantial will emerge from
the review but I commend and congratulate the noble Baroness on raising

Alli:</Member></B> At the heart of this debate is the basic premise
that, given that gay marriage will occur, we should open up civil
partnerships to a range of other people. We will see that in a number
of amendments as we proceed through Committee. My problem with that is
that I do not believe that gay marriage is being opened up as part of
this Bill. This Bill creates civil same-sex marriage but it does not
create equal marriage in the case of religious organisations. It is an
enabling Bill and removes the prohibition for same-sex marriages in
England and Wales, with the notable exception of the Church of England,
which retains so many locks. The Bill preserves an inequality in
religious marriages for the very good reasons we have debated
throughout Committee. This is an important point in why I think civil

listened very carefully to almost every word of the debate and I detect
a real mood on the Benches Spiritual and in other religious

Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury for the way in which he has sought
to shine a new light on these relationships. I believe that before we
see same-sex marriage in our churches, temples and mosques, we will see
civil partnerships celebrated. We will see liturgies and special
services created to bless gay couples without the churches having to

movement forward in some religious organisations can happen only if
civil partnerships stay in place for a little while longer and do not
apply to these other categories of people. For example, while I support
those who want civil partnerships to be extended to opposite-sex
couples, civil partnerships for same-sex couples will have a unique
role to play that justifies their position in a way that is not the
same for opposite-sex couples. For me, that is a fundamental part of
why I want to resist the extension of civil partnerships in this Bill.

them will want to bless civil partnerships, and these amendments would
remove the ability for them to do

direct relation to Amendment 46A, there has been a huge amount of

their relationship to be solemnised before God and in the presence of

The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, was quite right to quote me, and the
noble Baroness, Lady O’Cathain, will recall that we had
significant and detailed discussions of this issue during the passage
of the Civil Partnership Act 2004. The other place was not sympathetic
to what was being proposed because of the different aspects for

that of the noble Baroness, Lady O’Cathain, in trying to advance
the plight of carers but I implore your Lordships to look at the role

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, nine years ago I took part in
this debate, as did many others in your Lordships’ House. I was
deeply moved then, as was the noble Lord, Lord Alli, by the cases and
arguments put by the noble Baroness, Lady O’Cathain, which were
repeated so eloquently today by the noble Baroness, Lady
Deech<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:55:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000196">I
agreed absolutely that we need to address the problem of inheritance
for people—they may be sisters or may not even be blood
relatives—who none the less share a home for a long time and
then face the problem of an inheritance tax which could push them into
the shadows of residential care. I absolutely accept that that must be
addressed. I hoped at the time we argued this, and still hope, that
this should be addressed by the Treasury agreeing, very
simply—it does not need legislation—that you can roll up
inheritance tax on the first death to the death of the second
person<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:56:02"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
understand it, that is all one needs to do. The state is not denied any
money, but the sibling or carer who is left does not have the threat of
losing their home held over them. That is the way to go. When it comes
to extending or even considering this as part of an extension of civil
partnerships, I obviously have no problem with this being part of a
review, but I had two fundamental objections nine years ago and they
remain for me today to consider this as possibly an extension of the
civil partnership.</hs_para>

a civil partnership has a legal entry and a legal exit, which is
equivalent to divorce. Take, for example, a mother and daughter who
enter into a civil partnership, in good faith, partly to protect the
home. The daughter may be in her forties or fifties; her mother dies,
she inherits and is protected. If she is in a civil partnership and
five years down the line meets a man whom she chooses to marry, she has
to divorce her mother—her civil partner—to enter into a
new marriage with a man. She may alternatively decide that when her
mother has died and that civil partnership has ended she will form
another civil partnership with her own grown-up son. Therefore the
property cascades down the generations without ever touching the
Treasury at any
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:57:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000198">This
can be done through a revision of inheritance tax. It cannot in my view
be done through a civil partnership which has to be divorced before you
can enter another one or, indeed, before you enter a marriage. The
notion that a daughter can divorce a mother in order to marry somebody
else, or that a sister and brother can divorce each other because they
each wish to marry someone else brings the notion of civil partnership,
its ceremonies of entering and its divorce, into
disrepute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:58:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000199">The
second problem, which is why I was engaged fairly heavily the last time
round, is that you cannot separate inheritance advantages from social
security 
<?notus-xml column=534?>liability. If two people, whether they are a carer and the person cared
for, a mother and a daughter, or a brother and a sister, enter a civil
partnership in the hope of avoiding or postponing inheritance tax, they
take on mutual responsibility for each other in social security. That
means, for example, that if a frail elderly mother and a son enter a
civil partnership to spare the son a big inheritance tax bill, he
becomes wholly financially responsible for his mother, if he can afford
it. For the first time ever, he will be means-tested for his
mother’s support; his mother will have no independent rights to
social security benefits because she will be his dependent. If he can
afford to pay for her, the state does not need to. She loses her
independence of social security income because the son, by virtue of
the civil partnership, has taken on that
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000200">I
could enlarge on that, but noble Lords can see the consequences. If a
sister and a brother enter into a civil partnership, then they become
mutually financially responsible for each other in social security
terms, including children and the like. The problem is that one cannot
separate out the upside, in terms of inheritance law, for carers, or
for a mother and a daughter or for sisters, without taking on, in all
fairness, the downside of responsibility for social
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000201">I

Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, was absolutely right about this.
We should see a way of avoiding a survivor, particularly in the case of
the two elderly sisters who went to the courts, having the inheritance
abated on the first person and being rolled over to the second death.
That seems to me to protect the position of the two sisters, which I

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, around the Committee
there is clear recognition of an injustice in inheritance tax terms to
carers and siblings. However, while I do so with diffidence, I will to
try to answer the question posed by the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Lloyd. He effectively asked what the difference was between siblings
living together and couples presently in civil partnerships living
together. The answer, I suggest, is that the noble Baroness’s
amendment threatens to undermine the whole notion of civil
partnerships, which are about loving relationships between people
living together as couples—and yes, in a sexual
relationship—rather than about carers or adult brothers and
sisters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062413000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0001.htm#13062413000207">The
questions are not questions about inheritance tax. I suggest that the
point made by the noble Lord, Lord Alli, that people may wish to
continue in civil partnerships even after this Bill goes through and
even where they are same-sex couples is completely valid. To broaden

undermines that possibility. Even in the words of the amendment which
calls only for a review, as emolliently pointed out by the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Pannick,
the suggestion has that tendency to undermine what civil partnerships
are. It is for that reason that nine years ago noble Lords called the
notion embodied in this amendment inappropriate and why, although it
was passed here, it was rejected by the other place. I suggest that the
amendment should be rejected today for the same reason and that
Parliament needs to find a way, whether as described by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hollis, in her erudite explanation of the technical
difficulties, or some other way, to solve the quite separate injustice

not, indeed, some element of contempt for what is called the vehicular
defence. Too often, it has been said in a case where there is every
merit in a proposed amendment, “Ah, yes, but that is not the
correct vehicle to use at this stage”. More often than 
<?notus-xml column=536?>not, in the years that I have spent in this House and in another place,
I have felt that it was a path of craven retreat used by many
Governments in many situations but in a wholly unworthy cause. Indeed,

one dilutes the possibilities by including the issue in a review where
there may be dubiety as to whether that is the correct vehicle.
Therefore, in the circumstances, I respectfully suggest that the
amendment is aimed at the wrong Act. It is not the 2004 Act
that causes injustice in this regard, but the 19th century Partnership
Act, as amended. In other words, if the relationships that one speaks
about could by statute be deemed to be a certain type of partnership
with a certain type of fiscal consequence leading therefrom that would
be just, equitable and proper, then the proposal would be aimed at a
correct target. If that could be done quickly not by way of review but
by direct legislation, I would, indeed, consider that we had done

indicate that some aspects of this discussion will arise under my
Amendment 55. It is important to remember that this Bill is not about
gay marriage but same-sex marriage. As I pointed out, and I invited
correction—so far I have not been corrected—it includes
platonic relations between people of the same sex. Therefore, the idea
that sexual relationships are fundamental to it is a mistake. That may

marriage by law, let alone by the churches, because they would be
deemed too close and thus to be incestuous. In saying that, I do not in
any way disparage the importance of the issue that needs to be raised.

unsuccessful Bill about free support for people at home. There have
been many times when this House could have taken on board these issues
and made its views clear in appropriate Bills to do with income support
and carers. Yet, again we find ourselves discussing this important
issue during the passage of a Bill to do with, in this case, equal
marriage. That does not do service to both the importance of the issue
of carers and the fate of people who care for their relatives, or the

the value, rather—of the relationships that exist between

obligations. Indeed, the noble and learned Lord,

who was injured in a riding accident. Certainly, our society, country
and communities benefit enormously from the caring relationships that
exist the length and breadth of the

Lord, Lord Anderson, said that they would take professional advice on
whether the tax or social security arrangements were in their
interests. We are talking about marriages which, in a religious
context, would involve the engagement of a priest. I now hear that
people wanting to take them on would probably have to engage the
services of an accountant. These are very materially different kinds of
arrangements. One is meant to be an expression of commitment and a
desire to live together to the exclusion of others for life, and one is
really tantamount to a tax arrangement. I do not think I am doing an
injustice to the way it was actually phrased. That in no way diminishes
the quality of care that exists. That was indeed the basis of the
argument.

Pearson of Rannoch, inquired about the questions he submitted. I
apologise if he has not had responses. The most recent information

These partnerships were formed between the Civil Partnership Act 2004

possible to estimate the impact of civil partnerships on tax revenues,

suspect that might answer the second question, which concerned the
difference between same-sex marriage and civil partnerships. The noble
Lord’s third question concerned how many blood relative, sibling
or family partnerships exist, and what the cost would be. I think that
is probably an impossible question to answer, not least because that
knowledge is not collected by any government department in that way. It
is also because, 
<?notus-xml column=542?>for reasons which have been well rehearsed during this debate, where
these kinds of relationships exist one does not know in how many cases
the couple concerned would want to make the relationship into a civil
partnership. I understand why the noble Lord asked the question, but I
think it is almost impossible to answer in any meaningful way. I am

it is purely because there are too many of these partnerships. There
are very many more: a multiple of 53,000. That is why the Government

how he saw civil partnerships perhaps developing, and how there might
be a liturgy associated with them in times to come. No doubt that is a
point he and others will make to the body conducting the review.
Questions do arise from the change to marriage law which we are making
in this Bill. It will result in the apparent anomaly of same-sex
couples having the choice between marriage and civil partnership, while
opposite-sex couples will only be able to marry. It was for that reason

the case that parents, children and siblings already have a legally
recognised relationship, one to the other. These relationships already
afford certain rights. For example, children and siblings are
recognised in intestacy rules. The extent of those rights is clearly a
separate issue from the question of future civil partnerships. That is

to the rights and responsibilities of carers, of course they play an
invaluable role in our society, caring for people. No one disputes
that. The Government strongly value the role and commitment of carers.
Indeed, we set out our priorities in November 2010 in a
cross-government strategy: <I>Recognised, valued and supported: next
steps for the Carers Strategy</I>. The mandate to the NHS Commissioning
Board also contains a clear objective on enhancing the quality of life
of people with long-term conditions and their carers. Achieving this
objective will mean that by 2015, the 5 million carers looking after
friends and family members will routinely have access to information
and advice about the available support. When it comes to financial
support for carers, the Government have announced that carer’s
allowance will continue to exist as a separate benefit outside of
universal credit, so that carers will continue to enjoy the support of
a dedicated

this kind, and this Government share the view that civil partnership,
as it then was and as it has evolved and developed over time, is not
the appropriate place to open up these new, significant policy
questions. The review is about civil partnerships. It would be
inappropriate to open it up to look at unrelated issues of carers and
family law, and particularly the question of tax and benefits. We have
also indicated that we do not wish to delay or add to the cost and
complexity of a review which the Government have committed to undertake

am grateful to all those who have spoken. Our discussion has caused me
to focus on three themes. The first is obvious: there is no time to
waste. There are lots of old folk who need help. Every time I have
inquired at the Whips’ Office or the clerks’ office when
Bills have come forward, I have been told, “Oh, it’s not

am focusing also on freedom of choice. Once this Bill has passed,
everybody in the country who is over 16 will be able to choose to enter
a legal bond with somebody else, except those who are related. That is
why I do not support the noble Lord, Lord Lester—as he
knows—in relation to cohabitants. They can choose; they could
get married. Maybe in future they could 
<?notus-xml column=545?>have a civil partnership and make a contract if they have not done so; I
would not dump our very unsatisfactory matrimonial law on them without
their choice. However, siblings have no choice at all. They are faintly
recognised as relatives in some other laws, but there is really very
little help for adult

has been some talk of my amendment somehow devaluing equal marriage. I
say to those who have made that point that this Bill is about equality.
Those who are gaining equality should not rest on their laurels. On the
contrary, having reached their target, they should hold out their hand
to others to give them the same help, despite perhaps the same
objections, as is being given in this Bill for same-sex marriages. It
is not a religious question. I cannot imagine for a minute that any
review would ever expect any religious authority to bless the union of
related people. Religion has nothing to do with it—so I did not
quite follow the argument of the noble Lord, Lord Alli. What I am
thinking of is some union—it need not necessarily be a civil
partnership—some formal contract or some recognition that could
be extended to siblings, and, believe me, there has been no opportunity

do not agree with those who say that civil partnerships are different.
Sex has got nothing to do with it—some chaps here may not agree
with that—now that we have changed the definition of marriage.
Even at the moment, if two people get married, no one inquires as to
whether it is a sexual relationship. As we all know, neither adultery
nor consummation will play any part in remedies or definition of
marriage in the future. This really has nothing to do with sex. We are
not talking about sisters committing incest—that is a crime
anyway. We all realise that that is beyond the bounds of possibility;
it is nothing to do with that. It is to do with the fact that the whole
definition of marriage has changed. My bet is that a new case before
the European Court would probably succeed because the law of Europe
prohibits discrimination on the grounds of birth, status and sex inter
alia. I cannot see a ground for not extending some advantages, as
appropriate, to those who are related and therefore unable to take

strong plank of the new law is equality. We have to cling to that: it
is about equality. I do not agree, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis,
realised, with any notion of forcing people into something like this.
Nor am I suggesting that it is all about tax advantage—or maybe
it is, because, after all, people of both sexes now get married or can
enter a civil partnership in order to gain tax advantage; I vaguely
remember, decades ago, that there was a particular date in April that
was much favoured for getting married because one got tax relief for
the whole of the previous year as a married couple. For all we know,
people are entering 
<?notus-xml column=546?>into marriages or civil partnerships for all sorts of financial reasons.
It is not for us to inquire. People make their decision based on the
range before them; sisters have no range in front of them. If it were
to mean that people who entered some new sort of union had to support
each other, that is all well and good—that would be altogether
excellent. Too often, one reads about people who are abandoned, die on
their own or are in hospital on their own and, much later, relatives
come out of the woodwork to ask why no one was taking care of them. One

of religious organisations. We passed a provision in this House
allowing civil partnerships to happen in religious buildings. One
reason for our doing so was the need for same-sex couples to be able to
have their unions blessed with the congregations with whom they had
prayed. We saw this as being progress towards marriage being celebrated
in churches. It was recognised that there would be two speeds, where we
would see religious organisations wanting to bless civil partnerships
in their churches and some already doing so. Does the noble Baroness
accept that if her plan went through as envisaged, it would drive a
coach and horses through the church’s ability to bless civil
partnerships, because the nature of those relationships will have been

take advantage of this legislation because there will be no vehicle for
them. Men and women can get married; two people of the same sex can get
married; there may still be civil partnerships; there may even be civil
partnerships for heterosexual couples. The excluded category is those
who are related. There is probably little point in keeping
the prohibited degrees any longer, save for the point about
abuse within the family—but, sadly, we know that abuse within

The noble Baroness talks about two sisters. What about a father and

relationships involving coercion and violence. I am not arguing against

homophobic bullying must have no place in church or any other schools.
Discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation is usually expressly
forbidden within a school’s code of conduct and that must remain
the case. The Church of England’s established policy is that
pupils should have the opportunity to examine the full range of views
on same-sex relationships—including different Christian
views—and develop their own considered position. Within that
atmosphere of open discussion, church schools must nevertheless be in a
position to teach the nature of marriage in a way that is in accordance

England.</hs_parafo>

Christian ethos of church schools will be undermined unless that
position is accommodated. Exactly the same goes for schools that belong
to other religious traditions. The purpose of this amendment is simply
to achieve that accommodation. It does not seek an
exemption. No one is asking for a provision that would enable schools
to operate outside the framework that the Secretary of State’s
guidance provides. What I seek is a provision which ensures that the
guidance itself expressly recognises the need for schools that have a
religious character to teach the nature of marriage in a way that is in
accordance with that
character.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062426000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062426000007">The
meat of the amendment is the new subsection (1CA). The
meaning of the provision is quite straightforward. It would require the
guidance itself to address this particular issue. It would require it
to do so by accommodating the need for schools that have a religious
character to teach in a way that is consistent with their religious
ethos, while continuing to operate within the statutory framework.
Unfortunately the amendment needs to be quite a bit longer than that,
to provide definitions that link it to other existing statutory
provisions. It also needs to deal with the position of academies in a
slightly different way, because of the legal basis on which they are
established. In substance, it would put academies that have a religious
character in the same position in this regard as other church
schools.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062426000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062426000008">When

the right reverend Prelate and the noble Baroness. The current guidance
is altered by Clause 11 as Clause 11 changes the definition of marriage
and hence the content of what must be taught. It is the case, of

that marriage will be able in future, if this Bill is passed, to be
celebrated by man and woman, man and man or woman and woman. However,
it will give some protection against legal uncertainty to those whose

eminently reasonable until you try to imagine yourself a child within a
classroom in a school of a religious foundation. If you are talking
about marriage and you know that your parents, who are legally married
to each other, are both of the same sex, how would it make you feel if
you were told that their union is legal but not moral and not in
accordance with Christian teaching? Perhaps I might ask the right
reverend Prelate whether there is to be any guidance on the criteria
issued for entrance into a school of religious foundation to alert
parents of same-sex unions and their children that this may be the
case. I am trying to see how it will work out and what it will mean to
them if they are told that their parents are legally married but that
this is not within the Christian religion, and whether the criteria for
selection might need to be changed—or at least for parents to be

noble Baroness likes that. If I recall correctly, it was the
Conservative Government in 1996 who wrote the specific conditions into
the Act. I suspect that the broader supporters of this amendment would
have been the very people who wanted that provision written into the
Act in the first place. If I recall the nature of the debate at the
time, it was about family life and family values. The term was supposed
to refer exclusively to heterosexuals, and the reason for it being in
the Act was to allow those who did not approve of alternative family
structures to be placated. We are now giving access to civil marriage
to those who have been denied it. We therefore need to look at these
provisions again in that light.</hs_para>

majority of the contributions that we have listened to here in
Committee and in the other place, there is general consensus that
marriage has an important and very special place to play in family
life, and in the bringing up of children. I think that we are all
agreed on that. While I have heard no one in this place say that
one-parent families or divorced, separated or same-sex parenting are
somehow inadequate, we have all recognised that marriage can have a
unique and special role to play in bringing up children.</hs_para>

guidance will be the same after this Bill is enacted as they were
before. My problem with the amendment is not with what it seeks to do,
because it is right and proper that faith schools should be allowed to
teach the importance of marriage as they see it in relation to family
life. That is the case now, as I am sure that the Minister will say. My
opposition is to continually writing into the Bill something that is
not necessary and should be a matter for the guidance, not the Bill. It
would be equally unnecessary for me to amend the amendment, although
the right reverend Prelate might allow me to do so, to add the words,
“and in doing so, must pay due regard and respect to other forms
of relationship, including but

point to the Committee, particularly following what the noble Lord has

said and considered during the course of Bills passed in both Houses.
It is very important indeed to make sure that all the necessary points
are brought up. The noble Lord, Lord Alli, mentioned teachers. I am
quite sure that I am not alone in the volume of letters that I have
received about this Bill. In fact, I can say that never before on any
Bill while I have been in either House have Members ever received as
many letters as we have. Quite a number have come from teachers who are
very worried on this point. It ought to be brought out in the debate
that teachers themselves, who know perfectly well what their duties are
in accordance with the Bills passed in Parliament, have written to
express their deep concern that they are going to be forced to teach
something to which they have a basic and very important
objection.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062428000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062428000025">In
an earlier debate on this Bill, I mentioned how concerned I am that the
right of a person’s conscience is being eroded, day after day
and Bill by Bill. We have now had some 50 years of promises, made by
different Governments at different times, stating very clearly that we
all have a right to a conscience and to live by that conscience. That
is why so many letters have come to us all, I am sure, from teachers on
this very point. It is not a question of adding a few words to make
people happy. It is about giving people the right to continue to live
by the conscience which is in their heart and
soul.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_24_PT_1/56316A2B5AACFF2448E23FA75681F8FA2B5EAD9B" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 June 2013">Monday,

Lester of Herne Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said before, the
Human Rights Act 1998 expressly incorporates into our legal system
freedom of conscience, religion and belief, and expression. It requires
all legislation—old, new and future—to be read and given
effect in accordance with those fundamental rights. When the Joint
Committee on Human Rights, on which I serve, was presented with an
opinion by Mr Aidan O’Neill QC, one of the scenarios that he
suggested might occur in legislation of this kind involved teachers. He
speculated that a primary schoolteacher is told to teach using a book
about a prince who marries a man, and is asked to help the children to
perform the story as a play; she says that it goes against her
religious beliefs and disciplinary proceedings are taken against her.
He said that this is an example of a

department in charge of the Bill gave an extremely helpful answer to
that kind of speculative scenario. As the noble Baroness, Lady Knight,
rightly said, our proceedings may be read in future so I will briefly 
<?notus-xml column=558?>explain what the department said, which in my view completely complies
with the Human Rights Act and the European Convention on Human Rights.
This is what the department told the

will continue to have the clear right to express their own beliefs, or
that of their faith—such as that marriage should be between a
man and a woman—as long as it is done in an appropriate way and
a suitable context. No teacher will be required to promote or endorse
views which go against their beliefs. Teachers will of course be
expected to explain the world as it is, in a way which is appropriate
to the age, stage and level of understanding of their pupils and within
the context of the school’s curriculum, policies and ethos. This
may include the factual position that under the law marriage can be
between opposite sex couples and same sex couples. There are many areas
within teaching, particularly within faith schools, where teachers and
schools already deal with areas relating to religious conscience, such
as homosexuality and divorce, with professionalism and sensitivity. The
guidance governing these issues is the same guidance that will govern
how same sex marriage in the classroom will be approached. No teacher
can be compelled to promote or endorse views which go against their
conscience. We expect heads, governors and teachers will come to
sensible arrangements about any teaching that includes discussion of
same sex marriage as they currently do in all other areas of the
curriculum”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13062428000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062428000028">To

the reference to marriage and family life in Section 403, which has

that when pupils learn about sexual relationships, they should learn

words, they should not learn about sex as a mere physical act. In my
view, it would be most unfortunate that if and when pupils learn in sex
education classes—as they do—about gay sex, such

concern is not so much with teachers as with parents. So many
parents—I am sure that the noble Baroness and others will have

There was a time when this was left entirely to the parents, but that
is no longer the case because so many parents do not in fact teach
these matters to their children and do not bring up their children to
understand the rights and wrongs on issues of this kind. So it has gone

I understand it, the position of parents is defended in this

right to withdraw a child.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T18:37:27"></hs_TimeCode> find that very
difficult to accept. I acknowledge that it is done with the best of
intentions, but I do not think it is very helpful to the child. Very
often a child who is singled out from the rest of her peers in the
classroom is made to feel different in some way or another. This is not
very helpful to that child in the relationship with the rest of the
children in the class. I hope, therefore, that when my noble friend

got a picture of two rabbits upside-down with no explanation as to what

of this House are causing fear and consternation but I very much hope
not. The reality is that the correspondence that came into the House
did so long before there was any debate on this, and certainly long
before I made any comment in public about it. It is profoundly
important that we understand that there is a body of people out there,
spread right across the country, who write to Members of the House of
Lords in letters that are not template letters. These people have sat
down and thought this through. They are teachers, chaplains and all
sorts of people, and they are afraid. They have had previous experience
of how life has changed for them, and possibly they have had to come to
terms with teaching abortion—which they may believe to be truly
wrong—but they must do these things. I do not think that is a

the Government have taken the view that they were right from the start
and that any amendments which have been proposed are either otiose,
excessive or outwith the purpose of the Bill. Here is an occasion where
the Government can perhaps show a little magnanimity and say that there
is serious concern, as a number of noble colleagues have said. Although
one might have some confidence in the guidance issued by the
department, it is only guidance. It does not need wild speculation
about what future Secretaries of State may or may not do. The wording

Surely one factor we should recognise from the start is that there is a

great populace is to favour the discipline and ethos of those church
schools for their children. I was interested a few years ago to have a

End and almost 100% of her pupils were Bangladeshi. Why did they choose

otiose. It will have widespread acceptance from those who really value
the ethos and values of our church schools. It is a test of how serious
the Government are when they talk so much not only about the core

feel that this amendment is unnecessary for a variety of reasons. I
speak as an Anglican and was rather surprised that my church had taken
the view that it has on same-sex marriage. The law of the land will be
changed on same-sex marriage, and for the established church to say in
effect that it is contracting out of it and not to allow its churches
to be used for it is not, I would have thought, in the tradition of
Anglicanism—not the Anglicanism that I favour. The history of
the Church of England from 1533 onwards shows that it is not so much a
question of the tenets or the 39 articles but of what happened with
individual vicars in their parish churches. If you look at how English
vicars interpreted Anglicanism in the 17th<Sup> </Sup>and 18th
centuries, there is an infinite variety of activity. I should have
thought the Anglican church would have done much better to have
followed that practice than the one that it has followed.</hs_para>

aside, on this particular matter, the position is in fact exceedingly
clear. Where the state has provided birth control and various
government agencies promote it, teachers in the Catholic Church will
make it very clear that this is something which they object to and they
think is fundamentally wrong. It is not a tenet of their faith but a
practice, and the same is true of divorce. A great deal of discretion
is already happening every day in our schools. I think it would happen
in this case with the Anglican Church regarding sex education. I went
to a primary church school in Lancashire and we did not have any sex
education at all. I suppose that sex had not been discovered so much in
those days. I even went to a secondary grammar school in 
<?notus-xml column=564?>Lancashire for two years and we did not have any sex education there
either. I know we were very repressed sort of people—limited and
all that—but it was alien to us.</hs_para>

it is clear that when sex education is taught in schools—I
promoted it when I was Secretary of State—it is very much in the
context of a loving relationship. It was the point that the noble Lord,
Lord Pannick, made. It was not just the act of physical
gratification—immediate and then finished with. It was to
establish a loving relationship and that was a very essential part of
all sex education. So when the matter of marriage comes up, it would be
quite possible for any teacher, even a clergyman teacher at a Church of
England school, to say they believed very strongly that marriage should
be between a man and a wife and the purpose is to create a family. Even
when he is talking to 12 and 13 year-olds, they will know a lot about
other people who do not live like that. It has all changed today. It
will not be a matter of teaching but of discussion—that is what
it will be more like in actual practice. The teacher will be able to
say, without fear of persecution and quite clearly, “This is the
view that we believe in the Anglican Church at the moment, and we think
that is the position”. So I believe that this amendment is not

integrating the convictions of the Church of England with a recognition

balance to be struck, and I think that the Secretary of State for
Education was right to say that in teaching there will need to be a
recognition that we have a society in which same-sex
marriages—assuming the Bill goes through—are possible,

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a wide-ranging
debate. I am very grateful to the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Ripon and Leeds, for his introduction of his amendment and for quoting
what I said on Second Reading about this Bill being as much about
promoting religious freedom as it is about allowing same-sex couples to
marry. He was absolutely right about that. I am pleased that he was
clear that his amendment is about religious freedom of faith schools.
He sought to explain that this particular issue is quite different from
the earlier education matters we discussed last week, which focused on
the general freedom of any teacher to express a personal view rather
than on the teaching of sex and relationship education in religious
schools specifically. In responding to this debate, I will repeat
several points that I made last week, not least because as the debate
has unfolded it has become clear that the way in which the House
considers this issue is very much to do with education in a wider
context than just about the very narrow issue of religious
freedom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:05:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000022">Noble
Lords and others have expressed a concern that schools’ freedom
to teach their beliefs about marriage according to their religious
tenets will be threatened by the effect that Clause 11 will have on the
meaning of “marriage” in Section 403 of the Education Act
1996 and guidance made under it by the Secretary of State, to which
schools must have regard. As has already been noted, the Government
have received representations from religious groups, in particular the
Church of England and the Catholic Bishops’ Conference of
England and Wales, expressing concern that Clause 11 might affect the
ability of faith schools to continue to teach about the importance of
marriage 
<?notus-xml column=566?>for family life and the bringing up of children in line with their
religious tenets. This concern was echoed by Muslim leaders in their
public letter of 18
May.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000023">The noble
Lord, Lord Alli, was the first to raise a point about the origination
of Section 403. It is worth saying that it was not in a piece of
legislation originally in the 1996 Act. Section 403(1A) was inserted by
the Learning and Skills Act 2000. I will begin by explaining that
schools with a religious character provide an excellent education for
their pupils while reflecting their beliefs across the curriculum,
including in sex and relationship education. There is absolutely
nothing in this legislation that affects schools’ ability to
continue to do this in
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000024">In
schools of a religious character, teachers already deal admirably with
teaching about marriages which may not be recognised as such according
to the tenets of the relevant faith—for example, marriages of
divorcees, or mixed-faith marriages. Last week the noble Baroness, Lady
Farrington, gave us a great example of how teachers deal with sensitive
matters. The noble Baroness, Lady Richardson
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:07:21"></hs_TimeCode> Calow,
reminded us that it is important that teachers must be conscious of
pupils whose parents are of the same sex and married when teaching
about marriage in the context of sex and relationship education. My
noble friend Lord Baker also made a similar point. However, my
noble<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:06:44"></hs_TimeCode> friend
Lord Eden reminded us of the rights of parents who are concerned about
sex education and its content. I responded to his concern last week in
the debate about the policies that are in place to ensure that schools
properly consult parents on the content of sex and relationship

make a point, which is worth making in the context of this debate, that
sex and relationship education is compulsory in maintained secondary
schools. Primary schools are not required to teach sex and relationship
education, further than anything specific in the curriculum for
science. It is important that I make that point, because it is
sometimes forgotten.</hs_para>

order for teachers to handle the very sensitive situations in which
they often find themselves, they already interpret the Secretary of
State’s guidance according to their religious tenets. This will
be no different when marriage is extended to same-sex couples by this
Bill. If the tenets of a particular religion do not recognise same-sex
marriage, they will be able to approach teaching about marriage in
exactly the same professional way that they do now. Although teaching
will of course need to cover the factual position that marriage under
the law of England and Wales can be between both opposite-sex and
same-sex couples, faith schools will also be able to explain the
relevant tenets of their religion on this
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000027">I

Sudbury and Lord Elton, about the Secretary of State ensuring that
teaching about marriage is given in accordance with religious tenets.
It is important for me to make the point that I fully understand the
intentions of the right reverend Prelate in the amendment that he has
put forward, but I am sure that he and other noble Lords will agree
that it is not appropriate 
<?notus-xml column=567?>for the Secretary of State to issue guidance to secure adherence to
religious doctrine in teaching. This would amount to inappropriate
interference by the state in matters properly for the relevant
religious denomination. How faith schools approach such teaching is
quite rightly a matter for the schools and faiths
themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000028">While
I think it is broadly acknowledged that the Secretary of State’s
current guidance does not impinge on faith schools’ ability to
teach in line with their doctrines, concern has also been expressed
that the duty on the Secretary of State might allow future versions of
the guidance to preclude religious schools from teaching in accordance
with their beliefs. This was a point that my noble friend Lady
Cumberlege raised—when the noble Baroness, Lady Farrington,
referred to my noble friend Lady Knight, my noble friend Lady
Cumberlege expressed this point. However, the noble Baroness, Lady
Farrington, made my response for me by saying that it is clearly not
the intention behind this legislation to envisage circumstances in
which any Secretary of State might seek to interfere with matters of
religious doctrine in the future. We are framing this legislation as
things stand at the moment, and there is no way in which we are
suggesting that a future Secretary of State might do anything
different, but nor can I say from this Dispatch Box that things may not
change in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000029">The

the existing legislation already makes clear that it is absolutely
inappropriate for material to be used that would not have regard for
religious faiths. For the Secretary of State to issue guidance
specifying that a particular version of marriage be endorsed counter to
a school’s ethos, and by extension the religious background of
many of its pupils, would not meet this criterion that already exists
in legislation. I emphasise that point in response to my noble friend,
Lady Cumberlege, who expressed concern that the new legislation would
somehow remove some protection from schools that are against promoting
same-sex couples being able to marry. I want to emphasise that that is
absolutely not the
case.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062454000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000030">This
country has a strong tradition of schools with a religious character;
they are a valued part of our education system. It would be pointless
to maintain a system of designation if such schools were unable to
teach in accordance with the tenets of their religion. For this
designation to have significance, the school has to deliver what it was
set up for. The inherent right of schools to deliver their curriculum
and to interpret guidance according to their ethos is evident in their
existence as such schools. As I have described previously, such schools
do already teach about topics that may be considered sensitive, such as
divorce, and they do so without
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000031">While

will honour that commitment to continue to consider it and to discuss
it further. However, I was about to say that clearly, in the course of
doing that, one of the things that we will want to do is to take

leads me on nicely to conclude by addressing the noble Lord, Lord
Anderson of Swansea, as he suggested that the Government have not been
minded to listen to debate through the passage of this Bill and make
amendments. To give him some comfort and to remind the House that that
is not the case, I will point out that in the Bill so far the
Government have agreed to an amendment which includes a review of civil
partnership. We have included an amendment to the Public Order Act and
we have some amendments which clarify things around ecclesiastical law
which has been requested by the churches. We have made an amendment to
protect the spouses of transpeople so that if they continue in those
marriages they retain the pension rights from the terms when they were
originally married. We have further protected employed chaplains, we
have made some changes for the Church in Wales, and we have dealt with
void marriages. We are listening to the debates that are taking place
in your Lordships’ House, as we did in the other House through
the passage of this Bill. If we think that it is necessary to clarify

amendment is about the institutional religious character of schools. It
is about ensuring that the statutory framework addresses and
accommodates the school’s need to provide teaching that is in
accordance with its religious tenets when it formulates its policy on
teaching about sex and relationships. There is, rightly, guidance from
the Secretary of State about that policy, and the school needs to take
account of it. It should not have to rely on the Human Rights Act, but
should actually have it built into the guidance. Since we have
guidance, it ought to address this particular issue, rather than the
church schools being left in a position of having to act in a way that
is not clear within the guidance. I would hope that that does something
to respond to the direct question which I was asked by the noble
Baroness, Lady Richardson. I believe that there needs to be guidance to
avoid criticism of the family relationships to which she referred. As
the Minister said, the current requirement for guidance was inserted in
the 1996 Act in 2000. My belief remains that there needs to be guidance
on this matter to take note of the changes brought about by the Bill.
We need to acknowledge that those are real changes; otherwise, there
would be no point having the Bill. We need to respond to the particular
needs of schools of a religious character, not least in terms of the
tenets of their trust deeds. It is not for the Secretary of State to

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for repeating the Statement. I join in his comments of support for
Doreen and Neville Lawrence and their family. I suspect that no words
can give comfort in a situation such as this. Having had to cope with
the horror and the tragedy of the murder of their son Stephen, they had
almost 20 years of campaigning for justice before anyone was brought to
book for his murder. They then had to wait for a public inquiry into
the Metropolitan Police’s handling of the investigation and the
institutionalised racism at that time. We are still awaiting action to
address the devastating failures and shocking decisions made by the
Metropolitan Police at the time of Stephen’s
murder<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000055">Today,
we have these disgusting allegations. Officers were tasked to spy on
the Lawrence family to find “dirt” on them and
their supporters. It is alleged that police officers logged who went in
and out of the Lawrence family home, yet at the same time they were
failing to gather sufficient evidence to prosecute Gary Dobson and
David Norris, and any other suspects at the time. We can only imagine
the hurt, distress and anger—and also the deep sadness and sense
of betrayal that the Lawrence family and their supporters must continue
to feel. With allegations made last year that corruption within the
Metropolitan Police contributed to the failure to get
justice for the Lawrence family, we called for a wider public inquiry
into those allegations of corruption and we also considered it an
opportunity to address more widely the progress within the police in
addressing racism. Instead, the Home Secretary allowed the Metropolitan
Police to review itself and, as the noble Lord has indicated today,
asked Mark Ellison QC to review the paper work on this specific
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:33:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000056">It
would be helpful today for the Minister to update your
Lordships’ House on the progress in that case. He said something
about it but it would help to have a little bit more information. Does
he consider whether there is any overlap in these new
allegations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:33:35"></hs_TimeCode>? A
specific concern is whether police officers providing information to Mr
Ellison have withheld relevant information from him. Will the noble
Lord comment on that specific point? We have previously endorsed the
call of Doreen Lawrence, Stephen’s mother, for the reinstitution
of a public inquiry to examine any dereliction of duty by the
Metropolitan Police at the time of Stephen’s murder and, more
widely the progress made in implementing the Macpherson report’s
70 recommendations. We continue to support that

the substance of today’s allegations, clearly this links in with
wider concerns, as the Minister has addressed, about the use of
undercover and covert operations by the police. Noble Lords will be
aware that I have previously raised in your Lordships’ House 
<?notus-xml column=573?>concerns over the identities of dead children being used by officers,
without the consent or the knowledge of their families. We have had
evidence of shocking allegations and instances of inappropriate
relationships. I do know whether the Minister had the opportunity to
read the <I>Guardian</I> magazine this weekend, but I would recommend
the article by Rob Evans and Paul Lewis on the activities of SDS police
officers. The impact of their activities on individuals shows how
serious and devastating such behaviour can
be.</hs_para>

know that the noble Lord shares our concern about transparency in any
investigation on inquiries into these issues. I spoke to him earlier
about this and, as he said, the only way to restore public and
professional confidence is to have openness in the investigation and
openness in the actions taken to address any problems. We have some
concerns about the Home Secretary’s approach in wrapping these
allegations together with the pre-existing investigation being
undertaken by Derbyshire’s Chief Constable Creedon and
supervised by the
IPPC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>. That
investigation is looking at complex and covert investigations into
environmental and animal rights groups that go back many years. In the
past month, new allegations have been made about corporate protests and
potential undercover police involvement. This is another monster of an
inquiry being undertaken by the IPCC. It is already taken 20 months and
cost £1.2 million, although no arrests have yet been made. This
will take some years. Alongside Hillsborough, the scoping of Orgreave,
and many other investigations, it is unclear whether the IPCC will be
able to prioritise and deal with all those issues in an appropriate
timescale. Rightly, these are all huge issues of
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:36:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000059">In
addition to the undercover element, there is a common theme. It was so
powerfully evidenced in relation to Hillsborough, as the noble Lord and
I discussed at the time, and is now reinforced in the case of the
Lawrence family—namely, that police institutions seek to
undermine victims. Police institutions try to smear those seeking
justice as being agitators or they even try to find some evidence of
their being criminals—trying to smear them in the process. The
agony that the Lawrence family has endured since the day Stephen was
murdered has also made this case uniquely damaging to British policing
and public confidence. Unless that is effectively and properly dealt
with, not only will that lack of confidence endure, it will undermine
the confidence of the majority of police officers who seek to serve the
public honestly and
decently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:37:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062454000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#13062454000060">We
now have two different inquiries: the investigation, Operation Herne,
and the new Ellison review dealing with very similar things. I have a
few questions for the noble Lord. I want to get to the bottom of
whether the Government are absolutely confident that these inquiries
will, first, be sufficiently focused; and, secondly, have complete
co-operation from police officers. They also have to ensure that
whistleblowers will be sufficiently empowered and protected to come
forward. A number of recent cases show that the actions of
whistleblowers have been vital in exposing the allegations of serious
corruption within public institutions. Crucially, we seek an assurance
that there is no information or evidence that could be lost in a black
hole between the different
inquiries.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:38:14"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

corruption allegations; and a clear need for a wider inquiry as Doreen
Lawrence, Stephen’s mother, has called for. We need urgent

were married, they had three children who went to school regularly, and
they played tennis. Five Englishmen set upon their eldest son and
murdered him in the street. At the time the community, in its grief,
was concerned about how the police were reacting to the death of an 18
year-old<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:46:28"></hs_TimeCode>. On the
night of the murder, I went to the hospital and had to drive along the
road, but the police had not cordoned off the area where Stephen had
been murdered. I have said this many times, but today I can say it
publicly: we were all very concerned.</hs_para>

knowledge of undercover operations at the extreme end is that it is a
critical and highly dangerous part of policing. Penetrating officers
into organised crime groups is difficult. It is 
<?notus-xml column=577?>critical—as the Front Bench has already acknowledged—and a
very dangerous involvement indeed, which was not the case with Lawrence

profess<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T19:51:49"></hs_TimeCode>ional
compass of the service are there first. It needs leadership
to hold it together and move it forward. This is a drum I have beaten
here before, as the Minister knows. I would like reassurance
from him that the whole question of
leadership—not the College of Policing but leadership—is
being addressed as a matter of urgency within the Home
Office. It is to do with recruiting and training the right people,
giving them the space to operate and encouraging leadership rather than
management. With good leadership, this sort of thing should not and

sentiment expressed with regard to the tragedy and the further agony
that the Lawrence family will experience on realising that the
undercover operation was actually trying to implicate them—the
nasty part of British policing. Two questions arise. The Macpherson
inquiry talked about institutional racism. Would that inquiry have
stopped talking about institutional racism if it had known that the
police were involved in such an undercover operation? Would it not have
recommended at that stage the need to criminally investigate police who
were involved in this undercover operation? I raise this because there
has been botched operation after botched operation in the investigation

second point concerns the nature of the investigation, which the noble
Baroness from the Opposition spoke about. I have full confidence in
the IPCC and how it is supervised. However, public
perception is still that the police and others tend to investigate
themselves no matter how one supervises them. I do not believe in that.

acted wrongfully. We need clear answers and that can come about only

is absolutely right. The Macpherson inquiry was only
as good as the information that was made available to it. I

content to spend taxpayers’ money paying a company that fails to

that, by failing to hold Atos to account, they will encourage it to
behave in ways that it believes its paymaster will approve rather than

Thomas of Winchester:</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for giving us this opportunity to raise
again the issue of PIP and the higher rate mobility component. This, of
course, is the gateway to the Motability scheme which 
<?notus-xml column=586?>enables so many disabled people—including myself—to get
about. I declare that interest.</hs_para>

PIP in general, but turning to these regulations, I am pleased that
Motability has stated that it aims to avoid recovering vehicles from
hospital in-patients affected by this change. If the car has been
adapted to suit the claimant’s condition, then it could be very
expensive for a Motability car to be recovered and for the claimant to
apply again when he or she comes out of hospital, and another
Motability car has to be adapted in due course. Presumably the payment
of the higher rate mobility component of DLA will continue to be paid
if a person is in hospital for more than four weeks. Perhaps the
Minister could tell me if that is the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000031">Turning
to other matters, I am very glad that the DWP is reopening the
consultation which it failed to do on the final version of the PIP
criteria. Even though the amending regulations should make the position
clear, none of us who has taken part in these discussions
has any confidence that the assessors will
properly take the criteria in the amending regulations into
account—even though they are mandatory. I hope that the new
consultation will not be an empty exercise and that the DWP will take
on board what disabled people say and change the original criteria if
the consultation makes it clear that this should
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000032">One
matter which I am very disturbed about is the figure of 600,000
claimants that the Government say will disappear from their books once
PIP is introduced. Where did the DWP get this figure from? Is it saying
that these people are not disabled enough, or that they are now
receiving DLA fraudulently? How closely is it in touch with the
Department of Health, which might be able to enlighten it about
improvements in treatments for many disabled people, meaning that they
are likely to live longer with their disabilities?</hs_para>

constantly is that PIP is to be targeted at those who need it most.
However, although that sounds good and right, it is actually pretty
meaningless because DLA and PIP are not to be means-tested. So one is
left with a subjective judgment by a DWP decision-maker—heavily
influenced by the assessor. Without targets, how will the
decision-maker judge one person against another? Outside the Chamber,
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, said they would need the judgment of
Solomon. Instead, they have the judgment of Atos. I know which I
prefer.</hs_para>

from the noble Lord about the Atos contracts, so I shall not repeat
those facts, which are very disturbing. In general, I supported the

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I want to make three brief points, but
first declare an interest. Two members of my extended family have
Motability cars and they are their lifeline. I shall make a point about
statistics, one about appeals and finally a point about isolation. I
shall try to be quick because we are pressed for time.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=587?><hs_para UID="1306251000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000036">On statistics, as I
recall when we were doing the Welfare Reform Bill, we were told that
something like 600,000 of those getting the higher rate DLA mobility
component would drop and about 200,000 of those on a lower rate would
go up, leaving a net loss of 400,000 people on DLA mob. As understand
it from our debates at the time, something like 27% of those people
converted their DLA higher rate mob into a car. Therefore it means we
are talking about the loss of potentially 180,000 Motability cars from
disabled people who are dependent upon them. These are cars which in
many cases have been extremely expensively adapted to them and
therefore are of relatively little use for people following after,
because they have been customised. This leaves the disabled person
without any ability to afford alternative transport, because they too
cannot afford those adaptations done by Motability. So on my first
point about statistics, I think we are dealing with about 180,000 cars.
If the Minister can correct me on this, I should be pleased to know,
but it is a huge number.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1306251000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000037">Secondly, there are
appeals. At the moment, between 40% and 50% of all appeals on DLA are
successful. One reason is that there is often a considerable time
between the DLA assessment and the appeal, by which point someone may
have got worse or, possibly, better and, as a result, the evidence is
contested. The problem is the length of time taken to hear the appeal.
If it takes six months to hear an appeal against Atos, you lose your
car after one month, you win your appeal, but then you have to wait for
a new car with all the expensive adaptations while 180,000 cars are
effectively on the scrapheap, that seems a foolish and unwise use of
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T20:30:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

can we overcome that? We have to link the transitional arrangement
under which you can hold on to your car to the end of the appeals
procedure. That could be three months; it could be six months. I am
sure that the Minister will say, “That would encourage everyone
to appeal”. Possibly, but we could at least have a
decision-maker review in the first place, which would winnow out some
and get that information looped back to the person appealing. If the
Minister so chose, that would lead to an acceleration of the appeals
process, which in all decency would be a good thing in any case. It
would allow for better quality judgments, because the appeal would be
heard much closer to the original decision and would therefore be based
on the same evidence, which is not what is happening at the moment.
That would be good for both the department and the disabled
person.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000039">Can the
Minister give us an assurance that we can link the length of
time it takes to have an appeal to the transitional time
during which you can hold on to your vehicle? Otherwise, it is really
absurd. I know that the Minister can find a way around this if he
chooses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T20:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000040">The
third point is about isolation. What comes out clearly time and again
is that if you take away the Motability car, you turn a disabled person
from being independent to being dependent on other people. More than
that, you lock the person on whom he depends—I 
<?notus-xml column=588?>say “he”, and it is therefore likely to be his
wife—into a shared isolation with him. She has to be permanently
his runaround carer as well as his home carer, because he has no
capacity to have any independent life apart from her support. That
locks them into a shadowy dance into
isolation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T20:32:08"></hs_TimeCode>, which
is disastrous for them
both.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000041">Those are
my three points: the number of cars that we are talking about, which I
judge to be about 180,000; the problem of the length of time to hear
appeals, which mean that more cars will be lost which then have to be
restored—unless the Minister can calibrate and bring together
the two; and, thirdly, the need to ensure that we do not send disabled
people and their carers into isolation. That is particularly marked in
rural areas. There, disabled people have few options. They cannot
afford taxis, they do not have buses, they cannot walk those distances,
and they cannot run scooters because the distances are too far. Without
their Motability car, they are locked into their home as well as their
isolation, as are their partners. For those three reasons, I very much
hope that the Minister can give us more satisfactory reasons this
evening than we have had so
far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T20:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000042"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hardie" PimsId="835" UID="1306251000215" xid="1255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000215">Lord
Hardie:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as honorary
president of Capability Scotland and share noble Lords’ concern
about the changes to the regulatory regime. In that regard, I refer
noble Lords to my observations of 13 February at cols. 737-78, which I
shall not repeat. The present regulations, among other things, affect
claimants who have entered into a Motability agreement and are
thereafter hospitalised. The noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester,
derived some comfort from the assurance that Motability will not
recover those vehicles if a patient is hospitalised, but if one reads
paragraph 7.10 of the Explanatory Notes, one sees that that is not what
the Government have said. They say that the Motability scheme has
stated that it would aim to avoid recovering vehicles from hospital
in-patients affected by that change.</hs_para>

is not the absolute assurance that hospital patients will not lose
their vehicles. Without such an assurance, the reality is that if a
person is in hospital for a particularly long period, the payments made
by the department to Motability on behalf of the patients will not be
made and the vehicle—the car, motorised scooter or motorised
wheelchair—may well be recovered. Indeed, the Explanatory Notes
recognise that if it has to be recovered, Motability will give some
allowance, depending on the condition of the vehicle when it is
recovered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000044">These
are concerns, because the present system means that payments direct to
Motability continue to be made after the hospitalisation of a claimant.
That is recognised as an exception to the rule that social security
benefits are affected after hospitalisation. In my view there is a good
reason for that, because these payments are payments of a capital
nature to enable people to have the necessary facilities to give them
the independence that they need. They are different from revenue paid
direct to the person for their maintenance.</hs_para>

10 and 11 remove this exemption for no good reason. It is no answer to
say that it is intended to bring Motability users into line with 
<?notus-xml column=589?>other recipients of DLA or PIP. As I have sought to explain,
they are in a different position to the other claimants. Moreover, the
consequences of this change are draconian. There is a real risk of the
repossession of necessary equipment, resulting in the inability of such
claimants to lead independent lives after they leave hospital until
they are able to renegotiate other Motability contracts. The noble
Baroness, Lady Hollis, explained the complexities of that. There will
be a delay in obtaining necessary equipment, during which period these
people will not be able to live the independent lives that they have
enjoyed previously. Can the Minister advise the House what timescale is
involved between the order and delivery of a purpose-built powered
wheelchair, scooter or modified
vehicle?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000046">I also
ask the Minister what is the urgency in promoting this change,
particularly in view of the announcement by the DWP on 17 June, already
mentioned, of a further consultation on the mobility component of PIP?
Would it not make sense to have an integrated approach and to leave
these changes to form part of the consultation process? Has there been
any consultation with interested parties or the public at large about
this significant change? If the Government are not willing to await the
outcome of the consultation, can the Minister tell the House how many
people will be affected by this proposed
change?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0002.htm#1306251000047">The
loss of a wheelchair or car may have greater implications in different

better—although not ideal—transport facilities for

is for an amalgam of historic industrial reasons, which we will not go
into now. Those people stand to lose, and many are in areas with the
lowest incomes per head in these islands—places such as Blaenau
Gwent and Merthyr Tydfil, where I used to live, and where almost 13% of
the population have a dependency on the mobility component. In my
next-door area of Anglesey, which has one of the lowest GVAs per head
of anywhere in the United Kingdom, at just 55% of the UK average, there
is a caseload of 7.2%. That is in a rural area where they do not have

Lord Hardie, made the very interesting point that if direct payments
are made, the Government must know that information. Even if they do
not, irrespective of the fact that a number of people will choose no
longer to lease a vehicle, a number will automatically lose theirs
simply by virtue of the fact that they will no longer be entitled to
the enhanced rate when they transfer to PIP. The Government surely must

the risk of running slightly wide of the Motion, has the Minister given

clearly failing to help disabled people into work. The latest report
from the Employment Related Services Association suggests 
<?notus-xml column=594?>that the numbers of people on ESA getting a job start as a result of
referral to the Work Programme are terribly low: just 6% of referrals

framing this answer because the debate was very wide but the
regulations we are discussing are actually extremely narrow. What we
are actually discussing is bringing the treatment of patients in
hospital into line between those who receive Motability and those who
stop receiving it after a certain period. There was an exemption for
the Motability element and we are just bringing the two into line. I
acknowledge that there has been a very wide debate on the whole area

will set a little bit of context by saying that even in these hard
economic times this Government continue to spend around £50
billion a year on disabled people and services to enable those who face
the greatest barrier to participate fully in society. That figure
compares well internationally. We spend almost double the OECD average
as a percentage of GDP—2.4% against the OECD average of 1.3%.
Only two out of the 34 OECD countries spend more. Through
the reforms of DLA and the introduction of PIP, we will make sure that
the billions we spend provide more targeted support to those who need
it most. Three million people will continue to get DLA or PIP and half
a million will actually get more under the new system.</hs_para>

we have sought to ensure that those who lose out are those whose
disabilities have the least impact on their participation in society.

UK has a proud history in furthering the rights of disabled people and
we want to ensure that all people are treated fairly. The provisions
under debate, which also apply to claimants of PIP, are a case in hand.
They ensure that everyone receiving the mobility component of DLA or
PIP in the future will be subject to the same payment rules, whether or
not they have a Motability vehicle. The history of this was that when
the mobility component of DLA stopped being paid to hospital
in-patients in 1996, transitional provisions were built in, including a
measure which allowed for payments to continue in order to cover the
costs of the lease on a Motability vehicle. These arrangements 
<?notus-xml column=595?>represented a reasonable adjustment at the time for those in-patients
who were committed to a mobility contract when the rules changed.

response to the question from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie,

that noble Lords would agree that to continue paying a benefit intended
to meet the additional costs of disability indefinitely when they are
already being met by the NHS would be a waste of financial resource,
regardless of the financial climate. Adult in-patients will continue to
receive their DLA for 28 days, which compares with an OECD estimate of
the average hospital stay of between seven and eight days, and benefit

consultation told us that we needed to strike a better balance between
attaining equal treatment for all DLA recipients in hospital in the
future while recognising the particular concerns of those who currently
have a Motability vehicle. In particular, concerns were expressed about
existing Motability users who could not have planned for these new
arrangements at the time they took out their lease. We have therefore
introduced transitional protection for those people who had a
Motability vehicle and were in hospital when the new rules came in.
This will allow customers who were in hospital on 8 April to run out
their current lease. However, in contrast to the previous provisions,
we have set a backstop so that the protection will end after three
years. I think noble Lords will agree that this is an extremely
generous transitional protection
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306251000081">Therefore,

assure noble Lords that we have worked closely with Motability on this

which to recover the vehicle. Motability has also said that when a
vehicle is returned any advance payment outstanding will be returned on
a pro rata

these protections end, Motability will discuss with scheme users the
return of the vehicle and, on a case by case basis, whether it may be
more appropriate to defer the return of the vehicle. Clearly, if

will give noble Lords some figures around the scale of the
issue—the numbers that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie,

Motability vehicles when the new rules came in on 8 April. As I
mentioned earlier, these people will be allowed to run their lease
down, but will be subject to a backstop of three years’
protection. In the future, we estimate that there may be around 800 new
in-patients a year who have a Motability vehicle, remain in hospital
beyond 28 days or 84 days and will be subject to the new rules. These

Motability vehicle. If that figure is correct, which I believe it to
be, then he can surely extrapolate that to the numbers of gross losers
coming down from high rate DLA mobility, which I understand, again
relying on memory, was 600,000. Therefore, 29% of 600,000 brings me to

marriage did not of itself amount to discriminating or harassing
another, that would provide reassurance and a degree of legal

doubt that offences regarding stirring up hatred on the grounds of
sexual orientation do not outlaw the reasonable expression of the view
that marriage should be between a man and a woman. We were able to

Dear:</Member></B> My Lords, by any stretch of the imagination same-sex
marriage is something of a social experiment. Its consequences cannot
accurately be foretold, certainly not in this country. Amendment 47
requires a review of the legislation to be conducted by a Lord Justice
of Appeal, two years and again five years after the Act is 
<?notus-xml column=605?>passed, with reports published within six months of each of those two
reviews. If the amendment is carried, the reviews are to focus
particularly on the impact of the legislation, first on civil liberty
and secondly on the rates of opposite and same-sex
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306251000127">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T21:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>
reasoning behind the amendment is that the impact of same-sex marriage
on marriage rates should be reviewed, because evidence shows that
redefining marriage undermines support for marriage in the wider
society. I draw two examples. After same-sex marriage was introduced in
Spain, marriages across the whole population plummeted by more than 20%
in the following six years. It has been said that the relaxation of
divorce laws that occurred at about the same time as the introduction
of same-sex marriage had something to do with this fall. No doubt it
did, but it could not account for the full extent of that 20% fall.
Without going into the detail, the Netherlands also saw a significant
fall in marriage rates after marriage was redefined
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306251000128">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T21:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>
focus of the reviews on the consequences of same-sex marriage for civil
liberty will enable evaluation of the effectiveness of the
Government’s quadruple lock. More broadly, many civil liberty
concerns, some of which we have just heard again in the preceding
amendment, have been raised with respect to the Bill, only to be
largely dismissed by the Government and other supporters of the
legislation. With the greatest respect for the Minister, I must say
that we have now seen more than 50 amendments in Committee. On several
occasions I would have expected words from the Front Bench along the
lines of, “We will take away what has been said and consider
it”, or, “We intend to review what has been said in the
Chamber”, or, “I will take this away and discuss what he
has said with the noble Lord”. I can think of only two examples
of this taking place. If the Minister can disabuse me of the idea that
only two or three amendments have received that sort of response, I
will be delighted to know how many more there
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306251000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306251000129">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T21:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>
seems to me that the noble Baroness’s instructions are heavily
annotated with, “Do not concede”. From my standpoint, and
that of others who have spoken to me in the margins of Committee before
this third day, it seems that the Government are putting some sort of
stone wall around the Bill, and refusing to concede anything at all of
any substance. Whether that is right or not—and I look forward
to being disabused of that idea—I would be delighted to know
that the Government are going to take away substantial parts of this

that to one side, the reviews set out in the amendment will be able to
consider the extent to which the Government’s assurances have
been vindicated or contradicted by events. Concerns about the impact of
same-sex marriage on civil liberty arise partly because of what has
already happened. Again, we have just had a comment on that in the
preceding amendment. Believers in traditional marriage have been
punished, both in the UK under the current definition of marriage, and
also internationally in those countries which have redefined marriage.
We have heard the case of Aidan Smith, which has been much quoted in
the last three days of Committee, and was referred to again by the

does, and I am sure that it will. I say to the Front Bench that if the
Government are so very confident that there is nothing to fear and that
the Bill is watertight—and I would be delighted to find that
that were the case—it follows that they should have no fear of
demonstrating its success by those reviews. I am not so sure
necessarily that that will follow. To go out to public consultation, to
go out to opinion polls as to where this goes—we have heard this
debated in your Lordships’ House in the past. On the one hand,
83% of people taking part in the consultation on the Bill were
apparently against it. The ComRes poll and the bulging postbags that we
have heard about all seem to show that the Bill is not a very good
idea. On the other hand, the polls that have been put forward by
Stonewall and others suggest that the Bill is probably a very good
idea. Going out to the public in those sorts of ways is not going to
produce much of a result. To measure the result of the Bill at the
two-year point and the five-year point, and having it done
independently and with judicial scrutiny, seems to me to be the way to
resolve whether it is going to work and will allay a great deal of
public concern which exists at the moment. I beg to

that all Acts—or certainly all major Acts—should be

post-legislative scrutiny, seeing whether it has all worked out
properly or at least as Parliament has intended. From that point of

well. I find it extremely difficult to go along with the noble Lord. I

a post-legislative review is that we did not have any
pre-legislation. That is the great defect. In a Bill of this sort with
such far-reaching consequences, there should have been pre-legislation
so that all the possibilities could have been ironed out over quite a
long period and then a Bill which had considered all the consequences
could have been brought before Parliament. Indeed, perhaps there would

Dear, on the principle of the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart,
is absolutely right that in this amendment we can make up for past
omissions—things that should have happened but have not. I am
conscious that, at this moment, the Mental Capacity Act is subject to
post-legislative scrutiny, which has been very successful. We have the
principle already and I am sure that we have done it with other Acts in
the past. The National Health Service, about which I know a bit, is
simply an organ of the state, of Parliament, and it is endlessly under
scrutiny. At the moment, the Care Quality Commission is going through
the wringer, as we know, because people are so concerned that the
regulator is not doing the job that people hoped it
would.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000002">Having

different cases, I find it interesting that throughout this Committee

legislation. Yet we hear of these cases all the time and this is before

absolutely unnecessary in the terms put forward by the noble Lord, Lord
Dear. I think that the process that the noble Lord suggests is flawed
and unnecessary. However, I am a great fan of post-legislative scrutiny
and I know that the committee looking into the Mental Capacity Act is
doing a splendid job. I think that every Act should be subject to
pre-legislative and post-legislative scrutiny as a matter of course, so
I would not be against post-legislative scrutiny, but I am utterly
against the sort of judicial process that the noble Lord speaks
of.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306256000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000004">I say to
my noble friend Lord Anderson that I find it slightly offensive that he

laboratory experiment. I wish to put that on

and I think that there will be some standard post-implementation
evaluation of the Bill, which will be very welcome, but that will
rightly not take place for some time. I ask the noble Lord whether he
looked at his own marriage one or two years after he entered wedded
bliss. I suspect not. In same-sex marriages we tend to think about the

suitable to ask a Lord Justice to do this sort of work. The sort of
inquiries that Lord Justices and other judges are asked to do are
usually into some specific matter in which their talent and
fact-finding is thought to be of particular importance. It has been
said that the results of their recommendations are often not quite as
influential as the findings that they make on facts. Anyhow,
post-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, as with other Bills, 
<?notus-xml column=611?>would be extremely valuable. It has been said more than once that
marriage is the building block of our society. If you change the
building blocks, that is quite likely to produce some change in the
building, whether for good or bad. It would be right to have this as a
subject of post-legislative scrutiny. So far as my marriage is

noble Lords that the Bill, if enacted, should be reviewed, as is
standard practice for any significant legislation. Whether they are for
or against the Bill, noble Lords are pushing at an open door. Let me
address quickly the slightly different point made by the noble Lord,
Lord Dear—the argument that there have been few changes to the
Bill during its passage. I point him to the comprehensive answer that
my noble friend Lady Stowell gave to counter that point when the noble
Lord, Lord Anderson, made it earlier.</hs_para>

how this legislation works, we agree with the principle. I welcome the
support that has come from my noble friends Lord Fowler, Lord Cormack
and Lady Cumberlege, my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay and the
noble Baroness, Lady Royall. We would envisage post-legislative
scrutiny covering issues such as an assessment of how the Act has
worked in practice, which would no doubt address the kind of concerns
that the noble Lord, Lord Dear, has mentioned, should they arise. We
also envisage it covering: when and how different provisions have been
brought into operation; any provisions that have not been brought into
force, or enabling powers not used; details of the associated delegated
legislation, guidance documents or other relevant material prepared or
issued in connection with the Act; and any specific legal or drafting
difficulties that had been matters of public concern. That was perhaps
the kind of issue that the noble Lord, Lord Dear, was talking
about—for example, where litigation has resulted, as the right
reverend Prelate mentioned on the last grouping.</hs_para>

such a review needs to be carefully considered, with some flexibility
built into the process, which is why arrangements for review are
typically not set out within a Bill. In line with established Cabinet
Office procedures, a memorandum will be produced containing a
preliminary assessment of how the Act has turned out in reality,
measured by the objectives set out during the passage of the
Bill—including, for example, the protections mentioned by the
noble Lord, Lord Anderson. That would be part of the way in which the
Act would be reviewed. It will then be a matter for a Select Committee
to determine whether it wants to go on to hold a wider post-legislative
inquiry into the Act. I thank my noble friends for the support they
have given on the process. The convention is that a review is
undertaken three to five years after Royal Assent—perhaps
earlier than the noble Baroness indicated—in order to provide

readily admit that there was a time when referendums were alien to our
British tradition. Those of my grandparents’ generation never
got to vote in any referendums. Of course, things have changed in
recent years. Leaving aside the vote on Sunday opening of public houses
in Wales, there was in 1975 the Common Market referendum; in 1979 the
first devolution referendums; in 1997 the second devolution
referendums; in 2011 the Welsh Assembly referendum; and of course there
was the referendum on PR for Westminster elections in May 2011. If the
Prime Minister has his way, in 2017 there will be a further referendum
on our future membership of the European Union. That proposed
referendum is on a relatively complex matter. By contrast, the
referendum on this Bill would be a simple choice. In my view, there is
a far greater public interest on this issue than in several of the
other referendums. There is a clear constitutional precedent for the
use of referendums now in decision-making and clearly the Government
have no objection in principle to the use of
referendums.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000026">What
is it about this particular issue that merits the provision of a
referendum? I give three main reasons. First, there is the magnitude of
the change. In the first instance, we need to recognise the very
radical nature of the change proposed by the Bill. While there is no
denying that aspects of marriage have changed over the years, the basic
definition that it is a lifelong commitment of a man and a woman in a
potentially procreative context has not changed for millennia. Indeed,
there is a very real sense in which marriage predates the state and in
which our marriage laws do not so much define marriage as reflect a
pre-existing definition. In that context, seeking to redefine marriage
is revolutionary: first, because marriage has been defined 
<?notus-xml column=614?>in one way for so long; and secondly, because we are seeking to use a
political means to redefine something that was not defined politically
in the first place. Many champions of the limited state would suggest
that we should respect the boundary between civil society and the state
and not engage in such projects. However, if one is to do so, the need
for a very clear mandate becomes particularly
developed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000027">Secondly,
there is the magnitude of the change in the absence of that electoral
mandate. Surely no person speaking on behalf of the Government can
plausibly claim that there is an electoral mandate for this change. We
need to understand that there has been no mandate. It is one thing to
seek to introduce a more modest change without an electoral mandate but
to engage in this kind of fundamental change without such a mandate is
frankly shocking. There was no manifesto commitment from any party
within the coalition or from my own party without. Some have sought to
point to the Conservative Party’s <I>A Contract for
Equalities</I> as justification but that will not do. It was an
entirely separate document from the 2010 manifesto, published just
three days before the election and long after postal voting had begun.
Moreover, that contract did not commit to redefine marriage, only to
consider reclassifying civil partnerships as marriage—something
that would have involved only amending the Civil Partnership Act, not
rewriting the Marriage Act. Equally, during that election campaign the
then leader of the Opposition told Sky News that he had no plans to
redefine marriage. Of course, during the passage of the Civil
Partnership Act it was made clear from the then Government’s
Front Bench that that did not constitute a step towards equal marriage.
Thus, the strength of particular pressure groups appears to be quite
formidable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000028">Thirdly,
there is the violation of constitutional due process. In this
mandate-less context for a very far-reaching change, one would have
expected the Government to tread with some deliberate care and to
strive to make up for the lack of an electoral mandate by being careful
to do everything very properly: conducting a number of high-quality
consultations, perhaps publishing a Green Paper and then a White Paper,
or perhaps establishing a royal commission. One would certainly have
expected a draft Bill and some form of pre-legislative scrutiny by a
Joint Committee of both Houses. The only thing we got was a single and
very flawed consultation process. In the first instance of that
process, all submissions were anonymous so there was nothing to stop
people with strong views making multiple submissions. Moreover, the
anonymity also means that we have no way of knowing what proportion of
submissions came from abroad, perhaps in response to a particular
foreign pressure group. That should certainly be considered in light of
the fact that those submissions were not made by British citizens who
stand to be affected by any change in our domestic law.</hs_para>

the lack of regard for the electorate and the failure to bother with a
manifesto mandate, the Government first intimated that the consultation
would be on how, not whether, to redefine marriage. After protests, it
was agreed that the first question should ask people whether they
supported a redefinition 
<?notus-xml column=615?>of marriage. Mindful of that first question and the fact that it was
answered by the Coalition for Marriage petition, the coalition asked
the Government in turn whether signatories to the petition could be
counted as submissions in the process. They were assured that
signatories would be counted as submissions to the consultation and
signatories acted accordingly. That assurance proved wholly worthless
and was totally abandoned by the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T22:15:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

imagine the outrage of those who were so advised when the Government
announced after the conclusion of the consultation that it was not
counting the 500,000 Coalition for Marriage signatures that were
delivered to them as submissions to the consultations. The only words
of explanation provided were that of course the Government took the
petition signatories into consideration but not as submissions to their
consultation, and that, back to their earlier message, the consultation
was never about the “whether” but about the
“how”. The end result was that the Government could claim
that 53% of submissions were in favour of redefining
marriage.</hs_para>

the 500,000 petition signatures been included, they would have provided
a far more robust source of data since each signature came with a name
and an address proving that they were British resident citizens. The
result would have then been 83% against. As it was, the so-called
consultation carried out by the Government proved worthless and totally
bogus. As if that was not enough, the Government then announced that
they intended to make the changes they proposed even more radical by
extending the project from the redefinition of civil marriage to the
redefinition of marriage per se. Seldom can a Bill with such
far-reaching consequences be developed with such scant regard for
constitutional

scrutiny, over which I will go fairly speedily. At Second Reading in

deliver their speeches. They were in fact all whipped to attend. When
it went to Committee, instead of allowing all Members to speak, vote
and move amendments, which the other place had done on much lesser
issues, the Bill was committed to a Committee of just 19 Members. By
convention, Bills affecting the constitution—I submit this is
certainly such a Bill—are debated by a Committee of the whole
House. This was sent to a Public Bill Committee and the Second Reading
Division was not accurately reflected in the allocation of Committee
seats. Fifteen of the 19 on the Committee had voted for the Bill.
Unsurprisingly, no amendments were made. The assumption was, and
remains, that the Government had got it essentially right from the
start. Spokesmen for the Government and the Opposition were joint
cheerleaders for the Bill. Of the words spoken at Committee, 60% came
from three dissenters. The Opposition moved only 15 amendments in five
days of debate, 11 of them being discussed in a single 30-minute
debate.</hs_para>

benefits. Numerous Members wanted to speak during the debate on the
very vital conscience amendments but were unable to do so because there
was inadequate time. Eight amendments were selected but there was time
to divide on only three. By contrast, despite the four and a half hours
allocated, there were no Divisions at all on humanist weddings and
transsexual benefits. There were suggestions that this was a free vote,
but one Front-Bencher was compelled to remove his name from all
amendments on Report and there was clear evidence of substantial
pressure put on Members. A cross-party group of MPs was so aggrieved
about the way in which the Bill was handled in the other place that
they took the unusual step of writing to Peers to highlight the
problems.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1306256000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000034">Of

period in which there has been a simple and agreed definition of
marriage, is the juggernaut now rolling at such speed? What is the
reason for the speed? Even Stonewall came round to support for
so-called equal marriage only a couple of years ago. Does Mr Cameron
have the zeal of a convert? Why is he so desperate to complete all the
stages before the Summer Recess, which has run over the timetable for a
number of other Bills that many would consider far more relevant and
important than this? Is it because this is such a neuralgic issue for
his party and for Conservative activists that he is desperately anxious
to put the issue behind him, recognising that we are now less than two
years from the next general election? Perhaps the Minister can give

short, it is very clear that when we put together the three
considerations that I have reflected upon today—the magnitude of
the change in question, which renders a democratic mandate imperative;
the lack of any democratic mandate; and the compounding of the
grievance resulting from the lack of any democratic mandate because of
the multiple offences of due process in the passage of this
Bill—we find ourselves with a very serious problem. We can kid
ourselves, pretending that it is acceptable to build far-reaching
changes on this slim and shaky foundation, and proceed speedily,
regardless of the consequences. However, that would surely be
unwise.</hs_para>

is in that context that I believe Amendment 48 is of great consequence.
As I noted at the outset, if your Lordships’ House supports
Amendment 48 it will not 
<?notus-xml column=617?>stop this Bill becoming law, but there must be a referendum that secures
majority support before the law can take effect—which Amendment
59 provides for. It would be an opportunity for the people to have
their say, not on the question of homosexuality but on the question of
their views on traditional marriage. That will serve two purposes.
First, it will compensate for the lack of an election mandate, so vital
in the context of such a far-reaching and radical measure. The debate
in your Lordships’ House has revealed some disagreement about
the state of public opinion. Different opinion polls on this issue have
been cited by my noble friend and myself. If the Government are so
confident that they have the majority of the public on their side,
surely they should have no fears about asking that same public to
express their views. There is also the additional advantage for the
Government that a referendum in favour of the Bill would cement the
change in our law. No future Government would dare to be bold enough to
seek to reverse that which the people had
endorsed.</hs_para>

it would also make up for the lack of respect for constitutional and
due process that has been exhibited massively in the development of
this Bill to date. As we know, the Prime Minister would like to have a
referendum on our membership of the European Union. I submit that
having a referendum on this marriage question is just as important if
we are to address the constitutional problems that have surrounded the
development of the Bill. By the European Union Act of two years ago,
the Government have ensured that there will be a referendum on even
relatively trivial transfers of power to Brussels—what a sense
of priorities. Some might argue that this is not a constitutional
issue; I completely
disagree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000039">Finally,
the marriage issue lends itself to a referendum because referendums
work well only when the presenting dilemma can be encapsulated in a
simple question. That is eminently the case here: “Do you
believe that the definition of marriage should change from that between
a man and a woman for life, to that between two people for
life?”. In my judgment, the text satisfies the test for holding
a referendum that it is a matter of major public concern and it is easy
to understand the choice. This would have the additional safeguard that
it would result from a settled view of the British people, rather than
from the spurious government consultation process that I have outlined.
I beg to move Amendment

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I added my name to this amendment. I
referred to the desirability of testing public opinion at Second
Reading, but I will not detain the House for more than a few moments;
the hour is late and we have had a very long exposition of the need for
a referendum, and of the deficiencies of the Government in the way that
this Bill has been handled so far. I endorse all that the noble Lord,
Lord Anderson, said in that regard; the consultation process was deeply
flawed and there has been an element of haste that was, frankly, not
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000041">My
main reason for supporting the idea of a referendum is this: we do not
know what the majority feeling is in our country on this very important
social issue. All sorts of figures have been bandied around on 
<?notus-xml column=618?>both sides. I know no more than the noble Lord, Lord Dear, the noble
Lord, Lord Anderson, or any other noble Lord in this place about what
the majority view of the public is in England and Wales. There is only

first came into politics in 1970 in the other place, I was strongly
opposed to the whole concept of the referendum. I wish that we had
never gone down that route, but we have and the noble Lord, Lord
Anderson, has indicated that. We have had referenda on a whole range of
issues and he has listed them. If it is justified—and I am not
suggesting it is not—to have a vote on the opening hours of
public houses in Wales, it is surely appropriate to give the people of
England and Wales an opportunity of saying whether or not they really
wish for the state of marriage to be changed irrevocably in our
country. This is something that should commend itself to all true
democrats. I very much hope that when we come to Report, the House will
have the opportunity to vote on this. We will be able to test the
opinion of colleagues when we are perhaps a little fresher, and, one
would hope, a little earlier in the

themselves of the married state. They know that I have reservations

should allow the public out there to say whether or not they really
want this change. A simple majority will suffice, but let them have the

particularly in the workplace. I agree that if all those on the
receiving end of harassment in the past, of which we have had examples,
and potentially in the future were lawyers with deep-lined pockets,
they could address the issues much more easily. Unfortunately, most
people are not lawyers and do not have deep-lined pockets and can
easily be subjected to harassment. Amendments were brought to try to

is revealing to note that those supporting this legislation have
focused their comments on the benefits that might accrue to the gay
community, with little or no consideration as to the effects on wider
society. In this House, we have a responsibility to the country to take
a wider view. As regards the building blocks of the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Mackay, in the 1960s and 1970s, it became common to take out
a wall between two adjoining rooms to give more space, 
<?notus-xml column=619?>generally without conducting any sort of structural survey. The result
was often structural damage costing thousands of pounds. The Bill seeks
to change the definition of marriage, and with it the structure,
meaning and purpose of the family unit, without any consideration of
the consequences for the structure and stability of society and,
importantly, for the well-being of
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T22:32:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000048">It
is important to look at this from the perspective of both types of
relationship. Let us start with commitment to care and fidelity. In
both formalised heterosexual relationships and same-sex relationships
there is due emphasis on commitment. Heterosexual marriage, however,
also requires an unequivocal pledge of fidelity to stay together to the
exclusion of others to provide a stability that is critical for
children. In same-sex marriage there is no parallel requirement of
fidelity. There is no religious, social or legal sanction to prevent a
party to the relationship having other liaisons with others of the same
sex. This devalues the importance of commitment and fidelity in the
eyes of children and can only add to the “me and my”
culture and the ever increasing number of children taken into what we
euphemistically call
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T22:33:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000049">The
bonding between parents and children of natural birth parents starts
from the very moment of birth. I am not saying for a moment that
same-sex couples cannot be excellent parents, but heterosexual parents
have an important and early advantage in giving a desired level of
stability and support to children and in helping them to adjust to, and
appreciate, those of an opposite sex to their own. What I am saying is
that these two distinct forms of relationships, equally respected by
law and society, are inherently different, and a different form of
words to describe them simply makes for clarity. To my mind, gay people
demean themselves when they seek to hide their separate identity under
the guise of the heterosexual term “marriage”. Gay people
have an absolute right to respect for their way of life, but they and
their supporters should extend the same consideration to others and
their
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T22:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306256000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306256000050">Legislation
on important social change must take into account the implications of
such change. The legislation before us was not put in any party
manifesto; there was no consultation on its merits. The Prime Minister
David Cameron explicitly ruled out shortly before the election that he
would introduce the legislation. It was effectively introduced through
the back door. The electorate as a whole has been treated with
contempt. Those with religious beliefs have been treated with contempt.
It is true that near absolute protection has been given to the Anglican
Church—not out of respect but because of the complexities of the
link between church and state, making it difficult to do anything
different. Other religions, including my own, have been neither
considered nor consulted. We were told on Wednesday that no offence was
intended in dealing with other religions; it was simply too difficult.

Amendment 48. As has been made plain throughout the debates on the
Bill, marriage is a vital institution and, as such, the subject of
redefining marriage touches people’s deepest feelings and
beliefs. It is not a change that should ever be countenanced without a
clear manifesto mandate. I know that some noble Lords have tried to
suggest that it is not always necessary to have a manifesto mandate. In

that perhaps it is possible to introduce without a mandate, although I
have to say that it does not seem particularly like best practice

When it comes to changing the definition of something that has been
defined one way for millennia and in relation to which there is a real
sense that Parliament has not so much defined marriage, but rather
reflected a pre-existing definition, it is absolutely imperative to
have a manifesto mandate. I find it shocking that such an innovation

do not understand

at Second Reading. The fact is that this bit of legislation has
undoubtedly split the country. All of us have had very abnormal
postbags and e-mails in this context. Indeed, I have had the biggest
postbag since I proposed, promoted and got through this House a Bill to
ban same-sex wards. It is quite obviously something that the public
think very strongly about. It can only really be tested through a
referendum because it not only makes such a difference to an
institution that has been around for some thousands of years but has
constitutional implications. Those are some of the reasons why there

political parties have had their say and are virtually unanimous. The
Cabinet has had its say; whether that was unanimous I do not know. The
wider Government have had their say. The House of Commons, albeit with
a so-called free vote, has had its say, and has made a decision. The
House of Lords is having its say. The only people who are not having a
say—because they have never been given the
opportunity—are the wider public and the people who are going to
be affected by the Bill. That is why I believe that there should be a

here on February 9, the drive to get same-sex marriage into law was
masterminded from 2010 onwards by an alliance between Theresa May, the
Conservative Home Secretary, Lynne Featherstone, the Lib Dem equalities

pushed the issue forward, not in Westminster, but through the Council
of Europe, culminating in March last year with a day-long
‘secret conference’ chaired by Miss Featherstone in
Strasbourg. With the public excluded for the first time in the
Council’s history, it was here that—with the active
support of Sir Nicolas Bratza, the British president of the European
Court of Human Rights (ECHR)—a deadline was set for their
planned coup of June 2013. If, by this date, ‘several
countries’ had managed to put gay marriage into law, Sir Nicolas
pledged that his court would then declare same-sex marriage to be a

10 years’ time it may well be widely, if not universally,
accepted as such. I also believe that it will ultimately have a
positive impact on society and social cohesion. It will make the status
of marriage, which I see as a vital building block of society,
available to same-sex couples and parents, and remove any possibility

Government do not believe that this is a sensible course of action, and
nor is it required. The Government’s position is that
referendums should be used only in issues of substantial constitutional
significance. Noble Lords may recall that the Constitution Committee of

of huge significance and importance to those couples who are currently
being prevented from marrying, and quite clearly from our debates this

interesting point about the question, because the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000 makes provision for how a question
should be dealt with if it is present on the introduction of the Bill,
or indeed if the wording is to be done subsequently by way of order. It
does not make any provision for what would happen if a question was
introduced at a later stage. Quite clearly, my noble friend and the

the robustness of the Government’s legal mechanisms to protect
places of worship that do not want to register same-sex weddings.
Ministers, no doubt in good faith, have promised that their quad locks

religious organisation or individual minister can be compelled to marry
same-sex couples or to permit that to happen on their premises if they
do not opt in.</hs_para>

recognise that there is an appetite to see churches compelled to opt

Government or the majority in this House, but we keep being told how
important it is that we take into account the views of young people.
That survey suggests that there would be a significant demand to test
the limits of the quad locks, so any concern that those quad locks
might have weaknesses must be properly addressed, in particular those
relating to the European Convention on Human

has been consistent in saying that gay marriage is not a right found
within the convention, a view upheld as recently as 2012, but there are
features of the convention that, in relation to the Bill, cause great
unease about the future. If Strasbourg were ever to find that there is
a right to same-sex marriage, the protections provided by the
Government’s quad locks would be completely undermined—or
I believe they would. Article 12 of the convention holds that men and
women of marriageable age have the right to marry and to found a
family. That is the only article that explicitly refers to gender,
showing that marriage is understood to be between a man and a woman.
However, one of the convention’s most notable features,
frequently reiterated in judgments, is that it can be interpreted
according to what the court calls emerging consensus and common values
in international law. It is said to be a living instrument governed not
just by the wording of the convention agreed decades ago but by
present-day standards. In other words, it changes its mind about what
the words
mean.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306259000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306259000006">Three
years ago, in the case of Schalk and Kopf v Austria, Strasbourg ruled
against an Austrian same-sex couple who were arguing that the
convention must be adapted to fit in line with apparently changing
social views on same-sex marriage. At the time, the court was not
persuaded that social attitudes had changed enough for same-sex
marriage to be regarded as mandatory. It interpreted the right to marry
in Article 12 as being limited to unions of persons of the opposite
sex. It justified its ruling by reference to the fact that there is no
European consensus in support of gay
marriage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306259000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0003.htm#1306259000007">However,

being had to Article 9 of the charter, therefore, the court would no
longer consider that the right to marry enshrined in Article 12 must in
all circumstances be limited to marriage between two persons of the

inapplicable to the applicants’ complaint. However, as matters
stand, the question whether or not to allow same-sex marriage is left
to regulation by the national law of the contracting

the current position of Strasbourg, and the current European climate,
is that Article 12 does not impose an obligation to grant same-sex
couples the right to marry. However, clearly that could change and, if
it did, the whole legal landscape would change with it. In that new
legal landscape, the so-called quad locks could look pretty obsolete,

this secret conference was an event attended by 300 people, invited by
the Government of the United Kingdom, when the United Kingdom held the

president of the European Court of Human Rights, spoke for five

instead of expressing it in these columns it did it by way of
relationships. That was that done in the Civil Partnership Act. Section

respects from opposite-sex marriage. In particular, opposite-sex
marriage includes as one of its purposes—not its only
purpose—the natural procreation of children. That is not a
purpose of the same-sex couples marriage for reasons that are

to make is that I have heard same-sex couples marriage described as gay
marriage. That is not correct. The correct description is same-sex

anything to do with sexual relationships. Therefore it is perfectly
open for people in same-sex marriages to have a completely platonic
relationship. That raises the question of the applicability 
<?notus-xml column=636?>of the prohibited degrees to same-sex marriage. I want to raise the
question of whether prohibition requires reconsideration in relation to
same-sex marriage. It is one thing to have it for opposite-sex marriage

means all. Obviously if someone is married already there is no
possibility or freedom to remarry, but subject to that kind of
consideration the general assertion is that all couples should be free
to marry. Therefore we have to look at the prohibited degrees which are
prohibitions on couples who may wish to marry. One such
couple—to take an example—is brothers. I know of no love
which is more widely commended than brotherly love. There is nothing to
suggest that brothers cannot love each other perfectly properly and in
such a way as to be willing to commit to each other in the full sense

raise the question more fundamentally in relation to marriage and
same-sex marriage in particular. At present I do not understand why it
should be closed to all of the present prohibited degrees. I would like
to know to what extent the Government have previously analysed this
position and have reached a conclusion on it because as yet I have seen
no discussion of this particular aspect in any detail. It is an
important aspect to my mind, and I think it has a bearing on how some
people in our society view the provision for same-sex couples marriage.
A lot of people—we have heard it today once or
twice—refer to it as gay marriage. That is restricting the scope
of this Bill in a way that is not justified by the terms of the Bill

importance of the fact that ordinary marriage—what I will call
opposite-sex marriage—has as one of its purposes the natural
procreation of children is that the institution is there to offer
protection and safeguards to children. When it works properly it is a
very effective safeguard for children. As I said the other day, the

received in connection with this Committee stage a request to make it
clear that I am against homophobic bullying in any way. I certainly
want to make that abundantly clear. The function of ordinary
marriage—the marriage of opposite sexes—includes
protecting the children against any form of bullying and any form of
homophobic bullying, and preventing them taking part in such bullying.
We all know that children are quite quick to notice differences between
their circumstances and those of other children, perhaps in the same
class. That is often a source of improper bullying of one kind or
another. I make it clear that I 
<?notus-xml column=637?>regard one of the functions of opposite-sex marriage as protecting

noble Baroness on the Opposition Front Bench referred, in the context
of another amendment, to the presumption that when a child is born to a
married woman the other party to the marriage is parent of the child.
That presumption is set aside in this Bill—an important fact
that must be taken into account. In opposite-sex marriage the three
ways in which children of the marriage can be produced are by natural
procreation, IVF or adoption. In same-sex marriage it will be by IVF or
possibly full sexual relations, which according to the Bill may
constitute adultery—which is slightly unfortunate from the point
of view of the child being produced. According to the Bill, that child
will have no relationship with the marriage at all. Of course, the
other method is by
adoption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T23:43:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062513000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0004.htm#13062513000011">Same-sex
marriage, as the Bill makes plain, does not embrace children in the
same way as the natural child is embraced by the marriage of
opposite-sex couples. All of this has a bearing on the relationships
that are prohibited—the prohibited degrees. At the moment I can
see no reason why brothers and sisters should not be able to have a
same-sex marriage if they felt that they wanted to. A noble Lord
pointed out earlier that of course you can end a relationship only with
a divorce. That is absolutely true. The marriage relationship would be
over and above the relationship between sisters or brothers. If they
decided to end the marriage relationship that would be sad, but it can
happen with same-sex and opposite-sex couples and it is sad whenever it
happens. However, it could happen. One would not wish to contemplate
that as happening very often, but of course it is certainly a
possibility.</hs_para>

the background that all couples who love one another are able to
marry—that is what we want—I find it difficult to see why
brothers or sisters who are willing to marry should not be able to do
so. The Bill needs to consider a little more carefully than it has done
this provision raised by the noble Baronesses on the Front Bench in
their amendment for no presumption in favour of a child born to a woman
in a same-sex marriage. That child is left without any marriage
connection at all as far as I can see. That seems to me be highly
unfortunate. Although it is important to consider the rights of adults
in relation to same-sex marriage—that is what the Bill is
primarily about—it is extremely important to think about future
generations and the relationship with children as well as the
prohibited degrees matters that I mentioned. I believe that the
prohibited degrees were first inserted into the marriage institution
for the primary reason of protecting against inbreeding with normal
procreation. These reasons, of course, do not have any place in
same-sex marriage, and therefore I think we need to look at the
justification, if any, for the prohibited degrees, at least in their
present form. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_24_PT_1/EA4C082BAE3F23EA7280F46A40FB0CC0A484924F" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 June 2013">Monday,

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the interesting
debate that my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay has generated. He
is right to challenge us to consider it and I can indicate at the
outset, although I will say more, that the Government do not feel able
to support his amendment. It would permit siblings of the same sex to
marry, and I assume that that could include uncles and nephews,
grandfathers and grandsons and mothers and daughters. The Government do
not feel able to accept the extension of marriage to close relatives.
Clearly, as my noble and learned friend indicated, the origins of this
go back to concerns about the need to prevent incest and potential
inbreeding.</hs_para>

fair to point out that, in terms of procreation, not all marriages,
even heterosexual ones, are contracted for the purposes of procreation.
It would almost be a logical extension of the argument that when an
opposite-sex couple are past a certain age, or the woman passes a
certain age and is incapable any longer of having children, perhaps the
degrees of affinity regulations and prohibitions should fly off. Even
just saying that indicates the real sensitivity around this and how it
is difficult to readily accede the point being made by my noble and
learned
friend.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062513000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0004.htm#13062513000016">Before
returning to some of the substance of his argument, my noble and
learned friend indicated in his opening remarks that he seeks by this
amendment to restore Section 1 of the Marriage Act 1949 to what it was
before the Civil Partnership Act 2004 amended it. It is important to
point out that the 2004 Act created one gender-neutral list setting out
the prohibited degrees of relationship. The amended Marriage Act makes
it clear that no person can marry any relative listed in Schedule
1.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062513000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0004.htm#13062513000017">I am not
founding my argument on this point because it is a technical matter
which no doubt could be addressed. But in reverting back to the
original Section 1 of the Marriage Act 1949, the amendment does not
lead to any change in the relevant schedules, so that certainly could
lead to confusion, although no doubt my noble and learned friend could
do something about that if he wished to persist with this and bring
forward amendments to the schedules as well. Paragraph 17 of
Schedule 27 to the Civil Partnership Act 2004 replaced the two separate
lists. Under the amendment, that single gender-neutral list would still
stand and would need to be repealed and the original wording

have sought to indicate that the Government do not accept the principle
of what my noble and learned friend is trying to achieve. He referred
to platonic relationships. If this Bill is passed, it will be open to
individual couples, whether of opposite sex or of the same sex, to
determine whether to engage in sexual activity and to consummate their
marriage. Couples are not required to consummate their marriage; there
is only an option for opposite-sex couples to apply for an annulment if
one party applies to have the marriage annulled on that

brothers being able to marry, as I indicated, the Marriage Act sets out
the relationships of people who cannot marry each other. The Government
want to ensure that same-sex couples are able to marry under the same
provisions as opposite-sex couples. The provisions in the Marriage Act
on prohibited degrees of relations are already capable of applying to
same-sex couples and therefore no change from what was put in place for
civil partnerships is

noble and learned friend referred to the debate we had earlier on the
amendment moved by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech. In my response to
that I referred to tax issues. To be fair to my noble and learned
friend, he did not use that argument. His argument was based more on
grounds of principle. Nevertheless, the proposal would have
consequences in terms of tax. However, I also think—I made this
argument during that debate—that there are power relationships
within families. Who is to say that pressure could not be brought to
bear on a brother to marry another brother if it was thought that that
would best serve his inheritance interests? You cannot tell what goes
on in families. That is why my noble and learned friend is absolutely
right to talk about the need to protect children. We are not
necessarily talking about infant children or children under the age of
16, but within families lots of power can still be exerted when
children are young adults or even older. While concerns about incest
and inbreeding clearly lie at the heart of the prohibited degrees of
marriage, there is also a recognition that within families powerful
relationships can often be at
play<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T23:54:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062513000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0004.htm#13062513000021">As
I indicated, this amendment would allow father and son, mother and
daughter, uncle and nephew, aunt and niece to marry. We think that the
pressure is more relevant at an intergenerational level than
at a sibling level, although that is not to say that it
could not occur at a sibling level. Therefore, we
should be very cautious about going down that
road. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Alli, referred to civil partnerships
in this connection. We believe that the nature of marriage is one which
people recognise as being different from the relationship that exists
between two close members of the same sex of a family. For these
reasons, I ask my noble and learned friend to withdraw the

example, to brothers. The idea that this is something to do
with pressure is ridiculous because, as we know, pressure is exerted in
families far beyond same-sex relationships, and that has to be dealt
with somehow. There are plenty of laws relating to undue pressure being
put on people to get married or otherwise. What I am talking

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> This is a justification for same-sex
marriage that has been put forward. That is what I am talking about. I
said in my speech at Second Reading—I invited correction but so
far that has not come—that the reason for the prohibited degrees
applying across marriage generally is because the natural procreation
of children was a central purpose. I quite understand that people far
beyond the age of childbearing are subject to the rules, and if George
Clooney does not hurry up, you never know what might happen. The rules
are there because a central purpose of opposite-sex marriage is the
normal procreation of children, and therefore the rules are put
generally to the whole lot. That does not apply to same-sex marriage at

just as likely to occur in relation to people who are not directly

That kind of pressure is something that has to be looked at. However, I
do not see why such pressure should be particularly rife between
brothers at full age and thus perfectly entitled to consider what they
want to do. I cannot see that it is a reason for cutting brothers out.

respect differences of view about whether marriage should be between a
man and a woman. Although the noble Lord,

but I do want to move Amendment 56A, which relates to Part 2 of
Schedule 7, on the last page of the Bill. As I reflect on
tonight’s debate, I would say to the Government that this may
not be as simple as it seems. The reality is that, despite the repeated
assurances of certain noble Lords, the United Kingdom has repeatedly
been found to be in breach of its obligations under the convention and,
more recently, under the Human Rights

with the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, I would say to the Minister that
there is both courage and common sense in considering the Bill again
and in 
<?notus-xml column=643?>bringing it back on Report with amendments. I have heard the
Minister’s comments on that and have seen government
amendments. I asked the question that the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Mackay, asked at Second Reading. However, I did

something rather than just ex post facto post-legislative scrutiny. We
need more than that because there is an expectation in this House that
the Bill will become law and I want to place on record that I was
somewhat concerned at the earlier tenor of the debate. I understood
that the process in this House was to raise issues in general at Second
Reading, to put amendments in Committee and hear a government response,
and to revert to unsolved issues on Report. Otherwise, surely, there
would be no point in anything other than Second Reading and wherein
would lie our scrutiny function? I would also like to place on record,
in response to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace of Tankerness,
the fact that I and, I think, several other noble Lords have received a
letter signed by a significant number of Members in the other place,
saying that although it was broadcast as a free vote, it was not quite

Bill as drafted is not limited in its consequences to the issue of
conducting same-sex marriages, et cetera. It does not ensure that there
can be no detriment to an individual or organisation in their
interactions with a public authority, because it does not deal, in this
context, with a Section 149 issue and does not deal with the risk of
the attribution of discriminatory action against persons with a
protected characteristic; namely, sexual orientation. I want therefore
to speak very briefly about individuals who, for reasons of conscience,
feel unable to promote same-sex marriage in the way that the law,
currently, would appear to suggest that they might have to

sex and relationship education tends to be something which is asked of
teachers who do not specialise in the topic but may be mathematicians,
physicists or historians. SRE has to be taught and some staff must
teach it. The risk for a teacher is that, directly or indirectly,
something they say may be interpreted as relating to the subject matter
of the Bill and may be interpreted as discriminatory by pupils of a
homosexual orientation. The noble Lord, Lord Alli, was right when he
said earlier that teachers of course have to act as professionals. They
can develop rules; for example, that in their classroom no teacher or
pupil can be asked a personal question. However, the reality is that a
classroom of 30 or more teenagers is not the easiest place to operate.
There may be pupils who see an opportunity to embarrass a teacher by
asking repeated questions, by making suggestions or by their conduct
generally as the teacher tries to ensure that all the children are kept
safe, that there is no bullying and that the children actually learn.

beliefs that marriage is between a man and a woman. It would not permit

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
noble Baroness, Lady O’Loan, for her further amendment regarding
the public sector equality duty. It is similar, although not identical,
to Amendment 13 in the name of the noble Baroness and that of the noble
Lord, Lord Singh, which the Committee discussed
at length last Wednesday. I certainly do not
intend to rehearse all the points that were made then. I undertook,
following that debate, to write to the noble Baroness on a number of
points that were made in that debate—I think that that
suggestion was made by the noble Lord, Lord Deben—and to
circulate the letter to all those who took part. I also indicated that
if the recipients of that letter wished to follow it up with a meeting,
I would more than happy to do so. Certainly, if there are any further
points arising out of the contributions to the debate that have been
made this evening which require to be covered by that, I shall do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T00:15:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in different terms from Amendment 13 and would have a slightly
different effect but, again, the Government believe that it is
unnecessary and potentially harmful. As we discussed last week, the
public sector equality duty places a duty on public authorities to have
due regard to the need to eliminate unlawful discrimination because of,
among other matters, religion or belief. Where this is relevant to the
exercise of their functions, public authorities are already required to
have due regard to the possible impact of their policies on people who
believe that marriage should be between only a man and a woman. The
amendment is therefore
unnecessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T00:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062513000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0004.htm#13062513000054">However,
the amendment is also potentially harmful—the noble Baroness,
Lady Thornton, was right to say that this is our domestic legislation.
The amendment would mean that public authorities would be required to
consider this particular belief about marriage, giving precedence to it
over all the other beliefs to which they are required to have due
regard whenever they take a decision, regardless of the context and the
relevance to the
decision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062513000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0004.htm#13062513000055">Moreover,
the public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T00:16:21"></hs_TimeCode>
sector equality duty is a duty to have due regard. It is a duty to
think; it is not a duty to act or to achieve a particular outcome. The
amendment goes far beyond the duty to have due regard. It places a duty
on a public authority to ensure that the belief that marriage should
only be between a man and a woman is respected, and to ensure that no
one expressing such a belief will suffer any detriment. That is of
course a desirable outcome, but it is not clear to me how any single
public authority, or indeed all public authorities working together,
could ensure that that would happen. I take the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Martin of Springburn. It was in one of our first debates
that my noble friend Lord Lester made the point—I think that the
noble Lord, Lord Alli, then quoted it back—that you cannot
legislate against some public authorities or some individual doing a
daft thing; “idiotic” may have been the word that he
used. Mention has been made of the case of the housing officer who lost
his job for something that was put on a public website, when in fact
the law actually protected him. When the case went for judicial review,
the judge put it on the record that, had he taken the matter to an
employment tribunal, he would have had more substantial damages than he
was able to get under a judicial review. The law has worked. I say to
the noble Lord, Lord Martin, that I think that we all get very
frustrated sometimes when daft things are done, but we believe that the
Bill ensures that those protections are in place. I do not believe that
the way to deal with those occasions where public authorities have not
applied the current laws properly is to start trying to meddle with the
equality protections and to risk unintended consequences. Rather, we
should address them by doing what we can to ensure that public
authorities understand the nature of the requirements on them and what
they mean in
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T00:18:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062513000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-0004.htm#13062513000056">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-25T00:18:29"></hs_TimeCode>
is why, as I explained on Wednesday and as my noble friend Lady Stowell
has also explained, the Government will work with the Equality and
Human Rights Commission to ensure that its guidance for public
authorities is as clear as possible, in particular by making it clear
that the equality duty cannot be 
<?notus-xml column=647?>used to penalise an organisation or individual for opposing same-sex
marriage and indeed that to do so would be unlawful. I also remind the

quite a narrow probing amendment. At the start of our deliberations
today, perhaps I should just make clear that although we have some
concerns about the fragmentation of the new local audit
regime—an amendment to cover this will be forthcoming on
Wednesday—we accept the broad technical means by which the
Government seek to implement its framework, drawing on the Companies
Act 2006 and the Audit Commission Act 1998. Our probing should be seen

Schedule 5 again, which relates to the new regulatory framework for
auditors of local public bodies. It draws heavily, as we have
discussed, on the framework contained in the Companies Act 2006, the
provisions of which, as I have said, have our broad support. Schedule 5
applies Part 42 of the 2006 Act to local audits, as it does to
statutory audits, but with some exclusions. The purpose of this
amendment is  to understand the exclusion of Section 1215(2) to
(7) of the Companies

1215 takes us back to the subject of independence, and requires a
statutory auditor to resign immediately on becoming prohibited from
acting because of lack of independence, and this requirement is imposed
similarly on local auditors. However the legal sanctions which underpin
the failure to comply with this requirement for statutory auditors
appear to have been omitted in the case of local audits. Doubtless the

somewhere else. Could she draw my attention to a specific provision? I

to provide confidence in the independence of the local auditor. This
amendment seeks to replicate the criminal offences in Section 1215 of
the Companies Act 2006 in the local audit framework, as the noble Lord
explained. We have chosen not to replicate these particular criminal
offences as we consider that there are other, more suitable mechanisms
to do so—in short, the disciplinary powers of the recognised
supervisory bodies and the ethical standards raised by the Financial

rules and practices that the recognised supervisory bodies will put in
place will cover the independence of the auditor. They will also
outline the disciplinary sanctions that could be applied if the
independence requirements were found to have been breached. This could
ultimately include the withdrawal of registration, and other sanctions
could include that the firm responsible for the audit would not be able
to accept new audits or particular types of audits, that a person may
no longer be a responsible individual and that a specific employee may
no longer be involved in audit work.</hs_para>

is concerned with the eligibility and regulation of local auditors. It
covers independence requirements, the qualification requirements, the
monitoring of audits and the inspections. The requirements that may be
specified to be an appropriate qualification, enabling a person to act
as a local auditor, include their qualification experience, practical
training, examinations passed and so on. However, this amendment
specifically requires that, in evaluating whether somebody has an
appropriate qualification, regard must be had to the need to understand
the wider scope of public audit. In fact, this is an issue that also

is clearly vital that an understanding of and an ability to undertake
this wider role is part of an appropriate qualification for local
auditors. The Minister will doubtless tell us that it is implicit in
the requirements that may be specified in paragraph 8(5) of Schedule 5,
but the amendment would make it explicit. It gives us the chance to
probe the Government’s assessment of how many firms are likely
to be in the market for local audit work, certainly for principal body
audits. We are told that there were just 13 firms which prequalified
when the Audit Commission outsourced its in-house practice, although
only seven firms were appointed. Schedule 5 provides for the register
of auditors of be maintained. When is it expected that the register
will first be published and when might we have sight of the draft
regulations? In particular, can the Minister say something more about
the Government’s assessment of how many firms are likely to be
in the market for local audits, and will they be appropriately

while holding an appropriate audit qualification is necessary, it is
not sufficient in itself for those individuals within firms assigned

important for local audit is that auditors have the  skill and
experience of local audit, which includes understanding the wider scope
of public audit. As such, we believe that the amendment is unnecessary
as the Bill requires all individuals to have this appropriate level of
competence to carry out local audits, regardless of whether they hold a
qualification under Part 42 of the Companies Act 2006 or another one
recognised under the Bill. This critical requirement regarding
competence is set out in paragraph 27 of Schedule 5. The amendment

requirements for approving those individuals who will be responsible
for signing audit reports for companies. The requirements established
by the recognised supervisory bodies are subject to agreement and
oversight by the Financial Reporting Council. Once an individual has
been approved to sign an audit report of a company, it does not follow
that they could sign such a report for any company. That individual

of that particular company; they would need to have the relevant

must comply regardless of whether they are appointed to a company or a
local public body. In particular, the international standard on quality
control requires all firms to have policies and procedures that ensure
that individuals have the right knowledge and experience to undertake a
specific engagement. For local audit, this would mean that a firm could
not put forward an individual to be responsible for a local audit if
that individual did not understand the wider scope of public audit. If

four or the bigger four and three bidding—which I think got us
to seven before—and that there will be increasing competition.

noble Lord, Lord Tope, for his support for this line of enquiry. I note
that the register 
<?notus-xml column=194?>will not be available until 2016, but it is good that the draft
regulations will be available when the Bill goes into the Commons. I
think we shall have to see the outcome of that and
how many local firms end up in a competitive position in the market.
One of the fears is that those firms that are active in the local audit
market currently do it through specialist divisions. They have the
financial clout to invest in the training in these sorts of
arrangements. I think we would have common cause in wanting there to be
a number of firms in the market—certainly it should be expanded
from the existing base. I am somewhat sceptical about whether that
would be achieved. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the

unnecessary provision from paragraph 16 which is a supplement to
paragraph 15 of Schedule 5. Paragraph 15 substitutes Section 1248 of

substitutes Section 1249 of the Companies Act 2006 and inserts
supplementary provisions about second audits. Subsection (3) states
that a direction given to retain a second auditor may be enforced by

Companies Act. However, given that all public authorities, unlike
companies, are subject to judicial review, we now wish to remove
subsection (3) which refers to the use of an injunction; this is
clearly not necessary. Should a relevant authority fail to comply with
the direction relating to a second audit, an action could be brought
for judicial review. This is currently the way in which local public
bodies are brought to account. This is a minor and technical amendment
that removes an unnecessary provision. I beg to

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 20 covers the general
duties of auditors of a health service body and sets down the areas on
which the auditor must be satisfied. These include that the body has
made proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and
effectiveness in the use of its resources. Clause 20(4) precludes the
auditor’s opinion on the accounts making any reference to this
requirement unless he is not satisfied in that matter, so the auditor
cannot positively state that he is satisfied that the body has made
proper arrangements for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness
in the use of its resources. Obviously, an informed reader of the
auditor’s report would be able to interpret what appears to be
silence on this, but it seems an odd restriction. Perhaps someone could
explain its purpose. I beg to move.</hs_para>

report of the auditor is a detailed and technical document. The
Government are of the view that for health bodies—in this clause
we are referring only to health bodies—the audit report should
contain those matters that are most important to the reader. We
consider them to be: the opinion on the true and fair nature of the
accounts; for those bodies that are directly funded from resources
provided by Parliament—which includes all bodies that are now
part of the health service—to confirm that the funds have been 
<?notus-xml column=196?>used for authorised purposes; and any cases where arrangements
to secure value for money are not appropriate. This
approach would provide for greater focus and attention where
value-for-money arrangements are not in

provision in the Bill also aims to bring consistency for all health
bodies. Currently, the audit opinions of health commissioning bodies

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this is another quick one, I
expect. This amendment relates to an offence under Clause 22. Clause 21
provides for an auditor’s right to documentation and
information. Clause 22 makes it an offence without reasonable excuse
for a person to obstruct the process or to fail to comply with any
requirement of a local auditor. A person guilty of an offence can be
subject to a fine on summary conviction. A local auditor can recover
reasonable expenses in connection with proceedings alleged to have been
committed by certain persons from the relevant authority. Those persons
include, for example, a member or officer of the relevant authority.
The amendment seeks to makes certain that the right to recovery runs,
albeit that the person committing the offence is no longer a member or
officer of the authority. This raises the issue of when an offence
might have been committed when it includes, for example, continuing
failure to provide information or explanations by somebody who has
ceased to be a member or officer and perhaps put themselves in that
position deliberately. This ties the position back to Clause 21(8)(f),
which brings such individuals within the scope of those from whom the
auditor can seek information. We do not want anyone to escape by
jumping ship or, indeed, for the recovery of costs to be precluded in
those circumstances. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="13062411000181" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000181">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 21 gives auditors a
right to access documents and information that they consider necessary
for them to exercise their functions under this Bill. Clause 22, as the
noble Lord has just explained, provides that a person who obstructs the
auditors’ rights under Clause 21, without reasonable excuse,
commits an offence. Clause 22 enables the auditors to recover their
expenses from relevant authorities in connection with offences
committed by members or officers of the authority.</hs_para>

me to highlight two improvements we have made to the Bill since we
published it in draft. First, we have included former members and
officers of a relevant authority within the duty to provide information
and explanation as required by the auditor. Secondly, we have increased
the provisions supporting the auditors’ recovery of their costs.
Auditors will be able to recover reasonable costs from the authority
being audited for their time. We expect that the contracts between the
auditor and relevant authority will also enable this, but to remove
doubt, the Bill includes specific provisions to enable the auditors to
recover costs or expenses for specified functions.</hs_para>

extend the provision set out in this clause to enable auditors also to
recover expenses regarding offences committed by former members or
officers of an authority from the relevant authority. This is a matter
to which we gave some thought when we were strengthening the provisions
supporting the auditor to recover costs and expenses 
<?notus-xml column=198?>incurred in undertaking its functions. We concluded that there are some
circumstances under which it would not be right for a relevant
authority to be required to fund these costs automatically; for
example, where a person was a member or officer at the time to which
the information or explanation relates but commits the offence of
obstructing or not complying with the auditor after they have left the
position. Rather than legislating to provide for such rare situations,
we consider that it would be preferable for the relevant authority and
auditor to agree via their contracts how the auditor’s costs and
expenses would be covered in such an unusual situation. I hope my
explanation allows this amendment to be

Wills:</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, both this amendment and Amendment
18A, which is grouped with it, seek to improve transparency in these
new arrangements for local government. Such transparency is key to
greater accountability and therefore to better government and over and
over again we have seen what damage can be done when transparency is
smothered. The NHS has 
<?notus-xml column=199?>provided some tragic examples recently, as the Francis report
into Mid Staffs and the Grant Thornton report for
the Care Quality Commission have both
shown.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000061">The
work carried out by private contractors for local authorities will
often be of equal importance in the way that it involves issues of
public safety, but it may also raise other issues of concern to the
public such as corruption. The public should also have rights of access
under the Freedom of Information Act to the work carried out by local
auditors, because they are the ultimate clients of those auditors.
Those auditors may be carrying out their tasks for a local authority,
but that local authority serves the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000062">The
amendments are particularly necessary because the Localism Act
envisages that a growing proportion of local authorities’
functions will be carried out for it by private companies under
contract. If the authority carries out the work itself, then all
information about that work is subject to the Act and subject, of
course, to the exemptions in the Act. But the public’s right to
information is less straightforward when the work is done by a private
contractor. Section 1 of the Freedom of Information Act establishes
that the right of access is to information which a public authority
holds. Section 3(2)(b) of the Act provides that information which
another person holds on behalf of the authority is treated as held by
the authority
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000063">However,
how much of the information a contractor holds about the contract is
held on behalf of an authority? The answer is not self-evident. The
contract itself may specify that particular information is to be
treated as held on behalf of that authority or it may say a specified
type of information must be provided to the authority if it asks for
it, to help it answer an FOI request. But what if such a provision
applies only to a very limited class of
information?</hs_para><hs_time UID="13062411000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000147">4.15

may be to exclude the public from access to any information which is
not specifically mentioned. The amendments will help, I think, to
overcome any such oversights. I return here briefly to an example which
I have given previously in your Lordships’ House about the
contentious issue of parking tickets. In 2007, Islington Council
received a freedom of information request for information about the
criteria used to reward parking attendants for good results. The
parking attendants were employed by National Car Parks Ltd under a
contract with that council, and the rewards included bonus performance
payments and points that could be spent at
Argos.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000065">The
requester wanted anonymised information about the rewards provided to
the best performing attendants, including the number of penalty charge
notices issued by them, the number of complaints involving those
attendants and the number of notices subsequently cancelled. The
requester clearly suspected that the incentives were leading parking
attendants to issue as many notices as they possibly could, regardless
of the justification. The council replied that it did not hold such
statistics, and the contract did not give it power to obtain them from
National Car
Parks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000066">The
Information Commissioner examined the contract in force at the time and
found that it imposed no requirement on National Car Parks to provide
statistical 
<?notus-xml column=200?>information about the Argos points, the performance payments to
individual staff or the criteria used to decide who should receive
these. The commissioner concluded that this information was not held on
the council's behalf and was not accessible to it under the Freedom of
Information Act. Yet that information was central to any attempt to
understand whether the incentives were encouraging notices to be issued
improperly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000067">I
am sure that many of your Lordships will be aware of just how sensitive
this issue can be. This is the kind of problem that may occur when
people attempt to use the Freedom of Information Act to obtain
information about such contracts. The amendments seek to address some
of these issues, although sadly it is not possible within the scope of
this Bill to address all of
them.</hs_para><hs_parafo UID="13062411000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000124">Amendment
17 seeks to make the work of local auditors scrutinising private sector
bodies performing work contracted to them by local
authorities—in other words, work of a public
nature—accessible to the public under the Freedom of Information
Act. It seeks to make it clear that such bodies are so
covered in the
Bill.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13062411000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000068">That
is not to say that such information will have to be disclosed. If the
local auditor is asked to publish information under the Freedom of
Information Act, under proposed new subsection (2), it will be subject
to the exemptions in the Act to protect legitimate interests. For
example, the exemption in Section 43 of the Act protects trade secrets
or information likely to prejudice the commercial interests of the
contractor or the authority, subject to a public interest test. Again,
Section 40 protects personal information about any identifiable
individual, including members of the contractor's staff, if disclosure
would breach the principles of the Data Protection Act. Other
exemptions apply where disclosure would be likely to endanger health or
safety, prejudice law enforcement or defence, or cause other types of
harm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000069">Whenever
freedom of information is involved, those opposed to transparency in
government rehearse arguments about cost as a reason for opposing it,
and I hope that Ministers will not do that today because there need be
no substance in such arguments. This requirement should not be onerous
for local auditors. They will have the raw data already; they will not
have to set up new mechanisms to collect them. All they will have to do
is process them, and efficient information management systems should
make that easy and cheap. If local auditors do not have efficient
information management systems, then they should have. They should
accept whatever marginal costs transparency to the public imposes on
them as the price of their entry ticket into such a lucrative new
stream of public sector
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000070">If any
local auditors seek to pass on such marginal costs to the local
authority, then competition for this new stream of work should enable
the local authority to find an auditor who absorbs such costs. If the
Government were to suggest—and I hope they will not—that
such competition does not exist because of the relatively limited
number of such auditors available to do such work, then, as a
Government that believe in 
<?notus-xml column=201?>the virtues and beneficial effects of free markets, I hope they will
make sure that such competition exists in
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000071">Amendment
18A is a straightforward attempt to place local auditors in the same
position as the Audit Commission now being replaced by them in making
them subject to the Freedom of Information Act. As with Amendment 17,
this provision will be subject to the exemptions in the Act to protect
legitimate interests. I tabled this amendment in addition to Amendment
17 because that amendment only provides access to information which the
auditor obtains from the contractor, not to other information held by
the local auditor. Although some of this information will come from the
local council, there is no right of access to other information held by
the auditor, including information that it generates
itself—notes of meetings with the council or third parties or
correspondence that it has with bodies other than the council such as
people objecting to the accounts. Amendment 17 on its own does not
bring auditors into line with the position of the Audit Commission,
which is already fully subject to the Freedom of Information Act, but
this amendment
does.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000072">There is
one further difference between the arguments for Amendment 17 and this
one. Amendment 17 seeks to extend transparency. This
amendment seeks simply  to maintain the existing situation. For
the Government to resist it would represent a significant restriction
of transparency in local government. Quite apart from the fact that
this would resile from the commitment made in the coalition agreement,
it would in my view represent another threat to the public interest, in
the way I have already
described.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000073">We
have seen over and again how restricting freedom of information and

so many ways, work that the local auditors will be scrutinising will be
as important to the public as that scrutinised by the Care Quality

that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13062411000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000075">If the
Minister is minded to resist one or both of these amendments, I should
be grateful if she could explain why the Government believe that
transparency and a duty of candour are so important in the NHS, but not
in local government. On the other hand, if the Government resist, as I
fear they might, only because they feel the drafting of these
amendments is defective in some way—and drafting can usually be
improved—I should be grateful if the Minister could at least
indicate that the Government are content with the principles

opened up a very important area of discussion. My
understanding—as he said—is that the Audit Commission, as
a public authority, is subject to freedom of information, but that
those private sector firms appointed to undertake local public audits
are not. The purpose of the amendment is to put them in a position

understand it, there was a consultation on that in 2011 and the Audit
Commission’s response was that it was sensible for auditors to
be brought within the Freedom of Information Act, adding that it would
be necessary to make it clear that freedom of information requirements
applied only to information held in support of the functions of local
public auditors. My noble friend made a good
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000078">In
relation to Amendment 17, I am not quite clear about the extent to
which my noble friend wishes this to proceed. It talks about the audit
documents from private companies to which the local authority has
contracted services. It is sometimes, possibly frequently, the case
that it is not just one entity that is providing services. There is a
whole range of sub-contractors in the chain and I am not sure quite how
it would work in those circumstances. However, I believe that my noble
friend has raised a very important point and, like him, I look forward

by other persons—including the authority’s

his or

Clause 22 makes it an offence to obstruct the auditor’s power to

terms of publication of documents, the auditor is able to refer to

the Government’s code of recommended practice for local

publish all expenditure over £500, as well as copies of
contracts and tenders. All councils are publishing spend above

Wills:</Member></B> First, I am very grateful to the Minister for that
response and for the offer to talk to the Government. I will be very
happy to take it up. He is not right that I am not entirely satisfied
with his response; I am not at all satisfied with his response. Indeed,
I find myself rather saddened by this resiling from the fundamental
principle of the importance of transparency. It is in the coalition
agreement that the coalition Government are committed to greater
transparency. After all the evidence we have seen from the NHS in
recent months, I would have thought that the Government would have been
persuaded of the importance of that commitment but, sadly, we have the
same old excuses that are always trotted out when freedom of
information and greater transparency are proposed.</hs_para>

Minister says that local authorities should be able to provide all the
information needed under freedom of information, he did not address the
specific examples that I gave to show why there may be cases where the
current provision is not adequate in which people will not be able to
gain access to the information to which they are entitled. I hope that
when he and his officials read <I>Hansard</I>, they will look at that
again before we meet so that we can examine this particular case
because existing provision is not adequate and neither is the provision
in this Bill.</hs_para>

audit fees, again I had hoped that I would have pre-empted some of
these arguments but it is, I have to say, pathetic for the Government
to accept this argument. This is an argument for a steady withdrawal of
transparency from the public in terms of local government as more and
more services are contracted out, as the Government wish, rightly or
wrongly, because that is envisaged in the Localism Act. There was a lot
of discussion of it when that Bill was going through. As that happens,
there will, according to the argument just advanced by the Minister, be
decreasing transparency. That stands to reason. The provisions in this
Bill are not adequate for that, so I am very
disappointed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000093">Finally,
I shall withdraw the amendment for the time being, subject to further
discussions with the Minister and officials, but I ask Ministers to
reflect on this. There will be abuses of power in local government.
Wherever power resides, whether in local government or anywhere else,
such as in the National Health Service or in central government, power
is abused. Nearly always, greater transparency and freedom of
information are the key to preventing, or at least mitigating, the
effect of such abuses of power. We have seen it over and over again. So
at some point in the future, unless changes are made to the Bill, this
Government will be in the dock for having had the opportunity to
increase transparency and having refused to do so. The consequences
will then be visited, perhaps on some future Government, and some
hapless Minister will have to stand up, as we have just seen Health 
<?notus-xml column=205?>Ministers do twice in the past few months, and apologise to all those
who tried to get the information and were denied it
and will then have to take remedial measures. Ministers have a chance
to do something now before further damage is done. I hope they will

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, the pre-legislative scrutiny
committee reminds us that in many instances serious cases of financial
or governance failure are not identified through the audit itself but
are brought to the attention of the appropriate authorities by
individual whistleblowers. This matter could hardly be more topical. It
is vital that robust protections are available for individuals in all
relevant bodies, including health bodies.</hs_para>

far as whistleblowers are concerned, currently the Audit Commission is
a prescribed person under the 1998 public interest disclosure
provisions. Its appointed auditors are also prescribed persons. The
Public Interest Disclosure Act protects from recriminations employees
who make disclosures about a range of subjects. Whistleblowers can
claim protection by disclosing their concerns either to an employer or,
if they prefer, to another organisation authorised to receive
disclosures—a prescribed
person<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>. The
commission provides a confidential public interest disclosure line for
employees of councils and NHS bodies where they are unable or unwilling
to report internally. Once employees contact the commission, the
commission alerts the relevant
auditors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T16:38:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062411000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062411000102">The
Bill makes no mention of whistleblowers, and this is an area that needs
to be strengthened. We believe that, while appointed auditors should
remain a prescribed person, there should also be another prescribed
body which could pass on information to an auditor—for example,
in cases where employees are unable to contact the auditor directly or
where, as the ad hoc draft Bill committee suggested, they may not be
comfortable approaching a private auditing firm that has a commercial

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment amends the
requirement that a local auditor must notify a relevant
authority’s auditor panel before making a public interest report
and requires the notification to be made when the report is made. There
was a very strong recommendation from the pre-legislative committee
that an auditor should be able to raise a public interest report
without prior reference to the audited body’s auditor panel or
audit committee. This amendment would fulfil that recommendation in the
knowledge that the Bill is an improvement on the draft, which required
consultation with the auditor

interest reporting is, of course, a vital part of public auditing and
assurance. There is a statutory requirement in the Audit Commission Act
and the Bill that we are considering. Under Section 8 of the Audit
Commission Act 1998, the appointed auditor is required to consider
whether to issue a report in the public interest of any significant
matter coming to his or her notice in the course of an audit and to
bring it to the attention of the audited body and the

two amendments would change the auditors’ consideration of

behind these amendments but do not consider them to be necessary.
First, regarding the requirement on the auditor to inform the auditor
panel, I should explain that we have refined this requirement in the
light of the pre-legislative scrutiny committee’s
recommendations. The draft Bill required the auditor to consult the
auditor panel before making a public interest report, but the Bill now
requires the auditor only to inform the panel before issuing a public
interest report.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062416000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000003">As we have discussed,
an auditor panel has a key role in overseeing the independence of the
relationship between the auditor and the relevant authority. We believe
that this requirement on the auditor to inform 
<?notus-xml column=210?>the panel supports the panel’s role in overseeing the independent
relationship between the auditor and the audited body. We would not
expect the panel to try to influence the auditor in
the discharge of his or her functions or on whether to issue the
report. In practice, auditors will often need or wish to discuss issues
with persons within the relevant authority when investigating the
matters under consideration to ensure a full understanding of the
situation and to gather the evidence. I therefore do not believe that
it is necessary or particularly desirable to make this
change.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13062416000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000004">Secondly, on the role
of the National Audit Office, the Bill already places a duty on the
Comptroller and Auditor-General to produce and maintain the code of
audit practice and provides a power to issue guidance in support of the
code. These will support auditors to undertake their full range of
functions under the Bill, including the issue of public interest
reports. We do not believe that placing a duty on the National Audit
Office to provide guidance is the right approach. Auditors are
accountable for their actions and will exercise their professional
judgment when deciding how to undertake their functions. Individual
auditors will base decisions on their professional judgment, supported
by their firms. This is how it operates now. The Audit Commission
issues guidance but does not seek to influence the auditor’s
judgment. I think it would be fair to say that the Comptroller and
Auditor-General would stand behind the auditor. The guidance will be
there, and I am certain that under it if the auditor wished to seek
further clarification, it would be perfectly possible under this
legislation for them to do so from the National Audit Office or the
Comptroller and
Auditor-General.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000005">Auditors
will still have a statutory duty to consider whether they need to make
a public interest report. That will occur at the time of informing the
panel or subsequently, and they do not need to do anything more than
inform it and tell it they are going to do it, although they may
discuss it if necessary. Their professional judgment will decide
whether a public interest report is necessary. Nothing will change in
that respect, and the Bill provides for auditors to recover reasonable
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000006">Finally,
the noble Lord raised foundation trusts, which appoint their own
auditors but have a regulator. Monitor said to the draft Bill scrutiny
committee that there is a rigorous monitoring system which detects
problems early and tiered support and intervention from Monitor to help
resolve problems before they escalate, so the system is different.
Also, auditors have qualified accounts of foundation trusts which
demonstrate that they are not reluctant to give bad news or to raise
issues as
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000007">I

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for her reply. The
point that I was trying to make was that, since foundation trusts have
appointed their own auditors, the lack of public interest reporting has
been equated with concerns about how independent auditors are and
whether they feel that they have the strength and support to issue
those reports. I take the point that some 
<?notus-xml column=211?>of them may well have had their accounts qualified, although I do not
know on what grounds. I think that it may help to
put the issue in context if we could have a note on how many foundation

the Bill as it stands is a considerable improvement on where the draft
Bill was on these issues. In a sense, the amendments that I was seeking
to press are relatively minor, although I suggest that they are
important. The noble Baroness made reference to the importance of the
auditor panel being informed before the report is issued. I am a bit
unclear as to what it is then expected that the auditor panel will do.
I think that in a lot of instances there will, as the Minister said, be
engagement along the way before we get to the final document. However,
the difference between it being done when the report is issued and
before that suggests that there is a perceived role for the auditor
panel before the document is finally issued. It is another hurdle, and

public interest reporting, I am not sure. I do not think that I got the
sense from the Minister’s reply that that more proactive
engagement was expected. If it were not, that would be a loss, but

Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sorry if I did not make it clear
that the NAO, while issuing the guidance, will also be behind the
auditor, who will be able to discuss issues with it and receive

backbone to the auditor and clarify how to go ahead. That will not

ability to go to the auditor panel and say, “This is what we are
about to do, this is what we think is wrong.”, would, first,
probably just give the auditor panel responsible an opportunity to know
that something was coming up which it would need to be aware of.
Secondly, it would possibly give the auditor the ability to discuss a
particular issue with someone independent of the council. I do not

concluded what he or she needed to do. There might be no engagement at
all. It might

private audit companies to bear the risks and costs for any
consequences resulting from the exercise of their functions, covering

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 26 draws on Section 16
of the Audit Commission Act. This allows a local government elector for
an area to make objections in respect of matters where the auditor
could make a public interest report, or where the auditor could seek a
declaration that an item of account is unlawful. Where objections are
received, the auditor must decide whether to take action under these
powers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000023">The
purpose of the amendment is to open up some debate around the
circumstances where the auditor does not need to consider an objection,
circumstances which do not appear to be spelled out in the Audit
Commission Act. The amendment introduces a slightly higher threshold
for the auditor not to consider an objection, by adding that the
auditor must have reasonable grounds for considering that exemptions
apply. The Minister may say that this is implied by the current
wording. We have no problem with the auditor being able to ignore
frivolous or vexatious objections, or indeed an objection that has
already been considered. The reason of disproportionate cost is
somewhat more problematic and requires potentially more refined
judgment—especially when it may involve governance issues rather
than considerable sums of public money. Of course, there is a get-out
clause in that these provisions cannot be used to avoid the action of
an auditor who has serious concerns as to how an authority is managed.
Is it envisaged that there would be guidance on this matter—part
of the audit code, perhaps? Would the Minister expand on the
Government’s views of the parameters of this particular
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:05:31"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="13062416000066" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000066">Baroness

government electors to question the auditor, as the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, has said. They can raise objections, if they think that there
are matters that the auditor should report on in the public interest,
or items that they think constitute unlawful expenditure. The auditor
can decide not to investigate an objection—and noble Lords have
mentioned the frivolous or unconstitutional—if he or she thinks
that it meets certain
criteria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:06:05"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:06:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the basis for an auditor not to consider an objection from
“thinks that” to “reasonable grounds for
considering”. This means that an auditor would be required to
meet a reasonableness test before being able to decide not to
investigate an objection. Following consultation, the Government
decided to modify the objection process. The Bill, therefore, gives an
auditor the discretion not to consider an objection in certain
circumstances—where the auditor thinks that the objection is
frivolous or vexatious, or it repeats an objection previously
considered. The auditor has further discretion to not consider an
objection if the financial value is disproportionately small when
compared to the cost of the auditor’s time in investigating 
<?notus-xml column=214?>the issue, as long as the auditor does not think that the objection
might raise concerns about serious failures of leadership or management

specific exclusions are new and we think that providing the auditor
with discretion not to consider objections as outlined can help to
avoid circumstances where an authority—and therefore the

use their professional judgment in exercising this discretion, as they
do now for all their functions. We believe that this amendment would
add an additional burden and cost in that an auditor would need to meet
a reasonableness test before deciding not to investigate an objection.

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment concerns the
declaration that an item of account is unlawful. It draws on Section 17
of the Audit Commission Act 1998, which contains similar provisions,
although this Bill does not give the Secretary of State power 
to sanction an item of account which is contrary to law—unless
it is tucked away somewhere else in the Bill, in which case perhaps the
Minister would let us know. However, the Audit Commission Act does give
power to the court to order a person responsible for 
<?notus-xml column=215?>incurring or authorising unlawful expenditure to repay it in whole or in
part to the body affected. It can  order that the person is
disqualified from serving as a member of a local authority for a
specified period. These powers seem to be missing from Clause 27, and
the amendment simply seeks to rectify the omission by using the wording
from Section 17. The Minister will doubtless say that it is blindingly
obvious that these powers are covered elsewhere. If they are, it would
be helpful to know where—and, if not, why the
exclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000030"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="13062416000070" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000070">Baroness
Hanham:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a sort of déjà vu
about this amendment. The power of surcharge, as the noble Lord said,
enables auditors to recover money from individuals whose actions caused
losses to their councils, and was taken out in 2000. It was first
introduced in the 19th century, and it is felt to be quite unnecessary
in modern local government. In its 1997 report on standards in public
life, the Nolan committee concluded that surcharge was an
“archaic penalty”; what was archaic in 1997 is surely
even more so
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>. Moreover,
surcharge was unfair because of the technical difficulties in
calculating the relevant sums, which could be well beyond the means of
the individuals involved and bore no relation to people’s
ability to pay. This could result in damage to families as property and
assets were disposed of to pay the
surcharge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000031">I
note<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:11:31"></hs_TimeCode> that this
amendment offers no protection to those who act in the belief that the
expenditure that they were authorising was lawful, meaning that, as it
stands, the amendment might result in councillors or officials having
to make a substantial payment as a result of a decision that they make
in good faith<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:11:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
Following the abolition of surcharge, the Standards Board regime was
introduced to prevent personal misconduct by councillors in office.
Unfortunately, the Standards Board regime became a vehicle for petty
and malicious complaints so, in 2012, we abolished it and put in place
new arrangements for the conduct of councillors. These new arrangements
include tough new rules to prevent genuine, wilful corruption, with
councillors having to be transparent about their pecuniary interests.
The auditor can himself, or after a concern has been expressed, raise
the issue of a public interest report, as we have just discussed. We
have backed up these rules with a criminal penalty for the wilful
disregard of pecuniary interests, giving the courts the power to impose
a fine of up to £5,000 and to disqualify a guilty councillor
from
office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000032">Surcharge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:12:55"></hs_TimeCode>

joint appointments, it can be done jointly or by either one of the

point comes up with regard to who can make an application for judicial
review, although I notice that, in Clause 30, the reference is to the
Senior Courts Act 1981. The Audit Commission Act, unless it has been
amended since, makes reference to the Supreme Court Act 1981. I ask for

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a probing amendment
concerning advisory notices. It would appear that this regime has
replaced the prohibition order regime contained in the Audit Commission
Act 1998, but with some key differences. Advisory notices can be served
if an auditor considers an authority is about to make a decision that
would be unlawful or lead to unlawful expenditure. Under the advisory
notice regime, the decision or course of action would be unlawful
unless the authority, having reflected, considers it appropriate to
proceed. This would appear to contrast with the prohibition order
procedure, whereby, unless the order revokes it, the action or decision
remains unlawful subject to an appeal to the High Court. Is that
correct? Presumably, the risk of proceeding when faced with an advisory
notice is that the order would seek a determination from the court that
the expenditure involved is unlawful, so the onus has been switched
from the local authority to the auditor. Can the Government explain
this changed approach?</hs_para>

specific amendment was to delete the protection given to auditors from
any loss of damage alleged to have been caused by the issuing of the
advisory notice, which was issued in good faith. This mirrors the
protection given in respect of prohibition notices and raises the
question of who is to suffer the loss if there is one. Obviously, this
is not without its importance given the difficult financial times that
local government is in.</hs_para>

briefer by the minute. The Government think it is important to retain
this exemption in order to support the auditor’s ability to
undertake the important function according to their professional
judgment without fear of facing a damages claim, which, even were it
not upheld, would be costly and time-consuming to

report on things that have happened, their opinions on the accounts and
the issue of public interest reports, and apply to the court for a
declaration that there has been unlawful expenditure. The power to
issue an advisory notice is forward-looking, seeking to prevent the
authority taking some action that could be unlawful. It is possible,
therefore, that auditors will have to act quickly and action may be
based on partial evidence. The limitation of liability is to give the
auditor some protection to enable them to use their professional
judgment. We think it would be right to continue the
protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:19:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-24T17:20:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord’s questions, the Audit Commission Act includes advisory
notices. No major changes have been made to the power to issue an
advisory notice. It is still there. This mirrors existing provisions
under which the auditor can issue an advisory notice if he thinks that
the authority or an officer has undertaken or is about to undertake an
unlawful action: a decision on carrying unlawful expenditure, unlawful
action or entering an unlawful item of account. There are detailed
requirements about the contents of the advisory notice and how it
should be served. Within seven days of issuing an advisory
notice—this may be something that requires quick
action—the local authority is going to have to serve a statement
of its reasons for putting forward the advisory
notice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13062416000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130624-gc0001.htm#13062416000045">The

contains the current requirement for local authorities. An equivalent
requirement for health bodies has not existed previously and is not
required because the governance arrangements for health bodies are
different. Health bodies are consolidated into the accounts of the
Department of Health and are covered by the requirements of <I>Managing
Public Money</I> issued by Her Majesty’s Treasury. As such, they
are accountable to Parliament for their expenditure, not to local
people. The difference between the two is in the process. Under those
circumstances, I may not need to say that I will write to the noble
Lord on health service bodies. He will tell me whether he thinks I have

search for Middle East peace remains an urgent global priority in 2013.
At the start of this year we were clear about the overriding need for
the United States, supported by the international community, to lead an
effort to revitalise the peace process. The events of the Arab Spring,
particularly the threat posed by conflict in Syria, make the need for
progress even more pressing. We therefore deeply appreciate the
leadership which the US, and particularly Secretary Kerry, are showing
on this issue. Britain stands fully behind these efforts to revive the
peace process. We remain in close contact with the United States. On 12
June in Washington, the Foreign Secretary discussed with Secretary
Kerry the prospects for progress on the Peace Process and stressed UK
support for his efforts.</hs_para>

visited Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories on 23-24 May,
to demonstrate UK support for US efforts to bring about credible
negotiations. He met with key figures from both sides, including Prime
Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas, and welcomed their clear
commitment to a two-state solution and to work to achieve peace for the
Israeli and Palestinian people. With both parties, the Foreign
Secretary set out the urgent need for them to show bold and decisive
leadership and engage seriously with US efforts. The Foreign Secretary
made clear that there was no credible alternative to Secretary
Kerry’s initiative.</hs_para>

set out the UK’s commitment to seeing a negotiated two-state

Foreign Secretary also underlined UK concern about Israeli settlement
activity and the threat this poses to the two-state solution. He

serious engagement. In Israel, I met Justice Minister and Chief
Negotiator Tzipi Livni, International Relations and Strategic Affairs
Minister Yuval Steinitz and Prime Minister Netanyahu’s personal
envoy Isaac Molcho. In Ramallah, I met Palestinian President Abbas and
Prime Minister Hamdallah (who has since resigned), and paid another
visit to the village of Nabi Saleh in the West Bank. I also visited
Gaza and southern Israel, to understand the impact of movement and
access restrictions on the livelihoods of ordinary people, and the
reality faced by families who live in fear of rocket attacks. We are
clear that a solution to the problems of Gaza is urgently needed, that
economic restrictions should be lifted and that any negotiated
two-state solution must include Gaza—Gaza is a fundamental part

Secretary and I made clear to our Israeli and Palestinian partners that
maintaining the status quo is neither desirable, nor practicable. As
Secretary Kerry has said, a stalemate today will not remain one
tomorrow. We are running out of time to achieve a two-state solution as
the situation on the ground continues to deteriorate. Yet any
alternatives would be harder still. There is no such thing as a

with the strong support of the region and the wider international
community, or we face an uncertain and dangerous future. This is why
the Government will continue to do all we can to support US efforts. In
this context, we will discuss specific steps the EU can take in support
at the EU Foreign Affairs Council on 24 June. And we will continue to
work actively with the United States, the Israelis and Palestinians,
and our other international partners including the Arab League, to
achieve peace before the window for a two-state solution

Caribbean and Pacific countries. As of April this year, €682
million (71%) of this had been allocated to projects to help these

be rolled over into the next funding period, 2014-20, but the UK will
