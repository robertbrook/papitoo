been made. Payment-by-results is a tough and challenging regime, but
each exercise will be different and the process will evolve. It is a
better regime than paying for failure and mediocrity, which is what the
Labour Government did. The next test is the probation reforms. If the
hon. Gentleman looks at the detail of what the Ministry of Justice has
produced, he will see that lessons have been learned on having more
contracts, paying much more attention to how the supply chain is

we should be supporting things like the academies programme and free
schools. We saw in Labour’s announcement this week that they are

Gentleman is that work is the best answer for taking people out of

we do. Of course we should continue with the tax credits that we do
pay. Indeed, one of the decisions we made when we came into office was
to stop the nonsense of tax credits going to people, including Members
of this House of Commons, earning £50,000 or more a year. So we
are focusing the help on the people who need it most, and we have seen

set a clear agenda for this summit: to boost jobs and
growth, with more open trade, fairer taxes and greater
transparency—what I have called the three Ts. I also added a
fourth T—combating terrorism. We reached important agreements,
including on support to the Libyan Government and ending ransom
payments for kidnap by terrorists. Despite our fundamental differences,
we also made good progress, agreeing a way forward on
working together to help the Syrian people achieve the change they
want. Let me take each of these points in
turn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000208">We
started with the issues that matter most to our people—jobs,
growth and mending our economies. First, we agreed that each country
needs to press on with sorting out its public finances. Dealing with
our debts and securing growth are not alternatives. The former is an
essential step in achieving the latter. In fact, the communiqué
that we agreed unanimously reflects all three parts of the plan for
growth that we have in Britain—not just fiscal sustainability,
but active monetary policy to unlock the finance that businesses and
families need, and structural reforms to increase our competitiveness
so that our young people can get into work and succeed in the global
race.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000209">The
UK’s G8 also launched a bold new pro-business agenda to drive a
dramatic increase in trade and to get to grips with the problems of tax
evasion, aggressive tax avoidance and corporate secrecy. This was a
distinctive British agenda to shape the way the world economy works for
the benefit of everyone. We believe in free trade, private enterprise
and low taxes as the best route to growth, but that is only sustainable
if ambitious trade deals are agreed, the taxes owed are paid and
companies play by the rules. This agenda has now, I believe, been
written into the DNA of G8 and G20 summits for many years to
come.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000210">On
trade, we started the summit with the launch of negotiations on the
EU-US trade deal. As has recently been said, this could add as much as
£100 billion to the EU economy, £80 billion to the US and
£85 billion for the rest of the world. We should be clear about
what these numbers mean: more jobs, more choice and lower prices in our
shops, and the biggest bilateral trade deal in history, launched at our
G8.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000211">On
tax, the Lough Erne declaration that leaders signed yesterday sets out
simple, clear commitments: tax authorities around the world should
automatically 
<?notus-xml column=894?>share information so that those who want to evade taxes will have
nowhere to hide; companies should know who really owns them; and tax
collectors and law enforcers should be able to obtain this information
easily, for example through central registries, so that people cannot
escape taxes by using complicated and fake structures. In a world where
business has moved from the offline and the national to the online and
the international but the tax system has not caught up, we are
commissioning the OECD to develop a new international tax tool that
will expose discrepancies between where multinationals earn their
profits and where they pay their
taxes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000212">The
declaration also makes it clear that all that action has to help
developing countries too, by sharing tax information and building their
capability to collect taxes. Crucially for developing countries, we
agreed that oil, gas and mining companies should report what they pay
to Governments and that Governments should publish what they receive so
that natural resources are a blessing, not a curse. Charities and other
non-governmental organisations have rightly campaigned for years for
action on these issues, and for the first time they have been raised to
the top of the agenda and brought together in one document.</hs_Para>

agreements on tax made at the summit are significant, but it is also
worth noting what has happened on this front since I put the issue to
the top of the agenda. On 1 January there was no single international
standard for automatic exchange of information. Now there is such a
standard, and over 30 jurisdictions have already signed up, with more
to follow. After years of delay, the European Union has agreed to
progress the sharing of tax information between member states. The
UK’s overseas territories and Crown dependencies have signed up
to the multilateral convention on information exchange and agreed
automatic exchange of information with the UK and action plans for
beneficial ownership. Taken together, all the actions agreed with the
overseas territories and Crown dependencies will provide over
£1 billion in revenue to the Exchequer, helping to
keep taxes down for hard-working families here in
Britain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000214">People
around the world also wanted to know whether the G8 would take action
to tackle malnutrition and ensure that there is enough food for
everyone. The pledges at our nutrition and hunger summit earlier this
month will save 20 million children from stunting by 2020. Crucially,
our G8 also took action on some of the causes of these problems. That
is why the work we did on land, extractive industries, tax and
transparency is so
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000215">Turing
to the fourth T—terrorism—we agreed a tough, patient and
intelligent approach: confronting the terrorists, defeating the
poisonous ideology that sustains them and tackling the weak and failing
states in which they thrive. The G8 leaders reached a groundbreaking
agreement on ransom payments for kidnap by terrorists. In the last
three years alone ransom payments have given al-Qaeda and its allies
tens of millions of dollars. These payments have to stop and this G8
agreed that they
will.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000216">We

forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000217">We
also discussed support to Libya. I believe that we should be proud of
the role we played in ridding Libya of Colonel Gaddafi, but we need to
help that country 
<?notus-xml column=895?>secure its future. So we held a separate meeting with the Libyan Prime
Minister, which included President Obama, and European nations have
already offered to train 7,000 troops to help Prime Minister Zeidan
disarm and integrate the militias and bring security to the whole
country. More contributions will follow from others. Let me be clear
that the Libyan Government have asked for this and will pay for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000218">Finally,
let me turn to Syria. It is no secret that there are very different
views around the G8 table, but I was determined that we should use the
opportunity of this summit to overcome some of these differences and
agree a way forward to help the Syrian people achieve the change that
they want. This did not happen during just one night in Lough Erne; the
talks between Secretary Kerry and Foreign Minister Lavrov have been
vital.</hs_Para>

before the summit, I flew to Sochi and Washington, and I met again
President Putin and President Obama in the hours before the summit
began. These conversations were open, honest and frank, but we were all
agreed on what must be the core principle of the international approach
to this crisis. There is no military victory to be won and all our
efforts must be focused on the ultimate goal of a political
solution.</hs_Para>

our G8 partners, we agreed almost $1.5 billion of new money for
humanitarian support. This is an unprecedented commitment from Lough
Erne for Syria and her neighbours. We agreed to back a Geneva II
process that delivers a transitional governing body with, crucially,
full Executive authority. So a core requirement for success that had
been called into doubt in recent weeks has now been reasserted
unanimously, with the full authority of the
G8.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000221">We
pledged to learn the lessons of Iraq by making sure that the key
institutions of the state are maintained throughout the transition and
that there is no vacuum. This sends a clear message to those loyalists
looking for an alternative to Assad. The G8 also unequivocally
condemned any use of chemical weapons and, following an
extensive debate, we reached for the first time a united position,
including Russia, that the regime must immediately allow unrestricted
access for UN inspectors to establish the full facts on the use of
chemical weapons by regime forces, or indeed by anyone else. All these
agreements are absolutely fundamental to saving lives and securing the
political transition that we all want to see.</hs_Para>

clear on what is happening in Syria and what we are trying to achieve.
We are faced with a dramatically escalating humanitarian disaster with
more than 90,000 dead and almost 6 million people having had to flee
their homes. There is a radicalisation of terrorists and extremists who
will pose a direct threat to the security of the region and also the
world. There is a growing risk to the peace and stability of
Syria’s neighbours and the long-standing international
prohibition on chemical weapons is being breached by a dictator who is
brutalising his
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000223">None
of this constitutes an argument for plunging in recklessly. We will not
do so, and we will not take any major actions without first coming to
this House. But we cannot simply ignore this continuing slaughter. Of
course it is right to point out that there are extremists among the
Opposition. There are, and I am clear: they 
<?notus-xml column=896?>pose a threat not just to Syria but to all of us. The G8 agreed that
they should be defeated and expelled from their havens in
Syria.</hs_Para>

understand those who fear that whatever we try to do could make things
worse, not better. Of course we must think carefully before any course
of action, but we must not accept what President Assad wants us to
believe—that the only alternative to his brutal action against
Syria is extremism and terrorism. There are millions of ordinary
Syrians who want to take control of their own future, a future without
Assad. That is why I made sure that the G8 agreed that the way through
the crisis is to help Syrians forge a new Government who are neither
Sunni, nor Alawite, nor Shi’a.</hs_Para>

This is not easy, but the essential first step must be to get agreement

and commitments made during the hunger summit. The task must now be to
ensure that these commitments will be delivered. Does the Prime

Gentleman for what he said about holding the conference in Northern
Ireland. That was not without its difficulties and questions were
asked, but not only was it a very successful and very well-managed and
well-run conference—I pay tribute to everyone who was involved
in it—but I think it was also one of the most peaceful G8s in
terms of demonstrations. It was rumoured that one of the six tents in
the place where all the tents were going to be put up belonged to some
Dutch folk who happened to be on holiday. I also read this morning that
one of the hopeful shopkeepers in Enniskillen had stocked up on vegan
meals only to find that the protesters did not turn up in large enough
numbers, so he now has 
<?notus-xml column=898?>a large supply going spare. It is a remarkable part of our country and

thank the right hon. Gentleman for what he said on the aid pledge. It
is right that Britain has made and kept its promises, and we use that
to bring others up to the mark. Of course, the G8 always publishes an
accountability report. A lot of these communiqués are
impenetrable, but this is very simple and straightforward on who has
promised what and whether they have kept that promise. We should go on
publishing those reports. I say to any sceptics that for every pound
they pay in tax, only 1p of it goes to overseas aid. I think that that
is a good investment in the future of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0001.htm#13061976000240">I

It is good that we have made a start on EU-US trade and disappointing

right hon. Gentleman raised the issue of public registries of
beneficial ownership and asked why we had not achieved public
registries everywhere. For many G8 Governments and leaders, this is a
new issue at the top of the agenda. I am absolutely convinced that
central registries of ownership are vital if we are to cut out
corruption and corrupt payments from developing countries, and if we
are to get to the bottom of tax evasion. We put that on the agenda, and
every G8 country has agreed to an action plan, and some have
committed to immediate registries. We must keep pushing on that agenda
because it is so vital. We will consult on whether our registry should
be public—I look forward to the consultation getting
going—but no one should underestimate the importance of having a
registry so that the tax authorities can get to grips with
those

the position we are now in. I would make two points to him on that. The
Russians were backing off the idea of a transitional authority with
full Executive powers, but have now fully reaffirmed it. That is
important because no one wants to take part in negotiations that are
for negotiations’ sake—they must be about
something—and a transitional authority will not work unless it
has full Executive power, including over the armed forces. As I said in
my statement, the language and approach on chemical weapons is new, as
is the language on humanitarian aid. Those new things were achieved at

would make to him is this: I think that lifting the arms embargo in the
EU was right. It sent a powerful signal that there is not a moral
equivalence between Assad on the one hand and the official opposition,
who want a democratic Syria, on the other. That has helped to add to
the pressure. There is a huge danger that people will fall into the
trap of believing Assad’s argument, which is that the only
alternative to him is terrorism and extremism. We should stand for
something else in the House and in this country—we should stand

be made only by the killing, or removal in some way, of President
Assad, because the Syrian presidency is something of a family business,
and President Assad has a number of extremely tough and ruthless
individuals around him. They are probably tougher and more ruthless
than he is. If President Assad is removed, one of them will instantly
take over his position, and will be just as determined to prevent the
Alawites from being massacred by the Sunni as is President Assad. If

the drivers of terrorism and extremism across north Africa, and on what

peace conference and a transitional Government, and we want a peace
settlement. We believe, however, that we should be helping the Syrian
national opposition. We have recognised—not just us, but America
and countries across the European Union—that the opposition are
legitimate spokespeople for the Syrian people. We should decry
Assad—frankly, I hope the Labour party and all its allies in the
Social Democratic and Labour party and elsewhere will decry
Assad—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> and continue to do

say that on Libya, I think it was right to work with others, including
the French. There was cross-party agreement to do that and get rid of
Gaddafi. Of course, that work is never done, but that should not be an
argument for never doing anything anywhere. If we take action, as we do
in Libya, we must do everything we can to help the successor regime
that is democratically elected get weapons out of Libya, and that is
what we are doing. Those are all arguments for engagement and working

remember that. On the issue of how wide to take the discussions, of
course in the end we need to involve all partners and
neighbours—the more people who buy into a process, the
better—but it is important that we do not make that a substitute
for the real action that is needed, which is to get the Syrian regime
and the Syrian opposition, with encouragement from the Russians and
Americans, to name the people who need to sit round the table to hold
those talks. That is where the leaders need to apply pressure on

Clearly, it is a concern, because Syria has very large stockpiles of
chemical weapons, and I think we have to focus on both dangers: the
danger that the regime could use them again—as we have said, we
believe they have been used on 10 occasions, so we have to beware of
that danger, and President Obama has sent a clear message about
that—and the danger that these stocks could fall into dangerous
hands. We have to be alert to both dangers. He is absolutely right to

cast our minds back to 2001, we will remember that one of the reasons
we went into Afghanistan was that the then Taliban regime refused to
give up or condemn al-Qaeda. The whole point of the action was to get
al-Qaeda out of Afghanistan and to stop them launching attacks from
there on our soil. We should pay tribute to the more than 400 service
personnel who have given their lives and to the many more who have been
wounded. We should pay tribute to the incredible work they have done.
They have helped bring us to a point at which Afghanistan is now taking
responsibility for its own security through the highly capable Afghan
national security forces. The Taliban have said in their statement that

days of sunshine were a bonus, and not one that I was expecting. The
point about the discussions with the Taliban is that they are taking
place against the background of a statement by the Taliban
that—I am paraphrasing—they do not want to see
Afghanistan being used as a base for attacks on other countries. That
is the right basis for them to start from, but clearly the whole aim of
the process is to give people who thought that they could achieve their
goals through the bomb and the bullet an opportunity to achieve them by

Of course, if Britain wanted to leave the European Union, we could do
so and we could then make trade deals with every country in the world.
Obviously that path is open to us. The argument that I would make is
that, as part of the European Union—the world’s largest
single market—we have the opportunity to drive some quite good
deals. Clearly we sometimes have to make compromises with EU partners
with whom we might not agree, but I would argue that, on balance,
membership of the single market brings clear benefits, as does the
negotiating heft that we have. The whole point is that we are going to
be able to debate and discuss this, not least in the run-up to a

the misuse of companies and legal arrangements” provides eight

“could” and no “shall”. The provisions will
be subject to a process of self-reporting against individual action
plans. The UK individual action plan, which was helpfully published

That is the point of the high-level international tax tool. I have been

less what we want the OECD to provide to countries so that we can see
at a glance what a company earns, what its profits are and how much tax
it has paid. In that way, we shall be able to see whether there is a
problem, and whether further investigation is required. The register of
beneficial ownership will also help, because it will enable us to hunt
down the true owners of companies that are being registered under

most shocking revelation in this report is that, in March 2012, an

“delete” the findings of a critical internal review. Let
me remind the House of the context in which that March 2012 instruction
was given. At that time, we were midway through a major public inquiry
into the terrible failings at Mid Staffs. This was two years after the
completion of an earlier independent inquiry—also led by Robert
Francis, QC—following which all parts of the NHS had committed
to full openness and transparency. It also came after failings at other
trusts—most notably Basildon and Thurrock—which led me to
request an in-depth look at all hospitals so that problems could be
flushed out and a system put in place to ensure that people had a
comprehensive picture of local
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:15:12"></hs_TimeCode>. That

whether that has happened in this case. Concerns about the CQC were
raised by an internal whistleblower who was on the board. We know there
was an attempt to remove her from the board and to question her
character. Has the Secretary of State looked into these issues and
considered whether appropriate support was provided—by both the
CQC and the Department—to the individual who raised these
concerns? The same whistleblower told the CQC today that she had raised
issues internally first, then within the Department and then directly
with the former Secretary of State in a meeting. Will the Secretary of
State provide details of that meeting and publish a minute of it? What
actions were taken by Ministers subsequent to that meeting? Were

buck stops in terms of sorting out a problem when it is identified.

Friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:29:04"></hs_TimeCode> says. He
is absolutely right that accountability for what went wrong is crucial
in this. I know that the CQC wanted to publish the report in full
today, including the names of the individuals involved, but was given
legal advice that it would be against the law to do so. However, the
CQC is keen to have maximum transparency as soon as possible and is
looking into how it can make sure that happens. There no should be no
anonymity, no hiding place, no opportunity to get off scot-free for
anyone at all who was responsible for this. This is the problem we have
to address in the NHS: all too often, people are not held accountable
for what went wrong. However, the system also bears responsibility.
This is not just about bad apples and how we root them out 
<?notus-xml column=930?>more quickly; it is also about creating a system that brings out the

course, support that. However, CQC inspectors have had access to
specialists for a long time—they have talked about it before the

with full ministerial approval, to go for a generalist inspection
model—a model where inspection was not carried out by
specialists; the same people would inspect dental clinics, GP
practices, hospitals and slimming clinics. That was the wrong decision
to take. Making sure that we have enough specialist inspectors in
place, with appropriate clinical expertise, takes time—it is a
very big recruitment job—and that is what the new chief
inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, is now setting
about doing. It is also expensive—it costs money—but he
has said to me that when his teams are in place he will start those
inspections before the end of this year. So we are going as fast as we

frees up people on the front line to raise safety concerns

encourages them to rethink procedures to minimise the risk of harm to
patients; and that encourages the open and transparent approach that
has enabled hospitals such as Salford royal to become one of
the safest in the country, because of the inspirational leadership of
David Dalton. That change in leadership is fundamental, but having a

What happened beggars belief, and I very much agreed with his comments

that there will be a criminal liability for boards that do not tell

tell the regulator; boards will have a responsibility to be honest,

key issues raised by the Francis report was the fact that we have a
form of accountability for doctors and nurses—it does not always
work as well as it should—through the possibility of being
struck off by the GMC and the Nursing and Midwifery Council, but there
is no equivalent accountability for managers. In a way, that is what
the chief inspector is going to do. That is why I was so keen that as
well as looking at whether a hospital is safe or not, the chief
inspector 
<?notus-xml column=934?>should rate hospitals with Ofsted-style rankings, which look clearly at
the quality of leadership in every organisation. The score that a
hospital or a trust gets from the chief inspector will ultimately be
the determinant of whether or not an organisation is well led. That is
why I think it will give the public vital information about leadership,

developing a strategy for the arts and creative industries; believes
that this should include putting creativity at the heart of education,
ensuring that creative industries have access to finance and funding,
protecting intellectual property, supporting the arts and creative

debate is an opportunity for the whole House to express support for our
arts and creative industries and to assert their great importance to
this country. In this House, we often debate health, education and the
economy, and we should recognise that the arts contribute to all of
those. It is right too that we talk about the intrinsic value of the
arts—how they move us and challenge us, and the great joy that
arts and culture bring to our lives. Yes, the arts make money for this
country, but they are never just a commodity. From the parents watching
a school play to the nation watching the Olympic ceremony, the arts
enrich our lives and all our
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:57:48"></hs_TimeCode>.

are a country that produces some of the greatest creativity on the
planet, whether it is music, fashion, film, theatre, broadcasting,
design, art, our libraries or our museums. Our cultural creativity is
admired and envied around the world, and it was that belief that led
the Labour party when it was in government to step up support for the
arts, including massively strengthening the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport, bringing in free entry to museums and galleries, and
trebling the budget for the Arts Council. But let us be clear: public
support for the arts is repaid over and over. For example, there was a
£5,000 public subsidy to support the stage production of
“The Woman in Black”. Since then, the production company
has paid back more than £12 million in tax to the
Treasury.</hs_Para>

subsidy allows for the willingness of the arts to take risks, like the
hugely successful “Matilda”, which the Royal Shakespeare
company says would just not have been possible without public seedcorn
funding. For some, subsidy has become a dirty word, but there is a
false dichotomy between the public and the commercial. They are
inextricably linked. Public investment gives the space for commercial
success. The Arts Council calculates that for every pound of Government
spending invested in the arts, the British economy gets £4
back.</hs_Para>

general election, the Department has taken on more responsibilities,
including, notably, telecoms, so the creative industries are not the

encourage organisations to build endowments for the first time;
introduced lifetime giving and the cultural gift scheme; maintained
free access to museums in the toughest economic climate for almost a
century; launched a national music education plan; developed a national
cultural education plan; introduced tax credits for film, television

Some really good work is being done between the British Museum and
Birmingham art galleries. It is not so much a question of money as of
central co-ordination. It looks to me as though that co-ordination is
about to be lost. Will the Secretary of State assure us that that is

co-ordination and regional funding. That is why we have put so much

Miller:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises a really important point. In
his constituency I saw first hand how this commitment to the arts is
being translated into industry and jobs in the heart of his
constituency. That sort of relationship between the arts and the
creative industries means that we have some of the very best creative
industries in the world. As the recent survey of theatre workers by
Creative &amp; Cultural Skills demonstrated, the relationship between
cultural organisations and the creative industries is fluid and vital,
and underpins the £36 billion a year that the creative
industries are

remarks. Our international reputation for arts and culture and the easy
transfer of people between the cultural sector and the creative
industries are based on the enormous talents of the people who work in
the sector. We recognise that we need to invest for the future,
however, and thanks to our sector skills councils, more than 3,500
people have either completed or are currently doing apprenticeships in
the creative industries. The Arts Council’s creative employment
programme will support up to 6,500 new apprenticeships,
pre-apprenticeships and paid internships across the sector, and the
Government are investing up to £8 million each year over the
next two years to support skills development in the UK digital content
sector. That is important investment in people for the future. It is
ensuring that our creative industries have the sort of skilled work

the beautiful historic city of York. It is a vibrant centre for the
arts, science, craft skills, technology and the creative industries. It
is important to realise that they feed off each other—we cannot
silo the arts away from science and think that the one does not affect
the other. We have apprentice stonemasons being trained at York Minster
and wood carvers. The York Glaziers Trust is restoring the biggest
mediaeval work of art in the world, the great east window of York
Minster, in a £30 million project. Exhibition designers have
just installed the new York Minster Revealed exhibition in the
undercroft below York Minster, which combines Roman remains with
interactive computer-driven displays, so that people can imagine what
life was like almost 2,000 years ago. We have software engineers who
have designed some of the world’s most popular computer games. I
could talk about all these things, but instead I want to talk about one
thing only: the Science Museum Group, which includes the National
Railway museum in York.</hs_Para>

also tabled a parliamentary question to ask about the

replied yesterday, for which I am grateful. He told me that if the
funding were pooled for the Science museum, which includes the York,
Shildon and Bradford museums, the Museum for Science and Industry in
Manchester, which was funded separately until recently, and the
National Coal Mining museum, one would see that the total had fallen
from £48.25 million in 2009-10 to £42.25
million this year. That is a reduction of more than 15% after inflation

that the Department for Culture, Media and Sport secured a reduction of
only 5% in its funding settlement. If the Science museum received a
further cut of 5%, its structural deficit would increase from about
£2 million a year to £4 million a year. Nothing has been
said yet about the capital funding of between £2 million and
£2.5 million. If that is not provided, the deficit will of
course increase further, because revenue money would have to be used to
repair the roof of the museum and for other capital works.

Museum Group does not receive capital money in addition, the deficit

outreach and for collecting new assets.

inevitable. This Government have the higher priority of trying to clear

<?notus-xml column=961?>up the enormous mountain of borrowing and debt that we inherited, and it
would be wrong to exclude the arts from having to play a part in that.
However, when we on the Select Committee looked at funding of the arts
immediately after the election, we said that it would result in some
difficult decisions and that some institutions would probably close as
a result. I am delighted to hear from the Secretary of State that she
has done well in her debate with colleagues in the Treasury for this
year’s spending settlement, but I understand from what I have
read and what she has said that we can anticipate still further
reductions. That means that more institutions will probably have to

that we need to look at other means by which we can find funding for
those institutions. The Government have already done a lot in trying to
encourage philanthropy and, as has been mentioned, to increase the
money going from the national lottery. In that respect, I would suggest
that what the shadow Secretary of State described as the arts emergency
might mean that we can consider—perhaps on only a temporary
basis—the flexibility of national lottery funding. It has always
been the principle that national lottery funding is there for capital
investment projects and not for meeting ongoing costs, but if the
consequence is that we can build new buildings while existing ones
close, that would not necessarily seem to be a sensible use of
resources. That is something that we might consider, if only for a
limited period.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=962?>pursue questionable and illusory benefits at the price of putting at
risk the huge economic benefit to this country from the success of all

Ministers in the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, to
think very carefully about introducing such things as private copying
exception and some of the other Hargreaves proposals. I know that we

also need to do more to tackle online piracy, which is still doing huge
damage to the creative industries. The Digital Economy Act
2010 was an extremely good first step: it is not perfect, but it is
nevertheless a matter of great regret that none of its provisions have
yet been enacted. Things are being done—the City of London
police are doing extremely good work, and I strongly support their new
initiatives to pursue online intellectual property crime—but a
very strong signal would be sent if letters could be written to serial
file-sharers who are in breach of copyright law, telling them that what

sheer number of jobs involved. The creative industries employ about 1.5
million people, and, according to Government statistics, employment in
the sector is increasing at twice the rate of the economy. This is not

well. I mentioned earlier that young people drive the industry, but in
talking about jobs we must address the desperate need to encourage and
support those who want to follow such a path.

Government’s education policy, there has been a downgrading of
the arts and other subjects that lead towards the creative industries.
More importantly, there are few opportunities for young people to train
on the job in apprenticeships and paid posts. I fear that those who
cannot afford to work in such posts, or to go to university to gain the
additional qualifications—they may not even want to do

afford not to be paid; they can afford to live in London,
Manchester or Glasgow with no wages. That is not a reality for many
young people, so we inevitably lose some of our best talents to those

John Leech</B> (Manchester, Withington) (LD):</Member> I am grateful
for the opportunity to take part in this debate. The arts and creative
industries are one of the UK’s biggest success stories,
outperforming most of our more traditional sectors of the economy and
exporting talent across the globe. They are one of the main reasons why
the UK is a prime destination of choice for so many foreign travellers.
Unfortunately, we do not often get the opportunity to talk about its
successes or to debate some of the potential challenges ahead, which is
why I welcome this opportunity.</hs_Para>

little doubt that the subject of this Opposition day debate was chosen
in the light of questions being raised about the future of some of our
finest museums in the north—in Manchester, Bradford and
York—but the unequivocal response from the Minister that the
museums are not going to close, and the tough negotiations by the
Secretary of State, which have resulted in a much better settlement for
our museums, have rather ruined the Opposition’s opportunity to
criticise the Government. This has resulted in a fairly benign motion,
which the Government could quite easily have agreed to, and I certainly
agree with the comments of the Chair of my Select Committee,

anything put forward by Oppositions. I suppose it could be argued that
the Opposition’s motion questions the leadership of the

museums in the north if the spending review resulted in a 10% cut in
the budget, or at least to start charging to make up the predicted
increase in the deficit from £2 million to £6
million. That resulted in huge campaigns to protect our museums,

I am certain about is that we must not go down the road of charging for
entry. The previous Government should be applauded for ending charging
at state-funded museums in 2001. In Manchester that resulted in an
increase in patronage from 288,000 in the last 12 months of charging to
over 833,000 last year. MOSI is Manchester’s No. 1 attraction,
but it is more than that: it is a science and industry museum located

learning. Most children across Greater Manchester will visit the museum
at some point in their school career.</hs_Para>

there were 5 million visitors to the group’s four museums in the
last 12 months. Even with the “doomsday” scenario mooted
by Ian Blatchford, that means the SMG would need to generate only
£1.20 extra from visitors coming through the doors to
wipe out the £6 million deficit.</hs_Para>

an entry fee is not the answer. We know what charging does to visitor
numbers. Currently eight of the top 10 UK visitor attractions are free
DCMS-sponsored national museums, and there are about 18
million annual visits to museums and galleries that used to charge an
entrance fee. It would also have an impact on foreign tourism.
According to VisitBritain, Britain’s major museums and galleries
earn the country £1 billion a year in revenue from overseas
tourists. A recent report on Britain’s culture and heritage
showed that museums and galleries are a key motivator for many
international visitors to Britain, with free world-class national
museums and art galleries a particular draw. Given the importance of

the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Jim Sheridan) was a bit
hard on himself in saying that he was not fully involved with the
thought patterns on what needs to happen. He, like me, has certainly
learned that the creative industries are vital parts of this
country’s lifeblood. They are also important to cities such as
Bradford.</hs_Para>

know the House will forgive me for talking about the plight of
Bradford’s media museum, but before I do that I wish to mention
something that was being talked about long before the prospect of its
closure: the rebranding of the city. We were discussing a city with a
strong literary and cultural history, and people will know that of
Bradford. It is the home of the Brontës, J. B. Priestley, 
<?notus-xml column=967?>David Hockney, the Black Dyke Mills Band, Kala Sangam and, more
recently, Zayn from One Direction. It is also the birthplace of the
British film industry and is the first UNESCO city of film. The
Minister, and the Education Secretary, whom we are delighted to see in
his place, will be pleased to know that next month Bradford college
will launch the international film school. That brings together
Bollywood and international film makers from around the world to teach
the youngsters of Bradford about film. Of course, as I said, Bradford
is also the home of the National Media museum.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061976000740" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000740"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:24:17"></hs_TimeCode>We
were not just involved in a marketing or rebranding exercise; it was
about rethinking our future economy in Bradford and cities like it.
Bradford is very close to Leeds, the regional centre, and we wanted to
find a way to examine the job and economic prospects for Bradford for
the future. We want to sell ourselves as a city of culture, media and
sport—we have the heritage. That is why the announcement saying
that the National Media museum may close came as a bit of a blow. I
think that there has been some inverted snobbery over many years. I am
old enough to remember when we first got the National Media museum from
London in the late ’80s, at a time when the then Government were
trying to make sure that everything was not concentrated around London
and that things would go out to the regions. We were proud to have the
National Media museum in Bradford, but there has been snobbery in the
past, as people have, year after year, been trying to get the museum
back to London from Bradford. So it is great news that the Minister
said what he did to the group of Bradford MPs and said publicly
yesterday that there is no reason why the media museum should close. It
is great news that the Department has been able to reduce a 10% cut to
a 5% cut, but it is still a cut.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

of problems that we

hope the Minister can tell us about the capital programme and the
issues that science museums may face in relation to the capital
project. That will be important to the future of the museum. It is not
just about saving the northern museums; it is about putting investment
in and making sure that they are places where people want to go. Our
museum has been run down over the past few years. I do not care whose
fault that is. We need to look at new partnership arrangements to make
sure that we can invigorate that museum. We can do that through the
local authority, the local college and the local university
coming together, and businesses in Bradford looking to see what they
can do philanthropically to protect the future of the
museum<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
grateful to the Minister, who said at the meeting on Monday that he
would use his good offices to bring people together to try and make

Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale) said. The Government need to take
heed of bodies such as ALCS, which the Minister knows well. It is not
about alcoholics, as he tried to explain yesterday when he talked about
Barbara Hayes and Janet Anderson spending their time in Strangers Bar.

creative industries are important to the economy. They are the new
manufacturing, in terms of the opportunities that they present. In
Bradford we have a growing young population. We have the opportunity to
have technicians involved in the film industry and in the games

interest that the Warner Brothers planning application has been turned
down. If Buckinghamshire does not want it, we will have it in Bradford
and in Yorkshire. We must ensure that the sector in the UK remains a
world-leading sector. We may have our political knockabout, but the
sector is important to us as a country and we need to make sure that we

Tomlinson</B> (North Swindon) (Con):</Member> I shall take this
opportunity to try to cover two subjects, the video games industry and
libraries. I am the chair of both all-party parliamentary
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:27:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000745" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000745">Starting
with the video games industry, I work very well with the trade
representatives, UKIE, the Association for UK Interactive
Entertainment, and TIGA, which have done an incredible job in helping
to shape Government policy and promote an industry that is growing at
an incredible rate. In the UK alone the video game consumer market is
worth £2.9 billion, with year-on-year growth of 4%. That makes
up 40.2% of the entertainment market. There are about 33.6 million
games in the UK, evenly split between males and females. The UK is the
third biggest consumer market for the video games industry, after Japan
and America. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that the global market
will be worth $87 billion by
2017<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:28:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000746" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000746">Game
development is popular in the UK, with 56 universities
providing 141 video games specialist courses throughout the UK. There
are 9,224 creative staff working in studios, with 16,864 jobs
indirectly supported by those studios. The sector’s
contribution—this is always music to politicians’
ears—to the UK gross domestic product was around £947
million in 2012. Crucially, 95% of our game developers export their
product<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:28:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000747" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000747">The
first of the three points that I want is that the UK games tax relief
is hugely welcome news. It will be a major shot in the arm to our
industry and will allow us to keep up with the international
competition and the huge potential for growth in the sector. For those
Eurosceptics in the Chamber, I have to say that Europe is being
particularly difficult. I urge the Government to stand up, as they do
on many other issues relating to Europe, and make sure that Europe does
not cheat our games developers out of the incentive to
proceed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000748" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000748">Secondly,
the radical changes to computer science in schools are also crucial. On
a number of occasions I have visited a local studio called Neon Play,
which is expanding at an incredible rate and producing fantastic games.
It tells me that its biggest challenge is getting skilled people.
People have the degrees and qualifications, but they almost have to
start again because their education has been broad brush rather than
specialising in, for example, 3D programming, design, music or a
particular 
<?notus-xml column=969?>segment of a game, which would make a huge
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:29:45"></hs_TimeCode>. I
saw how it can inspire young people. I was fortunate enough to be able
to take a child from a local organisation called SMASH, which helps
children from challenging backgrounds, and he was given an opportunity
to be inspired in a career that ultimately, on average, pays
£34,000 a year, which is definitely worth aspiring
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:30:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000749" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000749">Finally,
we need to consider the problem of the lack of females in the video
games industry. I went to an event organised by a fantastic charity
called Lady Geek. Within the industry, 90% of jobs are taken by males,
and only 4% of game developers are female. Lady Geek is doing a
fantastic job to promote and encourage as many females as possible to
take this up, and I have recently written to the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport to ask her personally to meet representatives
of the charity, and I very much hope that she

provide an important starting point for many people who ultimately go
into the creative industries. I was formerly the lead member for
libraries within my local authority and we built a number of new
libraries, including a £10 million central library on time and
on budget, and made some changes. I want to make a quick whistle-stop
tour of things that I would like to see within the library service, and
I am sure that the shadow Minister will be taking lots of notes, as
this is an area that he often follows

library buildings are key. In a modern bookshop such as Waterstones,
one expects a certain quality of service, but I am afraid that too many
of our libraries are in need of refurbishment. Local authorities must
utilise section 106 moneys, the new homes bonus and the opportunities
within the Localism Act 2011 to leverage bits of funding. When they
spend that money, they need to look at sharing best practice. Too
often, local authorities reinvent the wheel, start again and spend huge
sums doing things that Waterstones would do for a fraction of the
price<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:31:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000752" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000752">We
must also consider measures such as shared usage. Our Old Town library
was due to close. I was part of the team that campaigned to keep it,
and across the road we had a fantastic refurbished arts centre. We
transferred the library into that, and it extended its core 20 hours to
cover the entire time that the arts centre was open. The council had to
pay only one set of rent and rates, and usage went through the
roof.</hs_Para>

Deputy Speaker, for allowing me to make my maiden speech in this
debate. I am deeply honoured not only to have been chosen by the people
of South Shields to represent them as their Member of Parliament, but
to be the first woman to do so. Shields has boasted a Labour MP in
every election since 1935. It gives me tremendous pride to represent
one of the most discerning electorates in the country.</hs_Para>

like to pay tribute to my predecessor, David Miliband. David was a
passionate and brilliant public servant, both as a constituency MP and
a Cabinet Minister. He was highly regarded by the local community, not
least for presiding over the dramatic transformation of our schools.
His record in government, beginning as schools Minister, then a
Communities and Local Government Minister, then Environment Secretary,
and finally Foreign Secretary, is proof of the determination and vigour
with which he pursued his role. I know that Members on both sides of
the House share my admiration and respect for him and wish him well in
his new
role.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000768" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000768">Shields<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:36:27"></hs_TimeCode>

the River Tyne and facing out to the North sea. As a port, it has
welcomed seafarers from far-flung locations. Its magnificent coastline
and award-winning beaches are one of the north-east’s great
natural spectacles. Each year we host one of Britain’s greatest

community and trade union activity. It is a town that knows the dignity
and reward that work brings and understands the duty we each have to
provide not just for ourselves and our families, but for the world
around us. It is a town enriched by a diversity of outlooks and
traditions, dating back to the days of the Roman empire but continually
refreshed by the arrival of foreign traders and settlers. I hope that
my contribution to the House will reflect those virtues and do credit
to the community I

innovators. My great-great-great-grandfather, William Wouldhave, was

Britain’s oldest daily newspaper, <I>The</I> <I>Shields

which will include a new cinema, library and arts centre. That will add
to our already vibrant creative industry, comprising the South Shields
museum and the Customs House. Since the 1800s, the Customs House has
developed into a premier arts venue, with a theatre, cinema and
gallery. Through its chartered programme, the Customs House, under the
fantastic leadership of Ray Spencer, known locally as “Tommy the

an opportunity for all people to engage and learn from the arts. That

place from which she comes, I am sure that she will proudly represent
her community. Her great sense of history, place and public service
shone through her speech. She must be particularly pleased to be the
first woman to represent her seat. As a woman Member of Parliament, I
am pleased to welcome other women, whatever side of the House they sit
on. Having more women Members of Parliament can only be a force for

the most difficult speech that a Member of Parliament makes; I assure

turn to the subject of the debate. Like the Secretary of State, I
believe passionately in the intrinsic value of the arts, which are a
fundamental expression of our human nature and important for our sense
of health and well-being. As the Secretary of State rightly pointed
out, arts and the creative industries are also important 
<?notus-xml column=973?>to our economy. In the south-west, the creative economy is worth more
than £1 billion and the region employs more than 94,000 people

of creative arts in Cornwall and my constituency in particular. Cornish
people are naturally creative and innovative, as well as self-reliant,

the couple of minutes I have left, I want to draw the House’s
attention to another way in which the Government are supporting the

reputation for excellence in art, design, media and performance. It has
4,000 students and employs people. Far from the doom and gloom of the
Opposition, it is seeing increased applications and full rolls. Over
100 hundred years, the institution has provided a great deal

£100 million of investment over the past 10 years, supported by
successive British Governments and the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:46:53"></hs_TimeCode>. The

investment means that a lot of graduates are not only going on to be
employed in our vital creative industries, but setting up businesses
themselves. Falmouth graduates do not simply get jobs; they make jobs
for themselves and others. Recent investments by the university,
working in partnership with Cornwall council, have led to innovative
projects, such as the academy for innovation and research and the
innovation centre, where graduates and undergraduates work with local
businesses, using their creativity to help grow even more jobs. A
target for 2015 is to support 185 companies, which should create 122

want to demonstrate how important the theatres are to the local
economy. Not long ago, in 2005, the theatres were closed for an
18-month, £14.5 million redevelopment, which saw the merging of
the two venues. I reiterate that it is a fantastic complex. While the
theatres were shut, the local economy of the area suffered, including
the restaurants and even the local council because of the lack of
parking revenues. Everybody suffered because the knock-on effect of the
theatres on the local economy is so large. We must take that into
account when we talk about regional
theatre<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:56:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000804" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000804">From
2006 to 2013, we had a fantastic regional artistic director in Laurie
Sansom. We now have an even better one in James Dacre. To prove how
important regional theatre is, in 2012-13, the Royal and Derngate
presented 767 performances and welcomed 236,000 audience members, which
is up a couple of thousand on the previous year. Of those, 89,000 were
young people, which is up from 50,000 in the previous year. We
delivered activities in schools, from drama and dance workshops to
residencies by the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, which reached 10,000
young people. We work closely with the university of Northampton and
hope to do more with it in the future. We employ 58 full-time staff and
99 part-time staff. We are part of the big society, with 127 volunteers

income of the theatres is £7.6 million, so this is not an
insignificant business. Of that income, 73% is earned
income—something we want to improve—14% comes
from the Arts Council and 11% comes from the local
authorities, which are doing their bit. I want to thank Northampton
borough council and Northamptonshire county council very much. Only 2%
of our income comes from sponsorship, trusts and individual donations,

should not knock them and should always be there to praise them. It has
been said that there are not many decent actors from the midlands.
Well, Alan Carr, who may not be an actor but is a very good comedian,

the Government, arts and culture must never be a fluffy, luxury add-on,
but should be central to our industrial and economic policy and to our
health and well-being policy, as well as being celebrated in their own
right for their unique power to inspire and speak to what makes us
human. They are sectors in which Britain excels. They are our biggest
export after precision engineering and financial services. No other

its

the Labour Government’s years in office, the creative industries
grew at more than twice the rate of our economy as a whole and they
continued to grow through the global financial crisis. They were
central to the industrial strategy that that Government published in
response to the crisis.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:59:29"></hs_TimeCode> we have heard
from many Members, British culture benefits from our unique combination
of a mixed economy of public and private support, respect for artistic
freedom and innovation, and the natural creativity of the British
people. I see such things daily in my constituency where, in spite of
the tough climate, Exeter’s Labour council has sought to
maintain support for the arts because it recognises their vital
contribution to the city’s economy and quality of
life.</hs_Para>

the help of the previous Government, Exeter invested big sums in the
redevelopment of our Victorian municipal museum, and was criticised by
some at the time for doing so. Last year, that museum won the
prestigious national art fund prize for the best museum in the country,
and we have seen a huge increase in visitor numbers and spend as a
result. Just in the past few months, the museum’s new global
reputation helped attract national portrait and wildlife photography
competition works on tour, as well as the wonderful British Museum
touring exhibition, Warriors of the Plains. Exeter sustains a brilliant
edgy theatre scene, an annual theatre festival, galleries, arts cinema,
as well as food and cultural festivals to celebrate the city’s
diversity. All that cultural capital makes Exeter an attractive place
to live and work, provides training, boosts jobs, and helps keep
talented and creative people in the city, rather than losing them to
Bristol or
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:00:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000811" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000811">I
believe the Culture Secretary recognises and understands all of that,
and if the reports that she fought hard to minimise the next onslaught
from the comprehensive spending review are true, I congratulate her on
standing up for her Department. That makes a welcome contrast to her
predecessor, who almost seemed to take pride in the fact that he
offered the Treasury one of the biggest cuts in the last spending
review, and that he was one of the first Cabinet Ministers to settle in
that review.</hs_Para>

three more important battles that she must fight and win? The first is
for the survival of her 
<?notus-xml column=978?>Department—I hear what she said today but I tell her, through the
Minister, that the philistines will come back. The Minister knows the
arguments; we cannot have a Cabinet without a strong voice for arts and

try to abolish his Department, I recommend he suggests that there are
several other Departments it would make more sense to abolish before
the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.</hs_Para>

the Culture Secretary must go to battle with the Education Secretary
because of his apparent desire to destroy cultural and creative
subjects in our education system. We are already seeing evidence of the
impact that his changes to the curriculum and performance measurement
systems in schools are having on arts subjects—a worrying and
dramatic decline. Will the Culture Secretary please tell the Education
Secretary that a student who leaves school at 16 with two arts
qualifications is more likely to get a job by the time they are 19 than
one who leaves with two science qualifications? Britain’s
fantastic creative economy is built on an education system that has
allowed and encouraged creativity and the arts to flourish. If we lose
that, we lose everything else we have talked about in this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:02:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000814" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000814">Finally,
the Culture Secretary must get tough on copyright. We know what needs
doing; we legislated for it collectively in the House three years ago
but the Government have still not implemented those measures. Copyright
theft loses the creative industries billions of pounds a year, and it
if is not tackled it will have a lasting, damaging effect on our
culture and economy. I do not believe that the Secretary of State or
the Minister wish to leave such a legacy behind them.</hs_Para>

Collins</B> (Folkestone and Hythe) (Con):</Member> My direct personal
experience of the creative industries was shaped during the 10 years I
worked in the advertising industry. Anyone who has worked in that
industry is well aware of the famous remark, attributed to Lord
Leverhulme, that he knew that 50% of his advertising was working but
did not know which 50%. Anyone who looks at the arts and creative
industries across the country can see they bring huge economic
benefits, and we have heard a lot about that today.</hs_Para>

the creative industries do not exist just for the economic benefit they
bring but because they have intrinsic worth in their own right. There
is nothing wrong with celebrating art for art’s sake. Art and
creativity allow us to express ideas in a way that adds more meaning
than words can simply allow. We will see that later this year when the
Royal Opera House puts on the Wagner opera “Parsifal”,
dealing with complex issues of sacrifice and hope. At the first
Folkestone triennial arts festival in my constituency, the poignant
sculpture by Tracey Emin, “Baby Things”, dealt with the
difficult issues of teenage pregnancy and single parenthood in coastal
towns around the country. One also thinks of Hogarth’s
masterpiece, “A Rake’s Progress”, which is about
the dangers that can befall someone who spends recklessly, beyond their
means and with no hope of supporting themselves.</hs_Para>

the Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale), the Chairman 
<?notus-xml column=979?>of the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, could agree with much of the
Opposition’s motion was that the motion misses out the key
component of the argument being advanced by Opposition Members. Labour
Members, particularly the shadow Secretary of State, talk principally
about money, insinuating that there should be more money for the arts
and that cuts are damaging the arts, so people following this debate
might be surprised to notice that money is not mentioned at all in the
motion. The nearest we get to it is where it states that the Government
should ensure that the creative industries have access to finance and
funding. No one is saying that funding should be cut, but Labour is not
saying how much funding. Should it be more? Should cuts be reversed?
Should it be extra money? There is no mention of that at all. People
following the debate will wonder, “What are they getting

striking giant ashtray filled with a lifetime’s supply of
cigarette butts generated by a smoker—a large vat of ash and

triennial arts festival, the wonderful new Turner Contemporary gallery

alas the east Kent bid did not make the final four. I can only imagine
that he thought that east Kent was already such a towering beacon of

a good part of the arts and the creative industries is non-subsidised.
In my own town of Lancaster, I can see the cross-cultural relationship

northern average is £4.66, yet the London average is
£21.42. I accept that London has great theatres such as the
National Theatre and the Royal Opera House, but the Arts Council must

spending and investment would be predicated on economic growth and
would have to demonstrate an economic return for the money given. When
we are talking about nations and regions, which the Labour motion
mentions, thank goodness that arts management and cultural
organisations are devolved in Scotland and that we will not be part of

resolved that. We now respect the sacrosanct value of art for
art’s sake, and we have been able to combine that with economic
growth, because we have to. It is essential that we get the terrain

speakers have mentioned this, but here in the UK we have a fantastic
creative sector, whether it is music, film, television or design, but
the success of these creative industries does not exist in a vacuum.
There are important but fragile pillars supporting them, and that comes
down to support for intellectual property and copyright protection. If
we are to continue to grow those sectors, we have to ensure that that
is nurtured. We are the largest producers of content in Europe and the
second largest in the world after the United States. By head of
population, we probably create more content than any other nation in
the world. One would think that practically all our effort as a
Government would be about ensuring that those industries can continue
to grow, but not a bit of it. Sometimes this Government actively work
with other nations that have a contrary interest on these issues. Let

form of “lobbynomics”. When the Government ask for

inventor or creator as the owner of important intellectual property
rights is sometimes barely recognised, while it seems that whatever
rights they wish to assert must be collectivised for the greater good.
The creative industries are often even told that they do not understand

executive member for culture on Test Valley borough council, I spent 10
years championing arts and culture throughout the borough, and I
vividly recall how important they were to its residents. Perhaps we in
Hampshire are lucky to have—in the main—local authorities
with a real commitment to the arts, and a thriving voluntary sector
which ensures that a wide range of activities are available, not
necessarily funded by the public purse, but brought together by the
community. We have the brilliant Test Valley Arts foundation, which has
a community outreach programme encouraging young artists, and in Romsey
we have the Plaza theatre. There is a genuine appreciation of the arts
in every form, and, dare I say, a love of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000852" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000852">I
do not want to portray the Plaza theatre as the domain of luvvies, for
it is not. The Plaza theatre youth group has been one of the
fastest-growing youth groups in the area, and is determined both to
keep up with demand from young people and to put on an exceptionally
high-quality programme of activities. The Plaza has launched an
ambitious Plaza Future campaign, which is raising funds to increase the
capacity of the 230-seat theatre, which already sells 10,000 tickets a
year, to install a new revolving stage, and to bring the facilities of
the 1930s art deco building up to the standards of the 21st century.
The campaign is supported by Sir Ian McKellen and honorary patron Mark
McGann. The Plaza demonstrates how a community theatre, operating with
no subsidy from the local authority, can work successfully and provide
a focal point for the arts in a relatively small
town.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000853" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000853">However,
it is not just one theatre that provides the cultural heart of a
community. In Hampshire, the arts have long been supported by town,
borough and county councils. The Romsey arts festival, which is held
every three years, is a great example of that, as is Rum’s Eg, a
community interest company. Rum’s Eg has set up an arts and
crafts gallery in Romsey, which promotes the crafts of Hampshire
artists and others in the region. It has been supported not just by
local authorities but by Waitrose’s community fund, which has
brought private money into the arts sector. It is a great example of
mixed funding, of which we have heard much this afternoon and which
enables the arts to have a viable future.</hs_Para>

Hampshire is very lucky. Formerly on the county council and now working
with the Minister as national adviser on public libraries is the
wonderful Yinnon Ezra, who is also one of my constituents. Perhaps it
is no surprise that we have such commitment to the arts and culture in
our little part of Hampshire. The pioneering Discovery Centre programme
has brought major changes to the library service, and has served as a
flagship in showing how to attract new audiences to libraries and bring
them up to date. If we are all in this together—and I believe
that we are—we should note some fantastic examples of
community-run libraries in Hampshire, such as the one in North
Baddesley in my constituency.</hs_Para>

is not easy, at local or national Government level, to decide on
priorities and make the difficult choices when it comes to how best to
spend limited resources. I was saddened by the reaction of the main

allocation of £250,000 to restore one of only two remaining
first world war gunboats. HMS M33, a 
<?notus-xml column=986?>Monitor gunboat, is berthed in dry dock in Portsmouth, and, in the
centenary year, provides a real link for today’s generation with
the great war. Surely that is one example of exactly what a cultural

particularly in the great naval city of
Portsmouth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000856" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000856">Culture

appeals to some does not necessarily float the boat of others, but
there is real value in the arts, whatever form they may take. In the
remaining minute available to me, I want to comment on the play, later
film, “War Horse”. In my constituency, it has led to a
fantastic community project involving young people making their own
clay model horses. The War Horse project will hopefully provide a
memorial for the town’s remount depot, which provided 120,000
horses for the great war. It is another example of a community coming
together and using arts and culture to provide a lasting memorial for
the

right track and have made good progress on the creative sector. I
mentioned live music in licensed premises earlier, and how the maximum
attendance figures are being increased from 100 to 200 and
up to 500. That is good; it will support pubs in our communities and
live music in the creative sector. We are on the right track,

I wish to make a couple more remarks about the Glasgow film festival.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:41:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Jim
Sheridan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>) talked
about the contribution of film making to the city of Glasgow. At last
year’s festival, I saw “Cloud Atlas” and it was
interesting to see streets just three or four blocks away from where I
was sitting being represented as 1970s San Francisco. That demonstrates
the ability and technical expertise in the film industry. The Drovers
Inn, on the A84, where I have spent many a Hogmanay, was also in that
film. It was not the greatest of films, but it was interesting to see.
Those things are an indicator of the ability of Glasgow as a city, and
as a city region in the west of Scotland, to drive that interest and
investment in film, and of the greater contribution that film
development makes to the wider economy. A number of people are in the
city centre when some of these films are being made, just to see that
happening. People came in during the early hours of the morning, when
the streets were being shut off and the American taxis were around
George square. It was amazing, and it really caught the interest and
imagination of people.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061976000886" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000886"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:42:13"></hs_TimeCode>The
Glasgow film festival is a regional one and it has applied for lottery
funding, to which the Government amendment refers. I place on the
record that that support is very valued and I know it has been heavily
oversubscribed. I am sure that the announcements are due soon and I
hope that Glasgow will be successful. The film festival brings in very
many people. It brings in not only people from in and around Glasgow,
such as myself, but people from outwith Glasgow, from more widely in
the UK and from overseas. The boost that that brings to the wider
economy in terms of tourism and the hospitality industry is tangible
and recognised, and it has helped to generate some sponsorship to go
alongside the funding that the festival needs. It does need funding to
be able to continue to bring that festival to life each year.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:41:52"></hs_TimeCode> pay huge
tribute to Jaki McDougall, Allison Gardner, Allan Hunter, Seonaid Daly
and all the others who have been involved in the film festival over the
past few years and have built it up to be the fastest-growing film
festival in the whole UK. It certainly does deserve the support of
lottery funding and the British Film Institute because of its
approach.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061976000887" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000887"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>For
those reasons, I wanted to touch on the BFI-commissioned report by
Oxford Economics indicating the very real contribution that film brings
to the wider economy. This debate is about the economic contribution,
and a huge amount comes to the UK through the film industry. We are
talking about: 117,000 jobs; British film’s 15% share of the
worldwide box office; the £1.7 billion in royalties
in 2011 from British films shown overseas; and £2.1 billion in
visitor spend in the UK from film tourism. So the industry has made a
huge contribution, and it has been successful largely because of
policies that developed over time—policies from the previous 
<?notus-xml column=991?>Government that have so far been continued.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:44:23"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr Clarke)
made that point very well. That has happened because of that support,
which must continue. The wider economic and cultural benefits are clear
to see. I want to see many more representations of Glasgow as San
Francisco and actors as zombies, to repeat the clarification that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Jim Sheridan) made
earlier, so that I do not offend any of my constituents. Those benefits
can come about only with sustained and continued support for the film
sector. It is vital. It brings so much culturally and economically, and
many are concerned that in the drive to reduce support for arts, the
film industry will suffer, although it provides a great deal that we
should all be hugely proud

Rotheram</B> (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab):</Member> Thank you, Mr Speaker,
for your indulgence. I had to pop out of the Chamber at the beginning
of the debate for a long-standing parliamentary
engagement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:45:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000889" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000889">Given
the time constraints, I shall make three quick points about why
Liverpool has kept its clear commitment to the cultural sector, despite
the unacceptable budgetary pressures foisted on it by this coalition
Government. First—I speak from the unique perspective of having
been the Lord Mayor of Liverpool during our year as the European
capital of culture—it is evident that the creative industries
and tourism continue to drive economic well-being at a time when the
ability of pubic bodies to spend money on the sector has,
unfortunately, been significantly
reduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:46:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000890" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000890">Secondly,
during 2008 I saw at first hand arts and culture used as a catalyst for
the creation of tangible benefits across the city, which included its
physical transformation, infrastructural improvement and economic
regeneration. In so doing, the creative industries brought about a
civic pride and a renewed collective confidence that engaged people and
inspired them to participate in imaginative activities. I do not mind
admitting that I had never truly appreciated Gustav Klimt, for
instance, until an exhibition of his works at the Tate gallery in
Liverpool opened my eyes. I, like many hundreds of thousands of people,
had their appetites whetted and to this day we are seeing record
numbers of visitors in our museums and galleries across the city. I
think we are the only city in the UK to build a brand-new museum in the
past 80-odd years, with the development of the purpose-built museum of
Liverpool on the world-famous banks of our waterfront. The net result
was that culture in its widest sense helped draw disparate sections and
generations of our community together and provided a focus for
creativity, education and health and
well-being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:47:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000891" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000891">But
the progress that we have made is in severe danger, and this is my
third point. The arts in the regions are under threat and they will
remain in a critical condition until the Government outline a clear
strategic vision of how they intend to support the arts and creative
sector across the whole country. Unfortunately, there remains
uncertainty about whether the arts in the regions will be able to
sustain themselves and in some cases even survive, let alone expand
their visitor offer. This is not simply an arts question that can be
dismissed 
<?notus-xml column=992?>by the Minister and nonchalantly passed over to the Arts Council to deal
with. I agree with arts for all, but this is a fundamental economic
question about the role of individual cities and organisations within
those cites, that both provide jobs and attract inward investment to
places outside the
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061976000892" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0003.htm#13061976000892">We
have seen today that it is only the Labour party that is making the
economic, business, educational and council-led argument for the
sector. The acute danger for Liverpool and the whole of England, which
the Government must begin to address, is that the scenario in which
large swathes of city centres could become devoid of theatres,
galleries and other cultural institutions is becoming ever more real.
The Government must establish and promote a clear vision for the role
of culture and creativity in UK cities and recognise that London is the
world leader in the field—we do not argue with that—and
its ability to generate money through philanthropic contributions is
far greater than cities such as Liverpool.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:54:16"></hs_TimeCode> fact,
philanthropy remains one of the killer ingredients in the funding
cocktail for regional arts organisations. According to the latest arts
and business private investment in culture survey, which was released
last month, more than 90% of all private giving goes to arts
organisations in London. By anyone’s standards, that is
phenomenally disproportionate. It is time for leadership for the
regions, and it is time for the three Ministers, all representing seats
in the south-east, to think again about the regional implications of
their cuts before large parts of the cultural sector in cities such as
Liverpool are lost

Gateshead. I am particularly impressed by how it has used cultural
services to regenerate an area. Instead, I want to focus my remarks on
libraries. Any debate about the arts and creative industries worth its

creative and cultural activity, building economic capacity and helping
to safeguard intellectual property.

address the leadership vacuum that continues to bedevil the public

of the best examples of all those benefits is the Museum of Science and
Industry in Manchester, which was mentioned earlier. The museum, like
others in the Science Museum Group, has been under threat of closure
due to a proposed 10% cut in the group’s funding. The threat has
been countered by a great campaign run by the <I>Manchester Evening
News</I>. As my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>

to discuss is the impact on Greater Manchester’s communities if
we lost the Museum of Science and Industry. Free access to museums,
introduced when Labour was in government, had a dramatic effect on
visitor numbers at the museum. In fact, the annual visitor total grew
from 289,000 in 2000-01 to 833,000 in 2011-12. Visitor numbers could
grow further, because refurbishments will mean that the museum could
support 1 million visitors annually, making it not just an important
regional museum, but a national museum, which is what it is.</hs_Para>

is not just about numbers. As we heard earlier, those of us who visit
museums with young family members—I have visited them with
family members under five—know that they get a great deal out of
a visit, both in fun and in learning. Of over 800,000 people who visit
the museum annually, 100,000 are children, and 22,000 children visit
its workshops. The workshop events and resources are provided up to key
stage 4 in history and science, but there are also science-themed
workshops for the under-fives to enjoy. The museum is a major centre
for the Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics
Network—STEMNET. Some 70% of Greater Manchester’s schools
have benefited from expertise in STEMNET subjects, and that is an
important link for our schools.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:59:07"></hs_TimeCode> museum also

creative industries are complementary to our manufacturing sector. In
many ways, modern British manufacturing has a leading edge because we
emphasise the importance of design and innovation. Jaguar Land Rover is
able to sell its cars around the world because the UK company is
designing beautiful well made and engineered cars. Our publishing
industry both reflects and fuels our country’s strong scientific
research and university base. A vibrant film and TV industry
facilitates engineering and production skills and jobs. The emergence
of 3D printing will unleash creativity on an unprecedented scale,

investment and jobs from coming to these shores, undermines
competitiveness and inhibits innovation. Sadly, we have exactly that
approach from this Government. For example, the manner in which they
are dealing with exceptions to copyright has undermined certainty and
deterred investment in this country. The provisions recently published

exceptions, which fundamentally alters contract law, almost as a casual

Bristol, it is not just the highbrow, publicly funded, mainstream
creative scene that is thriving; the city is also renowned for its
counter-culture scene. Banksy is 
<?notus-xml column=1006?>obviously the most notable example of that. A 2010 PRS for Music survey
showed Bristol as the UK’s most musical city, with more
songwriters per capita originating from the city than from any other
place. Bristol is probably best known for the groundbreaking group of
musicians that emerged in the 1990s and included Massive Attack,
Tricky, Portishead and Roni Size. I have talked to DJ Krust, who was
involved in that scene, about its DIY ethos. Those involved started by
putting on events in empty warehouses and no one turned up. Eventually,
however, they started selling tickets and created an incredibly
innovative scene that influences people to this day. It emerged in a
similar way to the punk scene that sprang from squats in
London and elsewhere in the 1970s.</hs_Para>

That raises interesting questions about how we can ensure that such

funding, assessing outcomes and all the bureaucracy that goes with
that. We need to support it, perhaps simply by not
repressing it. The Minister once confessed to me that he was an ardent

final point is linked to what I was just saying. It is increasingly
difficult for musicians to make a living these days, due to the growth
of piracy and illegal downloading and to the growing prevalence of low
pay and no pay in the creative industries. Recent research by the
Musicians’ Union showed that more than half of professional
musicians worked for less than £20,000 a year and that 60% had
worked for free over the past year. This is not just a problem for
musicians; it is an issue across many creative industries.
Equity’s most recent survey of members found that over 69%
earned either nothing or under £10,000 a year.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:38:30"></hs_TimeCode> need to get a
grip on this situation; otherwise, we could end up with a British music
scene that, although still successful, was dominated by the privately

Hopkins</B> (Luton North) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for the
opportunity to speak briefly. As a former member of the Musicians Union
and a current member of the board of the National Youth Jazz Orchestra,
I will speak primarily for music, musicians and the wonderful music
culture we have in Britain.</hs_Para>

are undoubtedly the leading nation in Europe when it comes to popular
music, jazz and, I would argue, classical
music<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:39:36"></hs_TimeCode>, but that
culture is in danger from cuts. Music is sustained by the Arts Council,
but also by local authorities. The local authority in Luton sustains
the Luton music service, an absolutely wonderful service that provides
opportunities for literally hundreds and possibly thousands of
working-class youngsters who would never have the opportunity to play
or learn an instrument if it was not for the support of the local
authority.</hs_Para>

is a class component in all this, because middle-class youngsters have
their instruments bought for them by their parents and professional
lessons paid for by their parents, but working-class kids need the
support of local authorities. Local authority support for music is
fundamental to sustaining, for the foreseeable future, the wonderful
musical culture of which we are rightly proud. Luton is a prime example
of what we do well. I want that to continue, which means that we must
sustain local authority support and resist cuts to local authority

Jarvis</B> (Barnsley Central) (Lab):</Member> In our country, when we
describe ourselves to others, we often rightly turn to the cultural and
the creative. This debate, just before the comprehensive spending
review, is timely because the arts and the creative industries are
facing great challenges. That matters, because as David Lan, artistic
director of the Young Vic theatre, has

has been a good debate, with a number of fine contributions. I am sure
that all Members will be heartened by the interest in it. Let me begin
by highlighting the brilliant maiden speech by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:41:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck). As the first woman to
represent her constituency, she spoke with great passion. I know she

come.</hs_Para>

have also had some particularly timely contributions from those who
have championed the value of their local cultural institutions. In
particular, we heard some fine speeches about the future of the Science
Museums Group, which was raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:42:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds), for Worsley
and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) and for York Central (Hugh Bayley).
My hon. Friend the Member for York
Central<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T17:36:03"></hs_TimeCode> spoke
about the crossover between science and the arts, perfectly
illustrating the point by talking about the influence that the National
Railway museum had had on his son, who went on to become a railway
engineer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

for Manchester, Withington (Mr Leech) rightly pointed out
that it would be a mistake to go back to the days when national museums
charged for entry.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:42:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe) spoke with passion about
the impact of the National Media museum on Bradford and pointed out the
importance of forging new partnerships to help to reinvigorate the
museum.</hs_Para>

number of contributions were about the positive impact of the arts and
the creative industries on constituencies and regions.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:42:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Swansea West (Geraint Davies), for Paisley and
Renfrewshire North (Jim Sheridan), for Birmingham, Northfield (Richard

(Mike Weatherley), for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton), for Daventry
(Chris Heaton-Harris), for Strangford (Jim Shannon), for Perth and
North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) and for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric

also had some particularly valuable contributions that reflected more
generally on the value of the arts. The Chair of the Select Committee
on Culture, Media and Sport rightly paid tribute to the last Labour
Government’s support of the arts. Obviously I completely agree
with him. He also raised the issue of the flexibility of national
lottery funding, which is something we should definitely consider. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw) and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:43:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt) spoke with great
passion and knowledge about the value that the arts add to our national
life. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:43:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright) rightly reflected on the
importance of cross-Government co-operation to support the creative
industries.</hs_Para>

know that he would not want me to miss him
out—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:43:59"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) rightly raised the
importance of the video games industry and the huge contribution it
makes to the economy. He also rightly raised the important subject of
libraries. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T18:44:13"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) correctly said that
libraries bring us together as a community. Libraries provide a unique
public space for individuals and communities to access services, to
read and to learn, but cuts to local government mean there is rightly
concern about their future.</hs_Para>

reflected in the debate, we believe that the arts are of intrinsic
value to us as a people and as a nation. They help to include those who
feel disfranchised and to inspire those without hope. We have rightly
discussed the importance of the arts in the context of education, and
our young people can expect to undergo several career changes in their
lifetimes, requiring them to possess a flexible skill set. Children who
play in orchestras or sing in choirs learn the value of team work, and
the discipline of rehearsal develops confidence and character. Those
who dance learn the importance of practice, and the ability to
reproduce routines with skill and
precision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306203000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203000056"><Member ContinuationText="Chris Ruane" PimsId="488" UID="1306203001223" xid="515" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203001223"><B>Chris
Ruane</B> (Vale of Clwyd) (Lab):</Member> My hon. Friend has mentioned
the importance of involving children and young people. As he knows, the
Prime Minister takes delight in slagging off Wales at regular

the skills to which I have referred are crucial in a modern world, and
all of them feed into our creative industries. The arts and the
creative industries provide huge economic benefit, as was made clear by
my hon. Friend the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy). The
creative industries are worth more than £36 billion a year, and
employ 1.5 million people in the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

free entry to our museums and galleries has seen the number of visitors
more than double to over 18 million a year, and we earn vital revenue
from overseas tourists who visit us for our acclaimed theatre
companies. Our thriving music industry is the second biggest exporter
of music in the world, and in 2011 the total revenue from the
international sale of UK television programmes was £1.5 billion.
We compete with the best in the world when it comes to animation, video
games, fashion, radio, publishing, architecture, design and
advertising.</hs_Para>

helped to revitalise many of our grey city and town centres. As our
cultural scene has developed, so have the jobs and the social
well-being of the people who live there. That point was made eloquently
by my hon. Friends the Members for Liverpool, Walton (Steve Rotheram)
and for Liverpool, Wavertree (Luciana Berger).</hs_Para>

tough times and tough choices need to be made, but we also need to make
decisions about the kind of society in which we want to live. Labour
has therefore been working on a strategy for jobs and growth in the
creative industries, which focuses on areas in which we believe the
Government should be leveraging effort.</hs_Para>

Government should nurture creative skills in education and develop
talent. By giving young people the opportunities and skills provided by
a creative education, we can ensure that our creative industries have
the widest talent pool available from which to draw. Secondly, the
Government should explore innovative ways of giving the creative
industries access to finance. Thirdly, they should champion
intellectual property. By protecting content creators and the rights of
the consumer, we can provide a sound basis for investment.</hs_Para>

Government need a regional strategy to support the arts and the
creative industries in all regions—not just in London—and
to ensure that opportunities are available in every town and city. What
work is the Minister doing with local authorities to safeguard
investment in the arts locally? May I ask him specifically to repeat
his assurance that none of the Science Museum Group’s museums,
including the National Coal Mining museum for England, in Wakefield,
will close as a result of Government spending cuts?</hs_Para>

speculation recently that in the forthcoming comprehensive spending
review, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport will be abolished
and its constituent parts moved elsewhere. The Secretary of State
stopped short of thanking Opposition Members for our campaign to save

well-known commentator reminded us that the DCMS is a Department in

place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306203000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203000066">We
need a devoted voice in government and at Cabinet for the arts and the
creative industries, and DCMS is the place for that voice. The arts and
creative industries are vital to Britain both socially and
economically, and we need a strong and influential DCMS working closely

am also relieved because, in a meeting the Minister graciously gave my
colleagues and I just a day or two ago, up to a point, he rather shot
my fox. There I was, with my parliamentary colleagues—four
parties are represented in Parliament from the Bradford

a mass campaign of the entire city and district against a proposed act
of cultural vandalism, but the Minister disarmed it in the first line

are grateful to the Minister for that, although he will forgive us if
we want to look the gift horse a little closer in the mouth, because
there are, of course, more ways of closing somewhere than simply
locking its doors. However, we are grateful that the Minister had the
sense to listen to the public, led by the five parliamentarians from
four parties, the city council, and the local newspaper, the
<I>Telegraph and Argus</I>. There was, as I have said, a crescendo of
opposition to the proposed closure, and it is only right to commend a
Minister who listens. I hope I do not spoil his chances in the
forthcoming reshuffle—I wish him well, and am grateful to him up
to this point, when I must part company from
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306203001147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203001147">The
National Media museum is fundamental to Bradford. It is a national
treasure, but it is fundamental to Bradford, a city with a sea of
troubles, with mass unemployment, mass poverty, mass child poverty,
record infant mortality rates, record deaths in hospitals and so on.
Bradford has so many problems that it could not afford another. If the
closure as leaked—I will come to that point in a
minute—had gone ahead, it could have been a death blow to a
great city, which in 1903 was the richest city per capita in England,
but which now, in 2013, does not have its troubles to seek,
particularly in the city centre, where we have a hole in the ground
where Westfield was supposed to be. When I arrived there at least 15
months ago, the iconic Odeon building was crumbling and shrink-wrapped,
looking like it was going to fall down. If the National Media museum
had closed on the back of that desertification of the city centre, it
could have been a death blow, so I am grateful that the Government have
announced that it will not
close.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306203001148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203001148">In
part, it will not close because the public expenditure cuts in this age
of austerity, which the Government are imposing on the country, have
turned out, in the case of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport
at least, not to be as severe as planned. We are told in authoritative
media briefings that 10% has been reduced to 5%, but, as the late and
lamented trade union leader Alan Fisher once said, 5% of bugger all is
bugger all. Five per cent. 
<?notus-xml column=1025?>off our shrunken budget will be a serious blow none the less, so my
first question to the Minister, which I hope he addresses, is this: the
museum will not close, which is wonderful, but what will happen to the
capital programme and capital expenditure on the building? Will the
building be not closed, but allowed to crumble? Will the vital physical
changes in the building not be possible? As my colleagues and I will
advance, and as we advanced in our meeting with the Minister, many
things about the National Media museum need to change. That is the
first
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306203001149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203001149">To
move on to my second question for the Minister, I have doubts as to
whether the National Media museum belongs in the Science Museum Group
at all. Media to me is an art rather than a science. The science of how
film, radio and television get into the living room or the cinema is
interesting, but not as interesting as the content of the film, radio
and television. The National Media museum in Bradford is the repository
of the national BBC archive, but who knows about it, who can access it
and who can see it? The whole notion of the national Science Museum
Group should be brought into question by this

school of socialists: I do not care whether the cat is black or white,
as long as it catches mice. The state must of course be a major
stakeholder in museums, and free admission must be defended at all
costs. The National Media museum has half a million visitors. That is
down from 1 million, but it is not nothing. The overwhelming majority
of those half a million visitors are from Yorkshire and Humberside.
Most of them, very unusually for a museum, are from lower
socio-economic groups. Charging would be a death knell for us and the
state must be there to guarantee that that does not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306203001153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203001153">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>,

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:45:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) said: I was expecting a
potentially difficult meeting with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:45:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman and I knew from his reputation 
<?notus-xml column=1028?>that being savaged by him would not be akin to being savaged by a dead
sheep, but something somewhat worse. I must say, however, that he has
behaved in an entirely constructive fashion on this issue—and
that, of course, goes for all the other hon. Members in the area.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:46:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

is clear that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:46:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bradford West spoke for all his colleagues in the area, but they
also made it clear, in their own interventions, that they believed
passionately in the value of our museums and cared deeply about the
museums that have their homes in the regions they represent. They spoke
eloquently of the relationship between the national museum in Bradford
and the people of that city. They paid tribute to the work of the
museum in educating and engaging and contributing to the economies of
the regions where they are based and in creating a focal point for
inquiry and enjoyment.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:47:19"></hs_TimeCode>I share the
concern expressed in recent weeks that any of these museums—in

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:47:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bradford West called this debate the week after the national museum
celebrated its 30th birthday, and it is worth reminding the House that
the museum holds collections ranging from the earliest surviving
photographic negative to John Logie Baird’s original television
apparatus and the camera used to create the first moving images. In an
intervention, the hon. Member for Bradford South said that he was sad
that BBC Radio had left the museum, but it is also worth noting that
the BBC recently gifted its collections of almost 1,000 historical
objects to the museum as part of the BBC’s 90th anniversary
celebrations. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:48:25"></hs_TimeCode>As
Members have said, the media museum also hosts the Bradford
international film festival, as well as animation and science
festivals, and the BAFTA young designer event, which was streamed live
over the web and marked 100 years of Indian cinema with a
series of events, including appearances by Bollywood stars. These are
good news stories and show the impact that the museum continues to have
on the region, particularly Bradford.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:48:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bradford West said, however, things have to change. I am not sure I
necessarily agreed with his diagnosis. I would not change the
leadership of the Science Museum Group. I have complete confidence in
Ian Blatchford, its director, who took over about one year ago, and let
us not forget that the leadership took over the Museum of Science and
Industry in Manchester, which has seen visitor numbers increase by 30%.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:49:23"></hs_TimeCode> I
recognise, and what we must all recognise, is that attendances have
fallen from a peak of nearly 1 million between 2000 and 2001 to just
under half a million now. Educational visits are also declining while
investment from the Science Museum Group has continued to
rise.</hs_Para>

the hon. Gentleman pointed out, the director of the Science Museum

clear from that 
<?notus-xml column=1029?>meeting that there is huge support for the National Media museum, as
well as the branches of the Science museum in Manchester and York. We
agreed that further study was needed, and that a working group
representing the Science Museum Group, MPs and Bradford city
councillors should come together to look at supporting a sustainable
future for the museum in Bradford. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:50:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bradford East so eloquently put it, this campaign has
shown—we in this House know this, but it is worth
saying—that MPs can be valuable. They can make a difference and
bring constructive and useful ideas to the table. Above all, they can
bring their communities together to look for constructive solutions.
Again, I must emphasise how constructive everyone has been in this
debate on what I think has been an unnecessary cause of concern for
their communities.</hs_Para>

are challenging times. The only silver lining that I can think of from
the past few weeks is that this has brought people together. It is
important that the local council comes to the table and makes an
important contribution to the future of the National Media museum. It
was said at the meeting that the local council has its own strategy to
promote science and technology to young people in Bradford. There,
sitting in the middle of Bradford, is the National Media museum. It is
part of the Science Museum Group, and has an opportunity and a remit to
promote science and technology. I hold my hand up, too. As a Government
who are promoting science and technology, we should recognise the huge
opportunity that the presence of the National Media museum in Bradford
offers us to further our agenda to promote science and technology among
young people.</hs_Para>

have to consider a range of options. In the meeting, the idea of a
five-year plan was discussed, which perhaps echoes the earlier
reference to the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:51:53"></hs_TimeCode>
brand of socialism favoured by the hon. Member for Bradford West. A
five-year plan to turn around the National Media museum would be a
brand of socialism that I would potentially sign up to. I think that is
a point on which we are all agreed. I again echo the words of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:52:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman: it is simply not good enough to have a sticking-plaster
solution that keeps the doors open, saves face and gets people off our
back. We must use this concern to look at all the opportunities that
could present themselves for the National Media museum. For example, in
November it will have an exhibition on the large hadron collider. The
group continues to attract income through corporate activity and is
looking to stage a range of live theatre-style events across all
branches, including in
Bradford<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T19:52:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306203001173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/debtext/130619-0004.htm#1306203001173">It
is important to talk about the spending review. In the last spending
review, the Government protected our national museums so that they
could continue to deliver free access to their important collections.
The cut was limited to 15% in real terms over four years. Indeed, the
grant in aid provided by the Government is conditional on the national
museums providing free admission to their permanent collections. This
has been a spectacularly successful policy. In my closing remarks in
the entertaining debate that we have just had on the importance of the
arts, I made the point that it is important to recognise the previous
Government’s achievements, just as I hope the current Opposition
will recognise this Government’s achievements.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1030?>There has also been speculation that the outcome of the spending review
for 2015-16 will deliver deep cuts to museums. We now know that in the
overall settlement for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport the

in 2015-16. In the context of this spending round, that is a
significant success story. There is absolutely no reason for any of the

Museum Group will certainly stay within the DCMS family as part of the
13 national museums that we fund directly. His intervention gives me
the opportunity to elaborate on a point that I made earlier. The
Science museum is the most formidable organisation in this country for
promoting science and technology in exciting ways to young people, so
we must use it not only as a repository for a science collection that
is unparalleled almost anywhere in the world, but as an opportunity to
excite young people and the wider population and engage them with
science. On the basis of that intervention and others, I will certainly
undertake to sit down with the Science museum. There was a lot of talk
earlier about joined-up government, and I take that point on board. I
will sit down and discuss how my Department and others can work
together to make use of the Science museum’s fantastic
resources.</hs_Para>

the scene by discussing the seminal importance of communication skills
in modern society. We are living in an increasingly complex world,
where more and more information is available to us. Therefore the
ability to communicate effectively is becoming ever more vital in
securing employment and gaining skills. Communication is about having
the ability not just to use language, but to understand and assimilate
information being conveyed to the individual; it is a two-way process.
For many children it is a given that the importance of communication is
understood at an early
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T09:31:28"></hs_TimeCode>, but for a
significant cohort that is not the case, which is where invaluable help

many as 10% of children in the United Kingdom—more than 1
million—have speech, language and communication needs that are
not caused by language neglect or English as an additional language.
That means that, in the average classroom, there are two or three
children with such communication difficulties. Of that group, a large
cohort—some 5% to 7% of the child population—has a
specific language impairment, which means that they have difficulties
acquiring, learning and using language that are not associated with
factors such as cerebral palsy, hearing impairment or autism spectrum
disorders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T09:32:26"></hs_TimeCode>. We

because there is an opportunity to do that through the
Government’s response to the better communication research
programme, set up under the previous Government as a result of the
Bercow review. I pay tribute to Mr Speaker for the work that he has
done in this field. The report published by this Government at the end
of last year, entitled “Better communication research programme:
improving provision for children and young people with speech, language
and communication needs”, led to the creation of a communication
council, which I believe will address the hon. Gentleman’s

council will involve the Department for Education, the Department of
Health and the Communication Trust, which is an organisation comprising
more than 40 bodies in the field of speech, language and communication.
The aim of the council will be to promote best practice, to share the
good work of councils, such as Stoke and Swindon, to work out ways in
which the research that has been obtained can be shared with as many
councils and agencies as possible and to promote a better awareness of
speech, language and communication
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T09:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I should

point, about early years. Often, we are talking about a pre-education
setting and a health setting. I have long advocated the need for a
proper, health-based assessment of speech, language and communication
needs at the age of two, and I am supported by people such as Jean
Gross, the communications champion. The Government are similarly
committed to moving in that direction. With the increase in health
visitor numbers—an extremely welcome initiative, which is
already having an effect in places such as Swindon—and with
extra training for health visitors and other professionals, we can
start to identify a cohort of young people who, at the moment, are not
being identified until early years education or, sometimes, even
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T09:43:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Swindon, we are training staff in early years settings and
children’s centres. We are training our health visitors in the
skill of early identification and in the support strategies that can be
put in place there and then. Despite the fact that Swindon’s
child population is rapidly increasing—our population generally
is increasing, and we expect it to grow from 209,000 last year to
240,000 in the next 15 years—the need for specialist referrals
is staying stable. That is clearly important, 
<?notus-xml column=227?>because we are saving valuable resources by putting in early support to
prevent issues from becoming acute and prevent the need for more
specialist referrals. That is good for the child, good for the family
and good for the provision of local services, at a time when resources
are increasingly tight.</hs_Para>

that context, I am glad to commend my local authority for being
flexible about the use of health and education funding, so that there
is a link speech and language therapist in each mainstream
school—in other words, the artificial division between sources
of funding for health and education has been broken down, there is
proper joint commissioning and people are intermeshed, rather than just
working side by side. For example, speech and language therapists have
been TUPE-ed over to the local authority, and there is a genuine coming
together of services around the child. That must increasingly be the
way forward for local authorities.</hs_Para>

old ground. However, from the point of view of speech and language

have talked about early identification not only at pre-school level,
but at the first opportunity, when the problem is identified. There are
still concerns about how the Bill will ensure that the identification
mechanisms will work across all phases of education. There needs to be
clearer guidance across health, education and social care about how
speech, language and communication needs are identified. Paragraph
11(a) of schedule 1 in the draft regulations in the indicative code of
practice makes it clear that local offers must set out what speech and
language therapy provision is available. That is welcome, but it would
be helpful to have further clarity about how the draft regulations
would ensure that those responsible for the quality and delivery of
services can be held to account. The Minister has indicated that those
are draft regulations and that there will be a full consultation later
in the year, but today is a golden opportunity to highlight some of the
work that needs to be done.</hs_Para>

uniformity, but simply for a common framework within which local

further reassurances 
<?notus-xml column=228?>as to how that will function in practice would be welcome. We must avoid
any compromise over the identification of the need. The imposition of a
duty on health providers, which was the subject of an amendment tabled
by my hon. Friend the Minister, was good news. That clearly reinforces
the existing commitment in the Bill to impose a duty jointly to
commission services. We had a long argument about the phrase
“wholly or mainly”, and my hon. Friend the Minister is
familiar with the issue. Until now, speech, language and communication
needs have been identified as educational needs, and we hope that that

welcome the declaration that communication and interaction are a
primary need, in the draft code of practice, but there are concerns
that the role of schools in SEN provision remains at the edge of the
Bill; there is not a huge amount of detail about what responsibilities
schools will have. That is important, bearing in mind the welcome move
to the creation of academies and free schools, and the unintended
consequence that that may have on long-term provision of speech and
language therapy services locally. There is a tension, is there not,
between the need to employ therapists on a medium or long-term basis
and the short-term spending priorities of schools that must spend to
budgets? Some further clarity about how academies can work
collaboratively to commission services would be extremely helpful. It
would regrettable if, through the welcome and admirable ethos of the
new academy structure, we lost some of the long and medium-term

want briefly to consider low-incidence, high-cost specialist need, and
approaches that can help with communications. One such approach is
augmentative and alternative communication. It is estimated that about
0.5% of the population may need that approach at some point in their
lives: that is about 260,000 children and adults. In addition, it is
estimated that 0.05% of the population need access to regional
specialised augmentative and alternative communication services, and
communication aids. I am talking about the sort of technology that you
may have seen, Mr Dobbin, when meeting speech and language therapists.
It would include iPads, and apps developed to assist with
communication. I have had a go at some of them; they are incredible,
and, frankly, rather fun to use, to begin with. They are a great tool
for young people, who are extremely adept at using the touch technology
that is now available. The technology is evolving all the time, of
course, and the problem for local commissioners is that often they make
expensive decisions that quickly become obsolete. We must address that,

new models and frameworks to deal with the issue of ownership of the

cannot put an undue burden on the children and their families; however,
perhaps with a joint ownership or lease-back approach we could make the
transition to adulthood much easier for those young people. I would

speaking and listening due consideration in secondary education, and
significantly reduce the incentive to teach oral communication in
schools; there will be no chain of accountability for pupils’
performance if that assessment is removed. I believe that that will
lead to further disadvantage for the 10% cohort that we are so

has been a pleasure to open this debate, and I have spoken for a

the Children and Families Bill on inclusion. At the time, I said that,
in general, inclusion is not some sort of buzz word used by the
politically correct; for tens of thousands of young people with
disabilities, their right to access not only mainstream education
services but mainstream social provision, and indeed a whole range of
mainstream services, is vital if we are to value their contribution to
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:01:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061963000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061963000047">I
will give an example of where I believe inclusion works well: a
playgroup for young pre-school children that can incorporate speech and
language therapy within its weekly schedule. What does that mean? It
means convenience, not only for the child but for their family, who do
not have to go to two separate appointments during the week, with all
the concomitant disruption that that causes. That is what inclusion
means, and I very much hope that, when the Bill is considered by the
House of Lords, there will be a return to what I regard as the
important and integral right for children and young people to be part
of the mainstream of our society. That is what this debate is all
about: children and young people attaining speech, language and
communication skills, so that they can be part of the mainstream of our

a consequence of those approaches, I convened a meeting in my

nevertheless I heard many very moving accounts from parents about the
difficulties they face under the current fragmented system, which makes
it unclear to whom they can turn, and presents difficulties in
accessing the help their children need. For those reasons, I welcome
the recognition implicit in the Government’s introduction of the
Bill that the current system for addressing special educational needs
is not fit for purpose and that we need a system that better integrates
the provision of services for parents and, frankly, just stops making
it so difficult for parents to achieve what they

hon. Friend, for reasons I understand, emphasises the economic benefits

difficult, to access the services they need. The transitions through

the specific case of speech and language impairment, what do parents

diagnosed and picked up early. Secondly, the diagnosis having been
made, they want to ensure adequate provision of the therapy and the
particular, specific and, yes, sometimes resource-intensive services
that such children need, without having constantly to petition
different agencies and providers and without the difficulties that they
have experienced. And thirdly, in the event that they do not feel a
service is being provided adequately, they want to make certain that
they have the ability to appeal, that the appeal is clear and that
providers are therefore held to account for the services they are
obliged to
provide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:05:36"></hs_TimeCode>. We

will there be no room for doubt in the new integrated assessment, so

it will be treated as an educational provision that cannot be gamed or

and if for some reason the existing case law that has built up in this
area can be bypassed or ignored, parents will be left in a position of
being told that a particular form of provision has been identified as
necessary but that, because the provision is not held to be an
educational provision, it will not actually be provided and will
instead be passed over to another provider that sidesteps its
obligation. The concern is that the Bill’s aim to ensure that
there is an integrated assessment and that agencies work together,

sidestepped.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061963000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061963000055">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:09:36"></hs_TimeCode>,

speech, language and communication needs and on the support, or lack of

name suggests, the education, health and care plans are a combination
of education, health and social care. The Minister must be commended
for his excellent work in that regard, to get the involvement of the
Department of Health and that collaboration and cross-departmental
working that in the past has been lacking, leading to confusion about
whether AAC sits under Education or Health. I am sure that the Minister
will respond to that point when he winds up. Under the new plans, I
hope that things will become clearer, if only in the sense that the

make it more difficult for parents to access the support that their

language and communication needs are highly prevalent: more than 30% of
those on school action plus schemes have been identified as having
speech, language and communication needs, and around a quarter have

needs achieve their expected progress in English; as we heard from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:15:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South Swindon, even fewer—35%—do so in maths by the
end of their school life. Even by age 19, little more than half those
young people have achieved level 2 qualifications, which means a C or
above at GCSE. Obviously, fewer still go on to get A-levels: just one
in five young people with speech, language and communication needs has
achieved a level 3 qualification by the age  of
19<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:15:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061963000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061963000066">Shockingly,
those statistics suggest that speech, language and communication needs
hold back children and young people more than other special educational
needs and disabilities that we might otherwise think have a bigger
impact on educational outcomes. The proportion of children achieving
level 3 qualifications is lower for those with speech, language and
communication needs than for those with hearing or visual impairment,
multi-sensory impairment, physical disability, autistic spectrum
disorders and specific learning
difficulties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:16:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Such statistics clearly indicate that we have a real problem with
how  we provide support for such children and young people. It

failure—all those young people being excluded and ending up in

cost to the public purse, through lost productivity and taxes from
children not reaching their potential, and the cost of welfare or of
keeping the young person in youth justice or in the prison system, if
it comes to that. Therefore, early intervention and getting the right
support in place as soon as possible are important not only to the
individual child or young person, but to the whole of society. That is
why I pushed the Minister so hard, as did everyone who spoke on these
matters during Committee consideration of the Bill, on the provisions
that will be in place under the new system, and particularly on the
role that early years settings and early years area special educational
needs co-ordinators working across those settings will be expected to
play.</hs_Para>

resisted my calls for local authorities to have a duty to co-operate
with private, voluntary and independent child care providers with
regard to children in their settings whom they believe to have special
educational needs, saying that he believed it would place a burden on
those providers. However, as I have heard from such providers, the
problem is that they are often completely ignored by local authorities
when they try to refer a child for an assessment or some other form of
help. That is the problem that I was trying to solve with an amendment.
I hope that our noble colleagues can address it in more detail in the
other

would also like early years area SENCOs to be given a statutory role to
ensure that PVI child care settings are given the support that they
need to identify and adequately cater for such children. As we
discussed in Committee, the draft code of practice includes a heading
on that role, which I welcome, although there is no content yet. I am
sure that the Minister and his officials are working on that now, so I
would be grateful if he could tell us what progress has been made on
developing that guidance since our discussion in
March.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061963000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061963000074">Obviously,
the vast majority of children and young people with identified SLCNs do
not qualify for a statement at present, and will not qualify for an
education, health and care plan when the new system is rolled out. At
present, their teachers and parents have school action and school
action plus as a graduated response to meeting their needs, which will
become a single SEN category under the new code of practice. We are
still not sure exactly how that will look in practice, but the Minister
assures us that the 1.4 million children on school action and school
action plus will continue to be supported, and we must take him at his

though, the level of support that children receive will owe much to the
quality of the local offer in their area, which is why I have sought at
every stage of the Children and Families Bill to strengthen the wording
of the legislation on that issue. In particular, the Minister and I,
along with the hon. Member for South
Swindon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:22:01"></hs_TimeCode>, have
had many debates about what standards we should expect from local

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:22:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart). The success of this raft of

teacher training is crucial in making every school a good school for

language and communication needs;
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:22:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South Swindon mentioned that as well. Every teacher is a teacher of
children with speech, language and communication needs, but not every
teacher knows how to be. Fewer than half of newly qualified teachers
surveyed by Ofsted had good skills and knowledge of language
development, and about one third did not have sufficient training to
enable them to plan how to give such children extra help in the

that the Department for Education should be leading on that issue by
requiring improvements to teacher training and continuing professional
development so that every teacher has the skills needed to teach the
class in front of them rather than just the subject. The Department is
going in the opposite direction, saying that people do not need a
teaching qualification to teach, or even to head a school in some
instances. Labour Members restated our opposition to that idea this
week.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Washington and Sunderland West raised the importance of
the local offer in trying to drive improvements on the ground. The
local offer will set out in one place information about all the
services that the local authority expects to be available in the local
area and beyond for local children and young people with special
educational needs and their parents. We have been clear in the
indicative regulations that it must cover support for all children and
young people with SEN, not just those with education, health and care
plans. That could include provision from small specialist services
providing outreach support to schools, such as those offering support
to children using alternative and augmentative communication, as well
as the provision normally available in mainstream settings and on offer

offer will also let parents know how to access services, what support
is available to enable them to do so and what to do if they are unhappy
with the support on offer. My approach is to make that engagement as
clear and simple as possible for parents to access, so that they do not
have to navigate through what I have described in the past as a
labyrinthine array of different organisations and processes. We must

offer in each area will be the transparency of information and the
involvement of local parents, children and young people in developing
and reviewing it. That will help to ensure that it is responsive to
local needs. Arguments have been made for stipulating minimum standards

clear expectations for schools on the processes for identifying and
assessing pupils, setting objectives for them, reviewing progress and
securing further support. That will not change the legislative duties
on schools to use their best endeavours to secure special educational

key change to the Bill, which several hon. Members have mentioned today

those responsible for commissioning health provision to secure the
health care provision in education, health and care plans. That
significant change has been acknowledged and widely welcomed. The new
duty builds on the joint commissioning duty in the Bill which requires
local authorities and clinical commissioning groups, as well as NHS
England when appropriate for national commissioning, to assess the
needs of the local population of children and young people with SEN,
and to plan and commission services to meet those needs. Joint
commissioning arrangements must include those for securing education,
health and care needs assessments, and the education, health and care
provision specified in education, health and care plans. The new health
duty requires health commissioners to ensure that the health care
elements of those plans are provided for each individual. That provides

health care providers, it is in fact special educational provision. The
clause also enables appeals to the tribunal in respect of health
provision when it is defined as special educational provision, as now.

he look again at the Bromley case that I referred to on Report?
Although I accept that it was in the context of the old system of
statements of special educational need, there, we had a very clear
exposition from Lord Justice Stephen Sedley, as he then was, of what is
necessary for the purposes of provision. As for my wording, I agree
that just removing “wholly or mainly” may not be the
right approach, but we all need to strive together to get the wording
absolutely right, so that we avoid the nice legal arguments that the

which reminds us lawyers that sometimes we need to look beyond the
boundaries of a legal document and reflect more on what it seeks to
achieve, as a way of ensuring that it does what we intend it to. I will
look carefully at the Bromley case that he mentioned, not only in
context, but as a demonstration of where we need to think through the
implications of the clause as drafted to ensure that some of those
eventualities do not still pertain in the new environment and in the
reformed system that we all want to see work. I am happy to do that,

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T10:42:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Washington and Sunderland West that young offenders, including
those with special educational needs, need to receive the right support
and access to education, both when in custody and when they return to
their communities. Clause 69 is necessary because it prevents our

custody should be delivered in future. I have ensured that the
education element for children, including those with SEN, in the care
system and elsewhere, is being properly considered as part of the
review. That provides an important opportunity to be absolutely clear
about what role the time that a young person spends in custody plays,
both as a form of punishment and in rehabilitation, so that when they
come out of custody, they have every prospect of moving on in a
positive direction. We have done that elsewhere in the prison estate.

touched on—the Ofqual consultation proposal not to assess
formally speaking and listening skills at GCSE. Clearly, pupils need
speaking skills for their future progression, and employers value good
communication skills and want them to be taught. The subject content of
the new English language GCSE will strengthen the requirement to teach
pupils how to become more confident in using spoken language in formal
settings. The key point is how speaking skills are taught. Often, we

consulted organisations representing students with special educational
needs as part of the equality analysis that we published in March.
Overall, we believe that the benefit to all students will be positive.
Students will follow more robust and challenging GCSE courses that will
have real value for their future progression to further education and
employment. Those with special educational needs can, through the
Equality Act 2010, be supported in their exams through reasonable
adjustments, such as extra time or supervised rest breaks. Ofqual, as

great distinction and honour and who keep the residents of Dorset safe.
Dorset police force is one of the best in the country; I have met many

is now the lowest centrally funded police force out of the 43 in
England and Wales. While some forces receive three quarters of their
grant from central Government, Dorset receives less than half. The rest
of the burden is placed on the local tax payer, and that inequity is
repeated year after year and will worsen when a further £1.9
million is lost in so-called formula damping.</hs_Para>

2013-14 grant settlement has seen Dorset receive less funding than the
formula calculates as appropriate. Had the formula been followed, we
would have had an additional £16 million to spend this year
alone, which equates to nearly 850 more police officers on the beat at
today’s starting salary of £19,000 a year. The reality is
that, through cuts, we have lost an astonishing 340 officers
since 2007, which is 23% of our total officer strength. By 2018,
anticipated further cuts suggest that we will lose 468 warranted police
officers, which is 31% of our
numbers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T11:01:44"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
equivalent to losing every single officer in Weymouth, Portland,
Dorchester, Bridport, Lyme Regis, Sherborne, Blandford, Shaftesbury,
Gillingham, Sturminster Newton and Beaminster—it sounds a bit
like a train journey I have been on a few times. On the urban side of
our county, cutting 468 officers would mean losing every officer in

Dorset has lost the highest number of police officers and staff in the
country. Back-office functions are already pared to the bone; that was
done by the previous chief constable who did a wonderful job in meeting
Government expectations and targets. None the less, Dorset police are
expected to do more with less. To their great credit, they have one of
the highest levels of public confidence in the country, but they will
not be able to sustain that because they face unique policing

split between a large conurbation on one side and a scattering of rural
communities on the other, the “two Dorsets” demand very
different styles of policing. Rural policing involves greater distances

seaside towns, particularly when summer numbers peak due to tourism,
demands a significant police presence. That is an area of great concern
as stretched resources have to be targeted at weekend trouble spots,
leaving the rest of the county with minimal cover. Resources are
stretched even further to cope with the 14 million visitors who come to
Dorset each year. Added to that, we have thriving sea ports and a busy
international airport. None of those factors is recognised in the

concern about the independence of the police when sponsors’
names are emblazoned on every police vehicle, station and letterhead.
Admittedly, the rules are strict: sponsorship must not amount to more
than 1% of a force’s total income; none of the statutory
functions of the force should depend on the sponsorship; and sponsors

the potential for conflict of interest, or at least a perception of

police officers look so young these days, the answer will be, because
they use Camay! I inject a note of humour, Mr Dobbin, but I think it
makes the point rather well. Policing is a serious matter, and this
sponsorship business does not bode well. If the police lose their
independence through sponsorship deals, can privatisation be far away?

my hon. Friend on securing this debate and I endorse his
congratulations on what all our public services achieve with such
scarce resources. It is commendable, and I agree that when an
organisation is already cut to the bone, it is very serious to have to
tackle further cuts. What is most important to my constituents, who are
in the next-door constituency, is their safer neighbourhood teams. If
there were any further threats to those teams, we would be in danger of
losing public confidence. They have been built up with our scarce

process up considerably and report back before 2015. Need I remind him
that there is no guarantee that he and I will be serving in government
in 2015, or even be MPs? Policing is a serious matter, and the
resources must be there to do the job effectively. Crime may well be
down in Dorset, but that should not be an excuse to keep cutting. The
previous chief constable told me repeatedly that every time Dorset
police did well, more resources were taken away. I am afraid that I do
not understand the logic that if someone is doing well they should lose
the resources with which they can keep up the extremely high standard

own bobby living in the community. Costly though that may be in the
short term, catching a potential offender in their childhood would save
countless millions of pounds in the longer

would like to dwell a bit on that point, and speak from my previous
experience as a soldier patrolling the streets of Northern Ireland. The
way in which we dominated the ground, gathered intelligence, fought
against the IRA and protected the good people of Belfast and the other
places in which I served, was by presence, by showing a face,
patrolling the streets, being there for people to talk to, and being
there to reassure, listen and pick up intelligence. The modern world
relies more and more on technology, but the CCTV cameras, precious
though they are, cannot possibly pick up on a patrol on the ground, on
the atmosphere, the feedback, the communication and the observation, on
the shop that is a bit different this morning from what it was last
night because there is a gunman inside with a weapon to the
shopkeeper’s head. CCTV cameras will not pick that up; police
officers on foot will. When they come back, a huge amount of
intelligence can be obtained by asking, “What did you see during
that two-hour patrol?” When our soldiers came back everything
was logged, pictures were taken and checks were done, and all the
intelligence went up the line, meaning we were better informed and
could do a far better and more effective job on that
mission.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061963000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061963000144">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T11:14:41"></hs_TimeCode>
am glad to say that policing does not carry the threat of being blown
up, although police officers in this country tragically lose their
lives in the line of duty. In Dorset, however, we are most fortunate
not to have had such an incident, as far as I can recall, for many
years, if at all, and long may that be the case. Nevertheless, the
threat is there. I urge the Minister carefully to consider the funding
formula, and to give a fairer deal to the people of Dorset, who must be
treated more equitably. We are not asking for more money. We understand
the restrictions that the Minister, the Government and the country
face—the austerity we all face. We have heard about that again
and again. What the people of Dorset are asking for is a much fairer
share of the

creative and stimulating ideas about more efficient ways of providing
blue light services across the board. As he is aware, we are looking at
them carefully, but it is a long-term process. For example, many people
have asked whether PCCs could merge the fire and police services in
their area, but there is currently no legal power for them to do so, so
that will not happen tomorrow. As he knows, the Home Secretary and

me turn specifically to Dorset. As has been said, the overall funding
settlement for the police is challenging, but Dorset police and the
vast majority of forces are demonstrating that it is manageable. The
latest report from Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary
makes it clear that forces are making the necessary savings, while
front-line delivery to the public is largely being maintained.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T11:23:16"></hs_TimeCode> has been
said, recorded crime in Dorset was 13% lower in the year to December
2012. Overall crime is down more than 10% since this Government came to
power, and in the last set of figures the downward trend was replicated
across every police force in England and
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061963000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061963000161">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T11:23:30"></hs_TimeCode>
appreciate that funding reductions have meant all forces having to
consider where savings must be made in officer and staff numbers. In
Dorset, the number of officers was reduced by 6% in the year to
September 2012. Ultimately, decisions on the work force’s size
and composition, which are important, are for individual chiefs and
PCCs. However, I emphasise that, across forces, the proportion of
officers on the front line is increasing. That, together with continued
improvements 
<?notus-xml column=252?>in victim satisfaction levels, shows that the police are rising to the
challenge of maintaining and improving services to the public while

mine—I am just thinking on my feet—but perhaps he is
looking at a shorter period. The figure of 30% has stuck in my mind,
and that would be even bigger if the planned cuts, whereby we would
lose nearly 500 officers, are implemented by 2018. We are now at the
point where the force is doing a good job, and there are officers on
the front line—no one is left in back offices; they have gone
now—but we do not have any more to put on the front line. The

can help forces to discharge their duties and ensure that officers are

protection we give the public. Core functions, such as patrolling and
leading investigations, will always be done by sworn warranted
officers. The police will remain accountable to the people, and any
decisions to engage the private sector will be taken by elected PCCs,
which gives local people a say. I am afraid that I do not share his
view that it is anathema: if PCCs think that that is a good way to get
more resources on to the front line effectively, we should look at
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061963000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061963000170">The

pleasure, Mr Owen, to serve under your chairmanship. I am grateful for
this welcome opportunity to discuss this important matter in this
timely debate. Last week, the all-party parliamentary group on
migration launched its report on the impact of the income requirement
for those sponsoring a partner or spouse from outside the European
economic area, and the new rules on adult dependants, almost a year
after the new family migration rules were introduced. The media
coverage of the rules and the numerous e-mails and phone calls received
in my office over the past week suggest that there is great public
interest in the matter, which makes this debate even more
important.</hs_Para>

evidence to the APPG inquiry. Submissions were received from more than

of the main concerns is that the income
requirement—£18,600 to sponsor a non-EEA spouse or
partner, more if there are also children—is high for many
British people and permanent residents of the UK. According to the
accounts we received, the income requirement has affected some British
people who appear to have more than adequate means to support
themselves and family members. Some people seeking to sponsor a non-EEA
spouse or partner told us that they were not receiving any benefits and
were living well within their means, but that the application process
did not allow them to reflect their self-sufficiency.</hs_Para>

Sharma:</Member></B> It is clear that jobs and the income from those
jobs are not relevant when families are forced to live apart. The
income requirement would exclude almost half the UK working population
from living with their husbands or wives if they were from outside the
EEA. That seems unfair. Should they have to move overseas? We heard
from a number of families whose child care commitments prevented them
from relocating overseas, or who had other caring duties in the
UK—for example, for elderly parents—that meant that the
family had compelling reasons to wish to settle in the UK.</hs_Para>

addition, we heard from a number of hard-working, tax-paying British
citizens who were determined that being effectively forced out of their
own country should not be the only way in which they could live with
their spouse and children. I think most of us would have the same
reaction, were we in that
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:37:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061971000016">Another
issue close to those affected by the family migration rules is the
manner in which the income requirement can be met. The limited list of
permitted income sources has delayed and prevented even those families
with clear means, or access to means, from entering the UK since last
July. In the case of families who have been living overseas and wish to
return to the UK, if the couple wish to meet the income requirement
from the employment-related income source, the UK sponsor must show
prior earnings of that amount, which may well be difficult for those
who have been working in lower-income countries. The prior earnings or
prospective income in the UK of the non-EEA partner is not taken into
consideration at any point, regardless of whether he or she is the main
earner in the family. Even if the non-EEA partner has strong chances of
employment in the UK, or has a firm job offer here, it will still not
count towards the application. One submission to the inquiry raised the
case of a family based in Dubai; the non-EEA national was earning
£250,000 per annum, which could not be counted in any way
towards meeting the income
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:38:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061971000017">We

prior earnings and prospective income in the UK of the non-EEA partner
are not taken into consideration at any time, regardless of whether he
or she is the main earner in the family. The cash savings source
requires sponsors and applicants to take up to £62,500 out of
investments in stock and shares, and to place it in a bank account,
which is difficult for people whose assets cannot be liquidated. Again,
does that not exclude a substantial number of hard-working families
from being united in this country, because the income requirement is
not a proper reflection of the resources that will be available to
those families once they are together in the UK?

Lazarowicz</B> (Edinburgh North and Leith) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am
glad that my hon. Friend made that point, because the issue of elderly
relatives is another one that many of us have come across in our
constituencies; of 
<?notus-xml column=257?>course, I also agree with what he has said about spouses. Under the new
rules, it is almost impossible for a relative over the age of 65 to be
admitted to the UK, because their sponsor may not have the
income—may not meet the cash requirements—to allow them
to come to the UK; if the sponsor does meet the requirement, they will
be expected to support their relative in the foreign country, thereby
keeping away grandparents and parents who will not cause a major impact
on the UK population. It is a very cruel and inhumane thing to do.

Government should
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:44:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

because it highlights the fact that we generally expect families to be
united, with grandchildren living with their grandparents, so that
heritage can be passed on. That applies not only to people from outside
the EU, but to people everywhere—wherever we feel that families
need to come together. However, these rules are keeping families apart
and forcing them to remain apart.</hs_Para>

of us on that inquiry were really horrified by what we found, despite
my own experience as a constituency MP and having encountered the
frustrations of an awful lot of my constituents as they tried to deal
with the new rules. Of course, as the hon. Member for Ealing, Southall
said, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:45:55"></hs_TimeCode> new
rules have been in place for a year now and there is no doubt that they
are proving a significant source of frustration and tension for family
life without providing any obvious and immediate benefit to the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:46:08"></hs_TimeCode>. When the
Minister responds to the debate, I will be very interested to see if he
can tell us what benefits he considers the new rules have brought to
the UK, because they are not immediately obvious to me; I can see many
of the harms but I cannot see many obvious benefits.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061971000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061971000032"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:46:32"></hs_TimeCode>The
first thing that is very apparent about the new rules is that they
represent a distinct philosophical shift in approach from the old
rules. The system used to be 
<?notus-xml column=258?>tilted in favour of family life, subject to certain basic conditions
being met, such as the ability to support a spouse coming into the UK
and the ability to meet a basic income threshold, which was pretty much
tantamount to a basic income threshold that we would expect around
income support levels. Now, the system is tilted entirely in the
opposite direction, and against family life, unless someone can meet
certain requirements to demonstrate that their spouse who is coming
into the UK is desirable in some way and meets some extra criteria. So
rather than having a system that was very much about keeping families
together, the system now is about serving an overall objective on
immigration policy, with family life being significantly relegated in
importance. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:47:23"></hs_TimeCode>Of
course, it is not only family life that is being relegated in
importance, but relationships, children’s best interests, basic
human compassion and a certain level of common
sense<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:47:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061971000033">The
consequence is that we have created a system that is highly inflexible
and incredibly rigid, and that fails by its own narrow criteria in
terms of preventing a burden falling on the taxpayer. What do I mean by
that? The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:47:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Ealing, Southall raised many of these issues, as did a
number of the Members who intervened on him. One of my own reflections
from having been on the all-party group’s inquiry was,
“If you’re self-employed, woe betide you. You might be
earning a fortune, but it’s incredibly difficult for you to
demonstrate that you meet the Government’s criteria.”
Money must be in certain very specific bank accounts; it must be
accessible in a very specific way. Parents’ wealth is
disregarded, so someone may have a very wealthy family who are more
than willing to support them but that is not taken into
account.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:48:23"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:48:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman said, someone may have wealth tied up in other ways; for
example, it might be tied up in capital. Once again, however, that is
not adequate under the new rules. It is only someone’s earned
income in the UK that is taken into account, so even if someone has
been earning a small fortune abroad that is not taken into account.
Equally, even if someone’s spouse earns a small fortune, if they
come to the UK that is not taken into account either, and nor are their
projected future earnings. Even by the incredibly narrow criteria of
wanting income to be the most important factor and wanting people to
demonstrate a level of wealth that the Government have decided is
desirable, the system at the moment fails to deliver.</hs_Para>

is not to mention the hidden costs, which were highlighted by hon.
Members in a number of interventions—the costs that are incurred
by refusing someone permission to come to the UK. The obvious ones that
we heard about during our inquiry were around caring burdens,
particularly if the person who is here in the UK has some health
problems, or if they have very young children and they have been
separated from their partner. They might be able to go back to work if
their partner was here in the UK to share child care. Without the
partner, however, it is much more
difficult.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:49:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:47:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:47:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:45:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:45:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:42:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:42:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:40:18"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:40:13"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

the United Nations convention on the rights of the child and to take
into account children’s best interests when decisions are made.
What account is being taken of that now by the Minister’s
Department, as it looks at the rules and their impact? Has any
assessment been done and has any discussion been had with Department
for Education officials on this point? If he is unable to answer that
question today, I should be grateful if he wrote to let me

impact of the rules on bringing in grandparents and elderly dependants
is just as shocking as that of the spousal rules. Almost no approvals
have happened since the new rules came in. It was described to me by
one lawyer as a ban masquerading as a rule, which is probably a rather
more effective way of describing the problem. If almost nobody can come
in, that demonstrates what the Government want to do, and it might have
been more honest if that had been done in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:57:35"></hs_TimeCode>.

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:57:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ealing, Southall and made a similar point. It is almost impossible
to meet the rules. People must have a high income and must be clear
that their family member will not have recourse to any kind of
benefits, and sign something to say that that will not happen. They
must also demonstrate that the family member is so sick that they must
come here, and cannot possibly have their care needs met in the country
where they are, even if they were to pay for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:58:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061971000056">Almost
nobody will meet those criteria. One lawyer said that he had been
thinking through all the possible scenarios and the only example that
he came up with where somebody might meet such criteria was if they had
an elderly dependent relative in Monaco and had enough money here to
meet the first part of the rules, but because care is so expensive in
Monaco they would not be able to afford to pay for it there. That would
probably be the only way we would allow such people to come to the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:58:42"></hs_TimeCode>. If we are
going to have a ban, let us at least be more honest about
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T14:58:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0001.htm#13061971000057">The
consequences of the rules were drawn to our attention in the inquiry
most notably by the British Medical Association, which said that they
were among the biggest challenges in planning resourcing around
consultants and senior doctors, many of whom are second-generation
south Asian and want to bring a relative. For example, two people who
are partners, both of whom may be highly paid consultants capable of
supporting an elderly dependent relative but with no means of meeting
the rules, might end up moving to Singapore. If such highly trained,
highly valued people go somewhere else to work so that they are able to
be with their family members, that is a significant drain on our
national health service.</hs_Para>

current system seems to me to be inhumane and lacking in basic common
sense. It cuts across a whole set of areas that the Government say are
a priority: it cuts across our commitments on family policy, on early
intervention and on our obligations under the UNCRC. We heard in our
inquiry that the rules disproportionately affect those from poorer
communities in the UK, such as Bangladeshis and Pakistanis, and that
women, who struggle to earn the same wages as men, are particularly 
<?notus-xml column=262?>affected. The system affects not only those people but many highly paid
British citizens who may never have thought that they would meet the
full force of the immigration system preventing them from having a
happy family life. I strongly urge the Minister to review those rules
properly and to reconsider
them.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_19_PT_1/3339D5337FD91FB3646A1C986A9E596CF0A8706C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="19 June 2013">Wednesday

points but where there might be grounds for compassion?”

as I discovered this morning—even I did not know about this,
which just goes to show how quickly such things happen—the
Government have increased the probation period from two years to five
years. People cannot get indefinite leave to remain if they are on
benefits, so it is not a question of people arriving and going on
benefits, because doing so means they cannot get to the next stage on
the way to citizenship. Abuse is better dealt with through face-to-face
interviews, such as those the Minister saw when he went to
Sheffield—he saw people who are coming here as students being
interviewed. If we do that for spouses, we can address abuse much
better than putting in an arbitrary financial limit. The purpose, of
course, is to limit the number of people coming here.</hs_Para>

last point is about rights of appeal for people who are visiting, which
the coalition Government are about to take away. If they do that, they

extremely important because it means that a judge, rather than the Home

of absolute fairness in the system.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:19:41"></hs_TimeCode> put it to the

that things are not fair. We have some fantastic entry clearance
directors, such as Janice Moore in Mumbai and Mandy Iveny in Pakistan,

go to solve a problem. I ask the Minister to look again at the issues

described. These people have gone overseas and fallen in love, or they
have met someone who has come to this country as  a student or
to work for a time. They have formed a relationship and married, but
they now have a problem—one that they and their families never
thought they would encounter. They assumed it would be relatively

not.</hs_Para>

help the Minister appreciate how we, as constituency MPs, are being
affected, I want, without mentioning names, to highlight some of the
cases that have been brought to me in recent weeks. One constituent
grew up in my area and has been living in Canada. She is now in a
permanent relationship with someone in Canada. They both have skills
and want to bring them to this country, but they cannot come here
together. Given the industry in which they work, and given the wages in
places such as north Cornwall, there is no way they can come here and
meet the threshold. They would be able to live without recourse to
benefits because they would have access to housing and so on, but they
cannot meet the threshold. Effectively, someone who wants to return to
Cornwall will be unable to do so, and she will have to stay in Canada.
That is very painful for her family, who would like the couple to come
here. There are no children involved, but it is just as painful for the
extended family that the couple have, effectively, had this ban imposed
on them.</hs_Para>

another case, a woman who was born in the Caribbean married a British
man. She had children here, and she has been here for more than 20
years. Unfortunately, the marriage came to an end. A number of years
later, she got back in touch with someone from her home country. They
formed a relationship, and they have married, which is a source of
great happiness to them and her family, because she has children and a
grandchild in this country. However, if the couple are to live
together, she will have to leave her children and her grandchild,
taking away the support that she could offer them as a grandparent, and
return with her new husband to the country in which they grew up. She
has a business and the means to provide the foundation for a life
together in this country if he joined her. Indeed, he is a skilled
tradesman, and there are opportunities here. He has been able to come
over, and they have spent some time together, but the system is now
saying that he has to leave.</hs_Para>

another case, a young woman born in the constituency married an
American citizen. They have a child here, and they have a life
together, but he will have to return to the United States. He gave up
the job, the base and the support he had there to start a new life
here, but it is 
<?notus-xml column=267?>not possible for him to stay.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:18:34"></hs_TimeCode>I could go on
with this list of painful cases, which are affecting people who want to
make a real contribution here as the new spouse or partner of a British
citizen. These cases also affect those who are keen to welcome that new
person into their family and to make sure they are part of the
community. That is a real shame.</hs_Para>

of the big strengths of places such as Leicester is their diversity and
the fact that people are from all sorts of backgrounds. Although I grew
up in Cornwall, I spent my first six or seven years after leaving
university in the town of Bedford, which is a very diverse place. It
was a great experience and education to be part of a community such as
that. Cornwall has many strengths. Those who have come from overseas to
live there have often done so because they have married someone from
the area, and that has added to diversity and enriched the local
community. However, we will lose that because, given the wage set-up in
Cornwall, there will, effectively, be a ban on people doing that in
future. That is a great tragedy; it is not only a personal tragedy for
the families, but an issue for society as a whole.</hs_Para>

said I would be brief. I just wanted to give a perspective from an area
outside the cities with their more noticeable patterns of migration,
and mention that the policy is becoming an issue for us too. I hope
that in considering what to do about immigration policy the Government
will examine such cases and come up with a system that allows families
to stay together and contribute to British

me, as for other hon. Members taking part in the debate, this is a
constituency issue. Many of the constituents who have talked to me
about the rules’ effect on them and their families are
particularly upset, because they have been preparing for family
weddings, or have planned for a long time to bring a relative back to
care for them. They feel strongly that the rules cut across their
strong attachment to the importance of family ties and family life. We
recognise, as other hon. Members have said, the need to manage
migration and protect the public purse, but the rules must be fair to
families, and effective. We have heard of many instances where they
were neither.</hs_Para>

recognise that the income threshold, at £18,600, is at the
lowest end of the range suggested by the Migration Advisory Committee

Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan
Beith)—and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:22:02"></hs_TimeCode>
other hon. Members have said, the threshold will have a differential
impact on different sponsors, and it will create a significant
disadvantage for those who, by definition, are likely to be on low
earnings. That includes women sponsors, 
<?notus-xml column=268?>who typically will be on incomes lower than men’s. They often
work part time; also, taking time out of the labour market to care for
family members may have depressed their ability to progress at work.
Young people will also be disadvantaged. Let us not forget that many
who want to bring in a spouse will be young, because they will be
starting out on their adult and family life.</hs_Para>

who would want to make such an application are often precisely those
whom the rules will most effectively work against. Others who will be
disadvantaged are those who struggle to earn well—people with
low levels of qualifications, people with disabilities and those
outside high-pay areas such as London and the south-east. Last week in
my constituency, I was told of a young woman who has been forced to
take three jobs to try to meet the income requirement and bring in her
spouse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000093">It
is important to understand that we are not talking just about poorly
paid, poor-quality, low or entry-level jobs. The inquiry committee
heard evidence from the Royal College of Nursing that health care
workers can typically earn between £14,153 and £17,253,
so they would be below the income threshold of £18,600. Pay
levels in many other sectors, such as retail, security, administration
and customer service, and in the public sector, are likely to mean
people will not meet the threshold. That
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:24:09"></hs_TimeCode> unfair to UK
sponsors, many of whom have lived here all their lives—people
who are British-born, of British families—who cannot fulfil the
income requirement. Those people make a valuable contribution to the
economy and provide services that we all depend on. They are being
told, in effect, that they cannot carry on living in their own country
with their spouse. They are shocked and surprised to find that

to the impact of the rules on the public purse, the picture is more
complicated than the Government’s analysis and impact assessment
may suggest. The Government suggested in their assessment that there
would be savings to the overall welfare state—health, benefits,
education and so on—of £660 million over 10 years.
However, we must remember that most migrant partners would work and pay
taxes. They would therefore be contributing to the public purse.
Evidence presented to the committee by researchers at Middlesex
university suggests that by preventing up to 17,800 migrant partners
from coming to the UK and working here, the income requirement could
lead to a cost to the UK Exchequer and economy of as much as
£850 million in lost economic
activity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:25:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000095">The
Government impact assessment took account of tax forgone by reducing
the number of migrant partners entering the country, but failed to
consider the loss of the wider economic benefits of partner earnings:
lost output, lower consumption and spending in the economy, and the

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:26:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brent Central alluded to the fact that in some cases parents are
forced to rely on benefits because they cannot share the responsibility
for care of children with the other parent. Also, not being able to
bring a spouse into the country to share the balance of parenting and
working will affect the ability of the parent who is already here to
enter the labour market or increase their working hours. We know
sharing those roles is a feature of lifting families out of poverty;
those two sets of earnings are important in keeping families off
out-of-work

a large part of the Government’s assessment of the benefits that
would be affected has to do with benefits for children—child
benefit and child tax credit. They are paid for children who are
British citizens. In some cases they will continue for those children,
but in a family in which only one parent is here to support the child;
so the overall benefits impact is rather more complicated than the

male workers are more likely to be in work than non-migrant people of
working age. The history of migrants, and particularly male migrants,
arriving in this country is that they want and intend to work, and
contribute to our Exchequer and the wider economy. Women migrants may
be less likely to work than non-migrant adult women, but their earnings
tend to be a little higher; so, again, the labour market picture is
more complicated than the simple notion that may have been
assumed—that a spouse coming to this country will simply be

the hon. Member for Brent Central said, we need to recognise some of
the more indirect costs that we are piling up for society. I absolutely
agree with her about the potential long-term impact on the public purse
of separating children from their parents for long periods. We know
that separation can have long-standing and detrimental effects on
children’s health, including their mental health, and on their
educational attainment and behaviour, all of which will increase costs
to the public purse down the line. The Office of the Children’s
Commissioner for England has made a strong case for children’s
right to have their best interests taken into account as one of the
factors considered by the Government, but it is important to recognise
that not only a moral and legal but an economic case can be made in
relation to children. The Government should also consider the long-term
economic impact.</hs_Para>

under our equalities legislation, and in terms of protecting the public
purse, it seems that they may in fact be having a perverse effect. For
those reasons, the committee strongly urges the Government to take the
time to conduct a full review of the impact of the new rules on

have two points to make. The first is broadly in support of what the
Government are trying to do. There is growing consensus across the
House that net migration levels in recent years have been too high and
need to be reduced. My view is that that should be done in a way that
prioritises the forms of migration that are most economically
beneficial to the country. The family migration route needs to be
looked at. I say to Opposition Members, with apologies for not having
heard all their speeches, that it is not enough just to will the aims;
we must also consider the means of achieving any reduction.</hs_Para>

sympathy with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:32:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) on one specific point: the
income threshold at which the rules kick in. There is a perfectly
defensible intellectual logic to what the Government have selected:
essentially, the income level at which people no longer need recourse
to public funds. However, I have raised the issue privately with the
Minister; an individual working full time on the minimum wage would be
below the threshold set. The test set by the Prime Minister was that
people should be doing their best. Preventing someone who has taken a
full-time job that only commands the minimum wage from bringing a
partner with whom they have fallen in love into the country seems to me
to fail the test of fairness.</hs_Para>

to marriage. They went on honeymoon to Canada completely unaware of the

father or a mother for the first three or four years of their life, and

Catch-22 now arises for many people: if they are the carer of a child

the pay gap between men and women, many fewer

Bryant:</Member></B> If my right hon. Friend did not intervene, I would
have more time to lay out what our plans are. I was about to say that
he said the figure was arbitrary, but it is not arbitrary; it is
deliberate. The Migration Advisory Committee advised on a range between
£18,600 and £25,700—I suppose we should be
grateful that the figure is not £25,700—and laid out
that, according to its interpretation, at the lower bound of the range,
45% of applicants would not meet the income threshold. In other words,
it is deliberate that 45% of people are caught by the limit. It is,
therefore, important for us to look at the full impact of the
policy—to look not only at the short-term implications, because
I understand that it helps the Government to meet their net migration
target, but at the full implications in the long run for the public
purse and family
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000134">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:47:20"></hs_TimeCode>
undoubtedly have to examine some of the existing anomalies. Many who
have written to me made the point, “It is fine if you can come
in as a European economic area national; you don’t have to prove
anything”, but that seems grossly unfair to someone coming in
from outside the EEA. We need to look at such anomalies. We also need
to look at what flexibility can be brought into the system. As many
Members have said, a non-EEA partner’s earnings cannot be
considered at the moment, even though they may be considerable.
Ministers sometimes reply that people will be able to come in through a
different route—a work route—but that does not apply to
many, unless they have a specific job offer and so on. The way in which
cash savings are estimated and the earnings of those who are
self-employed similarly need to be looked at, as does whether
third-party support can be brought into the equation, as it has been in
several other
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:48:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000135">I
have already referred to the matter of the parliamentary process. I
want us to engage in a proper process, so that Members can go through

effect on the NHS, not only of people coming to this country, but of
losing people who are working in the NHS—they might be worried
about their elderly dependent relatives elsewhere in the world and
decide to leave this country to go there. That issue is already
affecting recruitment in south Wales and other
places<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>. Also,
categorically, we will seek 
<?notus-xml column=275?>to repeal the Government’s recent abolition of the right of

go much further afield for their holidays than they ever have done

hon. Friend the Member for Croydon Central (Gavin Barwell) touched on

have three aims. The first is to tackle abuse. The hon. Member for

That

applications based on sham marriages. That not only deals with abuse,

interacts with the immigration system. The £18,600 figure is not
arbitrary—I agree that the Migration Advisory Committee did some
serious evidence-based work. It is broadly the figure at which a couple
are no longer able to have income-related benefits. If the argument is
that that figure is high and that many people in this country will not
earn that much, we must remember that they may have a level of income

turn to some matters that will address the point made by the right hon.
Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Dame Joan Ruddock). There are some areas
where we have been flexible already. I had a meeting with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:56:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Members
for Slough (Fiona Mactaggart) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>for Bristol East
(Kerry McCarthy), who were here earlier. We looked at some
flexibilities, which I agreed to take away and consider. They were
about the length of time for which savings must be held if they arise
from the realisation of an asset that can be clearly traced to that
family. The example that was given to me was someone selling a property
that was clearly their property. I also said I would consider the
situation where people hold savings in an investment-based account,
such as a stocks and shares ISA, and whether that counts as
cash.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000156">I
am prepared to consider whether we can put in place some rules that are
not vulnerable to abuse. The best argument was the example of a couple,
one of whom would be working here but was insufficiently skilled to
meet the criteria to apply under the tier 2 scheme. I thought one of
the examples in the report was a bit odd. I struggled to see how
someone who earned £400,000 a year and had £3.5 million
of assets could not come here on a tier 2 visa, or would be unable to
organise their finances sufficiently to meet the rules. If people can
get here under a tier 2 visa, that is fine. However, clearly there are
people who could make a contribution but could not meet those
criteria.</hs_Para>

is not quite as straightforward as people say, because we must guard
against abuse. If all people have to do is to show a piece of paper
saying that they have a job offer, I know from the number of cases I
have seen that it will not be long before people are setting up vague
companies and offering jobs that do not exist. There must be a way of
putting in place processes that do not lead to abuse. I think that is
worth doing and I am prepared to go away and do so. The Chairman of the
Home Affairs Committee said that I listen, and I do. I see details of
cases that colleagues write to me about, and I am keen to ensure that
the rules are fair. They have been in force for less than a year, and
we have already made some changes to make them more

the United Kingdom. I do not know, but I am guessing that most Members

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T15:59:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brent Central (Sarah Teather) asked whether there had been any
discussion with the Department for Education on children’s best
interests. Yes, there has been. Our family consultation and the
statement of intent that we published were discussed with all relevant
Departments in the way that one secures agreement across Government.
Our rules and policy on leave outside the rules take into account a
child’s best interests. I will give an example. In exceptional
cases, those circumstances can be taken into account. Since I have been
doing this job, I have authorised the grant of leave outside the rules
to an applicant who, with their British partner, was unable to meet the
income threshold but had serious concerns about the health and welfare
of a
child.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-19?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_19_PT_1/A59998195CA22A1BADB7962AB753C595BB49C456" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="19 June 2013">Wednesday

the outset, it must be clarified that private operators do not have the

come clean about whether we can tidy this matter up. These pieces of
land were given a zero rateable value when the companies were given
planning permission, or whatever permission it was, and now an income
is being made from that land. The Government need to look closely at
whether the Valuation Office Agency should try to revalue pieces of
land where car parking charges are being applied, on the grounds that
as there is now an income from it, the rateable value should be
reviewed. I hope that the Government look at that, and I want to put

have found instances of that in Northern Ireland, but the rating of
particular properties or pieces of wasteland now used for car parking
purposes in Northern Ireland is a devolved matter. In this debate, I
want to concentrate on the issues that are particularly the reserve of
the Minister and the Department. However, I take my hon.
Friend’s point. There is a certain over-zealous attitude on the
part of many of the players, but the bottom line is that the ordinary

placed at great disadvantage—particularly a financial
one—some months down the line.</hs_Para>

would like to give some brief examples of the way in which certain
companies go to every length to put a significant amount of pressure on
people to settle up as quickly as possible, without querying the nature
of what they may perceive as an inescapable fine. Often the
correspondence, especially the initial notification letter to the
customer, will be designed to look like an official statutory notice of
the kind issued by a council or a local authority. For example, they
will commonly refer to “parking charge notices”,
otherwise known as PCNs, mimicking the “penalty charge
notice” title of official council tickets, and that will often
be accompanied by an official-looking logo, such as the scales of
justice. Such notices are clearly designed to make the person feel that
this is something they have to pay, and that its source is a body other
than a private company, thus making the person—it could happen
to any single one of us—deeply uncomfortable.</hs_Para>

addition, companies will present the possibility of the Debt Recovery
Agency becoming involved as early as the first correspondence with the
customer. Such a threat is clearly vastly out of proportion for what
amount to relatively small civil claims. Again, the purpose of that is
clearly to get the person to pay up as soon as 
<?notus-xml column=281?>possible and not to question the source, reasonableness or accuracy of
the claim. People are made to feel under pressure
and that they have no right to recourse.</hs_Para>

are reprehensible, especially in that many of those being pursued are
elderly or vulnerable, and they have even been employed in my

considered the manner in which some claims are pursued, we need also to

that certain companies are pressing claims that are spurious at best.
Previous court guidance has said that charges must be proportionate and
that an owner is entitled to seek only damages relating to actual loss.
For a start, the existence of tiered levels of payment depending on how
quickly fines are paid suggests that any real evaluation of loss is not
being used. The charges also seem excessive against any determination
of an actual loss incurred. The fact that some companies are charging
up to £150, which is more than 50% higher than, in our case, the
Roads Service’s fine, or a council fine, indicates that it is
not actual<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:10:57"></hs_TimeCode> loss

Instead, people often receive notification that they are being charged
up to a month later, with very inconsistent evidence as to what their

the very uncertain regulations that cover this area, consumers caught

principle of vehicle keeper information being provided to private
companies for such purposes. Unpopular though receipt of a parking
charge may be, measures to control parking on private land are
necessary to ensure that parking facilities remain accessible and
provide value to all who use them. Drivers who choose to park their

considerable scrutiny over recent years, and the activities and

Despite perceptions to the contrary, I assure the hon. Lady that
significant control is already applied to the operation of private car
parking companies. Unscrupulous operators can no longer put a sign up
in a car park that sets outrageous charges and harass motorists for
payment. Rogue operators might once have been able to request vehicle
keeper details, but that is no longer the case. Unlike in the past,
control is now exercised over the charges that can be imposed, the

2005, when the previous Government were in power, the issues raised by
motorists aggrieved by private parking enforcement have been carefully
scrutinised. As a result of the first review, the systems for accessing
vehicle keeper data were totally changed and formal safeguards were
introduced. The review led to the introduction of a requirement for
companies that receive keeper data via electronic links to be members
of an accredited trade association. The conditions have been
strengthened by making ATA membership a requirement for all car parking
companies as a prerequisite for access to data. Since 2009, all private
car parking companies that want to request vehicle keeper information
for private car parking management have been required to be ATA
members, regardless of whether they make such requests via electronic
or paper channels. That requirement has delivered a regulatory regime
for the parking industry where none previously existed.</hs_Para>

have a code of practice based on fair treatment of the motorist, which
requires its members to operate to high professional standards of
conduct while allowing them to take reasonable action to follow up
alleged parking contraventions. We would expect any organisation that
wanted to become an ATA to be able to demonstrate that it has a code of
practice that ensures that only a fair parking charge is asked for and
that prominent signage is present, which outlines clearly the
restrictions on parking and the charges and conditions that apply.
There should be no hidden charges or ambiguity for the motorist as to
what is and what is not permitted on the land. The code also helps to
ensure that contact with motorists is not threatening and that parking
charge notices are issued promptly so that a driver can recall the
circumstances surrounding the event. A reasonable amount of time must
be allowed for payment to be made before any additional charges are
imposed or the matter is escalated. That is the case in Northern
Ireland and in the rest of the United Kingdom</hs_Para>

strong requirements are in place to regulate the actions of parking
companies, disclosure of data is also tightly controlled. Even when a
company can demonstrate full compliance with the code of practice, the
DVLA and its Northern Ireland equivalent, the Driver and Vehicle
Agency, operate to the same standards and must be assured that there is
good reason to believe that a parking contravention is likely to have
occurred and that the company is acting with integrity when requesting
data.</hs_Para>

management companies are visited to audit their operations and further
in-depth checking of individual cases is undertaken to make sure that
requests have been submitted for genuine reasons and with reliable

is inevitable that motorists who feel that they have been unfairly
treated will complain. The first port of call is usually the ATA, and I
have mentioned that an operator needs to demonstrate compliance with
the code of practice in order to retain its membership. The ATA is
there to investigate and ensure that, where appropriate, remedial
action is taken. It is for the ATA to decide whether the operator needs
to be placed on notice with additional scrutiny, follow-up audits and
checks to monitor future actions closely. In more serious cases, a
decision may be taken to terminate an operator’s membership of
the ATA, without which they cannot operate. That consequence is serious
for a company’s survival and it is an incentive for them to
behave responsibly.</hs_Para>

that supply data to operators also play a key role. Where sufficiently
serious concerns are raised or ongoing issues are identified, agencies
will consider whether continued access to vehicle keeper data is
appropriate. Several parking management companies have had their
ability to request vehicle keeper data suspended where shortfalls in
the standards expected have been identified. In addition, trading
standards departments can prosecute companies if they have breached
consumer protection law. In short, if a company is not meeting the
standards expected, there are serious consequences.</hs_Para>

regulation for the parking sector. I do not have enough time to deal
with the hon. Lady’s other points, so I will ensure that my
ministerial colleague, my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon, writes

the details of any cases experienced by her constituents and others

the Minister to ensure that UKTI does more to encourage British
companies to go to Libya, which is a hugely important market for us. We
have spent nearly £1 billion helping the Libyans to throw off
the shackles of dictatorship, and we must not fall behind our German,
Italian and French counterparts, who are banging the drum for their

am frustrated that the UKTI does not engage more with parliamentarians.
I have been the chairman of the all-party group on Libya for the past
eight years. I have led many delegations to Libya, and I have an
extensive network of contacts throughout the country. Before the
revolution, I even wrote a biography of Colonel Gaddafi. Yet I have not
had a single exchange with UKTI about anything to do with that country

prime ministerial trade envoys is a very good step that I want to be
expanded. There are also catalysts—they are hired by UKTI as
such—who have expert knowledge of a country. I want to mention
one to the Minister: Mr Ali Mosawi, who came to see me, has been
selected as an Iraqi catalyst. He has expert knowledge of the country,
being from one of the best-known Iraqi families and having a network of
offices throughout the country. He is an official UKTI catalyst, but he
came to see me because he is getting very little traction with UKTI,
which is not using his services at all. He has even offered UKTI free
use of his extensive network of offices throughout Iraq, but nobody has
responded to his very generous offer. I want the Minister to
investigate that and I want his officials to ensure that Mr Mosawi is

inward investment to the United Kingdom, I want to know—I will
ask a series of parliamentary questions to find out—where UKTI
staff are based and what areas they cover. I think that the UK is still
No. 1 for inward investment in the European Union, although Germany is
rapidly catching us up. It seems to me that the vast bulk of inward

London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000234">With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:45:58"></hs_TimeCode>

We have huge opportunities in Shropshire, with both the council

that inward investment to the United Kingdom is spread more evenly and
that professional staff in UKTI cover more rural constituencies. For
the record, I will not rest from badgering UKTI until at least one of
its members of staff is responsible for and dedicated to working with
my local companies and authorities to attract inward investment into

Prime Minister has set a target of £1 trillion of exports by
2020, which is a hugely important issue. We spend so much time in this
House debating between Labour, Liberal Democrats and ourselves and
having huge arguments about how to cut up the cake. I respect that, but
we must come together as three political parties—with those from
Ulster—to talk about and work collectively on how to increase
exports. That should not be a party political issue; we should come
together and work together to ensure that SMEs, which are the lifeblood

Green over breakfast at 8 o’clock this morning, with other
parliamentarians, and he told me that the £1 trillion target

the Chair, Mr Owen. I thank
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:48:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham (Daniel Kawczynski) for giving me
the opportunity to explain in more detail the breadth and depth of
support provided by UK Trade &amp; Investment for UK SMEs in the middle
east and north Africa. Let me reassure him that there is a very good
story to tell<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:48:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
This is a large and growing marketplace, in which there are tremendous
opportunities. We export more to the United Arab Emirates than we do to
India, more to Saudi Arabia than to Brazil and more to Qatar than to
Mexico. Equally, there are challenges, particularly in markets such as
those in Iraq and Libya that he mentioned, where the business
environment is clearly more
challenging.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000238">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:48:56"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend will be familiar with some of the services that UKTI
provides. A typical example is support for trade missions, of which 20,
involving 150 SMEs, have visited Saudi Arabia alone since mid-2012.
Indeed, independent research undertaken on UKTI’s behalf
demonstrates that, for the year to September 2012, the organisation
delivered 4,500 services to businesses across the region. Some 60% of
businesses surveyed reported that those services generated significant
business benefit, including an average additional profit of
£84,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000239">In
addition to supporting companies in-market, UKTI brings its specialists
from the region back to the UK to speak directly to SME exporters. For
example, earlier this month, in partnership with private sector
sponsors and other partners, UKTI organised a UK tour for specialists
from the UAE, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. My hon. Friend will be
interested to know that they met more than 200 companies in four
cities—Glasgow, 
<?notus-xml column=292?>Manchester, Bristol and London. Those events were organised in
association with UKTI’s extensive domestic regional network,
which is dedicated to supporting exporters across our country. I do
want to reassure my hon. Friend, because he asked this specific
question, that there are UKTI staff in every region, if not in every
council area.</hs_Para>

work of UKTI officials to support SMEs is increasingly enhanced by the
activity of the Prime Minister’s trade envoys and our British
business ambassadors. As senior business leaders, they are well known
internationally, and they consistently generate significant interest in
overseas markets. For example, one of our business ambassadors, Malcolm
Brinded, recently led a trade mission to Jordan, significantly helping
the companies concerned to position themselves to secure a share of
Jordanian
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:51:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000241">I
should also highlight that SMEs in the region will benefit from another
UKTI initiative—its high value opportunity campaigns. Those
campaigns cover 100 of the world’s largest commercial projects,
19 of which are in the middle east and north Africa. Each will open up
for our SMEs huge supply chain opportunities in projects as diverse as
Qatar’s World cup stadium infrastructure, Dubai’s airport
expansion and huge oil and gas projects in Iraq and Saudi Arabia. We
want success in those major overseas projects to mirror the positive
benefits of investment in our national infrastructure by Gulf sovereign
wealth funds. Indeed, we are tendering for the provision of private
sector support in the Gulf to help to grow that
opportunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000242">Looking
forward, my hon. Friend will want to know that my colleague, Lord
Green, and UKTI’s chief executive officer, Nick Baird, intend to
build on the excellent services already provided to make the
organisation more attuned to what its competitors offer, in line with
their desire to bring more private sector expertise to bear in support
of exporters. One of the key differences between us and our major
competitors, especially Germany, is the range of business-to-business
services available in overseas markets from organisations such as
chambers of commerce. That is a difference that we need to address.
Lord Green and Nick Baird also want to see a much stronger connection
between domestic and overseas business
networks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:52:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:52:56"></hs_TimeCode> strong case
has been made, and British chambers and other British business groups
offer a potential means to extend such services to UK SMEs. However, in
most cases, that will require a substantial upgrading of those business
groups’ own capacity to offer the requisite level of service,
which is why the Prime Minister announced last year a transformational
change to the support that business can offer to business.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13061971000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000243">UKTI<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>
has now launched a pilot campaign in 20 markets that will
radically enhance the support to UK SMEs over the next three to five
years. The pilot focuses on high growth and emerging markets and
includes Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Our aim is that by 2017 the
support available to UK SMEs from Government and business groups will
have significantly increased in range, quantity, impact and quality in
at least the first 20 markets. It is then planned to roll
out the programme to include all markets and connect our overseas
business-to-business support to UK business networks, so that we have
one global British business network that is operating on a par with our
competitors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:54:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

UKTI’s broader official business offering needs to adapt to the
actual needs of business rather than to what we think they need. UK
Export Finance understands that and continues to provide invaluable
support to UK companies, many of which are SMEs, during turbulent times
in the region. It was one of the first export credit agencies to resume
cover for Libya, and even at the height of the Arab spring uprisings,
UK Export Finance took a long-term view of the risks involved and
remained on cover for the majority of
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000245">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:54:49"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that my words demonstrate to my hon. Friend that UKTI intends to
continue to build on its success in supporting SMEs in the middle east
and north Africa, while at the same time developing new programmes of
assistance. We want, for example, to be able to help more companies
such as Apton Partitioning Limited of the west midlands, which designs,
manufactures and distributes office partitioning systems for commercial
offices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000246">The
Apton story shows how a British business, dependent on the UK
construction industry, lost 50% of its business in 2008, but emerged,
with the help of UKTI, to be an international business operating in
countries with major construction growth across the world. It is now
exporting to Qatar, the UAE, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia and
Kuwait<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:55:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000247">My
hon. Friend raised a number of specific points, which I will touch on
if I may and write to him if I miss. He announced the publication of
his report. We all look forward to reading that when it appears in the
next few weeks. He asked about scrutiny of UKTI. I think today has been
about scrutiny, but I take his point that there have not been
sufficient debates on that important issue. It is of course open to the
Select Committees to take up the work of
UKTI<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:56:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000248">My
hon. Friend asked me specifically about Libya. We were one of the first
to open an office again in Libya. Some 250 British firms have been to
Libya since  
<?notus-xml column=294?>the end of the conflict, but I wholly accept that we need to do more
than that. He mentioned Mr Mosawi in relation to Iraq, and I will
certainly follow that up and reply to it. I repeat the reassurance that
there are UKTI staff in every region of our
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-19T16:56:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13061971000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/halltext/130619h0002.htm#13061971000249">I
hope that my hon. Friend will be reassured that UKTI takes seriously
any scrutiny and comments on its activities. I hope he has had
engagement with senior UKTI staff in response to any concerns that he
has had. The fact that some companies occasionally feel that they are
not getting the service they expect is, in my experience, the exception
rather than the rule. Across the globe, countries that have used UKTI
sing its praises. There may of course be exceptions to that, and if
there are we need to learn why that is and to build on it. Nick Baird
has made improving all levels of customer satisfaction one of the top
priorities for him and his top management team. They are challenging
the organisation and are seeing a response. Current indications are
that, over the last calendar year, UKTI hit its target of 32,000
businesses assisted, up from just 25,000 the previous year. This year,
UKTI aims to help 40,000 companies. Its target for 2015 is 50,000

hope that hon. Members will be reassured to hear that, of the tens of
thousands of businesses that were helped and supported by UKTI in the
year to September 2012, 90% of which were SMEs, more than 75% were
either satisfied or very satisfied, and those companies say that UKTI
has helped them generate additional sales of £49 billion. I hope
that my hon. Friend and others will agree that that is an impressive
performance. It is not a performance that we are complacent about, but
one to which we should none the less pay

Jeremy Browne:</Member></B> The latest data from the Office for
National Statistics (Focus on: Violent Crime and Sexual Offences,

and abuse. For example, only 5% of respondents who reported being
victims of domestic violence and abuse in the self-completion module of
the Crime Survey for England and Wales (CSEW) had reported that they
were victims of domestic violence and abuse in face-to-face interviews
in the same survey, reflecting the sensitivity and complexity of this
topic. The under-reporting of crime to the police is known to be
particularly acute for intimate
violence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306206000611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/text/130619w0001.htm#1306206000611">We

of these checks will depend on the materiality of the grant, but if the
applicant were publicly known to be engaged in criminal activity, such
as evading the National Minimum Wage requirements, then we would

determining eligibility. It is also not usually a reasonable grant
requirement to require a recipient to divulge its full payroll or tax

Javid:</Member></B> Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) is
building on its strategic approach to tackle tax credit error and fraud
by improving the way it identifies claimants who have failed to notify
changes. It includes using real time information on earnings to tackle
income risks and, as part of the autumn statement, to introduce checks
on child care claims and confirmation that a child is still in
qualifying training or education. Work is also under way to explore
whether the private sector can help HMRC to increase the number of
checks it makes on tax credit claims. From April 2013, HMRC also
introduced sanctions which stop payments of working tax credits where
claimants have been
fraudulent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1306206001675" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130619/text/130619w0002.htm#1306206001675">The

Green:</Member></B> The partial defence of diminished
responsibility was reformed in the Coroners and Justice Act 2009 to
accommodate more modern ideas of psychiatry and abnormality of mental
functioning which reduces the capacity to understand situations and
control actions. The revised defence is based on the concept of a
‘recognised medical condition’. The Law Commission, who
recommended the reforms, and the then Government conducted extensive
public consultation to inform these changes to the law, which were then
subject to the full scrutiny of Parliament. There are no plans to
review the law in this area.</hs_Para>

Alcohol-related admissions</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The number
of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by
the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48
indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of
a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to
alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable
to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found
at:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The
application of the NWPHO methodology has recently been updated and is
now available directly from HES. As such, information about episodes
estimated to be alcohol related may be slightly different from
previously published data.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>2</Sup>
Socio-economic group</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The socio-economic
group used is derived from the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). IMD
is a measure of multiple deprivation which ranks the relative
deprivation of each area of England in a number domains (such as crime
and income) and then combines the individual scores to produce a
composite score for each area. The patient's residential postcode is
then mapped to one of these areas, and summarised into 10 groups for
presentation.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The version of IMD used
is appropriate to the years published, 2009-10 data use IMD the 2007
version, while later years use the 2010 version. For further details
see:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>www.gov.uk/government/publications/english-indices-of-deprivation-2010</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>for
further details.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>3</Sup> Assessing
growth through time</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>HES figures are
available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need
to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and
coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of
independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes In
NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due
to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient
settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES
data.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>4</Sup> Provisional
data</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>The data are provisional and may
be incomplete or contain errors for which no adjustments have yet been
made. Counts produced from provisional data are likely to be lower than
those generated for the same period in the final dataset. This
shortfall will be most pronounced in the final month of the latest
period, i.e. November from the (month 9) April to November extract. It
is also probable that clinical data are not complete, which may in
particular affect the last two months of any given period. There may
also be errors due to coding inconsistencies that have not yet been
investigated and
corrected.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><I>Source</I>:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>Hospital

in Mali comes to an end and a UN Peacekeeping Operation prepares to
deploy, a political settlement between north and south is needed to
ensure long-term stability. Progress has been slow but steady. Burkina
Faso, the lead mediators for the Economic Community of West African
States, with the support of the international community, is currently
brokering negotiations between the Malian transitional authorities and
representatives of non-terrorist armed groups (including the National
Movement for the Liberation of Azawad—MNLA). The UK position has
been clear throughout: the impasse over the MNLA's continued control of
the northern city of Kidal must be solved through dialogue. We are
hopeful that an inclusive political settlement, which recognises the
territorial integrity of Mali, will soon be reached. This will
represent a major step towards a sustainable peace agreement, which
will enable national presidential elections to be held on 28 July, and
provide the start to a long-term solution to the challenges facing
Mali. Another important factor will be the work of the newly-created
