between social and health authorities and, of course, the disastrous

badly bungled by the Labour party. I am pleased to be able to tell the

over the past three years is making sure that resources help children
in the early years, when they make the biggest difference. That is why
we are the first Government to deliver 15 hours of pre-school support
to all three and four-year-olds; the first Government ever, as of this
September, to deliver 15 hours of child care and pre-school support to
two-year-old toddlers from the lowest-income families; and the first
Government ever to introduce a pupil premium worth £2.5 billion
of additional support to children from the lowest-income families. That

opt-out for trade union members and of donations from the trade union
movement, which is now pretty well single-handedly bankrolling the
Labour party, has of course come up in the cross-party talks on party
funding, which unfortunately have proved somewhat elusive. One of the
measures that we want to bring forward —it does not
apply to trade unions alone—relates to the way in which a number
of campaign groups, be they trade unions, animal welfare groups,
tactical voting groups, rural campaign groups, religious groups or
individuals, spend money to determine the outcome of campaigns in
particular constituencies. At the last election, those major groups and
individuals spent £3 million—a full 10% of what the major
parties spent. We want to make sure that this increasingly important
type of campaigning is fully transparent and is not allowed to distort
the political process. That is what proposals that we will come forward

that smaller fraud, which falls outside the SFO’s remit
entirely, has long been a Cinderella area for law enforcement. The
economic crime command was set up in the National Crime Agency
precisely to try to ensure that smaller fraud is dealt with better at a
regional policing level and in order to put in place structures to
enable that to happen more effectively. It is a subject of legitimate
anxiety across the House that fraud problems faced by constituents
often cannot be dealt with adequately. The SFO is involved with the
economic crime command and sits on the economic crime co-ordination
board, so it can provide its professional
input.</hs_Para><hs_6bDepartment UID="13060468000008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0001.htm#13060468000008"><DepartmentName xid="58">Deputy

broadly correct. Specifically, the requirement of the Standing Order is
not that the request has to be made by the Prime Minister, but that it
does have to be made by one of Her Majesty’s Ministers. In so
far as the hon. Gentleman is highlighting this point as evidence of his
belief that the Standing Order is unsatisfactory and a constraint on
Parliament, I note very much what he says. It is what it is, and it
will be up to Members, if they judge it necessary, to deploy their
collective wits to try to ensure an opportunity for Parliament to
debate and vote, if that is what they seek. I hope that that is

<?notus-xml column=1388?>In doing so, I emphasise, as I have done before, that my

It is based on a unanimous recommendation made last July in the report

a variety of reasons, however, the need for the amendment is even
greater now than when my Committee’s report was published.
First, despite some positive signs on the Government’s support
for low-carbon electricity generation, the publication of the gas
strategy on the very day of the autumn statement confused many
investors. The possibility that the Government might sanction
37 GW of new gas-fired generation capacity rests uneasily
with their acceptance two years ago of the fourth carbon budget, which
covers the period 2023 to 2027, and raises the fear that the purpose of

Energy Bill. I think that the industry, the non-governmental
organisations and the academic world were all hoping to see it appear a
lot earlier than last summer. Our Committee was given a very limited
period—about half the time normally given to Select Committees
to comment on a draft Bill. We completed our work—with great
assistance not just from my colleagues on the Committee, but
from 
<?notus-xml column=1389?>the staff—in about six weeks. Having received our
recommendations at the end of July, we waited another five months
before the actual Energy Bill was published, although I recognise that
some of that period was used in the negotiations on which I have
already congratulated the Secretary of State. The Public Bill Committee
stage was completed in the first week of February, however, and we have
now waited a further four months to get to Report, so the matter has
not been conducted with the urgency that I think the needs of the

understandably envious glances cast across the Atlantic by the Treasury

the Energy and Climate Change Committee was one of the first bodies to
urge the Government, more than two years ago, to approve more
exploration and testing to establish the scale of Britain’s
recoverable shale gas reserves. If our dependence on imported gas can
be cut and if consumers can be partially protected against fluctuations
in international gas prices, which have been the main cause of the rise
in domestic energy prices in the last few years, that is wholly to be
welcomed. However, my Committee also warned, in a more recent report on
shale gas, that it would be rash to base energy policy on the
assumption that Britain will soon be a major shale gas producer. The
opposition to exploring for shale gas in Sussex, which is already
emerging, is a foretaste of the battle for public opinion, which must
be won before domestic production of shale gas on even a modest scale
can occur. The case for a diversified energy mix is therefore as strong
as ever.</hs_Para>

although we hear regular warnings about a looming capacity crisis in
electricity generation and the consequent risk of power cuts, there is
a curious complacency about the Government’s attitude.
Investment in new generating capacity is now at a low level. The
nuclear talks between the Government and EDF remain unfinished. Even
if, as I now hope and expect, they are brought to a successful, albeit
belated, conclusion, it will be 2020 at the earliest before a single
kilowatt of electricity is generated by a new nuclear power station in
Britain. New investment in coal is unlikely to occur until an
economically viable form of carbon capture and storage is available.
Despite the huge potential market for CCS, there is no sign anywhere in
the world of that happening. I am an enormous fan of CCS—it is
the single technology that the world most urgently needs to address
climate change—but we might have to wait another decade or even
longer for a breakthrough on that front.</hs_Para>

coal can be imported cheaply from America, so our remaining coal-fired
power stations are running flat out. Gas generation—the great

holding back until the details of the Government’s

example, according to new figures from Bloomberg, the flow of funds is

remain committed to supporting low-carbon technologies after 2020,
fears that instead they will bet the farm on another dash for gas, and
a lack of clarity about the level of strike prices to be proposed for
the new contracts for difference regime have all unsettled investors.
The only certain consequence of this is that investment will be slower

notably in its acceptance of the fourth carbon budget. However, the

matters—that nothing in the amendment would affect the cost of

consumers—a concern that I share—he should address his
attention in the short term to the Treasury, which has imposed a
minimum floor price for carbon. That will have the effect of
raising electricity prices before 2020. It is an imposition that

dishonest for anyone to suggest that we could protect consumers against
the probability of higher energy prices. The world’s demand for
energy is expanding very quickly, particularly in the Asian economies,
and that will probably lead to higher prices. What the Government can
do, and what the Bill is aiming to do, is at least to minimise those
price rises. A number of measures can be taken to achieve that,
including improving competition, ensuring that consumers are better
informed and deploying various smart technologies on a large scale.
Also, as I have said before, it would be helpful if Britain were able

hope, incidentally, that we will move swiftly away from a situation in
which the Government set the strike prices for contracts for difference
on a centrally determined basis, and that they will allow different
technologies to bid in an auction process so that we can be sure that
we are getting the best value for money. It may well be that some
technologies that we do not yet know about will offer better value than
offshore wind farms, for example, which look to me as if they are going
to be at the costly end of the spectrum. Even today, it is possible to
see solar and an array of wind farms—I visited them in my

Gardiner:</Member></B> Yes, the hon. Gentleman is right to say that the
climate has been changing over billions of years. If, however, he cared
to read the report from the Met Office and from meteorologists around
the world, he would find that the fluctuation over the past
10 years, to which he referred, relates to the context and
background diminishing rather than the effect of emissions reducing.
Again, if he bothered to read the report, he would find that it says
that once the background comes back to normal or back to the average,
the effect of the increased emissions would then produce a
correspondingly sharp rise in climate change. The hon. Gentleman is
right to say that there have always been changes in the climate and
there are risks that we must factor in, but when we do so, we must take
full account of the scientific data. Failing to do so is the mistake he

accurate. The Secretary of State did not need to give himself the power
to set a decarbonisation target in the Bill, because he already had
that power under the Climate Change Act 2008. What the Government
actually do in the Bill is make it illegal for him to set a 2030

question of what the costs to British industry and British consumers
will be. As the hon. Gentleman will accept, the independent Committee
on Climate Change has already addressed that question, and, indeed, its
remarks and recommendations were based precisely on its assessment of
the likely costs and benefits and the signals that currently exist in
the market; but he has made a fair point. We certainly need to ask what
signals exist, and what effect either costs or benefits are likely to
have on our national well-being.</hs_Para>

argument that the Government Whips have deployed against the amendments
is that sector-specific targets without road maps are meaningless. That
is, to a degree, relevant to the point made by the hon. Member for
Central Devon (Mel Stride). This is not only about the targets; it is
also about the road maps relating to the implementation of those
targets, and that, of course, is precisely why we have a levy control
framework. It is also why the EMR report of the Committee on Climate

final argument that we have heard from Ministers is that they do not
wish to sacrifice jobs and growth for the sake of the environment. That
is the most fallacious argument of all. It was dealt with very well in
some of the pre-Committee hearings. Andrew Buglass from the Royal Bank
of Scotland told the Energy Bill Committee that there is a cliff edge
and that cliff edge is making it very difficult for supply chain
investors to invest in the UK. Overcoming the insecurity created by the
2020 cliff edge does not require more public money or even
the promise of more money. It requires coherence in the form
of a 2030 target that proves to industry that the demand for low-carbon

Gardiner:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One of the
great mistakes this Government have made on energy policy is to confine
it simply to energy itself, and not to consider it in the wider context
of British industry. That is why I am delighted that the new Minister
for Energy, the right hon. Member for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon), has a
spanning brief over the two Departments. I hope he will be able to
bring that to bear, because we must see how our energy policy is
related to our exports. Unfortunately, last night the Government did
not accept the amendments on carbon capture and storage, but we must
understand that the growth of CCS as a new technology in this country
will impact not only on our own energy policy here in the UK, but much
more widely in terms of the exports we can make abroad and the impact
we can make on climate change across the globe and in countries such as
China and India, which will be using coal for the next 30 or 40 years.
That is the true prize. Our own energy consumption and our own
emissions are small compared with those of the rest of the world, but
the impact that our industrial policy can make is enormous. That is why
we have to integrate energy and business, as my hon. Friend
says.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0001.htm#13060468000307">Potential

significant debate and interest across the House. Let me say, first and
foremost, that the Government share the view that decarbonisation of
the electricity sector, done in the right way, is vital. It will help
us to: deliver secure and affordable energy for the long term;
diversify our energy mix: insulate the economy from price spikes in the
international energy market; and meet our long-term, legally binding
goals on renewable energy and climate change. It is because
decarbonising energy generation is one of the central pillars of this
Government’s energy policy that we introduced these new
provisions into the Energy Bill, in order to take that critical step of
enabling a legally binding decarbonisation target range for the
electricity sector to be set in 2016. That would be the first of its
kind in the world.</hs_Para>

Fallon:</Member></B> The amendments we introduced in Committee allow
the Government, if they so wish, to set a target. I will come on to
deal with that point, but let me turn first to the amendments tabled by
my hon. Friend the Member for South Suffolk (Mr Yeo) and the hon.
Member for Brent North (Barry Gardiner). I do not believe that these
amendments take the right approach for the following reasons.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=1402?><hs_Para UID="13060468000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0001.htm#13060468000326">First, now is
not the right time to set a target range. Hon. Members say that doing
so will improve investor certainty, but this Government are already
giving clear signals about the future of our electricity sector, and I
shall address that in a moment. Secondly—this answers
the point made by the hon. Member for Rutherglen and
Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex)—it would be a mistake to impose a
legal obligation now that a target range must be set. Decarbonisation
of the electricity sector is inextricably linked to that of the entire
economy, so a decision to set a binding target range should be taken in
2016 when we consider the trajectory of the whole economy towards our
2050 target. Thirdly, the Committee on Climate Change is the wrong body
to set a legal constraint on what the level of the target range
should be.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060468000327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0001.htm#13060468000327">I wish to
expand on each of those three points. Hon. Members say that we must set
a target now because investors need greater certainty. The Government
agree wholeheartedly that investor certainty is essential to delivering
our energy and climate change goals at the least cost. That has been a
fundamental part of our policy to date and it will continue to be a
high priority moving forward. However, it is very important to
recognise that we already have legal targets and measures that clarify
the long-term future of electricity generation in this country. They
include: the 2050 target to cut emissions by at least 80%, which is
likely to require the entire electricity sector to be decarbonised; the
fourth carbon budget that runs up to 2027, which requires this country
to halve its emissions in the whole economy—we have set out in
the carbon plan the likely implications of that for the electricity
sector; and the 2020 EU renewables directive, which will mean 30% of
electricity generation coming from renewables in 2020, compared with
around 10% today. We shall also be arguing, as the Secretary of State
announced last week, for the most ambitious greenhouse gas emission
target ever to be set in the European Union of 50% by
2030.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0001.htm#13060468000328">In
addition, we have committed ourselves to providing clarity on the
trajectory of the electricity sector up to 2030 by issuing guidance to
the National Grid Company on an indicative range of decarbonisation
scenarios consistent with the least-cost approach to achieving our
overall 2050 carbon target. Of course, we must also not forget that
what matters most for investors now is not simply words and
aspirations, but funding. That is what we have got through the
Government’s decision to increase support for low-carbon
electricity year on year to £7.6 billion by 2020, a tripling of
support between now and 2020 which provides a clear and durable signal
to
investors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0001.htm#13060468000329"><Member ContinuationText="Dan Byles" PimsId="5598" UID="13060468002199" xid="1199" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0001.htm#13060468002199"><B>Dan

further support for investors. For example, the Government’s
delivery plan, which is due to be published in draft in July, will
provide draft strike prices for renewables projects that wish to take
up contracts for difference. They will provide further certainty about
potential future revenues to developers of such projects, at an earlier

a decision on whether to set a target when considering the trajectory

between the electricity sector and other sectors of the economy,
especially those, such as heat and transport, that might well become
more dependent on electricity as we move into the 2020s and 2030s. That

Members—most recently the hon. Member for Brent North (Barry
Gardiner), who is just leaving the Chamber—have set them out
with great expertise and eloquence. From a security perspective, I want
to underline that the stakes could hardly be higher. It is clear that
those who will suffer the most harm and hardship from the impacts of
climate change are often the poorest and most vulnerable, here in the
UK and globally—those who have contributed the least to the
problem. In that respect, this crisis is not unlike the banking
crisis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000356">As
many business leaders and experts such as Lord Stern have said, there
is no business as usual at all in a 3° or 4° warmer
world. A couple of years ago, at the launch of the UK’s climate
adaptation plan, the big idea was managing the unavoidable and avoiding
the unmanageable. “Avoiding the unmanageable” means
keeping global temperature rises below 2°. For years, that line
in the sand has been recognised by the UK and most other Governments,
and enshrined in legal documents 
<?notus-xml column=1407?>under the auspices of the United Nations framework convention on climate
change and the G8. That is the basis for the UK’s Climate Change
Act 2008, and our carbon budgets, which the policies in the Bill will,
or perhaps will not, deliver. Internationally, citizens and Governments

would say that the target does not go far enough, although of course I
will support it this afternoon. Let us remember the context: a target
of 50 grams of carbon per kWh by 2030, which is what the amendments
that we are considering are essentially proposing, is absolutely the
minimum that we should seek to achieve. The Climate Change Act 2008 and
the carbon budgets that flow from it reflect the overwhelming
consensus, stated many times by the Government, that we have to keep
below 2° warming, but current carbon targets give us only a 37%
chance of doing that. I want to emphasise that, because I sometimes
think that when we discuss targets in the House, we assume that if we
meet a certain target, that gives 100% certainty of a given outcome.
Clearly it does not; it is about a balance of risks. How many of us
would get on an aeroplane if we were told that it had only a 37% chance
of reaching its destination in a safe way? A 37% chance is pretty low,

is still a high-carbon fuel, and gas prices are projected to rise in

oppose the amendments in the name of my hon. Friend the Member for
South Suffolk (Mr Yeo) and others, and I do so primarily because it is
high time that this House heard a voice for the consumer of energy. I
am extremely worried about energy prices. The Labour Government did
some good work, highlighting the serious problem that they called fuel
poverty. They rightly identified the fact that at the time of their
Government many people in our country found it difficult to pay the
energy bills because they were already high. In recent years—the
end of the Labour period and now under the coalition—those bills

fuel poverty have also had the great problem that in recent years we
have had a succession of particularly cold and bitter winters, with
heavy snowfalls and ice, and a series of rather cold and damp summers.
Although I will not go into the arguments about how we can measure
rising temperatures and how much global warming we are actually
experiencing, the cruel fact of life for people facing rising energy
bills is that they need to use more energy because it is so cold and
they need to keep warm. We even had snow and frost in May this year in
England, at the very time that energy prices were being put up, partly
by market forces and partly by a deliberate act of policy by the
Europeans to 
<?notus-xml column=1410?>try to make energy dearer to put people off using it. We need to take on
board the fact that there is a serious problem of people affording the
heating
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000377">This
is doubly damaging in an economy that is experiencing a fragile and
modest recovery and needs a faster recovery. Energy is taking too much
of the family budget. At the very time when we want people to have more
money to spend on other things to create demand and jobs around the
economy generally, a large chunk is being taken up by those rising
energy bills, both because of price and because of the need to burn
more as a result of the climate conditions outside. We also see that
there is an additional problem, which my right hon. Friend the Minister
referred to at the end of his speech: British business now faces
considerably higher costs for the energy it needs to use than
competitor businesses in America or throughout much of Asia. It should
be a grave worry to everyone in the House who is concerned about jobs
and about the creation of more industrial activity in Britain that we
are deliberately creating very high priced energy in this country,
which is a major impediment to industrial
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000378" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000378">I
welcome the Chancellor’s statement some time ago that he wished
to see the “march of the makers”. I welcome the idea that
we need to build up stronger and bigger industry to go alongside the
successful job creation that we have had in financial and professional
services and related areas. It would be good for our economy to have a
more diverse and flourishing structure. We have some very good
industrial businesses, but we do not have enough of them and the sector
is not as large as I think any major party in the House would like to

if we are all serious about wishing to have an industrial strategy that
works, and if we are serious about wanting to create a climate in which
business can flourish and more industrial jobs can be created, surely
we must tackle one of the main costs that business faces—the
cost of energy. The Government are well aware of the problem and have
responded to lobbying by high energy-using industries, such as steel,
glass and ceramics, where energy is a massive part of the total cost
because extreme heat is applied for the transformation of the materials
in the process. The Government are providing some kind of subsidy to
those heavy energy users in a desperate attempt to prevent some of
those factories and process plants closing, but even with the subsidy
the production costs are much higher in Britain than in America, China
or other parts of Asia, so we are still at risk of losing more of that
business by closure, and we are certainly at risk of not attracting the
new investment in those types of industry that we might like as part of
our industrial

Government also need to understand that it is not just transformational
processes such as steel or glass production that have an energy cost
problem; it is more or less any kind of industry with an automated
plant. If we wish to be competitive in a western country against
countries in Asia which have relatively low labour costs, we need to
automate. We need to have a very degree of machine power so that all
the mundane jobs can be done by intelligent machinery to keep costs
under control. But we lose the advantage of being able to automate and
use high technology if the cost of the energy to drive the machinery is
so uncompetitive. We will soon lose the advantage as well because a
country such as China is industrialising not only very rapidly, 
<?notus-xml column=1411?>but with the application of far more technology and labour-saving
equipment going into its factories. So we have a double problem in that
such countries are automating and they have much cheaper

urge the Government to take our problem of energy prices extremely
seriously. American energy prices are typically a third lower than
United Kingdom energy prices, so if energy is 10% or 20% of the cost of
the given process and the given industry, we can see immediately that
there is a 3% or 6% cost advantage just from the energy bill, which in
very competitive world markets can be an important distinction. When we
look at the success that America is now having in building her recovery
longer and faster than the European countries, it is clear that part of
that success comes from the accent placed on cheap energy. The United
States of America has not put through legislation similar to the
legislation passed in 2008 by the Labour Government—legislation
that I did not feel able to support at the time because I thought it
would be damaging to prosperity and would put up our energy bills too
much—and we see that America is also reaping the benefit of the
shale revolution. I hope that the words of the Prime Minister and the
Energy Minister will result in action, because the United Kingdom has
an opportunity with shale as well, but America not only has found the
shale and is keen on the shale, but is now extracting such large
quantities of shale gas that it has much, much cheaper gas prices than
the United Kingdom, of benefit to consumers and to American
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000382" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000382">We

approach to carbon targets because it is a growing economy. I have a
great deal of sympathy with its need, but China is not being asked to
cut its carbon emissions in the way that the United Kingdom is being
asked to cut emissions. When the Kyoto process was last looked at to
try to get much tougher targets across the world, the only countries
that were still prepared to be in the game were the European countries,
so the European economy as a whole on the continent is saddled with
dangerously high prices and restricted ability to generate power in
different ways, and the United Kingdom has the particularly virulent

almost every party in the House, and certainly from every part of the
UK, including Members from both governing parties. In particular, they

begin by paying tribute to the lead proposers for their efforts in
securing cross-party support for the amendment. There have been three
Ministers in eight months so it is easy to lose track, but the hon.
Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), who unfortunately cannot be with
us this afternoon, spoke in a debate in the House last November about
the need to take energy policy out of politics, because investors need
to know that there is support for long-term measures. That is key, and
it is in that spirit that the amendment is offered to the House this

the hon. Member for South Suffolk and others who have spoken have made
clear, the crux of the amendment is that if, as the Government keep
repeating, their intention in relation to energy policy is to seek
renewal of our energy infrastructure in a way that safeguards security
of supply and reduces our carbon 
<?notus-xml column=1413?>emissions, and does so in the most affordable way, then the greatest
prize in securing that investment is clarity, predictability and
purpose. That is precisely what a decarbonisation target provides, and
it does so in conjunction with the carbon budget and other measures in
the Bill. That is why I believe that there is, or certainly was, near
universal support for a decarbonisation target. My right hon. Friend
the Leader of the Opposition called for it last year. As we have
already heard, the Chief Secretary to the Treasury moved such a motion

There is strong support for this in the energy industry, business in

heard, organisations and industry, including companies as diverse as
Microsoft, Sky, Unilever, the EEF—to respond to the point made

directly from the investment that we know needs to happen. Memorably,

<?notus-xml column=1414?>that we heard in Committee from the representative from RBS, the lead

that investment, those jobs and that manufacturing capacity, quite
apart from the other benefits in terms of security of supply and carbon
emissions. That is why I am sure that those industries and companies
will be concerned to hear the tenor of some of the Minister’s
remarks, which seemed to be going further back even than those of his

the Cabinet Office, the home for displaced Ministers, in suggesting
that this is something that we might not want to do in the future. The
right hon. Member for South Holland and The Deepings (Mr Hayes) made it

more successful, they may hit 5 MW. An increase in the small-scale

to play a much increased role in our energy mix over the next few
years, and how the whole electricity market would be decarbonised over
the next period in line with what DECC had previously published as its
plans for a radical decarbonisation of the electricity market over that
period. The Bill was the embodiment of how those changes would be
made—how, over the next period, our energy markets, particularly
our electricity market, would radically change how they move forward
and 
<?notus-xml column=1420?>how they supply energy to us. The Bill also contains emissions
performance standards that reduce the emissions that plant may make,
also in line with the decarbonisation of our energy over the coming

blindingly obvious that a Bill of that kind should have a target at the
front in order to underpin all the other things that it is doing. Not
having that target is rather like someone carefully strapping a belt
around their waist and then sallying forth having forgotten to put on
the trousers that the belt was supposed to be supporting in the first
place. When the Bill first arrived, the lack of a target was a puzzle
to a large number of people. In a sense, the hon. Member for Edinburgh
West has started to unpick some of that puzzle. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex) outlined, we
know from what the Secretary of State has said to the Energy and
Climate Change Committee on more than one occasion that he was very
keen on having a target in a Bill and was engaged in work on that
target, the details of which he could not yet vouchsafe to the
Committee.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State was engaged in discussions with the Treasury about
what might go at one end of the Bill and what might be negotiated away
at the other end to secure the things that he thought were quite
important, relating particularly to supporting low-carbon energy in the
way that I have described. The result, as we discovered fairly
recently, is the announcement of the extension of the levy control
framework from 2015 to 2020, with a figure increasing from the current
amount of £2.3 billion to, allegedly, the whopping figure of
£7.5 billion in 2020.</hs_Para>

rather careful about immediately jumping for joy about that aspect of
the negotiation, because as soon as we unpack the figures we realise
that each year the levy control framework takes along with it the
accumulated underwriting of whatever has been commissioned in the year
before. That means that by the time we get to 2020, the accumulated
contracts for difference, or ongoing renewables obligation
certificates, that are caught up in the £7.5 billion make up a
good proportion of the total. The actual amount of support contained in
the levy control framework up until 2020, per year for new
entrants—that is the key thing to look at in terms of the
development of low-carbon energy, particularly round 3 offshore wind
and the like—turns out to be not much more than is being
undertaken at the moment. The idea of its ending up at twice the
current level is rather belied by the figures in the levy control
framework. Nevertheless, the Secretary of State felt that he had got a
good
deal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000448" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000448">It
is not, however, a particularly good deal and it is clear that the
inclusion of a target in the Bill was sacrificed. A belt and trousers
had not previously been available, but on 5 February—halfway
through the Committee stage—the Secretary of State came along
with the belt that had resulted from the discussions. As hon. Members
have said, as a result of the discussions, although the Secretary of
State could not set a target before 2016, he could set a target at
various levels that could be considered then. Indeed, the Minister has
made great play of the argument that we will need to have all the facts
at our disposal with regard to the future state of the universe in
order to decide how we might set a target.</hs_Para>

important things need to be considered during the intervening period.
First, the gas strategy set out by the Department of Energy and Climate
Change over a number of years assumes a relatively low level of gas
over the long term and, while it views gas as essential, it sees it as
a back up for other, renewable forms of generation. The recent gas
strategy includes an option to reverse that approach and puts gas at
the centre of a future strategy. It includes gas plants running at
maximum capacity, grandfathered for a long period and playing the main
role—not the back-up role suggested by the low-carbon strategy
exemplified by the Bill—in energy
generation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000450" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000450">Explicit
within that gas strategy is the need to take a decision in 2014. The
strategy specifically says that, depending on what happens in Europe, a
decision will have to be made as to whether to increase the
carbon target. Accommodating the strategy could therefore
result in a target of about 200 grams of emissions per kWh
by 2030, rather than the 100 to 150 grams envisaged previously by the
Department and endorsed by the Committee on Climate Change. A
significant decision might be taken in 2014—way before

I have said, I am not sure that the framework as it stands addresses

that are at the heart of the Bill have to start on the work now on
projects that will come on stream in six, seven, eight, nine and 10
years’ time. However, those companies, which are at heart of the
engine of this Bill, will not do that under the current circumstances,
because they have to take decisions now and if they see that they will

they do not want to use their initial investments for that purpose

give. I recently visited Vestas offshore wind research and development

the next generation of Vestas offshore wind blades and other
mechanisms. It is researching, among other things, 80-metre blades and
doing a great deal of stress testing and 
<?notus-xml column=1422?>research and development, and in the process it is fabricating those
blades. As a result, the centre has in place on the Isle of Wight a
single-line manufacturing capacity that could produce a large number of

UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000456" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000456">If
nothing happens after 2020—we should bear in mind that making
blades as close as possible to large offshore developments is,
significantly, commercially advantageous—it is extremely
unlikely that Vestas will change its R and D facility to a production
facility, because it will not make blades in this country for
development in the south China seas. That could lead to the development
of a UK offshore wind industry being based on no supply chain
whatsoever, because in order to carry out developments we would have to
source from elsewhere. That would be of considerable expense to
consumers, which would not be the case if we adopted a longer-term

oddity of there not being a target in the Bill raises questions about
the strategy to create certainty for the process by which the new form
of low-carbon energy market will be brought into being. The idea of
enacting the Bill without including a target is bizarre, but that is
the position we are in. Including a target would not just be the right
thing to do; it would be a practical element of what the Bill is about.
It would also be a practical way of ensuring that electricity market
reform and the Bill itself work. There are a number of reasons to
support the inclusion of a target, and the final bizarre thing to note
is that a large number of hon. Members present know that to be the case

number of hon. Members may decide, for all sorts of reasons, that it is
expedient not to vote for a target. If that is the case, let me be
clear that they will undermine the very purpose of the Bill. They will
also undermine what we all voted for with regard to the Climate Change

coherent and controlled way, using the best of our resources and
technology and our supply chains, and developing a low-carbon economy
that can reach the targets in a way that is good for the consumer and
for society. This is that important. That is why I hope that hon.
Members who may be equivocating over whether to go for the
deals—the Faustian pacts that have caused the Bill to reach its

Reckless:</Member></B> I am pleased to follow the hon. Member for
Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead), but I am not sure whether I agree
with him about the logic, let alone the coherence, of the Bill or the
amendment. He says that many hon. Members will want to vote for the
amendment for logical and coherent reasons, but I do not believe that
that is so. Many hon. Members—a very high
proportion—although rather less of my constituents vote almost
always on the green side of any argument. They vote almost
ideologically—they support the greener side of any issue under
discussion. The problem with that approach is that it has led to a
network of legislation and other commitments in this country that are
internally incoherent and make no sense. Instead of hon. Members
looking at the matter in the round and seeing how they could best
obtain their 
<?notus-xml column=1423?>overall objective, be that decarbonisation or
otherwise, they support each and every of various, disparate
initiatives that add up to a whole that does not make sense, even in
terms of those
objectives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000460">Those
promoting the amendment say that they want to bring certainty for
investors, and yet the Minister, too, says that that is his objective.
The Minister mentioned that he wanted to protect and insulate consumers
from price spikes. The problem is that the method by which he seeks to
do so, and administers in the Bill, locks in high prices, so that for a
very long period, whatever the uncertainties, our consumers will be
locked
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000461">The
primary purpose of the Bill is not the decarbonisation of electricity,
but to set up the “contract for difference” model that
allows the Government to sign long-term and very expensive contracts
with all manner of energy producers—the Government will pick
winners through an opaque process—and give certainty to
investors that our consumers will be forced to pay those prices and
have them added to their electricity bills throughout the length of
contracts that could contain a change-of-law clause that it might not
be possible to unpick in future should we want to do so. That is what
worries me about the Bill. We are changing the pie-in-the-sky, Alice in
Wonderland policy objectives that the previous Government
proposed—only four or five current Government Members voted
against them—but we can undo a Government policy objective for
2050 if we find that it does not make sense or is overly expensive.
This Bill, however, essentially makes such a reverse undoable because
it moves the policy from the sphere of legislation to that of
contractual
commitments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000462">It

fear that the sum might be larger than the £9.8
billion. Policy Exchange has released a well-considered analysis that
adds up the total additions to gas and electricity bills within the
levy control framework to £16.3 billion. Even that does not take
into account two significant factors: first, the carbon tax floor,
which is a tax and not in the levy control framework, which applies to
spending; and secondly, the cost of banning coal production—coal
production will be banned by shutting down plants through the EU
directive, and through the domestic and unilateral legislation to ban
the construction of new coal-fired plants. We could be looking at
amounts equivalent to 4p, 5p or 6p on income tax.</hs_Para>

almost all of my constituents that I speak to do not want to pay those

amendment confuses two issues, the first of which is the Climate Change
Act 2008 commitment to an 80% reduction in carbon gases by 2050. The
commitment applies to the whole economy, but the amendment seeks an
electricity decarbonisation target. The Minister persuasively drew
attention to that inconsistency. If we are looking to hit the 80%
reduction target in 2050—the target strikes me as an enormously
ambitious and costly one, and I doubt it will be met—we need to
decarbonise large sections of the economy, and not just the electricity
sector. As part of that, we must persuade significant sections of the
heating and transport sectors to convert from current fossil fuels to
electricity. However, the amendment would accelerate the
decarbonisation of electricity still more, which will shove up the cost
of electricity so much that it will be hugely unattractive for those
sectors to switch to electricity from their current fossil fuels.
Therefore, even on its own terms, the electricity decarbonisation
target risks setting back its avowed goal of helping towards the
purported 2050 target for the decarbonisation of the economy as a
whole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000468" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000468">None

consequence. I do not, on balance, support the amendment, but I am not

obviously be cheaper for consumers and producers of electricity to use
grotesquely expensive renewables rather than cheap fossil fuels that
have a vast tax is imposed on them. Even in that scenario, there is the

Reckless:</Member></B> Yes, it is robust in that sense, but the reason
it is robust is because almost any conceivable change in gas price is
completely swamped by the enormous increase in the carbon tax from
£16 now—and less than £2 in the ETS—to up
to between £200 and £500 per tonne by 2050. Of course the
conclusion is robust. If we assume that there will be a massive tax on
carbon, it will be cheaper to have lower carbon rather than higher
carbon, but so what? CFDs are included in the Bill, but they have
virtually nothing to do with this amendment. We keep on hearing that it
is about electricity decarbonisation, but it is not. That was only
inserted in the Committee stage of the Bill.</hs_Para>

is about hitting the renewable energy directive for 15% of all energy
production in this country—not just the electricity sector,
which makes up approximately a third—to be from renewables by
2020. However, that will set back decarbonisation across the whole
country, because it is a very expensive way to decarbonise. All the
savings we can make through energy efficiency, better insulation of
people’s homes, or, I hope the Minister will not mind me saying,
through different lighting that saves money across the network, are no
good or will only work on the denominator, because we are forced to
hit, by 2020, the 15% renewables target—33% of
electricity—set by the EU Commission. That will be grotesquely
expensive and will lead not to innovation in low-carbon technologies,
but to the rolling out of fairly mid-tech current generation onshore
and offshore wind at twice the price. That will absorb a huge
proportion of the £9.8 billion and lead to very little advance
in technology compared with what we could do with proper R and D
focused activity. That will happen not because of decarbonisation, but
because the EU directive that states that this must be done through
renewables.</hs_Para>

we are making the situation even worse by inserting further restraints,
such as a 12.5% cap on biomass. One way to get closer to hitting the EU
target is to use dual firing, where half coal, half wood pellets emit
approximately the same amount of carbon as gas, earning a
half-renewable credit on the real constraint, the 2020 EU target. We
are not allowing that, however. We could pay other
countries—Germany, Spain and perhaps Poland—to do a lot
those things far cheaper than we could do them ourselves. We have a new
Government in Iceland, and £2 billion is the estimate of the
capital cost of an interconnector to Iceland for its renewable
electricity. These measures are not being considered. Even if the
objective is to reduce carbon, that can be done so much cheaper than
the proposals that will be forced through by the Bill, which will be
millstone around our constituents’ necks for decades to
come.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_04_PT_1/41D698F942CD00FF301057093A8B662AC4DCAD7F" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 June 2013">Tuesday

Lavery</B> (Wansbeck) (Lab):</Member> I understand fully the call in
the amendment for the decarbonisation of the energy sector,
and for a target to be enshrined in the Bill. What the target should be
and whether it would be realistic is debateable. There have been wide
differences and many suggestions about what an achievable target might
be. 
<?notus-xml column=1427?>If the target is too ambitious, it will be impossible to
achieve. We need to bring some form of reality into the debate and
forget the pipe dreams of what people would love to see. This is about
what we can actually achieve between now and 2030, and between now and
2050. Is it achievable to decarbonise the energy sector to the degree
of 50 grams of CO<Sub>2 </Sub>per kWh? That is one suggestion, and I am
sure that plenty of Members believe that that is achievable. I find it
difficult to believe, however.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart), who had a shopping list
of issues he wanted to discuss today, I want to focus on carbon
capture, coal burn and gas burn—fossil fuels. I want to
accentuate the positives in burning fossil fuels with carbon capture. I
believe, and the expert advice shows, that it can contribute greatly
towards an agreed decarbonisation target. The trick is to transfer the
high-carbon electricity generation to low-carbon electricity
generation. [<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “How?”]
Carbon capture and storage is the answer. People seem to forget that
fossil fuels provide 70%—not 7%, but 70%—of the
UK’s electricity supply, and that is set to continue for the
short and medium term. Coal burning is set to increase not just in the
UK, but across the world, over the next 20 to 30 years. For whatever
reason, however, the role of coal, particularly in the UK, is often
pushed aside, swept under the carpet, totally ignored. This is done
deliberately in the Commons by many Members of Parliament, despite the
fantastic role that the miners of this country have played. They have
worked hard for many generations, producing the wealth and fuel to
generate this country, so it is unacceptable that they should be
ignored.</hs_Para>

years ago in 2010, the UK market demand for coal was roughly 54.1
million tonnes. That is what we burned in 2010. During the same period,
only 18.4 million tonnes were produced here, with a rough
50:50 split between open-cast and deep-mine sectors. Beyond doubt,
then, a lot of imported coal is required to meet the nation’s
demands. Coal imports have easily exceeded indigenous coal production
since 2003. Coal is not going away. It is here to stay, in
the UK and globally. We will not be able to persuade the
likes of China, India and America to stop burning coal; they are
burning coal unabated right now—that is a fact of
life.</hs_Para>

it would not be too difficult in China to make a little headway, given
how much carbon it produces. The trip to China was a learning curve. I

Australia, we have allowed our coal industry to be destroyed. The

there was a big fire at Daw Mill colliery, one of the biggest

this place. In my constituency, we do not produce coal, but we import
it, mainly from Colombia, through Hunterston. There was a proposal to
build a new coal plant at Hunterston, but that might not be going ahead
now. It would probably have been a carbon capture plan using
predominantly imported coal, because, I understand, the types of coal
produced in Scotland probably would not have been suitable. I know that

Lavery:</Member></B> That is an excellent and important point that I
will come to shortly. We have understood for generations that we closed
profitable coal mines the length and breadth of the country, knowing
full well that carbon capture was in the background. We have done
nothing to protect the British deep-mining coal industry, and that has
cost thousands and thousands of jobs. We have dillied and we have
dallied with carbon capture and storage, including over the past three
or four years. The first announcement was made by the previous Labour
Government, who committed themselves to carbon capture and storage in
2007. Where is it? It is not here. It has been kicked into the long

simple. We should look to exploit the coal reserves up and down the
country, with carbon capture and storage onsite and with clean coal
power stations. That would decarbonise the electricity sector and go a
long way to ensuring that we can meet the targets. It might even mean
that we could reach 50 grams of CO<Sub>2 </Sub>per kWh. I am not too
sure about that, but it is the answer. The demand for coal is
significant here. Electricity consumption is set to increase, as too is
the consumption of coal, but as mentioned by several Members on both
sides of the House, by 2015, approximately 9,000 MW of coal-fired plant
is to be closed down, as a result of the large combustion plant
directive, so the UK will become increasingly dependent on imported gas
for electricity and domestic heating
purposes.</hs_Para>

about allowing gas to be burnt unabated, we must think of the
consequences. It will mean that we will be unable to achieve any of our

2050.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000494" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000494">Do

issue, which the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) referred to

be—no one would be more pleased than me if it was. We are
looking, but if we are to achieve our targets, we have to get carbon
capture and storage. We have to be serious and urgent about it if we

as I have explained—I am not sure whether I have explained it
enough—fossil fuels provide 70% of the electricity generated in
the UK, and that is likely to continue. Fossil fuels represent a major
source of CO<Sub>2</Sub>, and CCS is a key technology that enables
fossil fuels to become a low-carbon source of electricity. Fossil fuel
electricity generation is not subject to the intermittency of
renewables or the inflexibility of nuclear, is an important tool in
meeting variations in demand, and, with carbon capture, will allow the
UK to maintain diversity of fuel and energy sources. Fossil fuel with
carbon capture and storage would undoubtedly enable the UK to
decarbonise, in line with so many people’s hopes and
aspirations. The message from me is quite simple. The Government need
to stop dithering with carbon capture and storage. They should give
equal importance, attention and focus to CCS as they have to securing
nuclear power into the future. We should support the British deep-mine
coal industry or forget any ambitions to meet the target of a
decarbonised UK by
2030.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_04_PT_1/26E39C6DA28B0F0ABB30A38A7AC8627B1A94F6EC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 June 2013">Tuesday

station in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk
Coastal (Dr Coffey) and the development of the East Anglia Array, the
largest round 3 offshore wind farm, for which Lowestoft, the largest
town in my constituency, is the nearest port. These projects provide a
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to bring jobs and prosperity back to an
area that has been hard hit in the last 30 years by the
dramatic decline in the fishing industry, the closure of factories and
the rise of package holidays, which has hit the domestic tourism
industry. If we can build a strong domestic supply chain for low-carbon
energy generation, we will have an opportunity to reverse that decline
and properly rebalance the economy. This opportunity is not restricted
to East Anglia, but is repeated all around the coast of the British
Isles. To me, the issue before us in this debate is the role that
having a decarbonisation target in the Bill could play in building a

energy sector. For the Government and the Opposition to be singing from
completely different hymn sheets would have unnerved investors and seen
them fleeing these shores. Instead, despite differences, largely of
emphasis, most of the feedback that I receive from industry is that the

of these; there are differences of opinion between some of them. The
CBI is of the view that the most important factor driving investment
decisions is electricity market reform—the proposals in the Bill
on contracts for difference, the capacity mechanism and the levy
control framework. It is vital that this debate on the decarbonisation
target should not hold up the Bill from receiving Royal Assent.
Electricity market reform will be the main catalyst for the investment
we all seek. Likewise, it is important that the draft strike prices are

take note of EDF’s findings. EDF, too, emphasises the importance
of a decarbonisation target not preventing the Bill from passing
through Parliament in a timely way. EDF expresses the opinion that if
such a duty is to be provided for, it should be in secondary
legislation, subject to adjustment in the light of new evidence. That
would help to ensure that the required pathway to 2050 is realistic and
deliverable. I am also mindful of the importance of a Europe-wide
target and the need for agreement at EU level. The EU emissions trading

the feedback that I receive from industry is that, on its own, it might
not be enough to maximise inward investment. I have studied closely the

its conclusion that a decarbonisation target would help to deliver
savings of £25 billion to £45 billion on
consumer energy bills. Further, it emphasises the need for a strong
signal about the future direction of travel in order to support supply
chain investment, which has long payback periods, and the development
of new projects that have long lead-in times. There is a risk that, due

thereby creating home-grown jobs. There is a concern that, without such

and in many respects it was compelling. My one concern, however, is the
delay until 2016. By that time, important investment decisions might
well have been made for round 3 offshore wind projects. The orders
might already have been placed, and my concern is that not enough of
them will go to British businesses. The amendment would improve the

Mike Weir</B><B>:</B></Member> I strongly support the amendments in
this group. It is imperative to decarbonise the energy sector, and I
believe that including a decarbonisation target in the Bill would give
a clear and unmistakeable message that we intend to do so. The first
reason for adopting such a target is that we must reduce our carbon
emissions. The energy sector is a major contributor to carbon emissions
and the Committee on Climate Change has made it clear that
decarbonising power is the cheapest way of meeting our overall carbon
budgets.</hs_Para>

best, a mixed message coming from the Government on how they intend to
proceed with the decarbonisation of energy. In the Bill Committee,
witnesses told us time and again of the need for a decarbonisation
target to ensure that a clear message was sent to those involved in the
industry. The mixed message coming from the Government could seriously
harm our efforts to attract not only new renewables generation but,
crucially, the supply chain that will ensure that we reap 
<?notus-xml column=1433?>the economic benefits and the jobs that go with them. In opposing the
decarbonisation target, Ministers have made the point that other
nations do not have such a target. That is true, but many of those
countries are already ahead of us in creating a supply chain that can
supply investment in renewable energy in their territories. We are
trying to attract that supply chain here and to ensure that it is
established so that we do not simply continue to import the
infrastructure that we need to create green energy for the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000518" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000518">Much
was said earlier about the situation in Germany. Although it is true
that Germany does not have a decarbonisation target, it recently
announced a very ambitious 2030 renewable target, which includes
25 GW of offshore wind and a budget of €23 billion. I
understand that France, too, is considering moving towards such a
target, so there is movement elsewhere within the EU on such targets,
and we should not be left behind.</hs_Para>

evidence session, Danielle Lane of DONG Energy made it clear that the
2020 target is presently at the cliff edge, and that the industry needs

all parties to continue along the route of
decarbonisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000520" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000520">The
issue is very important to Scotland, where the development of green
energy is a vital part of the revitalisation of our manufacturing
industry. It is interesting to note that the Scottish economy has
achieved some growth over the last two quarters, much of it through the
energy sector. Scotland’s offshore potential is huge—25%
of the entire European potential. If we are able to harness that, we
could attract billions of pounds- worth of investment and create tens
of thousands of highly skilled and sustainable jobs. Indeed,
Scotland’s offshore wind route map outlined the potential for
£30 billion-worth of investment with up to 28,000 direct and

already have strong offshore experience in the oil and gas industry,
particularly in the north-east, and many of these skills could be
transferable to new offshore renewable energy developments. I would
cite the example of offshore wind, which I believe has a strong vibrant
future. There are plans to install up to 10 GW of capacity in Scottish
waters over the next decade, including three projects off the coast of
my Angus constituency. Many more sites, alongside commercial wave and
tidal generation, are being looked at for deployment in the 2020s. We
must ensure that we send a clear and unambiguous message that we want
these developments, and that we will continue to push for the
decarbonisation of the energy sector.</hs_Para>

important to set the targets now because companies are looking at
long-term investment. It will be many years before these investments
come on stream, but the decisions affecting 2020 are being looked at in

decarbonisation, we may well lose out on all the potential.</hs_Para>

way to dealing with offshore wind arrays and onshore development at our
ports such as Dundee, and, in my own constituency, Montrose. That
development, however, is based on the assumption of having a long-term

Gamesa, Areva, Mitsubishi and Samsung have indicated an intention to
establish manufacturing plant in Scotland in order to meet the expected
opportunities for offshore wind development. The difficulty we face
with this Bill, however, is that we can be sure of funding only up to
2020—and then, as DONG Energy says, we face the “cliff
edge” of uncertainty. Many of those who are considering
investments do not feel that there is sufficient reassurance of a
long-term market for their products beyond that date, which could lead
them to reconsider or delay any decisions on investment. Such delays
could lead to a significant loss to the economy and check ambitions to
create a new greener manufacturing base, especially when, if companies
decide to go ahead within the compressed time that is certain, there
would be a considerable shortfall in the ability of UK-based
manufacturers to meet the demand for turbines, which will inevitably
lead to the importation of much of the infrastructure, creating jobs
elsewhere but not in Scotland.</hs_Para>

urge the Government to address the future role of wind, and also that

The subsidy gives those companies a competitive advantage, enabling
them to purchase timber more cheaply than any other provider in the

world leader in all forms of new generation. I want to see us, as
pro-nuclear, being the forerunner in that new technology. There is also
great untapped marine energy potential in this country, and I want it
to be unlocked. The Bill offers a good mechanism for doing
that.</hs_Para>

need a target not for the sake of having a target, but to provide a
proper framework. The Liberal Democrats—including the hon.
Member for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart), who is having a discussion
in the Chamber at present—should follow their consciences and
vote for this proposal, because they believe in it. Yesterday, a number
of Liberal Democrats voted against the Government on some amendments
because it was the right thing to do, and it would be the right thing
for Liberal Democrats to do again today. They should vote with their

good position. Whichever party were in power now, the Government would
have had to introduce electricity market reform. The Minister was right
to say that, but he was wrong to say nothing had been done in the
previous 13 years—in saying that, he falls into a trap. A lot
was done in the 13 years of the last Labour Government. They introduced
a lot of proposals to help with renewables. They also brought nuclear
back on to the agenda—it had almost entirely slipped off it.
They introduced the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority to clear up the
mess left by previous Governments of both colours, too. A lot was done,
therefore, and today’s proposals build on the agenda set by the
last Labour Government during their 13 years in office.</hs_Para>

decarbonise the electricity market, and that presents huge challenges.
As we wean ourselves off fossil fuels, gas heating will have to be
electrified, and we will therefore need low-carbon electricity. The
transport system will need to be electrified as we move to high-speed
trains. Our cars will need to be electrified, too. These are massive
challenges, and we will need sufficient generation of low-carbon energy
if we are to meet our 2050 targets.</hs_Para>

target puts in place the signal and the framework for now. That is why
these measures are important. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead) said, the Bill is about
decarbonisation and reform of the market. In order to ensure that

call him that—the Member for South Suffolk on introducing these

it just feels that it should not get in the way of the Bill’s

clean energy and policies to keep the lights on go hand-in-hand. We
need a commitment to decarbonising the power sector by 2030 not just to
combat devastating and unpredictable climate change, but to keep energy
prices down and the economy growing into the second half of the 21st
century. The idea that there is a binary choice between a firm
commitment to green energy and keeping energy bills down is clearly a
false dichotomy. Decarbonisation is fundamental to keeping energy
prices down in the long term; the alternative is to remain at the whim
of unpredictable yet ever-rising global fossil fuel prices.</hs_Para>

therefore shocking that investment in green energy has fallen in every
year since this Government came to power. At current rates, investment
in 2013 will be at its lowest level since 2006. This is not just a case
of “not good enough”; it is an utter dereliction of duty.
The Government, riddled by indecision and infighting, are deterring
investment, stopping Britain becoming the leader in Europe on renewable
investment.</hs_Para>

evidence stage of this Bill, I asked the Secretary of State whether he
agreed with his party’s position of wanting a decarbonisation
target in the Bill. He said that he did but we have a coalition
Government, which therefore meant that it was not going to be
there—that says it all. This issue should be beyond party
politics. I welcome the fact that the hon. Member for Waveney (Peter
Aldous) has decided to support the amendment, and I understand that the
president of the Liberal Democrats, the hon. Member for Westmorland and
Lonsdale (Tim Farron), and their former leader, the right hon. Member
for Ross, Skye and Lochaber (Mr Kennedy), are going to
support it, too. I urge other Liberal Democrats, who have the choice at
4 pm as to which way to vote, to support the amendment, in line with
their party policy.</hs_Para>

Government rightly decry short-termism, and we all support a long-term
plan to improve British competitiveness and boost growth, which is why
it is so disappointing that the Government cannot recognise the crucial
long-term benefits of a 2030 decarbonisation target. Long-term strategy
is even more crucial in energy policy, where large fixed costs must be
met. Investors’ cash, which we know is highly mobile, relies on
a strong and unwavering vision from the Government. Without such a
vision, the UK has slumped to seventh in the world for investment in
clean energy, and for the first time we are no longer ranked first
globally for offshore wind attractiveness.</hs_Para>

the power sector by 2030 is not just an important part of our legally

a 2030 decarbonisation target is about more than preventing
catastrophic climate change. There is an irresistible business case for
these amendments, and it can be summed up in one word—jobs. The
renewable industry currently supports 110,000 jobs and, across the
supply chain, it could support 400,000 jobs by 2020. In 2012, the CBI
estimated that nearly one third of the insufficient number of jobs
created in the UK came in the green sector. Two thirds of jobs
providing low-carbon and environmental goods and services are outside
London and the south-east. Furthermore, if we use the BIS definition of
“low-carbon environmental goods and services”, we find
that the largest activity in the sector is manufacturing, with 20% of
total sales and employment, as opposed to a figure of 13% for the
economy as a whole. In 2010-11, green business grew by 2.3% in real
terms, outstripping global growth, yet this Government’s
dithering is scaring off investment in an industry worth £3.2
trillion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000553" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000553">Jobs,
rebalancing the economy and economic growth are three pillars of this
Government’s agenda that would be boosted by a decarbonisation
target. It is at times of economic stagnation—this economy is
certainly not booming—that investment is at its most
economically productive. With interest rates at near zero, the
Government should be prioritising investment in decarbonisation. That
the “greenest Government ever” claim they want to
decarbonise the economy but will not support a 2030 decarbonisation
target is simply bizarre. Without such a target, I am deeply concerned
that this Bill will not give investors the confidence we know they need
to invest in low-carbon generation in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468000554" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468000554"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Yeo" PimsId="4697" UID="13060468002270" xid="656" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0002.htm#13060468002270">Mr

particularly pleased that most of those members maintained the position
that the Committee took last summer when we reported on the draft Bill
and made a unanimous recommendation about the need for a target. My
right hon. Friend the Minister set out the Government’s position
very powerfully. I do not think that there was any doubt about his
reasons for opposing the amendment, but nothing he has said has
explained to me what, if the Government remain as serious as he says
they are about meeting the fourth carbon budget, which takes us to
2027, and progressing further towards the 2050 target, the objection is
to accepting now rather than in three year’s time the advice of
the Committee on Climate Change about a 2030 target for decarbonising
electricity generation. That seems to me to be completely consistent
with everything he said.</hs_Para>

Friend also had some perhaps predictable fun about press reports of an
answer I gave at something called the Westminster Russia Forum last
week, but I am not sure that he attempted to understand the
intervention I made during his speech. I do not doubt, and I have not
doubted for 20 years, that the man-made increase in greenhouse gas
concentrations in the past 200 years as a result of the industrial
revolution is extremely likely to be the cause of the changes in the
climate that we are now observing.</hs_Para>

to one side, however, I want to reiterate that unlike a great many
people who argue about the science of climate change I see it in an
historical context. The human species is one of the most recently
arrived on the planet and the phenomenal success of the
species—our proliferation in numbers and our control over our
destinies to an extent that perhaps no other species has ever
achieved—has only happened even more recently than that. The
precondition for that has been climate stability.</hs_Para>

expressed by some hon. Members about the cost of energy. I absolutely
share those concerns and it is for that reason that the amendment,
which I will press to a vote in three minutes’ time, does not
have the effect of raising electricity prices by a single penny for the
next seven years. Anyone who is concerned about short-term movements in
electricity prices should be hammering the Treasury about the floor
price of carbon. That is what is forcing prices up and reducing the
competitive position of British industry, not the setting of a
decarbonisation target for 2030 on advice from the Committee on Climate
Change.</hs_Para>

will happen to prices in the 2020s, nobody can be certain, as
colleagues have made clear. There is, however, a very strong
probability that the cost of various renewable energy technologies will
be lower then than it is today, as several are on a very rapid downward
cost curve. The pace of that reduction in the price of those
technologies might be even faster if the industries
concerned have greater certainty that the Government remain committed
to reducing dependence on fossil fuels for electricity generation
beyond 2020.</hs_Para>

therefore in my view overwhelming environmental reasons for supporting
the amendment, but there are other reasons, too. As I made clear, it
will encourage investment and bring down the cost of investment,
benefiting consumer prices. By accepting the amendment, the Government
would strengthen their claim to be the greenest Government ever. The
credentials of all previous Governments are not that strong, so
achieving that accolade is probably even now within the grasp of the
Government. Accepting the amendment would be a big step towards placing
Britain in the vanguard of the new industrial revolution, taking our
economy to a position in which it is less dependent on fossil fuels. I
am convinced that countries, industries and companies that do that will
not only be doing the right thing environmentally but enjoy an economic
and financial advantage by improving their competitive position over
those countries that remain dependent on fossil fuels in
2030.</hs_Para>

Barker:</Member></B> We now turn to the topics of electricity demand
reduction and route to market. I shall speak in favour of the new
clauses and amendments in the name of the Secretary of State and I
thank hon. Members for tabling the other new clauses and amendments in
this group, prompting debate on this vital set of
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001157">I
will start by setting out the Government’s approach on
electricity demand reduction. Making good my pledge in Committee, the
Government have brought forward new clauses 11 and 12 and amendments
100 and 135, which, for the very first time in our energy history,
would allow energy saving projects to compete for new investment on an
equal footing with power stations. It has long been recognised that in
many cases it is cheaper, as well as greener, to save electricity
rather than generate it. However, the coalition’s radical
legislative proposals for large-scale energy efficiency are a double
win—a win not only for the green agenda, but for hard-pressed
consumers worried about rising bills.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060468001158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001158">The fact is
that successive Governments have failed to grab the opportunity to get
units of saved power, or “negawatts” as they are
sometimes called, to compete with traditional megawatts. Thanks to this
reforming Energy Bill, the era of negawatts has finally arrived. We
already have a number of important policies aimed at driving greater
efficiency, but these measures mean that we can go further. As I said
to the <I>Financial Times</I> way back in September 2010, we need to
create new markets for electricity efficiency projects to bring in the
scale of new investment needed that is commensurate with the challenges
and
opportunities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001159">Following
our consultation on options to promote electricity demand reduction, we
concluded that a new financial incentive would be the most effective
way of delivering a step change in the efficient use of electricity.
The most cost-effective way to achieve this, without cannibalising the
budget for renewables, is to include demand reduction in our proposed
capacity market, and that is achieved through Government
amendment 100. Hon. Members and their constituents can now
be reassured that while we have a massive, multi-billion pound,
low-carbon infrastructure programme ahead of us, we will not be
building expensive new energy plants unnecessarily where cheaper
alternatives for energy efficiency are available.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060468001160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001160">Delivering
EDR through the capacity market will let us achieve three key
objectives: targeting reductions at more expensive peak times; securing
value for money  
<?notus-xml column=1448?>because it will set megawatts against potentially cheaper
“negawatts”; and bringing permanent demand reduction
projects into line with shorter-term demand-side response measures to
enable more effective, joined-up delivery of energy efficiency across
the board. The approach of delivering EDR through a capacity market is
proven—it is already being done in the United States of
America—but our approach is more visionary and will certainly be
much more ambitious. Government new clause 12 will provide a spending
power to enable our approach to be tested via a large pilot, or pilots,
to better understand, among other things, the complexity of the issue
and the scale of the potential. Government new clause 11 and Government
amendment 135 allow the Secretary of State to appoint and make payments
to an alternative delivery body to National Grid for the capacity
market. If it is decided that National Grid is not best placed to carry

installations supported by the FITs scheme are distributed generators.
We therefore do not see the need for a new mechanism, which could

Barker:</Member></B> That is a real possibility. A number of local
authorities already have that ambition and are using a range of
technologies. Woking is using gas-fired CHP, but renewable fuels such
as woodchip can be used, too. Such processes can generate substantial
amounts of reliable electricity, and if they are carried out locally,
the heat generated can also be used constructively, with cheap
affordable heat being sent into social housing and public buildings, or
to private residents. This model is already starting to take shape in
pioneer local authorities. The city of Nottingham has exciting plans

inherently good; what matters is what it can deliver, and there are
several ways of delivering the agreed outcome while navigating in
slightly different directions. Our concerns stem from the fact that
GPAM is effectively a fixed feed-in tariff, as it provides the
generator with a guaranteed price for all the power it generates. As a
result, the generator would have no incentive to manage its imbalance
risks, as these would be taken away from it, which could work out more

challenging, in the market for power purchase agreements, enabling

me begin by saying how wonderful it is finally to hear what the
Government propose to do about reducing demand for electricity. When
the Bill was first published in May last year, many industry experts
rightly observed that there was a gaping hole where the answer to that
question should have been. We spent many hours in Committee and on
Second Reading discussing and debating how we generate energy, but not
how we could use less of it in the first place. A fortnight ago, the
Government produced new clauses 11 and 12. I will come to their merits
in a moment, but first I must tell the Minister that these proposals
should have been brought forward much sooner. I know that the
right  
<?notus-xml column=1454?>hon. Gentleman agrees with me about that, because when we debated the

Government’s plans in Committee. We have only recently had the
opportunity to do so, and we have just heard what the Minister said. I
remind the hon. Gentleman that pay-as-you-save efficiency scheme pilots
were started under the last Government. We are waiting to see exactly
how the green deal is doing. We await the Government’s figures,

pre-legislative scrutiny, the Energy and Climate Change Committee
concluded that Ministers were failing to give enough priority to
demand-side measures. As I have said, we still had no firm proposals on
Second Reading. In Committee, the Minister would not confirm whether
the Government would definitely seek to include demand reduction
amendments in the Bill once his consultation had concluded. Now, at
long last, we have the results. We received them two weeks before Third
Reading and a year to the day since the Bill was first
published.</hs_Para>

has now said that he is minded to pilot measures to reduce electricity
demand through the capacity market, and we welcome that step. However,
the Government’s own response to their consultation accepted
that that course of action still presented a number of uncertainties. A
number of questions remain unanswered. I am sorry that the Minister
will not have an opportunity to answer them, but I would be happy to
give way if he would like to intervene on me. It would be helpful to
know, for example, exactly how the pilots will work and by how much the
proposals will reduce electricity demand. Those are currently complete
unknowns.</hs_Para>

Government’s forecasts from before the new clauses were
published showed that current policies would reduce electricity demand
by 59 TWh in 2018 and by 68 TWh in 2030. That energy saving would be
dwarfed, however, by an additional 92 TWh of untapped potential saving
that could be achieved by 2030, according to analysis by McKinsey. That
could be the equivalent of a 25% reduction in total electricity demand,
representing a colossal saving. It is unfortunate that the Minister
could not share with us the Government’s estimate of by how much
the capacity market could reduce electricity demand over the same
period.</hs_Para>

have also raised serious concerns about how effective the capacity
markets can be in rewarding energy saving. In the United States, for
example, a similar policy in Massachusetts resulted in energy
efficiency projects receiving just 3% of total capacity payments.
Despite complex design, 70% of capacity payments went to existing
fossil fuel generation instead. Were the Government aware of that
scheme? If so, what lessons have they learned from
it?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001200">The
way in which new clauses 11 and 12 are drafted provides the mechanism
for pilots to happen, but they do not offer any further detail. I
listened carefully to the Minister’s remarks, but there were a
lot of gaps. The proposals do not specify what measures will be
piloted, or whether more than one measure will be trialled. We are no
clearer, following his remarks, as to when the Government are planning
to launch the pilot or when they expect the first capacity auction to
take

was disappointed by the Minister’s response to the amendment
proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test (Dr

the whole House will know, has long-standing expertise and considerable
experience in this area. His amendment 35 would require the Secretary
of State to
establish</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13060468001960" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001960">“a

to do so “within one year” of this Bill becoming law.
That would introduce clear, simple payments for households and
businesses, and it could start immediately, with no wait for a capacity
crunch to trigger an auction. I understand that the majority of
respondents to the Government’s consultation favoured a premium
payment option along those very lines, but we did not hear from the
Minister the rationale behind the Government’s decision to
reject that option and favour instead incentivising demand reduction
through the capacity market.</hs_Para>

briefly on amendment 47, also proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Test, which would establish a green power auction market,
or GPAM. This would combat a significant issue. The UK needs to invest
£75 billion in new renewable generation by 2020. Analysis of
DECC’s own figures has shown that the Government are currently
relying on 35% to 50% of this investment being delivered by independent
renewable energy generators, or the “disruptive new
entrants”, as the Minister referred to them on a number of
occasions. Their current route to market is dependent on long-term
purchase power agreements with the big six. A green power auction
market of the kind my hon. Friend proposes could open up the market to
new suppliers, increase competition and potentially deliver a cash
saving to consumers of £2 billion. Although I welcome the
Minister’s saying that he wants to address this sector and that
a real issue is at stake, I sincerely 
<?notus-xml column=1456?>hope that a viable solution, which he said would be forthcoming, is in
place in time for the allocation of the first CFDs in 2014.</hs_Para>

dealing with our amendment 1 on community energy, which stands in my
name and those of my right hon. Friend the Member for Don Valley
(Caroline Flint) and my hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen and
Hamilton West (Tom Greatrex). Speaking as a Labour and Co-operative
Member, I am very proud to speak to this amendment. It would appear
that the Minister and I agree that community energy schemes deliver
enormous benefits to our country. They bring diversity, resilience and
security to the energy market. They boost our economy by attracting new
sources of investment, and they help to tackle fuel poverty through a
strategy for generating and saving energy that is owned by local
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001207">I
recently saw that first hand when I visited Brixton Energy, an
award-winning solar project run by Repowering South London. It is the
UK’s first inner-city co-operatively-owned energy project, and I
urge hon. Members to pay it a visit if they have not already had the
pleasure. As well as offsetting 28 tonnes of carbon every year, the
project is providing invaluable work experience opportunities for young
people. There are many other fantastic community energy projects
throughout the country: Westmill wind farm co-operative in Oxfordshire,
Neilston community wind farm near Glasgow and the Lochcarnan community
wind farm—the list goes on. There is a risk, however, that as
drafted the Bill could stop these types of larger community schemes
from ever happening again. That is why we need to amend it
today.</hs_Para>

those words ring rather hollow when we examine how this Bill fails to
address how community energy schemes can compete with large-scale
commercial generation. The issues have been well summarised by Cornwall
Energy, when it said that the high degree of technical knowledge needed
to participate in the system is a barrier for many smaller generators,
and that the proposed CFD system does not compensate smaller generators
for the lower market prices they receive for their power. With the end
of the renewables obligation, the Bill provides no incentive for
suppliers to purchase renewable electricity from independent
generators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001210"><B><Member ContinuationText="Katy Clark" PimsId="4759" UID="13060468002850" xid="912" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468002850">Katy

I know of has denied the reality of climate change, and I have
certainly never done so. The point is that the climate has always been
changing. That has been a clear and present danger for the last 4.5
billion years. The new clause, and indeed the entire Bill, were tabled
on the basis that the 0.8° rise that we have seen over the last
300 years is somehow more of a danger than any of the other rises and
falls that we have seen over the last 4.5 billion years.</hs_Para>

two ways to reduce demand for anything. One way is to ration the goods

provision for that, as they know there is a danger that we could run
out of electricity over the next 10 to 15 years. My understanding is
that there have been discussions as to how, if that were to happen,
demand might be rationed in respect of certain high users of energy.

“Why did we suddenly decide to make it more expensive to

decarbonise at a time when other nations, such as China and other
places in south-east Asia, were doing quite the opposite?” We

Whitehead:</Member></B> I think the hon. Member for Monmouth (David T.
C. Davies) will be going home tonight and throwing all the contents of
his fridge out, because he knows that he can go down to the shop to buy
some more food tomorrow. Perhaps he might think about the wider
externalities of saving energy and saving demand, because, among other
things, having a good demand-side reduction policy means that we do not
have to produce the new capacity that otherwise we might have in
stream to meet our energy demand, as we would be using
energy across the board much more efficiently. Whether or not one
believes—he plainly does not—that anthropogenic climate
change is a real and pressing issue, using our energy far more
efficiently and making sure that those possibly unfundable,
difficult-to-organise increases in capacity can be averted by doing so
is a prize in its own right. That is the case whether or not one thinks
this is intimately bound up with climate change, and I wish to dwell
briefly on that precise point.</hs_Para>

showered me with kind words, so he would not expect me to say anything
unkind in return. It would be churlish of me, and I was not intending
to do so. <I>[Interruption.]</I> There is no “but”.
Instead of advocating, at great length, the amendment that I was
pursuing on demand-side reduction, I wish to see whether we can unpack
a little of some of the consequences of the Government proposals that
have now been introduced. I warmly welcome those, and I know that the
Minister had quite a hard time in getting them to the table in their
current form. Therefore, I very much welcome both the effort that has
gone into introducing these provisions and their content. Essentially,
the amendments would produce, through the right mechanism of capacity
payments rather than contracts for difference, a serious method of
addressing the question of demand-side reduction over a long period,
but I would place a little question mark against that demand-side
reduction capacity or anti-capacity being auctioned through the general
capacity auction system. As my hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool,
Wavertree (Luciana Berger) has mentioned, we know from experience
elsewhere in the world that demand-side auction participants tend to be
squeezed out of wider auctions on capacity when they
participate.</hs_Para>

we are left with a mechanism that merely introduces the ring, as it
were, to would-be boxers in the demand-side reduction auction world but
does not go further than 
<?notus-xml column=1461?>that to ensure that they can compete in the ring
properly, the outcome might look good on paper but will not produce
much change over the next period. I am, however, encouraged by the idea
that there will be pilot auctions for demand-side reduction measures. I
do not know whether the word “pilot” is meant to propose
alternative routes to auctioning, which could considerably advantage
demand-side reduction measures if they stand outside the overall
capacity auction market as far as is possible, or whether they will
just be pilots that set out the parameters for arrangements and are
therefore limited in their ambition.</hs_Para>

accept that among the reasons for tabling my amendments was a wish to
ask the Government to table some amendments and to suggest some that
might do the job if they did not do so. However, the amendments also
try to work out how such a de-capacity market might work. They would
draw forward not just the auction but payments taken from the general
capacity payments at an early date, in advance of a capacity auction,
to ensure that the demand-side payments were auctioned or allocated at
an early stage and before such an auction. Although a capacity auction
is pretty certain to take place, under the legislation as it stands
there is no guarantee that the Government will hold such an auction.
The Government must look forward to see what the capacity constraints
are likely to be over the next period and declare an auction on that
basis and if it happens that the capacity constraints are not what was
thought, the Government might decide to have a capacity auction later
or not to have one at all.</hs_Para>

concerned if the question of demand-side reduction measures was lost
because a capacity auction for demand was delayed or removed entirely
as a result of those exigencies. The idea of separating out as far as
possible the idea of either auctioning or allocating demand-side
reduction measures within the overall capacity measures seems to me to
have quite a strong measure of sense about it. As for the future, I
would like the pilots mentioned by the Minister to fledge into a longer
running version of a parallel market for demand-side reduction measures
rather than simply leading to the opportunity to take part in the wider
auction market, which, for the reasons I have outlined, might not lead
to the sort of success that we all want for those measures once they
have been put into place.</hs_Para>

Although we are not in a position to announce details today, our

other matter that I want to raise relates to amendment 47, which calls
for the establishment of a green power auction market arrangement in
wholesale and retail sales of energy. I want to spend a moment
establishing why something like GPAM is so important. My amendment
attempts to resolve, or at least to go some way to resolving, a very
serious issue: the drying-up of opportunities for independent
generators to establish reliable markets for their low-carbon
generation once the renewables obligation comes to an end in the spring
of 2017.</hs_Para>

those independent generators have been able to secure power purchase
agreements on the back of renewables obligation certificates, and to
use those agreements effectively to bank their investments, so that
they have the sort of market certainty that enables those investments
to be funded because it is known that there is a stream of sale coming
forward that will ensure that the investment is made and works well, as
far as both the independent generator and the bank are concerned. With
the arrival of contracts for difference, that simply will not be the
case. Indeed, power purchase agreements for those people still
undertaking RO arrangements before the end of the renewables obligation
have already dwindled to virtually zero. In fact, only one company, as
far as I know, is presently providing power purchase
agreements.</hs_Para>

independent generators, whether we are talking about onshore, offshore,
or other forms of low-carbon generation, are already thinking, when it
comes to their investment decisions, about CFDs rather than
ROs, simply because of the time period over which
those investments have to be considered. They cannot go back
to the bank and say, “Can we have that investment on the basis
of what we can demonstrate to you, in the absence of other financial
credit lines, is a known supply line for our energy
product?”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001247">The
outcome could be quite perverse, with regard to what the Bill’s
intentions have always been. It was always the intention, with the
contracts for difference, to try to bring a lot of new, different
investment into the energy market, as well as independent generators of
different sizes. It was also the intention to ensure that the vertical
integration seen in recent years did not become the enemy of
investment, or of small, independent operators and others trying to get
into the market, but rather became its friend, as other entrants came
into the market alongside larger generators.</hs_Para>

outcome is that as a result of the Bill we further consolidate the
vertical integration of the market rather than the opposite, that will
be a perverse outcome relative to everything that the Bill was supposed
to bring about. If we can get a mechanism similar to the green power
auction market—if it quacks a bit like GPAM and walks a bit like
GPAM—I would be happy with that. We need some mechanism that can
ensure that independent generators are not captured by the very large
companies and that they do not have to enter

fail to make a living from the energy that they are trying to put into

Whitehead:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Indeed, there are
companies in the UK, such as Ecotricity, which have not exactly
involved themselves in crowd funding, but have engaged in bond
arrangements for the development of their low-carbon power. Even if
such a source of funding is available, if the deal for the subsequent
sale of the energy is so disadvantaged by a contract for purchase that
shaves off the reference price or makes arrangements that are extremely
disadvantageous to the ability of that company to sell its energy into

my name, starting with new clause 2, which deals with the strategy for
electricity demand reduction. The clause sets a clear ambition for 2020
and 2030, using figures published by DECC, alongside the electricity
demand reduction consultation, and requires the Secretary of State to
have policies that get us
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001253">I
was a little disappointed that, in response to the amendments that I
have tabled, the Minister on many occasions indicated warm sympathy but
not action to achieve the aims. Willing the ends but not the means
creates a nice warm fuzzy feeling, but does not change the menu of
targets and strategies before us. That particularly matters when it
comes to electricity demand reduction, because there is so much scope
for doing so much more in this area. No matter how sympathetic we feel
to that aim, however, unless the legislation is in place, we do not
have the clarity, certainty or confidence that action will be taken. We
have seen all too often how, in the absence of firm targets and
strategies, Governments fail to put in place adequate polices or
resources to achieve things. My worry is that in many respects elements
of the Bill are more like a wish list than a
strategy.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13060468001985" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001985">5.30

accessed by efficiency policies. It is also disappointing to see

reduce the overall amount of energy we need to keep our homes warm and

that the justification that he advanced would be responsible for such a
dramatic reduction. I cannot believe that quite so many cavity wall
insulations, down from 40,000 last year to just over 1,000 this year,
could be as a result of its having been done badly in the past. There

line rather than a top limit. The 50 MW was the level

the amendments would require distribution network licence holders to
play their part in facilitating decentralised energy. It is worth

Government introduced a system of preferential feed-in tariffs. That

developments of over 5 MW have to participate in the new contracts for
difference. I share the concern that contracts for difference will
raise the barriers to entry for the community energy projects that
Members in all parts of the House have said that they support. The need
for a higher degree of technical knowledge is one such barrier to
entry. The contracts will mean that smaller generators will receive
lower market prices for their power. With the end of the renewables
obligation, there will no longer be an incentive for suppliers to
purchase renewable energy from independent suppliers.

those reasons, the feed-in tariff threshold should be raised to above 5
MW. I agree with the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion that we should
be ambitious and raise it further, but the amendment would allow us to
raise it to apply to schemes of above 10 MW. That would give smaller
renewables projects a clear and certain route to market and enable us

was surprised to hear about that. I have a letter from 15 organisations
involved in the championing of community energy provision in this
country, including the Centre for Sustainable Energy, the Forum for the
Future, the National Trust, the Low Carbon Communities Network, the
Communities Carbon Action Alliance, the Co-operative, Co-operatives UK
and, indeed, the Co-operative party, which I represent in Parliament.
They all believe that the Energy Bill’s measures will make it
much more difficult to achieve the step change in the provision of
community energy that I hope we all want to
see.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_04_PT_1/733C0D8ABEAF9AAF2B487941693A4393B5FDEAAC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 June 2013">Tuesday

Barker:</Member></B> This has been a very thoughtful debate. I am sorry
that I have not been able to deliver everything that Members have
sought, but I think there has been an unusual degree of consensus on
the direction we are taking, our objectives and the Bill’s
overall
intent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001288">It
is clear that we need to do more on independent generators. I listened
carefully to the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead) and I
assure him that we are working to come up with an acceptable
proposition to address the real concerns of independents about the
barriers to markets they face, but in a proportionate way that makes
sense. The green power auction market, as has been said, is a means to
an end, not an end in itself, and we believe that we can navigate our
way to that destination in an effective, proportionate
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001289">On
community energy, a great deal unites us throughout the House. I have
been campaigning for it since 2006, so I am sympathetic to calls to
raise the feed-in tariff threshold. Now that we have reformed the
feed-in tariff scheme—in the teeth of the Opposition—we
can consider going further. The hon. Member for Corby (Andy Sawford)
should not infer from the fact that we are unable to support amendment
1 that we are in any way set against the proposal. We are actively
looking at it, but we need to think about the impact on all of the
technologies. As my hon. Friend the Member for Selby and Ainsty (Nigel
Adams) said, the Solar Trade Association is opposed to it. I was
slightly surprised by that, but if we consider just how big a 5 MW
solar array is, perhaps we will conclude that it makes sense. It is the
size, I think, of several football pitches, so 5 MW of solar is a
significant installation. Concerns about the potential siting of
inappropriate large-scale solar on greenfield prime agricultural land
before our sustainability criteria are in place, rather than on where
we want to see it, namely rooftops, brownfield sites, industrial sites,
factories, warehouses and supermarket car parks—basically,
integrated into the built environment wherever possible and certainly
on non-agricultural land—could present certain problems. We need
to think through the unintended 
<?notus-xml column=1469?>consequences that raising the tariff threshold would have. On the
surface it seems extremely desirable, but it will have further
impacts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001290">We
also need to think about how that relates to the renewables obligation.
In the short term—for the next few years, at least—the
alternative for community schemes will not be contracts for difference,
but renewables obligation certificates, which are now, finally, after a
series of improvements, being used and understood by the small player.
However, we believe that in the longer term, even for the smaller-scale
independent, contracts for difference will be a significant
improvement. We are determined to make them work for small-scale and
community players.</hs_Para>

Opposition Members take on board that the coalition has an
unprecedented commitment to rolling out a distributed model of
generation, and that the Government are taking steps to put that vision
into reality. I am sure the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion
(Caroline Lucas) is right that there is always more to do. We have not
finished yet—it will take two or probably three terms of
government to achieve our ambition—but in the Bill we have the
foundations of a new, exciting, dynamic, secure, low-cost and
low-carbon energy economy. I urge colleagues to support the
Government’s amendments and urge Opposition Members not to press
their amendments to a

market reform, which is at the centre of the Energy Bill, is the result
of four imperatives: the need to power the country; the need to protect
the planet; the need to insulate consumers from rising energy bills;
and the need to get the economy moving. With demand for electricity set
to increase, and around a fifth of our power plants set to close, we
will need to attract £110 billion of new investment in
electricity and grid infrastructure in this decade alone to ensure that
we have enough reliable capacity to meet demand. The Energy Bill will
do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001879" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001879">The
Climate Change Act 2008 commits the United Kingdom to an 80% reduction
in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, so we need specifically to
encourage investment in low-carbon energy generation: renewables,
carbon capture and storage, and nuclear. The Energy Bill will do that.
With global demand driving wholesale prices higher, and with that in
turn driving domestic energy bills higher, we need to create a more
diverse and competitive energy market to help to cushion consumers from
volatile fossil fuel prices. We also need to ensure that they are
getting the best deal from suppliers. The Energy Bill will do
that.</hs_Para>

to the need to invest in low-carbon energy infrastructure, we will
support economic recovery too. The trebling of support under the levy
control framework will mean £7.6 billion a year by 2020 to
support low-carbon technologies, including infrastructure projects that
are ready to go now, supporting jobs, supporting communities and
providing prosperity. Projects worth over £8 billion are already
in the planning pipeline. Electricity market reform could support as
many as 250,000 jobs in the energy sector. The Energy Bill will support
green growth. That is why I am pleased that the Bill, as strengthened
in Committee and on Report, benefits from a general level of
cross-party support in the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001881" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001881">I
want to reflect on some of the ways in which the Bill has been further
strengthened in this House. Let me start by dealing with the
decarbonisation target head on. No party in this House—not the
Liberal Democrats, not the Conservatives, not Labour, not the
nationalists, not even the Greens—had a commitment in its 2010
manifesto to set a 2030 decarbonisation target during this Parliament.
Nor has any other country yet set a power sector decarbonisation target
for 2030.</hs_Para>

understand the argument that an early decarbonisation target could
provide extra certainty for large, long-term projects in the UK power
sector, particularly in the supply chain. However, there is also logic
in the consistency of setting the decarbonisation target for 2030 at
the same time as the fifth carbon budget, which is scheduled for
2016—still 14 years ahead of the target date. By comparison, the
2020 renewables target was set in 2008, just 12 years from its target
date.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001883" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001883">If
anyone still doubts my commitment, or that of this Government, to
decarbonisation, they should consider the decision that we have just
made on the UK’s position for the EU’s 2030 greenhouse
gas target. In the context of winning an ambitious global climate
change treaty, we will be arguing for a 50% reduction target in the EU.
That is the most ambitious position of any member state, and I am proud
that this Government are leading the way on climate change
action.</hs_Para>

to other areas of the Bill—first, to contracts for difference.
Long-term electricity price stability will be provided through CFDs and
will be a key part of the new low-carbon electricity market. As such,
the Commons Committee quite rightly looked at the nature of the CFD
counterparty body and made a number of recommendations. In response,
the Government have clarified the Bill’s drafting to make the
policy intention more
explicit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001885" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001885"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Weir" PimsId="4556" UID="13060468003447" xid="626" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468003447">Mr
Weir:</Member></B> I am listening closely to the Secretary of State,
but does he not share my slight concern about the CFDs that, as the
Bill presumably leaves this House tonight to go to the other place, we
still do not know basic details such as the strike price? Although that
information has been promised on several occasions, we are now told
that the delivery document may be published next month. We do not seem
to be getting any nearer to getting this
information.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001886" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001886"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Davey" PimsId="2851" UID="13060468003448" xid="154" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468003448">Mr

the CFDs, the capacity market will ensure that sufficient reliable
generating capacity is available to meet electricity demand as it
increases over the next decade, but we are also looking at reining in
demand. We have added measures on electricity demand reduction that for
the first time can allow energy-saving projects to be able to compete
with power stations for new investment—negawatts. Delivering
through the capacity market can incentivise permanent reductions in
demand at times when electricity is most expensive, allowing for a more
direct trade-off between generation capacity and demand reduction. This
is a radical approach that has been shown to work in international
examples such as in forward capacity markets in the United States, and
it is a major advance for the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001888" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001888">We
acknowledge that many consumers are “feeling the pinch”,
and we remain committed to doing everything we can to help. Let me be
clear, however, that the main reason for rising energy bills is rising
wholesale gas prices, which make up around half a typical household
dual fuel bill. These prices are set on global markets and changes are
driven by global events. This Bill paves the way for increased UK
production of energy, which will help to reduce price rises from global
markets.</hs_Para>

providing a more stable pricing environment and helping consumers to
reduce their electricity demand, we introduced in Committee new
provisions on domestic tariffs to ensure that all households will be
able get the best deal for their gas and electricity. These provisions
will ensure that energy companies provide consumers with clear
information about their tariffs and put them on the cheapest tariff
that meets their preferences. These provisions will also ensure that
there are fewer and simpler tariffs so that it is easier for consumers
to shop around for the best deals across the market. Last year, Ofgem
estimated that there were approximately 900 open tariffs.
Under these proposals, each supplier will allowed to offer a customer a
maximum of four core tariffs for each fuel and meter type. We want to
see a competitive retail market, where suppliers have to work hard to
retain their existing customers and attract new customers.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060468001890" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001890">These
measures complement the new consumer redress measures already in the
Bill, which ensure fairer outcomes for consumers by giving a new
enforcement power to Ofgem. This power will enable Ofgem to require
energy companies that have breached regulatory requirements directly to
compensate consumers where they might otherwise not have done so. This
is another step forward for energy consumers.</hs_Para>

Opposition Members have raised questions about transparency and
accountability, and we have responded by amending the Bill

committed to encouraging a more diverse and competitive energy market,
and there are a number of related areas within the Bill that we will
hope to consider further in the other place. As indicated in Committee,
we will continue actively to consider raising the threshold for the
small-scale feed-in tariff scheme from 5 MW to 10 MW, and the
Government hope to respond to this issue in the other place. We are
taking backstop powers in the Bill to enable the Government to
intervene in the generating market, if needed, to improve liquidity and
competition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001893" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001893">I

energy. We now have the opportunity to deliver a lasting framework for
investment in the country’s energy infrastructure: delivering
green jobs and green growth, securing a low-carbon energy future, and

Secretary of State referred to the redress framework. We are
disappointed by the rejection of amendments that would have ensured
that consumers were compensated pound for pound and that compensation

consumers is not to provide a redress framework—much though we

they want is certainty. They should gain confidence from our support

purpose was to reform the electricity market to deliver secure, clean

decarbonisation. Its choice is to lock Britain into a high-cost,
high-carbon electricity supply for decades to come, but there is still
a clear majority in this House in support of decarbonisation. The
Labour party supports it, and the Scottish National party, Plaid Cymru
and the Green party all support it, too, and I thank colleagues from
other parties who joined us in the Lobby this afternoon. With a
Government majority of just 23, there is no doubt that if the Liberal

clear about what this Bill does and does not do. It does not set a

another, and we must listen to that advice. The truth is that even if
the Secretary of State decides to set a target, 2016 is the earliest
date at which it could be set, but it could be set at any later
date—2026, 2036, 2046—or not at all. There is also no

Majesty’s Opposition are absolutely committed to decarbonisation
of the power sector. The reasons for that are simple. First, the
biggest driver of soaring energy bills is rising global gas prices.
Cleaning up our power supply and investing in energy efficiency would
lead to lower, not higher, bills. Secondly, the best way of improving
our energy security is to take advantage of the natural energy sources
in our own country. This is the windiest country in Europe, and when it
comes to marine energy, Britain really can rule the waves, but
businesses will only invest, and bring jobs and growth to this country
if they see that the Government back decarbonisation. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Wansbeck said, we should give confidence to those who
wish to invest in carbon capture and storage and put us at the
forefront of clean coal. Thirdly, if we cannot decarbonise the power
sector, we will not be able to reduce the country’s carbon
footprint, and if we cannot do that, we will face a future of chaotic
weather, rising sea levels, flooded homes, failing harvests
and
drought.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060468001911" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060468001911">If
the other place is not able to rectify the omission of a
decarbonisation target from this Bill, we will do so in government. Our
determination to clean up the power supply is matched by our commitment
to reform the energy market and to make it work in the public interest.
So, on decarbonisation and fairer bills for consumers, we regret what

should draw confidence, however, from the fact that there is broad
cross-party support for many of the provisions in the Bill, and, on our
part, there is the political will to deliver a lasting framework to
bring forward investment in low-carbon electricity generation. On that
basis, we will not oppose the Bill on Third Reading, but it is to be
regretted that a dirty deal with the Liberal Democrats has once again
blocked the path to clean energy and all the benefits it could
bring.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_04_PT_1/744E6233B4161FC2081A28497D3FAF4CE77549ED" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 June 2013">Tuesday

bringing forward these measures, the Government have identified a
genuine problem whose consequences could be severe—indeed, the
lights could go out. Security of supply is imperilled
through the decommissioning of resources. The shortage of available
public funds requires that the private sector delivers, but
uncertainties and market conditions have created a blockage. Above all,
we need to keep a close eye on the price of energy, and this Bill has
proved to be an important opportunity to do that.</hs_Para>

that some of the measures in the Bill will contribute positively, but
the bigger issue remains an abiding concern that the cost to British
industry will be disproportionately high, and the price we pay will be
of even greater magnitude. I have seen nothing to indicate that the
Government have taken seriously the question of the costs from this
Bill to our economy and our businesses compared with our major
competitor economies.</hs_Para>

ask whether the true cost of the zealous attachment of Liberal
Democrats to renewable energy solutions, endorsed by and, sadly,
imposed from Europe, should be pursued seemingly at any price. A recent
report by Civitas articulated many of those concerns, saying that the
relentless drive to renewable energy is stifling innovation in the
sector and costing a fortune, with the risk of reversing the long-term
trend of improved living standards. It estimates that the cost to
households of the renewable energy fixation will be about £600
each year by 2020, with the economy bearing a cost of about £200
billion—more than £16 billion each year, which exceeds 1%
of our GDP. That is an enormous cost and a massive burden. The report
also demonstrates that we risk bearing a quarter of the target of the
EU renewables directive, as we plan to create the largest single
increase in renewables to achieve compliance. The renewables obligation
already costs us around £2 billion each year, a figure predicted
to rise to £8 billion to meet these targets. Taking that money
out of the economy will impede our growth, reduce prosperity and cost
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060484000011">Although
decarbonisation is a worthy ambition and a desirable destination over
time, fuelling subsidies for expensive and inefficient renewable energy
technologies risks taking us further from, not closer to, achieving
that ambition. The cost we pay in promoting the renewable energy sector
could prove damaging to the development of our own innovative response
to the challenge of decarbonisation. It could harm our prospects for
rapid and sustained economic recovery, and it could drive enterprise
away from this country. If decarbonisation is our goal, we should be
far more prepared to encourage innovation in a range of different
technologies and systems. This is not about whether we have a
decarbonisation target in the Bill; it is about approaching the issue
without the prejudice and the dogmas that have characterised the
Secretary of State’s rhetoric and approach in office—he
has been only moderately less rabid than his predecessor.</hs_Para>

challenge that we face is acute. The previous Government failed to do
what was necessary. The time to act has almost passed; it is possible
that even these measures may be too late to avert a harmful crisis.
However, my overwhelming anxiety is that this Bill is not the answer to
the energy questions we face, not least because of the impact that will
confront businesses in this country. I wonder whether, in approving
these measures, we are supporting good politics within the coalition
but at a far greater cost to our economy than we can either sustain or
afford.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13060484000521" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060484000521">6.32

Weir:</Member></B> I said at the outset that SNP Members did not oppose
this Bill on Second Reading and we will not oppose it tonight. We
recognise the need for electricity 
<?notus-xml column=1482?>market reform and support much in the Bill. I understand the
Minister’s point—I understand that contracts for
difference could well be a good way forward—but I remain
concerned about the lack of much of the detail, and I say that for two
reasons.</hs_Para>

I raised the issue of the closure of the renewables obligation system
in 2017 and whether that could have an impact on investment in the
meantime. Many companies that are considering investment are still
unsure about how the CFD system will work and are concerned about the
changeover. More thought should have been given to how the interim
period could be dealt with, perhaps by extending the RO system.
Regrettably, the Minister was not prepared to accept that.</hs_Para>

point about CFDs is that we still do not know what is being negotiated
between the Government and EDF in respect of Hinkley. Whether or not I
am anti-nuclear, that is important, because whatever those details are
they will inevitably become the template for future CFDs in the nuclear
industry. If the price is set too high and the contract is too long,
that could have huge implications for the public purse in the
future. None of those details are available. We are told
that they will be available in July, presumably when the House is in
recess, but we have no opportunity to look at these things, and that is
a shame.</hs_Para>

Shannon:</Member></B> On that subject, statistics
show that in the past year 24,000 people died from
cold-related causes. That was due in a big way to the
inability of the system to address people’s needs early. Does
the hon. Gentleman feel that it is not too late for the Government to
take that on board and that ensuring the early payment of such money at
a time when oil is cheap would be a good way
forward?</hs_Para>

Weir:</Member></B> That is an excellent way forward. The Minister of
State, Department of Energy and Climate Change, the right hon. Member
for Sevenoaks (Michael Fallon), has convened a round table on oil-fired
heating. The first meeting was held in May and I welcomed that. It was
a useful meeting and might perhaps be a way of dealing with that
industry, but we need small-scale help as electricity market reform is
not the only way of dealing with energy markets. Small-scale things can
be done that make a real difference and the Government must grasp some
of those issues, rather than simply considering massive measures such
as this Bill.</hs_Para>

decarbonisation target. We fully support it; I spoke in the debate on
it and gave the reasons why. If Governments north and south of the
border want a true, green, sustainable manufacturing base, a
decarbonisation target will give companies the assurance that will
allow them to invest for the future. It will enable them to be sure
that they have a market as they push towards it. 
<?notus-xml column=1483?>It could also provide a huge amount of sustainable, highly
skilled jobs. As I pointed out earlier, growth in the Scottish economy
has come largely from the energy industry and such development could be
a huge boost for the future, so it is unfortunate that we do not have
that target.</hs_Para>

support the Bill, I admit that I have some concerns. I am concerned
about the level of complexity we are starting to pile on to our energy
sector. Perhaps that is inevitable, as this is a highly complex policy
area, but I sometimes feel that unintended consequences lead to another
sticking plaster being put on, leading to more unintended consequences,
so that a highly complex system evolves. I do not necessarily blame the
DECC team for that, as this is a difficult and complex area, but I hope
that as the Secretary of State introduces the secondary legislation he
will bear in mind the need to try to minimise the complexity as much as
possible, in keeping with the aims of the Bill.</hs_Para>

sector still faces huge challenges. As for the oft-quoted figure of
£110 billion a year of infrastructure investment, I have seen a
lot of estimates that put the figure much higher. Some people grossly
underestimate the scale of change required in our energy sector,
particularly in the argument about decarbonisation. The year 2030 is
just 17 years away and at 10 minutes to 6 today, in real time, 40% of
our electricity was being provided by gas and 35% was being provided by
coal. That means that 75% of our electricity was being provided by gas
and coal. Gas heats 83% of our homes. We will have a substantial slice
of gas on the system for a long time, so we need to get on and start
exploratory drilling for shale gas once again, so that we can ensure
that the gas is provided from a domestic source. The Institute of
Directors has told us that shale gas production could provide up to
74,000 jobs, both directly and indirectly, and up to a third of peak
demand—and that is just the central scenario. We need to search
for shale gas, and to accept that gas will be on the system for a long
time to come.</hs_Para>

steadily to increase investment in renewables; I entirely accept that.
Sometimes people throw at me that I am anti-decarbonisation—we
have heard that from some Opposition Members—but I am not. We
need to move to a low-carbon future, not through a rash, uncosted 2030
decarbonisation target set this year, but through the nuts and bolts of

Lucas:</Member></B> I am sorry to sound a negative note, but to my mind
the Bill falls well short of what is needed. Ministers have had many
opportunities to improve the legislation for the sake of our economy

locking the UK into high-cost, high-carbon gas generation for decades
to come; that we listen to and act on scientific advice on the urgency

does not go far enough. There are some positive aspects; for example, I
welcome the emissions performance standard, but it is too weak, and it
opens the door to a new dash for gas. As a result, we have not seen the
last of people turning their backs on the politicians who listen to the
fossil fuel lobby rather than climate scientists, and people instead
taking action themselves in the name of what they see, and the science

vast subsidies to new nuclear power stations that we do not need. There

public subsidies to support it and no real public or parliamentary

investment away from faster, less costly, more jobs-rich and more
secure means of meeting electricity needs, including 
<?notus-xml column=1485?>through harnessing the UK’s huge renewable energy resource. The
enormous potential of energy efficiency and demand reduction is also
overlooked, with weak amendments from the Government convincing nobody.

struggling to pay ever higher energy bills. It reinforces the
centralised electricity system, in which people are just passive
consumers, constantly ripped off, whether or not they switch from
npower to EDF to E.ON, because essentially they are all the same.
Contrast that with a place such as Germany, where only 13% of the

smaller independent generators and community and co-operative energy
schemes fair access to the market, where people own and generate their
power on a serious scale and benefit from lower energy prices as a

Davies</B> (Montgomeryshire) (Con):</Member> I have sat in the Chamber
for more than six hours today and heard many interesting speeches. It
has been an extremely good debate. The Bill is important in many
respects. It is the responsibility of Government to ensure energy
availability, to ensure that energy is supplied at a reasonable cost
and to pay proper heed to the need for decarbonisation of the energy
generation
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0003.htm#13060484000036">Whether
or not one believes that man’s activities contribute to climate
change—I do not think they make that much difference—it
is perfectly reasonable to want to pursue a decarbonisation approach as
a sort of insurance policy, so people will tend to agree with the
general approach that the Government are taking. There is also general
support for renewable energy projects, and there is a huge number of
good projects all over the country. I opened a biomass project in my
constituency run by a firm called Egnisco. If anybody is going to the
National Eisteddfod in Wales in 2015, I recommend that they go to the
farm buildings at Mathrafal where they will see a superb scheme. The
buildings have been converted into factories and have all been heated
by a biomass project that is taking timber from local woodlands. It is
a wonderful
project.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000037">To
me it is important that the Government pursue their objectives in a
reasonable way. There are two aspects that cause me and my constituents
great concern. 
<?notus-xml column=1486?>One is the attitude that we have to the local population. We have heard
the words about localism in the Chamber, but I am more interested in
the deeds. I can say that, right across the constituency, my
constituents do not believe that the Government care one jot for what
they think and what they say.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060484000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000038">Today the
largest public inquiry into wind farms opened in Welshpool in my
constituency. It is likely to take 12 months. The small rural local
council has had to set aside £2.8 million just to defend the
decisions that it took. This will have a huge effect on local services,
but nobody cares. When the Welsh Government were asked whether there
was any way they could help the council, they said, “You knew
what was going to happen and you turned down the application.” I
thought that was utterly disgraceful. They were going to suspend their
entire planning responsibilities to avoid the costs of defending their
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000039">Another
aspect is the public inquiry itself. My constituents are deeply
concerned that it is dealing just with the wind farms and not with the
transmission line to them. It is like dealing with houses without any
roads to them. Some £50,000 was spent trying to change the
position, and people believe that DECC had some involvement with the
inspector when the council’s decision was rejected. I do not
know whether that is true, but I wrote to the Minister several weeks
ago and have not yet had a reply to reassure my constituents that that
did not take
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000040">A
further issue that causes me shock and disgust is how National Grid has
behaved and is behaving. The project that I am talking about is a very
big project in my constituency; it involves about 500 wind turbines and
100 miles of cable, 50 km of which are on 150-foot high steel pillars.
Not surprisingly, landowners have not been keen to co-operate with
National Grid and to allow it on their land, so National Grid sent in
the heavies. In truth, it has sent in thugs.</hs_Para>

e-mail here that I only wish I could read out, because it is so
shocking. It comes from Councillor Gwilym Thomas, a recently elected
county councillor for an area affected. I can just refer to one or two
points that he makes. He is a man of unquestionable integrity and he
begins by saying that he was visited by two gentleman who approached
the door with envelopes, and said, “Mr Thomas, I have these for
you.” They looked threatening and he asked them for some ID.
They said they did not have it and would get it from their van and come
back. Some time later they came back but he was on the telephone and
his daughter answered the door. She clearly saw a threatening
individual. The daughter and Councillor Thomas’s wife retreated
to the kitchen. He went to speak to the man and they finished up nose
to nose with the man shouting at him, “Take these, Mr
Thomas,” and he threw them out and walked away. Mr. Thomas
walked after him, and as he walked away the man shouted,
“Goodbye, Mr Thomas,” 10 times, in a shockingly
intimidating
manner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000042">It
gets worse. Later that day Councillor Thomas called at a property that
he owns. There were two vans blocking the gate so he tooted the horn to
go in, and he found that it was the same people employed by National
Grid to enforce its policy. During the conversation, they used the
f-word at least three times, an example of gross profanity. Councillor
Thomas rang National Grid to 
<?notus-xml column=1487?>tell it, but it seemed not to care. It talked about them being process
servers, not bailiffs. This is shocking
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000043">Another

listening carefully to what the hon. Gentleman is saying, which is
clearly heartfelt, and I have given him much more latitude because of
the seriousness of the matter that he raises. But this is the Third
Reading of the Energy Bill, and what he says must relate to that, or he
might want to find another way to raise what are very important
matters. He may continue with his points, but he should either make
them relevant to today’s debate or perhaps stake a claim for a

country’s future, but we will not have anyone’s support

thought it right to put in the public domain what is happening in our

Christopher Chope</B> (Christchurch) (Con):</Member> The Bill fails to
meet four essential tests. First, will this Bill help to reduce energy
costs for consumers? At the moment, energy costs for consumers are
projected to rise at the rate of about 8% above inflation for the
foreseeable future, and the Bill does nothing to address that. In fact,
it makes it worse for
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000048">Secondly,
will the Bill make UK plc more competitive in international markets?
The resounding answer to that question is no, it will not.
Indeed, we have already driven a lot of our manufacturing
capacity overseas and the Government recently had to include in the
Finance Bill a sticking plaster to try to prevent the potteries from
closing down completely. That demonstrates that firms that are not
perhaps involved in the potteries will suffer as a result of more lack
of competitiveness being
generated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000049">Thirdly,
will the Bill prevent our countryside and coastal heritage from being
despoiled by wind turbines, such as those proposed for Christchurch
bay? It will definitely not do that. Indeed, because it is encouraging
the subsidy junkies to come to this country and feed off our
taxpayers’ money, it will make life even
worse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000050">Finally,
does the Bill address any of the perverse consequences that have flowed
from the Climate Change Act 2008? The answer is that it does not. Five
of us voted against the Third Reading of that legislation, and a lot
more colleagues wish that they had also been able to register their
opposition to it in the Division Lobby. That is why I hope that
tonight, although there is this grotesque cross-party consensus about a
lot of this legislation, it will be possible for individual Members to
put on record their own views as to whether the Bill should go on to
the statute book.</hs_Para>

Percy:</Member></B> I was not intending to speak, but
I have been moved to do so by the speech made by the hon. Member for
Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), who attempted to present those of
us who oppose the decarbonisation target as in some way anti-renewable.
I voted against the target not because I am anti-renewable but because
I am concerned about the bills paid by those who sent me to this place

constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000052">In
the Humber, we hope to benefit from significant investment by Siemens
and others in offshore wind. We all stand behind and support that, if
for no other reason than it is a job creation scheme. I hope we will
see British employers such as Tata—I got things slightly wrong
earlier in calling it a British company—benefiting from that. We
want that development and those jobs to come to the Humber. However,
the attempt to paint those of us who have opposed the decarbonisation

all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000053">Many
of my constituents work in the coal and gas sectors. A large number
work in coal and gas generation and some even work in coal mining. I
think about their jobs and rights when we debate our energy market. It
is not yet clear how the decarbonisation target would be hit or how
carbon capture and storage technology could contribute to it. In my
side of the constituency, at Drax, a lot of money is going into trying
to develop clean coal technology. We want that to be a success. Perhaps

Heaton-Harris</B> (Daventry) (Con):</Member> The times being what they
are, I feel I should declare an interest at the very start: I have
always wanted to be popular. Some would say that being a Conservative
Member of Parliament is not exactly the best way of going about that.
If we add the fact that I am an active and qualified football referee,
one could think that I have chosen what we might call a
“challenging path” to that popularity. I took my
referees’ course at the age of 12 and qualified shortly
afterwards, which I believe means I have just finished my 33rd season
as the man in the middle. I have been a member of the Referees
Association for all of that time. I should also declare a financial
interest. For each game I officiate I receive a fee. I have tried to
register it, but the relevant authorities got bored after a while and
told me to stop wasting their time.</hs_Para>

admit that I love the game. Like anyone who volunteers, coaches or
officiates any sport, I am passionate about the sport I practise every
week. One has to be passionate to go out there in most weathers doing
one of the least popular jobs in the country week in, week out. I have
officiated at all types of games in the UK and abroad at amateur and
semi-professional level. I have been very lucky not to have personally
experienced what too many referees have experienced: I have not been
assaulted while officiating a game of
football.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000485">Every
ref I know looks forward to his or her next fixture. While we get paid
a small amount, we do not referee for the match fee. We receive good
in-service training from the Football Association and the Referees
Association, and we go out to do the best job we possibly can in every
game. Occasionally—I know this will be hard for Members to
comprehend—match officials do make the odd mistake. The vast
majority of times, however, we get the decision right. Alas, on some
occasions—Members may have seen some well-publicised
examples—players do not like the decisions we make. Referees
have to deal with that by using common sense.</hs_Para>

challenging situations by using common sense, people management skills

their supporters might not like some decisions, everyone just gets on
with the game. Sometimes they do not, however. Recorded assaults on
referees are thankfully few and far between. The number of physical
contacts against officials has fallen quite dramatically by 21% since

the past year, the number of cautions has fallen: all cautions fell
10%; dissent cautions fell 13%; dismissals fell 13%; and in general all
misconduct on the football pitch fell 9%. Some put this gradual
improvement down to the Football Association’s respect agenda,
and I would tend to agree, but whatever the reason, it is obviously to
be welcomed. I still find it astonishing, however, that in the last
year for which full records are available 528 referees—more than
10 a week—were assaulted during a

in these cases, the Referees Association and the FA step in, the first
helping the assaulted and the county FA offering some punishment
post-disciplinary hearing. There were concerns that county FAs were
being too lenient in the punishments handed out, so several changes
were made to the appeals process. Now anyone, not just the person
subject to the violation, can appeal a decision and ask the FA to
review the case. For the police to take action, referees must report
incidents to the police themselves. The FA recommends that they do this
but cannot intervene or compel an official to do so. If criminal action
is taken in a case of assault or physical contact on a referee, the
player in question is automatically suspended pending the outcome of
the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000493" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000493">The
purpose of this debate is singular: to ask the Minister for his help.
Referees up and down the country are becoming more and more concerned
that neither the police nor the Crown Prosecution Service is following
through with the investigation of assaults, believing that footballing

punishment. It would be fantastic, therefore, if he could help. The FA

Heaton-Harris:</Member></B> That is true, actually. The Referees
Association offers insurance to referees, so if someone joins
it—not all referees do, but most do—it will help and
guide them down that route. If, though, there is a physical assault on
a football pitch, it should first be a matter for the police, but if
they choose not to act, perhaps there could be this second way of doing
it.</hs_Para>

the subject on which I would like the Minister’s help, the FA
would appreciate automatic feedback from the courts on football cases
to ensure 
<?notus-xml column=1495?>that any criminal cases involving footballers are also subject to
football disciplinary hearings. A simple communication would suffice to
ensure that if a banned player tried to play for a different football
club, they would not be allowed to. Furthermore, assaulting a referee
should automatically mean a formal interview by the police. It has been
suggested that sometimes the police only log details and do not
formally charge a player with assault, saying that it is a footballing
matter. Any player who assaults a referee should be formally
interviewed by the police as a matter of course, and witness statements
could be taken to prepare for appropriate action. A simple interview
after an assault would also act as a strong
deterrent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000497" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000497">In

referees would like the police to be more willing to charge those who
assault match officials, rather than leaving the issue to be dealt with
in-house by local county football associations. Police action is a far
greater deterrent and would ensure that referees felt more supported,
thus helping to retain the number of referees we need in our
game.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000501" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000501">I
said earlier that I had been lucky. I have not been physically
assaulted while officiating, although I once had to go to the police
because of what I perceived to be a very real threat made against me.
However, I had a horrible experience once when I gave a penalty and the
manager of the team, who thought he was a bit like Alex Ferguson, did
not like my decision. Unlike Alex Ferguson, he decided to charge on to
the pitch. Fortunately, one of his own players rugby-tackled him,
inches away from me on my blind side before he got to me. As I did not
really know that he was coming at me, who knows what could have
happened? That happened on what I chose as my last ever game of Sunday
morning
football.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000502" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000502">Others
have not been so lucky. Anyone who goes to a referees’ society
meeting and talks to those present will hear some horrific tales. In
2011, a Coventry referee was assaulted at a match that took place on
Sowe common on a Sunday morning. He was taken to hospital by ambulance
and needed stitches inside his mouth and other things. Two police cars
attended with four officers. Two of the officers went and spoke to the
assailant, but decided not to arrest him and walked off the pitch
saying that the football authorities would deal with the
incident.</hs_Para>

Manchester, an individual walked out of court with a suspended jail
sentence and community service for a cowardly assault on a referee. The
referee 
<?notus-xml column=1496?>had sent the player off for aggressive behaviour and swearing during a
Manchester amateur Sunday football league match. As he recorded the red
card in his notebook, the player ran towards him, jumped with both feet
off the ground and kicked him in the face—a karate kick of some
kind. The referee needed a number of stitches around his eye and was
left scarred for life. Doctors told him that he was lucky not to have
been blinded. The player was eventually charged and pleaded guilty at a
Manchester Crown court to the charge of assault occasioning actual
bodily harm. The judge did not give him a custodial sentence—he
said he had escaped “by a whisker”—but suspended a
10-month jail sentence for two years. The player was also ordered to
carry out 100 hours’ unpaid work and pay the referee £750
compensation. However, if that had happened on a Saturday night in any
town or city across the country, the result would have been very
different.</hs_Para>

across the country are concerned that assaults of this nature are not
always taken seriously by the authorities. We are seriously worried
about that, because we know of recent examples elsewhere, such as the
case of Richard Nieuwenhuizen in the Netherlands, who was killed in
December 2012 as he officiated a game of football in Holland, or, just
last month, that of Ricardo Portillo in the United States. In both
cases, the assault of an official resulted in their death. I am not
saying to the Minister that he must act now or this could happen here,
but I would like assurances from him that, after this debate, he will
send the appropriate message, as strongly as he can, that officials of
all sports across the country can pack their kits for this weekend,
comforted in the knowledge not just that they are appreciated, but that
there is an extra deterrent that will stop those who use violence to
show their disappointment at a decision that the ref has just
made.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13060484000528" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000528">7.29

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Jeremy
Wright):</Member></B> Before I begin, I would like to congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Daventry (Chris Heaton-Harris) on securing
the debate and on raising the important issue of how we deal with
violence in sporting events. As he says, it is an issue that we need to
take seriously, and we will. Such violence can be damaging not just for
the individuals directly concerned but for all those who enjoy sport.
They should be able to continue to do so in safety and in an atmosphere
where the rules of justice and fair play are accepted and upheld. The
respect that we show for the rules of a game such as football very much
reflects our respect for others, for society and for the rule of
law.</hs_Para>

Friend has made clear, football is one sport that has seen particular
examples of violence on and off the pitch. Such violence sets a
damaging example to young and possibly impressionable fans. We know of
cases in which fans have been tempted to emulate the behaviour they see
on the pitch. We must therefore make absolutely sure that we have the
means available to prevent such violence where possible, and to punish
it effectively if it does
occur.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000507" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000507">Looking
at the cases that my hon. Friend has detailed, I can entirely share his
concerns. I understand the frustrations felt by all the victims who do
not feel that justice has been done. It seems that we have three fronts
on which we should be tackling this issue. First, each
sport’s 
<?notus-xml column=1497?>governing body—in the case of football, the individual
clubs—needs to deal with the incident to ensure that future
events are not disrupted. They can and should discipline players and
fans when enthusiasm spills over into violence and aggression. It is
not clear from the cases that we have heard about whether clubs or the
Football Association have always used the full extent of their powers,
but my hon. Friend will appreciate that that would be a matter for my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000508" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000508">Secondly,
the criminal justice system has a role to play. My hon. Friend has
rightly asked me and my Department to concentrate on the issue of
effective sentencing, particularly for violence against referees. From
that perspective, we would not want to see offences, sentences or
procedures that applied only to football referees. The law must be seen
to apply equally and consistently to everyone, and we would therefore
need at least to deal with violence at all sporting events. We already
have adequate offences, sentences and procedures in place that apply
across the board, and ample guidance to help to ensure that they are
applied consistently. With that in mind, let me first explain the
offences available.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060484000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000509">There is a
range of offences that the police and the Crown Prosecution Service can
use in the case of a violent incident of any kind, including when the
violence occurs in a sporting context. These range from common assault
through to actual bodily harm and to grievous bodily harm, and
ultimately to manslaughter and murder. The penalties available range
from a maximum of six months imprisonment for common assault to a
maximum of life for wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.
The police and the CPS have a full spectrum of offences that can be
charged, and severe maximum penalties are available for those
convicted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000510" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000510">Within
those sentencing powers, it is for the courts to decide what the
penalty should be in individual cases. The courts have the full facts
of the case before them, and they can make an informed judgment about
the overall seriousness of the incident. Sentencers are trained and
experienced in arriving at appropriate penalties, and it would be wrong
for any of us, particularly Ministers, to try to substitute our
judgment for that of the court. I will not therefore comment on the
individual cases that my hon. Friend has raised; instead, I will
concentrate on how the courts arrive at their
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000511" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000511">The
courts have guidance in the form of guidelines issued by the
independent Sentencing Council. Courts are obliged to follow the
guidelines or to explain why, exceptionally, they are departing from
them. The guidelines are therefore rather stronger than the term
“guidelines” 
<?notus-xml column=1498?>might suggest. There are guidelines covering the general seriousness of
an offence, and specific guidelines on offences of assault, and they
can be found on the Sentencing Council’s website. As with
offences, I do not think that it would be helpful to have specific
guidelines that applied only to football referees, or even to sport in
general. They must apply across the
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000512" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000512">The
guidelines help to determine the seriousness of the offence by
reference to the harm that the offence has caused, and to the
culpability of the offender. Those factors can mitigate or aggravate
the potential sentence. For example, in the case of assault, factors
given in the guidelines as increasing the seriousness include the
location and timing of the offence, and the community impact. General
guidelines on the seriousness of any offence also include aggravating
factors such as whether the victim is serving the public. That might
arguably include functions such as refereeing a football match, as my
hon. Friend does on a regular
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000513" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000513">People
often ask, not just in this context, why the maximum possible penalties
for offences are not imposed more often. Sentences must be
proportionate to the offending behaviour, and the guidelines help to
ensure that the courts sentence in a proportionate and consistent way.
The maximum penalty is set to deal with the worst possible case for
each offence. The maximum is, therefore, rightly rarely used. Violence
and threats towards match officials may be regarded as an aggravating
factor, but should be looked at in isolation as meriting the most
serious possible penalty. It needs to be seen alongside all the other
aggravating and mitigating factors in a
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000514" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000514">The
third strand that emerges from the cases we have heard about this
evening is how the police react in cases of violence against officials.
That, I have to say, is partly a matter for my right hon. Friend the
Home Secretary, but it is largely, as my hon. Friend will understand,
an operational matter for the police. I understand entirely what he
says about the need to send the clearest possible message to the police
about taking these matters seriously. We need to work with officers to
ensure that they have guidance and training about cases involving match
officials, so that those cases are treated in a way that properly
reflects the harm such cases can
cause.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000515" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000515">I
am afraid to say to my hon. Friend that there is no magic solution to
the problem that he has rightly highlighted. I think he recognises
that. I accept that we need to work together to raise awareness and to
ensure that the system we have works better. We need to ensure that we

will not be
tolerated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060484000516" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/debtext/130604-0004.htm#13060484000516"><I>Question

opportunity in engineering at the moment is for young girls and young
ladies? It is a job not only for young men, but for ladies and girls.
There has been an example of that in Northern Ireland, with more young
girls—and young people—being involved and wanting to do

and guidance is crucial to helping young people make the right choices,
and it draws attention to the perverse incentives in the current system
that allow new schools to be established even where there is an
over-supply of places, which is madness. As it points out, that

information, advice and guidance and the lack of over-riding priority
given to teaching those essential employability skills. Why do the
Government not rectify that by giving the resource, capacity and
capability to LEPs to make the improvements that are badly needed to
ensure that the education service delivers what local employers need
both now and into the future? That is a way to deliver through City

happen. Why not go further and let LEPs commission Ofsted to do

can we do to change that situation? First, we must transform the
reputation of skills and apprenticeships, which will require a sea
change in our culture. Secondly, we must transform our vocational
infrastructure. Thirdly, if—as I have argued—vocational
education is about social justice, we need to ensure that resources are
directed at the most disadvantaged. That means not only providing the
ladders of opportunity, which the hon. Member for Scunthorpe mentioned,
for those who want to get on,

far too long we have talked about university, which has led to
vocational education falling into neglect. Vocational education came to
be seen as a second-class option, only suitable for those who did not
want to do A-levels, rather than being seen—as it should
be—as equal to university. If we are serious about tackling
youth unemployment, we must ensure there is a parity of esteem between
vocational education and traditional
academia.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000047">That
is why I have been calling, since I have been in this House, for the
introduction of a royal society for apprenticeships, which would work
in a similar way to the Royal College of Surgeons and other such
bodies. A royal society would dramatically increase the prestige and
culture of apprenticeships, marking a sea change in how apprenticeships

also need to expand the range of jobs that vocational education can
offer. Traditionally, people have assumed that if someone does an
apprenticeship that means they must become a builder or a plumber. That
assumption is wrong, which is why I took on Parliament’s first
apprentice three years ago. I am now on my third, Aaron Farrell, who
works in my office four days a week as well as studying for a level 3
apprenticeship in business administration. This experience has been
good for Aaron and for my office, and I am pleased that other Members
are beginning to do the same. Also, I pay tribute to the senior Clerk
of the House of Commons for establishing the Clerk’s apprentices
scheme. It is invaluable for a profession that is often seen as being
closed off to those who are from a disadvantaged
background<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T09:54:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000049">We
also need to make teachers aware of the benefits of apprenticeships.
Edge has already been mentioned and according to that organisation two
thirds of teachers regard their knowledge of apprenticeships as poor,
and just one in four teachers recommend apprenticeships over higher
education. Sadly, 23% of A-level pupils still say their school is far
more concerned with “sending students to university”.
That contrasts sharply with parents’ wishes. A clear majority of
parents—78%—would support their child if they chose to
take the vocational qualification
route<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T09:55:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Research
from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills shows that
people who 
<?notus-xml column=134?>have a higher apprenticeship are 25% more employable than university
graduates and that on average those with an apprenticeship
qualification earn over £100,000 more throughout their lifetime
than other employees.</hs_Para>

am glad that the Government are taking steps to address the problem of
prestige and I welcome the technical baccalaureate, according to which
vocational courses should have the same rigour and prestige as
A-Levels. However, we must go further. We need to encourage teachers to
find out more about the benefits of apprenticeships and to promote
those benefits directly to young people and their parents.</hs_Para>

can be done in simple but effective ways. For example, Harlow college,
which I must remind the House is the No. 1 college in England according
to the Department for Education, has a fantastic record of offering
vocational education for young people and it recently held a very
successful apprenticeship fair. Consequently, young people can make
well-informed choices and apprenticeships can get the fair hearing that
they deserve. A royal society for apprenticeships would offer rewards
to apprentices in the same way that university students get graduation

this process is not all about changing the reputation of
apprenticeships. We also need to provide the infrastructure to make it
easier for businesses to take on people to gain vocational skills. To
be fair to the Government, they have made good progress on that. I
disagree with the hon. Member for Scunthorpe, who believes that the
Government are only interested in academia. The Government have shown
that they support vocational education by investing £1.5 billion
in the sector in this financial year. As we know, since 2010 the number

understand it the school leaving age has been extended to 18 anyway,
which was something 
<?notus-xml column=135?>the last Government did. Given that, I think that if we change the
culture in our country, schools will encourage their pupils to take
vocational education over university. As I say, we need to change the
culture and emphasise to pupils that the vocational qualifications that
they will be encouraged to consider will be as prestigious as taking
university degrees. On that basis, we should not forget that in this
Parliament the Government are setting up 24 university technical
colleges—in essence, pre-apprentice schools—and I am
incredibly proud that Harlow is getting one, which will open next year.
However, we must not settle; we should be aiming to set up at least a
hundred such colleges.</hs_Para>

should also be encouraging employers to take on more apprentices. One
major hurdle that employers face is the lack of basic literacy and
numeracy skills among young people, and we must look at that issue.
Recent figures show that 17% of 16 to 19- year-olds are functionally
illiterate and that 22% of them are innumerate. It is essential that
apprenticeships place a greater emphasis on these basic skills, so that
young people are ready to join the work

a<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T09:59:41"></hs_TimeCode> country we
must create the right climate to encourage businesses to hire

apprenticeship grant for employers, which gives employers who employ
fewer than 1,000 people a grant worth £1,500. It is currently
available to employers until 31 December 2013. We will know that the
grant is successful if it boosts the uptake of apprenticeship
programmes. A new charity called Access is encouraging young people,

this before, that I believe that all Departments should replicate the
Department for Work and Pensions’ new model procurement

disadvantaged backgrounds. For example, young people at further
education colleges are not entitled to free school meals, even if they
meet the criteria for them, whereas their peers at sixth form do
receive them. The civil servants have said to Ministers that it is too
expensive and that schools do not get direct funding for it, even
though they are required to provide it by law. The Association of
Colleges estimates the cost of extending the right to free meals to
college students at around £38 million. I believe
that this money can be found through efficiencies. If we are to support

The terms of the bursary must also be looked at. It should not operate
in a similar way to the House of Lords, where you get paid just for

the beginning of my speech, I said that improving apprenticeships is

In 2012, youth unemployment cost the Treasury £4.8 billion. That

According to a study by the Association of Chief Executives of
Voluntary Organisations and the 
<?notus-xml column=137?>University of Bristol, the net present value of the cost to the
Treasury, even looking only a decade ahead, is approximately £28
billion. So it is essential that in these tough economic times we take
action quickly. But we must not forget that this is about social
justice. Young people are our best defence against poverty. If we give
them opportunities, skills and training, we get them off the street,
give them stability and a real chance of a job in the future. The
Government, in many ways, are taking the right decisions, but we must
go further and faster. We need a conveyor belt of apprentices changing

Apprenticeships are a valuable way to give young
people skills, training and jobs. They also offer on-the-job learning
opportunities 
<?notus-xml column=139?>and, of course, further education. They enable young people not only to
learn about their chosen trade or profession, but to do so on
the spot. They also enable them to talk to
colleagues who are already skilled and experienced. Apprenticeships and
vocational education can offer so much, and there is no reason why they
should not be expanded to cover a wide variety of jobs and professions.
If that is to happen, however, we need to engage more of
Britain’s companies and to bring them on

is vocational qualification day. I declare an interest as the chairman
of the all-party group on further education, skills and lifelong
learning. I therefore take this issue very seriously, and I have a
profound commitment to it. There are many reasons why I passionately
support vocational education, FE colleges and, indeed, the whole
sector, but the most important is that the conversion rates from
apprenticeships to jobs run at about 90%. At my local FE college,
Sussex Downs, which is outstanding and has had a tremendous track
record over the past few years under the leadership of its principal,
Melanie Hunt, the apprenticeship conversion rate is an astonishing
92%.</hs_Para>

number of people who have left university with degrees and who are,
sadly, still struggling to secure employment come to see me in my

gone down the vocational route they would not have the student debt
that so many people are, sadly, lumbered with nowadays and they would
almost certainly be in employment.</hs_Para>

vocational education, the FE sector plays an absolutely pivotal role.
There are several reasons for that. One is that the better FE and
vocational colleges 
<?notus-xml column=140?>develop close relationships with local employers, local alternative
training providers and the local DWP—the Jobcentre Plus. In
Eastbourne, Sussex Downs college, where I will attend an apprenticeship
event this evening before returning to Westminster tonight, is pursuing
yet another initiative in a particular area of employment—in
this case, retail. The college has spent a lot of time over the past
year or two developing and deepening its relationships with different
employer sectors and with Jobcentre Plus. A good FE sector wants to
listen to employers; it talks to businesses and to the private and
public sectors to try to understand their needs, so that it can train
people in the vocational qualifications that fit the jobs—in
other words, so that it can help people to be job ready.</hs_Para>

difference.</hs_Para>

State for Business, Innovation and Skills, who is probably the most
passionate advocate of FE and vocational education we have ever had as
a Secretary of State. I spoke to him about the issue in the main
Chamber only yesterday, and he reminded me—not that he needed
to—of just how important he feels vocational education is in the
FE sector. He also reminded me of how important it is that colleagues
who feel strongly about this issue continue to lobby the Treasury, so
that it does not remove too much money from the Department.</hs_Para>

apprenticeships in Eastbourne, I was one of the first MPs, along with
the local FE sector, to work on the 100 apprenticeships in 100 days
initiative. It was essential that I developed a close relationship with
my local FE college, Sussex Downs. The work, which involved us and a
number of other partners, was very successful, and we achieved 181
apprentices in 100 days. More importantly, it allowed me and the FE
college to open a really strong dialogue with many local employers in
the private and public sectors. The success of that has been
astonishing. The latest figures from the Library show that Eastbourne
has recruited more than 2,100 new apprentices since the general
election—more than in the previous 10 years—which shows
than when things are done properly the result is tremendous
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:20:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000092">I
want to focus on something that came out of that: it brought home to me
how deskilled schools have become about pushing apprenticeships. I work
closely with local secondary school heads, and they were the first to
admit that because for so long—particularly under the previous
Government, but, to be fair, for at least 20 years—there was a
drive almost to push people into degrees, teachers had become deskilled
as far as talking about apprenticeships and did not know anything about
them. The system in the Department for Education and the school sector
provides no advantages in school league tables to push people towards
becoming apprentices. There are, however, advantages to A-levels and
sending students to university: doing so gets more money. If I were a
proactive head who wanted to educate my students towards the tremendous

DFE, because I think the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
would be keen for the careers service to be extended into FE. I do not
think the solution is to stop careers guidance going into schools. I

hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe was a long-serving principal of a
sixth form college and is better placed than many of us to comment on
the challenges that we face in creating an outstanding vocational
education system. He set out the issues with authority and passion, and
I pay tribute to his work at the Humber Skills Commission. Amazingly,
he did all that while restricted by the anaconda of the omertà
of the Whips Office, the perennial purdah that he suffers. Yet he still
pursues his case with passion and authority. Furthermore, like me he
represents an area that is on the front line of the Government’s
austerity assault. One hopes that he has benefited from the
recent  changes in the climate change levy, but the truth is
that for cities such as Stoke-on-Trent and places such as Scunthorpe,
at the sharp end of the historic process of deindustrialisation, the
profound brilliance of our local craftsmanship and artisanal skills has
not insulated us from some challenging economic conditions. We can have
brilliant craftsmanship while the situation for local skill levels is
particularly
challenging<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:28:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000100">Now
is not the time for a debate on the Government’s disastrous
economic policies and the damage they have done to the demand side of
the equation. We are gathered here today because we know that the
supply side of the employment debate matters too; that educational
attainment and skills capacity are a vital component of rebalancing our
economy to a more sustainable model. That much should be abundantly
clear to all. Yet it should also be clear, as hon. Members of all
parties have agreed, that we are nowhere near where we need to be on
skills. Indeed, our weakness was illustrated in a recent global survey
of over 1,300 chief executives by PricewaterhouseCoopers. That report
revealed that UK business leaders are the most concerned in the whole
of western Europe about the availability of key skills. Indeed, they
rated it as the greatest threat to their businesses’ growth and
three quarters of them said, rightly, that creating a highly skilled
work force should be the highest priority for Government in the year
ahead.</hs_Para>

nation economy that can compete in a globalised economy while raising
living standards right across the regions and nations of the United
Kingdom—we simply must have the best-skilled work force in the

disagree on the way the Government have pursued vocational education,
however. Since they came to power, the Government have undermined
careers guidance, which is a big issue for vocational routes. The
recent report on that by the Select Committee on Education 
<?notus-xml column=144?>was absolutely damning. The Government have scrapped work experience and

for Eastbourne suggested, genuinely gives no preference to either
route<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. On
vocational standards, that means having a clear line of sight both to
work and to advanced, further or higher education, which means creating
flexible and permeable pathways as a matter of importance. After all,
young people are rightly wary of narrowing their options, and the whole
ethos of a baccalaureate is to have a sense of
broadness<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
see the option of gaining a degree or a gold-standard vocational

creating a genuine dual-track system also relies heavily on a
deep-seated, collaborative ethos between institutions in delivering
education and training. The countries that have enjoyed success in
raising standards, such as Austria, Finland and Germany, all benefit
from a system that has not only great career guidance but clearly
defined roles for key stakeholders, with a great amount of time
divested to building and maintaining institutional
relationships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000111">If
there is another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:39:36"></hs_TimeCode>
criticism of the Government’s education policy, it is on whether

but are not necessarily providing the kind of collaborative ethos that
a local skills economy might
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:35:56"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
some way from the institutional culture that the Government seem intent
on inculcating with their slightly high-handed approach to the
expertise of teachers and professionals, the lack of business
involvement in delivering training and their focus on competition as
the only measure of improving performance. If we want a proper
industrial strategy, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:36:15"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of

we only have to look at the shambolic execution of the
Government’s careers guidance policy for a textbook display of
encouraging perverse institutional incentives. In a tough funding
climate, it will be a brave and outstanding school that advises its
pupils not to stay on. In a recent conference in Westminster, we saw a
very good example of that: a leading academy school that is 
<?notus-xml column=145?>part of a leading chain said that it had brought in outside careers
guidance, exactly as it should be doing, but that it told the person
coming in to give the careers guidance that they were not allowed to
advise pupils to go to the college up the road. With in-house careers
guidance, there is a producer interest in keeping kids along an easily
understandable gold-path academic route, as it were, of GCSEs, A-level
and university, rather than thinking far more creatively, which
requires trained professionals with knowledge of local
situations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:37:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000113">Perhaps
the biggest problem we face in delivering a vocational education system
for the future is the perverse and pervasive disconnect between the
education system and local labour markets. All too often, skills policy
is isolated from industrial and economic policy. That  is why
Labour’s technical baccalaureate would directly involve
businesses in accrediting the quality of courses, and it is also why
our tech bacc, unlike the Government’s tech bacc, would have a
work experience requirement. Businesses have told our taskforce, the
Husbands review, that that is absolutely crucial, which is why we would
ensure that all vocational teachers spend time every year with local
businesses and industry to keep their skills and experience
fresh<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000114">Those
three measures would bring to education and training institutions a
clear and realistic understanding of local labour markets. Closing the

course, raising educational standards in vocational training does not
mean that we weaken our focus on core subjects and on improving rigour.
In vocational or academic routes, there should be no false division
between theoretical knowledge in practical subjects. There is an
interesting discussion to be had on where the journey begins of opening
up pathways at 14 or 16. What have we learnt from the university
technical colleges on the 14-to-19 parameter, rather than up to 16? Was
the Wolf report 100% correct in saying that people should continue with
the same totality of focus up to
16<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T10:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000116">Fundamental
to the Labour party’s education policy is a clear commitment to
teaching English and maths  to 18, irrespective of route,
because although many further education teachers do an outstanding job,
often in challenging circumstances—we have heard about the
differences in funding and free school meals—we need to raise
teaching standards in FE colleges in English and maths. Of the 40% of
pupils who do not get a level 2 qualification at 16, only
20% go on to acquire one at 19 through the FE system. That needs to
change if we want to upskill our country. The Minister should once
again take his cue from Labour’s policy review, which is open
and available to him, and from our one nation skills
commission’s interim report, and commit to requiring all FE
teachers to have at least a level 2 qualification in English or
maths.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060450000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060450000117">There
are other problems with our system of vocational education, training
and skills. We have acute skills shortages in crucial sectors such as
engineering, too many young people who lack employment skills, low
levels of employer involvement and a lack of good-quality advice for
navigating the transition to work. Labour supports the proposals on

the Department for Education, the action taken to increase standards in
vocational education came first. Since the Wolf report, commissioned in

setting out what we are doing to achieve those goals, I will answer the
questions put. Satisfyingly, the questions put were already answered in
the draft of my speech, which is always good news. Professor Wolf found
in her report, commissioned in 2011, that as many as 350,000 students
were being funded to study for qualifications that they could pass but
that were too small or low-level to get them a job. We are changing the
requirements for qualifications to be funded and recognised, but we are
doing so alongside changing how we fund all education between the ages
of 16 and 19.</hs_Para>

September, funding will be on a per-student, not a per-qualification,

experience.</hs_Para>

return to the point about work experience, which is part of the study
programme. This will give schools, colleges and training providers the
flexibility to offer the most challenging qualifications to students
who want to excel, whether in a technical field, in practical,
employment-based training such as an apprenticeship or in an academic
field. The need to ensure that people have a choice to pursue technical
or vocational education, academic education or a combination of the two
is important, and the Government’s job is to provide excellent
options in all of those fields. I was delighted that Her Majesty said
in the Queen’s Speech that it should become typical for young
people to go either to university or into an apprenticeship. Our job is
to ensure that excellent options are available on both sides, and not
to have a target that falsely pushes people one way or the

vocational education is social justice. The change in the funding
system means that all students will be funded at the same base level,
once the transitional protections are past. Instead of the average
person who goes to an FE college being funded less than the average
person who stays on at sixth form, because of the different amounts of
funding awarded per qualification, everyone will be funded per pupil,
on the same basis, with factors allowing for location, background and

important point to make is about the participation age rising from 16

necessarily in school—it could be in college, in an
apprenticeship, in employment with training or in voluntary work with
part-time training. That is an important point because we do not want

therefore, we are launching a high-quality traineeship programme within

it, know what is relevant to them and can set and reach their goals.
Ofsted is inspecting against the new duty to provide independent and
impartial advice, so schools will be inspected for that. Crucially, the
new destination data will show not only how many people go to
university, but how many go into an apprenticeship or a job. The data
will better hold schools to account for the outcomes of the education

reasoning. Such symptoms occur when the brain is affected by certain
diseases, including Alzheimer’s, and by damage caused by a
series of transient ischaemic attacks, or mini-strokes as they are
known. A staggering 
<?notus-xml column=152?>21 million people in the UK are estimated to know someone with dementia,
and one in three people aged over 65 will have dementia by the time
they reach the end of their life. More than 86,000 people in the
north-west alone are currently diagnosed with the
condition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060451000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060451000008">National
Museums Liverpool has recognised that museums are experts at recording
and caring for people’s memories and treasures, whether they are
thousands of years old or within living memory. A net result of the
project has been the way in which the House of Memories project has
encouraged the medical profession to consider new approaches and
alternatives to established practices and therapies. We know that
health care and medicine are evolving, but in Liverpool we have found
that some of the components to assist patients’ well-being have
been under our nose all

new strategies is not easy, and the first phase of the project, which
was funded by the Department of Health in 2011, was designed in
consultation with Skills for Care, the Alzheimer’s Society and
the local voluntary sector. Together, the partners informed a
real-world training experience to connect the care sector with National
Museums Liverpool’s cultural resources. The House of Memories

the wider health sector but sustained that
engagement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060451000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060451000010">The
outgoing Liverpool primary care trust identified that the project met

expanding the project across southern regions. That demonstrates the
thoroughness of the model. Not only have National Museums
Liverpool’s staff dedicated much time and energy to ensuring
that the health and social care side of the model is catered for, but

current project was delivered in the Liverpool city region, Manchester

the project increased awareness and understanding of dementia, and

hope that I have demonstrated that in Liverpool we have begun the
process of changing the culture of how we view those living with

recognises the economic impact that such projects have on NHS finances.
Early intervention and targeted treatment that uses 
<?notus-xml column=153?>local resources have the potential to save the NHS millions of pounds.
Instead of dealing with the condition in its latter stages,
which is not only expensive but heartbreaking for
patients and carers, we should ensure that any prevention or delay in
its development is made a priority, and that those left to treat the
condition are afforded appropriate training to deal better with its

study: for instance, the museum of modern art in New York runs an
internationally acknowledged programme, where gallery staff engage with
individuals living with dementia and their partners and families in
conversations about modern art. However, the House of Memories project
is qualitatively different from MOMA’s programme. It provides
guidance for engaging people living with dementia and their carers in
the museum experience, supporting that with a toolkit and resources

of the great success stories has been National Museums

recognition. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T11:11:46"></hs_TimeCode>One
way that I and my fellow Merseyside MPs can ensure that the partnership

further support he can offer to the development of that capability. I
am sure that Members of all parties will recognise and appreciate the
innovative work of the staff at the Museum of Liverpool, and I should
like to take the opportunity to praise each and every one of them. It
should be noted that the Museum has also recorded an increase in visits
from care home staff and patients. Cultural partners, such as Riverside
housing, have taken inspiration from the training by developing
personalised, culturally sensitive memory boxes for the Chinese and
Afro-Caribbean communities, which exemplifies the social value of
greater dementia awareness for the whole of Merseyside.</hs_Para>

are not talking about brain surgery; the concept  is simple. I
went to the museum to look at one of the sessions, and because it was
in Liverpool, a lot of people were interested in football, of course,
and music and comedy. The memory box, therefore, has such things as
football programmes from Liverpool or Everton football clubs, ration
books, some old tunes and records, and old theatre
programmes, and those stimulate conversation with people. The long-term
memory of 
<?notus-xml column=154?>most sufferers is very good. Short-term recollection is a problem for
many, but those props really get people into conversations and act as a
prompt for all sorts of detailed discussions, and—it must be

reminiscences and dementia. I have had people from Everton come to the

am wholly supportive of the House of Memories. It is an exceptional
project that has been funded in part, as the hon. Gentleman
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T11:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>said, by the
Department of Health; more than £220,000 has been allocated
during the last two years. As we have heard today, National Museums
Liverpool provides an innovative training programme that is making a
real difference for social care staff by helping them to connect with
the people with dementia whom they support every day. They use the
objects that the hon. Gentleman referred to and the stories linked to
the museums’ collections. Museums across the country have a rich
collection of objects and art that can be so powerful in helping people
to live well with dementia. It is a very powerful partnership with care
providers. I think the hon. Gentleman said that 3,000 care workers had
already participated. That demonstrates the reach of this project. It
is fantastic that the cultural sector is involved in work on dementia;
it is a great collaboration. Getting the medical profession to consider
new and different approaches beyond pure medicine can be very powerful.

hon. Gentleman is right about the value of early intervention and the
savings that can be secured for the NHS in this way. My understanding

a funding application in at the moment for 2013-14. That is being
considered by the dementia work force advisory group. It could extend
the roll-out to museums and galleries in the midlands. I think the
decision on that will be communicated to National Museums Liverpool
over the summer. Obviously, I cannot pre-empt the outcome of that

the foundations for delivery but making progress across all three areas
of the challenge: first, improving health and care services for people

the spending review considerations imminent, when decisions will be

based on a paper I published last year called, “Developing a

online for anyone who wants to see the whole thing, at
www.TinyURL.com/scipol. I would like to place on record my thanks to
those who helped, particularly Michelle Brook, who was critically
involved in writing much of it. It was passed by the Liberal Democrat
conference and large elements of it are now Liberal Democrat
policy—things we want to achieve—but I do not want the
debate to become a party political session. We are all used to the
debates where we all say, “The last Government did this and this
Government did that”, and it does not take us any further. I
hope that the Minister, the hon. Lady and I, in particular, can work
together to support science, because science works across

also have a constituency interest, because high-technology is key to
the success of Cambridge. We now have more than 1,500 companies, 54,000
jobs and £12 billion in revenue from the hi-tech,
knowledge-based economy in Cambridge. The details of the companies are

up—ARM, a huge powerhouse, developing superconducting chips.
People often talk about Intel as its major competitor, but just last
year ARM shipped more chips that Intel has ever shipped. There are more
ARM chips in the world than there are human arms, legs and heads put
together. It is a huge company that comes from a small town in the
fens. RealVNC is a three-time Queen’s award winner for exports
in the past three years. Its software is a critical part of any shuttle
launch and has a huge number of applications elsewhere. We have
MedImmune, the biggest biotech company in Europe. Marshall Aerospace
and Defence Group works in a very different area, but does incredibly
important work for our armed forces and a range of others. There are

clean-tech.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060460000009">Cambridge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>
is a huge success story, which is one of the reasons why unemployment
there is so low—the rate is about 2.5%, and the youth
unemployment rate about 1.5%. We all have an interest in the success of
science and research, because they are key to the success of Britain as
a whole. How do we think we will earn our way in 2020, 2030 or 2050 if
not in the knowledge-based economy, based on things that we will learn
and develop now? They are already key sectors driving the economy and
that is set to continue, because the UK continues to punch above its
weight in scientific research. Although we only have roughly 1% of the
world’s population, we have a huge research base, with 4% of the
world’s researchers, an 11% share of world citations and 14% of
highly cited publications. We have a great platform to develop and grow
a successful knowledge-based economy to develop jobs and growth for

would like to explore three key areas: money; people; and attitude.
Research and development costs money, but not all of it public sector
money. UK spending on research and development dropped to just 1.76% of
gross domestic product in 2010—well below the European Union
average and, for the first time ever, less than China, not to mention
pretty much all our other global competitors. That hits the UK economy,
because we are less innovative. We are particularly behind in public
sector funding: 0.57% compared with Germany’s 0.85%, which gives
Germany a huge lead. We know that public money crowds in private
funding: the more we spend in this area, the more industry will also
commit. I know that it was a fight for the Minister and my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State to ensure that the ring-fenced science
budget was protected. It was not cut in the previous spending review,
which is a great achievement. There were many concerns. The £4.6
billion was protected, in cash terms, which was essential, but that
still equates to a real-terms cut and capital funding took a very large
cut. Capital is also essential to good science and research.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:36:50"></hs_TimeCode> huge cut in
capital has been ameliorated by a number of new announcements since
then, on which I 
<?notus-xml column=160?>congratulate the Minister. He has managed to pull £1.4 billion,
which I am sure he will itemise later, out of the Treasury to rebuild
some of that capital. He has £300 million to claw back from the
cuts to go, but I am sure he will come up with a way to deliver that
from the
Treasury.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060460000011">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>
are other good new things that I am pleased to see: the Catapult
centres, although I still have a reservation about the name; the
reintroduction of SMART awards, and I declare an interest as a holder
of a Department of Trade and Industry SMART award from a
number  of years ago; and the extension of R
and D tax credits. Those are all good things. We are in a
decent place at the moment; it is not as great as it might be, but it
is nothing like as bad as it could have been. We must not have more
cuts in the forthcoming spending review—that is one of the most
important messages in the short
term.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060460000012">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>
recently hosted an event with the Association of Medical Research
Charities to launch its vision for research. There was a clear message
from academics such as Sir Paul Nurse, the president of the Royal
Society; medical charities such as Cancer Research UK; and industry,
such as GlaxoSmithKline, that if we cut now, it would be a huge and
clear signal to business that they should not invest in Britain.
Companies are mobile. They will leave. Biotech and hi-tech companies
will just go somewhere else. They can do it, and if we send a message
that they are not wanted here, they will. Our academic base will
decline as good people leave the UK or simply leave research to do
something
else.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060460000013">Science
and Research is big business for the UK. The pharmaceutical
industry—a huge, global business—generates a trade
surplus for the UK of £5.5 billion. The industry is changing and
becoming more biotech focused. We have to keep the small biotech
companies here. When AstraZeneca closed their plant and decided to move
to Cambridge, it was a shame for the north-west, but it is fantastic
for Cambridge and for the country that it is staying in the UK. It or
any other company could choose to leave. Pfizer has a presence in
Cambridge, as does GlaxoSmithKline. We have the largest biotech
companies in Europe—but only for as long as we can provide them
with reasons to stay.</hs_Para>

the spending review, not cutting capital or revenue budgets is very
least that can be done. If we want to prosper, we must increase
investment—and it is an investment. A study by the Wellcome
Trust, the Medical Research Council and the Academy of Medical Sciences
found that every pound invested in medical research generates an
ongoing return of about 30p every single year, and 30% returns are
fantastically good. Jonathan Haskel of Imperial college business school
has estimated that a £1 billion cut in research council funding
results in a GDP loss of the order of £10 billion. That is the
sort of size we could be talking
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060460000015">To
provide certainty,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:40:10"></hs_TimeCode> investment
absolutely has to be long term. We must find a way of getting away from
the three-year cycles. Long-term investment was called for in the
“Fuelling prosperity” report, which came out recently
from the Royal Society, the British Academy, the Royal Academy of
Engineering and the Academy of Medical Sciences. They make the case for
investing in research in the long term, to drive UK economic growth.
Similarly, a letter from a range of medical charities,

proposal, which was made in the paper I talked about earlier and is now

ambitious, and that 15 years is a long time, but I think it is the
right thing to do and that it is something we could get together.

is not, however, just about having the money; the money must be
allocated well. It has to be allocated correctly between applied

is the blue skies area that needs to be remembered, because there is a
temptation to say, “Let’s just fund the things that are
closest to being applied—closest to being products.” That
would be a mistake, and it is one that industry warns us about time and
again. No one can predict where new ideas will go. When work started on
lasers, the world wide web, Google’s search algorithm and
monoclonal antibodies, no one knew where it would lead. No one could
have predicted their scale, but they are
huge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0001.htm#13060460000020">Probably<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:43:16"></hs_TimeCode>
the least well-known of those is monoclonal antibodies, and the
investment from the Medical Research Council in Cambridge’s
Laboratory of Molecular Biology, which has generated fantastic
world-leading research and many Nobel prizes, also led to a
multi-billion-dollar drug, Humira, the profits from which partly paid
for the new lab that was opened just a couple of weeks ago. A huge
amount of money can be made, but that is never known at the beginning.
The Medical Research Council has made £390 million from
monoclonal antibodies, but when the grant application was written there
was no way it could have been claimed that that would happen—Sir
Greg Winter would never have had that
chance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>. In
addition to the applied work, we must, therefore, fund excellent blue
skies research, for its own sake as well as for its potential returns,

from the science and research budget, we must also support innovation.

We also have money from the Government, and we get a lot from the
European Union as well. In this room, at least, we can be pleased to
take that money from the European Union and make the most of it.
Framework programme 7, which finishes this year, is estimated to have
delivered €7 billion to the UK for research. That is fantastic,
and the Government should encourage and support the UK in tapping into
Horizon 2020, the next framework for research and innovation, which has

setting up an EU research support fund to meet the costs. In that way,
we will encourage UK researchers to pull even more money from the

are other things that could happen. The £l80 million in the
biomedical catalyst fund has been very welcome, and I hope it will

constituency among others, and I hope there will be money to continue
that work. I am also very taken by some of the work developed by the
BioIndustry Association on having pots of money
available—similar to individual saving accounts—for
funding high-tech companies. That model works very successfully in
France, enabling people to invest smallish amounts—£5,000
to £10,000—in high-tech growth companies and to get some

should also make better use of the NHS. We are rare among countries in
having a wonderful national health service, and it is an excellent

can get involved, and a lot of information that can be used. Privacy is
obviously a huge concern and we must not do things that would
jeopardise it, but there is far more we could do to use that rare and
previous resource. I am pleased that we now have, as a result of the
Health and Social Care Act 2012, a duty to promote research in the NHS.
That is very helpful, and much more needs to be done with it. More
patients should be told about the trials that are available, and there

am also pleased that the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
continues to work with the Department of Health; that works very well.
What I would not want to see is all the Medical Research Council being
transferred into the Department of Health. There must be a separation
between the implementation—actually doing health care—and
the pure research that the MRC does. The council is not the same as the
National Institute for Health Research, and I hope we will not see such
a transition. I am sure the Minister can reassure us about that

have said a lot about money, partly because the spending review is
coming up, but it is not the only thing that matters. Just throwing
money at problems does not always work; people matter as well. The UK
has to build a highly skilled work force to be able to attract industry
and innovation to do the best research, and there are two ways of doing
that. One is to start with people here in the UK, at school. Schools
must be able to provide a more solid curriculum in STEM
subjects—science, technology, engineering and maths—and
have teachers who are specialists in their fields. That means primary
schools having some sort of science subject leader, and secondary
school teachers should have continuous professional development, funded
by the Government, to make sure they are on top of what they are
teaching<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T14:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>. I am

England, trains primary schoolteachers. On one of her training courses,
she asked them to come up with a curriculum for primary school, and
every single group left out science. When she asked why, they said,
“Well, it’s hard, dull and not very useful.” If
that is the attitude among primary schoolteachers—I hope they
were corrected—we will have a problem over forthcoming decades.
We have to change that attitude where it exists; of course, it is by no

those subjects. We are missing out on a huge number of people who could

not welcome here. The poor performance of the UK Border Agency, which
often took months to make decisions, has made matters far worse. When I

are many attitude issues that I could talk about in the time remaining.
We need to push further on the important issue of open access. It is
absolutely right in principle, and the Minister for Universities and
Science is right to push ahead with it. It reflects the change in how
publication works, with the transition of costs away from distribution,
because we can just look at pdfs, the cost of which is very low. Open
access is the right thing to do, and will open up information for many
more people and help businesses to set up, but more care is needed with
the transition, as is a bit more funding. It has to be made very clear,
particularly to some nervous academics, that there is no intention to
use open access as a way of banning the publication of good work. There
will be difficulties during that transition, but we must get there in

is the related issue of open data. I visited the Open Data Institute in
Shoreditch earlier today, and I have to say that I was seriously
impressed. It is doing some very impressive work. To give one example
of the power of open data, early on in its existence it did a study of
statins in which it looked at the data available from
prescriptions—anonymised data that did not identify any
individuals—and showed that if generics were prescribed instead
brand-label drugs, in cases in which there was no clinical need for the
branded drug, it could save £200 million across the NHS. That
study was doable because the data were open. There is a huge potential
there, of which that study is only the

classic case is clinical trials. GlaxoSmithKline has been excellent in
opening data on its historical and current clinical trials, for which I

cuts in the science budget. The Minister will accept the research by
the Library and the Campaign for Science and Engineering that shows the
14% real-terms cut in the science budget thus far and the impact that
that will have on our capacity to keep up with our competitors. Not
only was this flat cash settlement an actual cut, but the science
budget itself only represents about 50% of Government science spending.
As we all know, science spending has been hit in other ways, too. For
example, the scrapping of the regional development agencies, which
spent something like £440 million per annum on science-related

some of that money. As the hon. Member for
Cambridge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
pointed out, we all know that we are still some £300 million
short. The boldness of the decision to cut capital spending by 40% has
not been met by a boldness of action to put it back, despite the fact

One Government decision that I have the most difficulty with and that
we would seek to change if we were to form the next Government would be
the scrapping of Labour’s 10-year investment

As I have said, researchers and industry need a long-term vision, so
that they can plan over time. Although we had a 10-year spending cycle
when we were in Government, the Royal Society has called for a 15-year

He will not be shocked to hear that I am not going to give a spending
commitment for what a Labour Government would do in 2015. However, the
broader point is that long-termism is not just about the headline
amount given to science. Saying, “This is your deal for 10, or
maybe 15, years—off you go” is also important because it
encourages private sector investment; the private sector will know that
a Government are serious about science, and it will know what will
happen if they stay in power at the next election. That certainty
breeds greater investment, and it will offer a much better deal. I
cannot, of course, give the exact sums that we will allocate when we, I
hope, form the Government in 2015, but we will return to that theme as
we continue to debate these important issues.</hs_Para>

me move away from the size of the budget and the length of the spending

we often forget that when we are grappling with the overall sums and
how long they are allocated for. In particular, he raised a really
important point about women in science, which is something I have
picked up on since I took up the science bit of my brief. My

was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:12:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:12:00"></hs_TimeCode>

science and a woman who speaks up for science and scientific
issues.</hs_Para>

is clearly a problem: if we cannot ensure that we take forward the best
talent that we have and make the most of it, we are truly missing out
on something that should be a competitive advantage. Many in the
science community tell me that the problem is often less about getting
women into undergraduate science degree programmes and more about
retaining them once they have graduated, when they are trying to plot
their careers as researchers and academics and to combine their work
with family life and career breaks to have children. I have said a
number of times that the issue is not unique to the scientific
community; it is a problem across our society, and those of us in the
world of politics know only too well the difficulties that political
parties of all persuasions have in attracting female talent into
politics and in ensuring that women can progress to the very top in
much the same way as men. This is therefore a cross-sector, societal
issue, and it is important for the science community, too. In the few
months that I have had this brief, I am pleased that so many
people—not just women—have wanted to talk to me about
women in science and about how we can do more to attract and, equally
importantly, retain female talent in the science pool.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman made a broader point about inspiring our young people
and children into careers in science and about making science fun. One
of my best visits since becoming a Member of Parliament was the morning
I spent at the Big Bang science fair a few months ago. Tens of
thousands of children were part of the fair and experienced it. It was
incredible to see the energy in the Docklands arena, as those young
people were exposed to science and scientific ideas. One thing that
really struck me was a project that had been entered into one of the
many competitions being run at the fair. A group of young girls had
done a study of the science behind hair straightening. Some of the
women reading or listening to the debate will recognise that hair
straightening is a big industry, and it is certainly something a lot of
women grapple with—it might not affect the Minister or the hon.
Gentleman quite so much, but I know a lot about it. It was really
interesting that the young girls could take something that mattered to
them—they talked about the protective qualities of the different
serums that they can put on their hair to protect it from the intense
heat that they apply when they use a hair straightener—and
understand that there is a lot of science behind it. They were able to
study, understand and relate that to their own lives. That was a
powerful way to show them that science is all around them and that it
is not a scary, dry, arid, austere thing that only geeky boys do when
they are at school, but an exciting, challenging thing that they use
every day, often without realising
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:15:51"></hs_TimeCode>. Lots of good
work is therefore being done to make science fun for our young people,

sympathise greatly with the hon. Gentleman’s point about
specialist science teaching in our primary schools. The Campaign for
Science and Engineering has spoken to me a number of times about the
issue, which is part of a campaign that it is running. I am very
sympathetic to the hon. Gentleman’s suggestion, and I am
involved in discussions with the shadow education team about how we
might make it happen. However, I absolutely agree with the broad
principle, because we need people who understand science and who are
passionate about it to be there right from the beginning of the
educational journey that our young children make if we are to make sure
that they do not drop science as soon as they turn 14, when they have
to decide which options to take.</hs_Para>

When I was promoted to the position of shadow Higher Education
Minister, I had no idea that my previous experience as a shadow
Minister in the Home Office team would be quite so relevant, but
somebody will talk to me about the impact of the Government’s
immigration policies almost every week. The Minister and the Business
Secretary are very sympathetic regarding the problems that have been
visited on the higher education sector and the science community as a
result of the Government’s immigration 
<?notus-xml column=171?>policy, and I suspect that we are often on the same side when we talk
about the fact that the impact has been negative
and that we need to change things. Unfortunately, to date, we have been
unable to persuade the Home Office and Downing street to change
course.</hs_Para>

is that important? Because the Government’s pledge to reduce net
migration to tens of thousands can be achieved only if they
dramatically reduce the number of legitimate international students who
come to our country, and only if they sit back and pray that lots of
British people leave this country, while lots of Brits living abroad do
not come back. We cannot get away from that fact. On the other things
that impact on net migration figures, such as family migration, the
Government have limited rights of appeal and so on, but they cannot do
any more without falling foul of human rights law; they cannot outlaw
people from having any kind of family life whatever or from marrying
spouses from abroad.

Mahmood:</Member></B> There has been a drop in net migration and there
is a flux backwards in relation to international students; the overall
picture of what has happened in the past three years, since the policy
was introduced, has been to create a perception that Britain does not
want to educate international students and does not draw a distinction
between legitimate international students and those who are here
illegitimately or illegally. The London Metropolitan university affair
did great damage to our standing in the world. Our competitors have
picked up on that, and marketing departments in universities in Canada,
Australia and America are homing in on it. It is the one thing that
every higher education institution in this country—whether a
leading Russell Group institution, a million+ institution, part of the
University Alliance or something else—has said is a big problem.

Mahmood:</Member></B> To focus on how we measure the net migration
target is to miss the point about what has happened. The Government
have picked a target; it does not particularly matter what goes into
the target, as long as the sole immigration policy is not just to set
an arbitrary target limit. Net migration is a useful measure of
influxes into a country and outflows, and a useful way for public
bodies, for example, to try to work out the future pattern and shape of
public services. I am not too fixated on how net migration is measured.
There is merit in universities that want to increase the number of
their legitimate international students engaging in a numbers-based
conversation with their local authorities, so that bus routes and
housing need can be planned. There is merit, therefore, in the way net
migration is measured for that purpose, but there is a problem if the
measure of success is whether it is reduced to tens of thousands. That
pledge was made in the knowledge that the only way to get net migration
down would be by significantly affecting the number of legitimate
international students coming to the country. The Minister must
recognise that if the number of such students continues to rise, the
net migration pledge will not be met. We must stop sending out the
message that the country is not open for business.</hs_Para>

I was saying before I took the intervention, that point is important

and their research teams decide where they may spend the next 10 to 20

scientific talent and be an easy and welcoming place to come to, with
an atmosphere of celebration of the contribution made by people who
come. If the overall offer from Britain is a bit mealy-mouthed and

lots of business leaders in particular have been talking to me about in
the last few months has been that in previous recessions some of our
biggest companies would have sent some of their work force back into
additional study to expand their skills, in the hope that by the time
those workers finished their studies the companies might be on an
upswing again and benefit from having refreshed and re-energised
workers who would have had the opportunity to go out there and explore
new ideas. That has been missing from the behaviour of big companies in
this recession, so there are changes in how people are reacting to the
current recession, the squeeze on living standards and the way in which
they are making decisions about study and improving their

from now. I often say to young people I meet that the jobs they will be

were many points in my hon. Friend’s speech that I agreed with,
but I just want to mention a couple of them to start with. First, he
rightly said that although this debate is called a debate about
science, we are actually talking about the wide range of research
activities across all disciplines. Indeed, within the science ring
fence I was very keen, on the advice of the experts, that we should not
do some dramatic rebalancing away from the arts and humanities or
whatever. Within that ring fence, we have broadly maintained the cash
funding going to the Arts and Humanities Research Council and to the
Economic and Social Research Council. In fact, one of Britain’s
strengths—we face challenges, but we should not forget our
strengths—is that for a medium-sized economy we have an
extraordinary range of scientific and research activities, and as every
major challenge facing the world will be tackled by harnessing a range
of different disciplines it is very important that we maintain that
breadth.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:34:19"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060460000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000093">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:34:23"></hs_TimeCode>
also very much liked and strongly agreed with my hon. Friend’s
point that, unlike conventional fears about “crowding
out”, this is an area where we “crowd in”
spending. Indeed, there is a theme running through a lot of the new
initiatives that the Government have been able to introduce of actively
trying to encourage industry, business and charities to come in and
invest with us. That was part of the logic, for example, of the
competition for the investment in new research and development
facilities on university campuses, the research partnership innovation
fund. With £300 million of public money, we have attracted more
than £700 million of private investment. There has therefore
been £1 billion of new investment in R and
D on university campuses, but with only £300 million of that
£1 billion counting as public expenditure. My hon. Friend made a
lot of other good points, but the two that I have mentioned
particularly caught my attention.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060460000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000094"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:35:18"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me briefly touch on the nitty-gritty of spending, because underneath
the fine words it is obvious that Members want to focus on where we are
on spending. There is a powerful logic for the science ring fence as we
have constructed it for this Parliament, because for the first time it
brings together all the main areas of current spending. It is
deliberately and explicitly a current spending pledge for this
Parliament, which means it brings together the quality-related research
funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England, running
at about £1.6 billion a year, and the spending of Research 
<?notus-xml column=176?>Councils UK, running at approximately £2.8 billion a year. In
addition, there are specific items such as the funding for the learned
societies and the Higher Education Innovation Funding programme, which
get us to the £4.6 billion ring fence. I think that this is the
first time we have had a ring fence that has included all those items,
so that even in a time of austerity we have been able to say that we
are maintaining the cash going into current activity.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13060460000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000095">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>
sometimes people have set alongside that what has happened in the
retail prices index and said, “Well, that is a real-terms
cut”, if they look at the advice that we have received from the
experts about the efficiency of the science base’s performance,
they will see that there
clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:36:43"></hs_TimeCode> was, and
still is, scope for efficiency savings. In so far as any group of
scientists and researchers can save money by working more efficiently,
they can be confident that that money is extra resource that can go
into real activity instead, because it is within the ring

give one example of how we are generating efficiency savings, there is
now far better sharing of scientific kit than there used to be.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:37:34"></hs_TimeCode> we consider
some of the initiatives, for example, in the N8 group of northern
universities, we see that for the first time—it is rather
shocking that it is happening for the first time—those
universities are preparing registers so that they know all the
equipment that is available in all their science labs. Consequently,
before one of them buys some expensive new piece of kit, they can work
out whether they can share a piece of kit that one of the other
universities has. If they do need new equipment, they can purchase it
collectively so that it can be shared among them. I do not buy the
argument that performance and efficiency are fixed, and that the cash
ring fence therefore equals real-terms cuts.</hs_Para>

However, one of my challenges
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:38:02"></hs_TimeCode> the community

is indeed the case that capital is outside the ring fence. Again, that
was a deliberate decision. The aim in the time of austerity was at
least to keep the activity going. However, more discretionary decisions
about capital investment can of course be taken. I must say that we
inherited some stark discretionary decisions from the previous
Government. There had been an artificial surge in science capital spend
in 2009-10, but we then inherited plans for significant reductions in
science capital spend, as part of a wider reduction. People should
remember that the 40% reduction in capital spend was simply the overall
plan for capital that we inherited from the previous Government. We did
not add any further
cuts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:39:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

back to the figures. Initially, about £1.9 billion of

have been able to add approximately another £1.5 billion to that

2009-10<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>. With
great support from the Chancellor, who completely
understands  
<?notus-xml column=177?>the value of science, I have taken decisions that have enabled us to

have heard criticism about those being ad hoc decisions. My hon. Friend

favourable circumstances possible, as part of a speech by the
Chancellor in august surroundings in the Royal Society. I cannot think

uncertainties of politics and finance. We cannot always be sure exactly
what we will be able to afford at what moment.
Nevertheless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:38:14"></hs_TimeCode>, we

the scientific community, we tried to identify where the need for new

extra capital investment. We published that document, and in the autumn

do not want to get into specifics at this rather delicate moment in the
plans for public spending in 2015-16, but the coalition stands by its
pledge. We are aiming to make Britain the best place in the world to do

wider context and culture. For example, our lead in the global debate
on open access and open data ensures that we are seen as serious
players in the science debate. Indeed, I look forward to putting on the
agenda for discussions with G8 Science Ministers in London, just over a
week from now, what we can do to agree on further progress towards open
access to research findings internationally and—even trickier,
probably—how we can ensure greater access to the data behind the
research findings. In that respect, there are a host of rather tricky

me touch on two or three specific questions. First, my hon. Friend
asked about postgraduates. I understand the anxiety about
postgraduates. I have to say that the Government have not been
deliberately reducing funding for postgraduates; the funding through
research councils and HEFCE has been broadly maintained. There has been
some shift in some of the research councils’ policies on larger
centres for doctoral training, reflecting a view that it is probably
better for people studying for doctorates to be in centres alongside
other people doing so. That has also enabled us to make stronger
connections between people doing doctorates and their opportunities for
business and industrial
experience<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:44:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000104">We
have to understand what is happening with postgraduates. Some
universities increased their postgraduate fees in line with what was
happening on student fees, but, of course, the latter was being done as
part of a policy and was matched by access to loans 
<?notus-xml column=178?>only to be repaid when the graduates were earning more than
£21,000. There is not the same kind of programme for postgrads,
so the decision by universities to raise their fees, even though there
had not necessarily been any reductions in funding, has had some impact
on
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:45:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000105">Arguments
are being made for postgraduate loans. I welcome the debate about
options for postgraduate student funding, but my experience with
part-time students suggests that if we went down that route, there
would have to be some controls over numbers and some regulation of
postgraduates, which would change the postgraduate scene from the
relatively open, unregulated one that exists at the moment. Pros and
cons need to be carefully
assessed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:45:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000106">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T15:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood asked about women in science. I
understand where she is coming from, and I agree that the science
community needs to do more to deliver diversity. I tracked down some
depressing statistics, showing how many people with good As and A*s in
GCSE physics and maths converted those into a decision to carry on at
A-level. That brings home the challenge that she is concerned about.
Some 52% of boys who get an A* at GCSE physics carry on to do A-level
physics, but only 25% of girls who get an A* at GCSE physics do so.
That is a real challenge. Meanwhile, it is interesting to
note—sadly, we are talking about gender stereotypes—that
41% of boys with an A* in GCSE biology go on to do A-level biology and
56% of girls with that grade go on to do so. Some decisions are being
taken that we need to tackle. I will be at the Cheltenham science
festival later this week, which is a great event, and among the many
things that I will celebrate there, I look forward to meeting our
STEMNET ambassadors—now 40% female, which helps—who go
round schools and colleges encouraging young people to get into
science. There is obviously far more that we can

have made progress and we strongly support the Athena SWAN principles,
aimed at diversity. In the past year, the Department of Health has
required clinical medical schools to have a silver award for Athena
SWAN principles. Research Councils UK, in a statement earlier this
year, which I welcomed, said that it expected institutions in receipt
of RCUK funding to provide evidence of commitment to equality and
diversity. Participation in Athena SWAN was the kind of evidence that
they were looking for. We are trying, without getting too directive, to
use our nudge powers—the fashionable doctrine that we in the
coalition signed up to—to get research councils to use their
clear financial clout to nudge institutions towards those important

second anxiety—I noticed how the hon. Lady shifted her ground to

India, on which I accompanied him with representatives of higher
education, to get the message across in India that legitimate students
are welcome, with no cap on numbers. I heard him say that in interview

to do everything we can to get that message across, which appears to be

very similar. The Catapult centres are proving to be a great success.

Jenkin:</Member></B> The three junctions I mentioned raise questions
about the safety management of many similar junctions on the trunk road
and motorway network: are they given sufficient priority? If as many
injuries occurred on the railways or in the aviation industry as occur
on our roads, far more money would be spent on that, and a far higher
priority would be given to it than is given to these accident black
spots. That is the point that I think my hon. Friend wants me to make
about the junctions he
discussed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:20:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000134">Fortunately,
we have not had any fatalities at the three junctions since the works
were completed—perhaps that is a benefit of the
changes—but there has been a steady stream of serious
collisions, often resulting in severe injuries, proving that that
stretch of road remains extremely unsafe. We have been lucky. During
the 12 months since the junctions were improved, there have
been 10 incidents, nearly seven times the accident rate that
would be expected statistically speaking. Prior to the junction
improvements, the accident rate was 6.3 per 12 months, or
4.6 times the average expected statistically. The junctions were
already dangerous, and may now be even more dangerous. Those figures
again bear out Derek Hamblin’s
observation:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13060460000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000159">“It

Highways Agency accepts that more needs to be done to improve safety on
this stretch of the A120, and I am extremely grateful for its
responsiveness. However, it carried out a further safety audit which
gave rise to its proposal to close the gaps in the central reservation
so that drivers would no longer be able to turn right off the A120
across the path of the oncoming traffic. That will stop accidents at
the location, but it is not a practical or safe
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060460000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060460000136">First,
it will significantly increase many local journey times, including
those for emergency vehicles responding to call-outs. Scheduled public

more than 40% of vehicles were exceeding the speed limit, and that did
not include heavy vehicles, which are subject to a lower speed limit

support the economy, and we have already announced increased levels of
Government funding to deliver improvements targeted at supporting
economic growth. At the 2010 spending review, we began investing

£0.28 million pinch point scheme to widen Galleys Corner
roundabout south of Braintree. Two other schemes were suggested for
pinch point funding by the local enterprise partnership. One was at
Earls Colne, which unfortunately did not, in our estimation, offer
value for money. The other was at the junctions that are the subject of
this debate, but it was unable to be taken forward from that funding

higher than on the rest of the route. The collision risk at those
particular junctions is significantly higher than one would expect.
That is not acceptable, and I fully acknowledge that improvements are
necessary.</hs_Para>

is regrettable that the modifications completed in April 2012, although
generally delivering a small reduction in speeds and an improvement in
speed limit observation, have not been successful, based on current
evidence, in reducing the number and severity of collisions, as one
might have expected. The Highways Agency is, as a priority,
investigating options to try and make those junctions safer for the
public.</hs_Para>

Highways Agency’s road safety audit concluded that further
measures to improve safety at those junctions should be investigated
and that the most effective way to improve safety would be to close the
gaps in the central reservation. That was because the recent accident
history suggested that motorists commonly find it difficult to judge
the distance and speed of approaching vehicles when undertaking right
turn movements at the junctions. If, following surveys, the Highways
Agency concludes that it is not feasible to close the gaps, the
severity of collisions could be reduced by implementing a reduced speed
limit, as my hon. Friend advocates, enforced with speed cameras to
ensure compliance. However, the 
<?notus-xml column=188?>Highways Agency, at the moment, has concluded that a reduced speed limit
would not significantly reduce the frequency of accidents. It favours
gap closures as a preferred short-term option, and it is continuing to
investigate a longer-term

Tuberculosis and Malaria plays a crucial role in funding programmes for

donor funding, including the majority of the UK’s response to TB
in developing countries, comes almost entirely through the global fund.
In 22 high-TB-burden countries, six are totally reliant on the fund and
in another 15 it accounts for two-thirds of their budget. To scale up
access and treatment for DR-TB, which remain woefully low, the
resources the global fund has at its disposal need to increase. The
Government have a key role to play in the replenishment of the fund,
having been a key driving force behind the recent reforms it undertook.
I commend the Government for that policy. What are their thoughts on
our contribution to the fund to address the threat of TB and DR-TB? A
lead from the UK should happen as soon as possible, to help leverage
more from other donor Governments in this important replenishment

through TB REACH and continued investment in research and development.
The Government have already shown leadership in support of developing
new, badly needed tools to tackle TB—a policy of successive
Governments that I hope will continue. Some of those tools have come to
market, specifically new rapid diagnostics, but despite that, 3 million
people each year still fail to access diagnosis and treatment for TB,
which includes a large portion of people with drug-resistant strains.
We need to accelerate our efforts to diagnose TB by rolling out new
technologies, and it is clear that we need to think outside the box. TB
REACH is one way to do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13060470000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130604/halltext/130604h0002.htm#13060470000043">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:55:58"></hs_TimeCode>
the Minister knows, TB REACH is a Stop TB Partnership-hosted initiative
that gives small grants of up to $1 million to find and treat those who
do not have access to TB diagnosis or treatment. It is an incubator for
innovation and pushes the frontiers of technology. It works closely
with DFID-funded UNITAID. In short, TB REACH goes where others cannot
and shows Governments and donors how to reach the unreachable.
Critically, it often demonstrates with data what projects could be
scaled up. The Minister may wish to express a view on whether she
agrees with that assessment. Beyond their contribution of core funding
to the Stop TB Partnership, which does not cover TB REACH,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-04T16:53:21"></hs_TimeCode> ask that the
Government become a donor to TB REACH, to maximise their investments in
UNITAID and support the expansion of new diagnostic tools to detect and
ultimately treat cases of TB, in addition to the work of the global

the importance of a global target within that. A national strategy for

in Ethiopia was frankly a success story, but a story based on years and
years of diligent health care. We met Drs Amara and Abseno from St
Peter’s hospital, who, having qualified as doctors 10 years ago,
had given their professional life to that TB hospital on the outskirts

Canadian Government to fund existing and new programmes for
case-finding and treatment in hard-to-reach populations. That is

realisation. This new initiative will include legislative measures and

training or education in Afghanistan in a subject of their own choosing
and a living stipend for the full period of training based on their
final salary. Staff who prefer not to take up the training package will
be offered a second option—a financial severance payment which
represents 18 months’ salary. This will be paid in monthly

have always been clear in our desire to recognise the efforts of local
staff, and have balanced this against a range of other factors. These
include the cost of any scheme, and the potential impact on the UK and
on Afghanistan of resettling large numbers of people. In line with
previous similar policies, qualification for this redundancy scheme is
limited to those local staff who were in post working directly for HMG
on 19 December 2012, when the Prime Minister announced the drawdown of
UK forces, and who have served more than 12 months when they
are made redundant. Those whose employment ended before this date, and
those whose employment was ended voluntarily or for disciplinary
reasons will not be eligible. In total, we estimate that around
1,200 local staff will qualify for a redundancy package. Of
these, we estimate that up to 600 will be eligible for resettlement,

local staff who face real threats to their own and

agenda leading to one set of goals, while remaining flexible in
international negotiations to the positions of partner countries on the

part of the process in making decisions about the comparative value for

of housing benefit. This suggests that it continues to be possible for
claimants to access the sector. However, private landlords and letting

reasonable for them to make independent decisions about who they let

the relief. The last Administration failed to support simplification to

half a million small firms. From October 2010 to April 2014, small
firms are receiving 100% rate relief (i.e. pay no business rates at
all) on properties up to £6,000 Rateable Value, and a tapered
rate relief from £6,000 to £12,000. An estimated 330,000

The Department conducted a baseline exercise for the 2010-11 reporting
year which established there were 54 human resources staff in DCLG, The

30 Government office for the regions human resources staff who were
subsequently merged into the DCLG human resources function. The salary

was set at 12 months to reduce the risk that a donor’s blood
might carry an infection that could be transmitted to a transfusion
recipient. Donations are routinely tested, but new infections and
infections in the late phase of clearance may not be detected. Lifting

has to move due to HS2 then the owners/operators of that club will have
a claim for compensation that, subject to negotiation of that claim,
should allow that facility to relocate to an alternative site in the

overseas exercises and Her Majesty's ships there is a single food
supply contract with Purple Foodservice Solutions Ltd (PFS). PFS lists
approximately 1,150 different food-related items for the armed forces
in the core range price list. Currently, they estimate that
approximately 60% of lines listed, excluding fresh produce, are sourced
from suppliers within the UK. The percentage of UK produced goods
changes regularly as a result of seasonality, value for money
incentives and changes of supplier.</hs_Para>
