many individuals who donate brain tissue. This donation enables vital
research leading to new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. The
Medical Research Council, the National Institute for Health Research
and research charities are all supporting work to encourage brain
donation. The MRC network of brain banks is developing a strategy to
encourage new donors and plans to hold a workshop in September this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:07:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Soley" PimsId="4897" UID="13060564000218" xid="1906" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000218">Lord
Soley:</Member></B> I am grateful for that Answer. I remind the
Minister that when we talked originally of heart donation many people
found that quite emotionally difficult, but now it is much more common.
There is something very similar with brain donation yet it is
profoundly important, not only for general research but particularly
for degenerative brain disease. The research bodies are very concerned
to get people to donate where they do not have a family history of
brain degeneration because they need comparative samples. Can the
Minister do all he can to promote this? I donated my brain some time
ago and so far it has not been returned marked “not fit for
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>”.
[<I>Laughter</I><I>.</I>] In all seriousness, this is a very important
issue. It can bring great improvement to people’s lives and to
scientific knowledge generally and I ask the Minister and his

it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:08:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13060564000219" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000219">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> I endorse entirely the noble Lord’s ambition
in this area. It is an extremely important area of tissue donation and
contributes enormously to our understanding, particularly of
neurodegenerative diseases. The network of brain banks I referred to
has already begun work on its donation strategy, encouraging new donors
to sign up for brain donation. Its plan is to target well characterised
individuals, for example those in clinical cohorts, as, once donated,
the tissue has lots of associated clinical information from life, which
is highly useful to researchers. I know that a lot of the major
charities are involved in promoting brain
donation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:09:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Walton of Detchant" PimsId="4515" UID="13060564000220" xid="1485" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000220">Lord
Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister recognise
that, partly as a result of such donations but also as a result of
major developments in genomic medicine, the individual genes
responsible for a substantial 
<?notus-xml column=1170?>number of degenerative brain diseases have now been identified; the
missing or abnormal gene product has been found and, as a result, new
treatments are coming on stream? Does he therefore agree that the rare
disease advisory group now established under NHS England should be in a
position to recommend, in collaboration with NICE, the prescription
under the NHS of these so-called orphan or ultra-orphan drugs which are
proving to be so effective in some of these conditions and which are
now coming on stream in an increasing
number?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000006"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:10:34"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13060564000221" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000221">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, we are clear that there
needs to be a mechanism to assess the clinical and cost-effectiveness
of new drugs, particularly those designed to treat rare and very rare
conditions. NICE will indeed be the body charged with doing
that. It is devising a process by which it can do so that is quite
distinct from its normal technology assessment methodology. As the
noble Lord will appreciate, the drugs concerned here are of a different
kind and order of cost from those which NICE normally assesses. The
noble Lord is quite right that that is the broad process which will be
adopted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:11:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

outcomes frameworks have been and continue to be increasingly aligned,

Tyler of Enfield:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that helpful
reply. I certainly welcome the efforts that have been made to align
more closely the various outcome frameworks, in particular the sharing
of particular outcome indicators on premature mortality. Given the new
duties that are now on the Secretary of State, the NHS Commissioning
Board and clinical commissioning groups to reduce health inequalities,
and indeed the current inequalities in the incidence of conditions such
as cancer and survival rates among deprived groups, what evidence is
there that using these common outcome indicators will result in more
integrated services such as smoking cessation, leading to real
reductions in health
inequalities?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13060564000250" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000250">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> The essence of the answer to that is that improved
outcomes will be achieved only when all parts of the system work
together. If you have shared measures within the outcomes frameworks
and measures that are complementary to each other, you will shine a
light on areas of inequality and inform local and national action to
advance equality. This focus on outcomes rather than processes enables
an innovative approach to health and care services that is driven
essentially by the needs of the local population. I will just add that
local Healthwatch has a role to play in working with partners to make
sure that the views of vulnerable and seldom heard groups in the
population are
heard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000034"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Pitkeathley" PimsId="59" UID="13060564000251" xid="1389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000251">Baroness

and support joint working in the way that I have described. However, we

integrated care for use in the outcomes frameworks. That is a work in
progress. Meanwhile, a place holder was included within both the NHS

support from local authorities, so we hope that there will be a great
deal of buy-in to it. It has as its focus high-quality care
and promoting people’s independence and well-being, and it
enables councils to make comparisons, assess scope for improvement and
measure progress against their own local priorities in adult social
care. Therefore, the virtue of the outcomes frameworks is, above all,
transparency and accountability, leading to improved quality of care as
defined locally by
councils.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_05_PT_1/2D461E350E6D88D5652354572E2A30E12F0B544C" __version__="1.16"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 June 2013">Wednesday,

is progressing well. The six tunnel-boring machines active under London
have completed around 12 kilometres of tunnels. Several milestones have
already been reached, including the tunnel breakthrough at Canary Wharf

Mayor of London last Friday. While maintaining focus on the delivery of

suspect that I am not alone in being in something of a quandary about
the Bill. I entirely support the main intent behind it, which is to
reduce the appalling reconviction rate that is an indictment of our
offender 
<?notus-xml column=1180?>management system, particularly as regards those awarded short prison
sentences who have the highest reconviction rate and are responsible
for so many crimes on release. For many years, I have campaigned for
many of the measures that it contains, so why should I be calling on
the Government to slow down their headlong rush towards a goal that I
share? I do so for two reasons, both based on personal experience. I
spent 41 years in the Army before I became Chief Inspector of Prisons,
a number of them in Whitehall. My memories of those days were revived
today when I read the obituary in the <I>Times</I> of Sir Patrick
Nairne, who was a most distinguished civil servant as well as a hugely
cultured and civilised man. From him, and others like him, I learnt
that when a paper or proposal was intended to be moved towards the
Secretary of State, it should be put first to the Army board, but only
after it has been properly researched and costed, which research
included careful examination of all the consequences, intended or
otherwise, that could be identified. Only after such proposals had gone
through the Army board, the Chiefs of Staff and then Ministers, would
they reach the Secretary of State, and certainly not the outside
world<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:41:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000066">When
I heard about this Bill in the gracious Speech on 8 May, I little
thought that it would be published the next day at the same time as the
long-awaited response to the consultation document, <I>Transforming
Rehabilitation</I>, to which it relates. However, what was even more
worrying was that, having been subjected in recent years to a very low
standard of impact assessments accompanying Bills, this one was also
dated 9 May, which suggested to me that far from being a document which
had informed Ministers and officials throughout their deliberations on
the Bill, it had been added as an afterthought. Far too many of the
impact assessments that I have seen recently seem to have only two
options—take it or leave it; or, I, the Secretary of State, have
decided that this is what I am going to do. That is one option and the
other is to do nothing, which is not
acceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T15:42:27"></hs_TimeCode>. When

second experience has been over the past 18 years, when I
have been associated with the offender management system itself. When
you get down to the guts of offender management, you find
that it is all about enabling someone or some people to influence
someone else to live a useful and law-abiding, as opposed to a useless
and law-breaking, life—nothing more and nothing less. I have
observed with considerable dismay the relentless advance of
political and bureaucratic interference, and the time and ability of
those concerned to do that, with the inevitable result that the
reconviction rate has increased. The old Prison Commission, before it
was abolished in 1962, was run from a house in Eccleston Square, with a
staff of 128 people without computers. Now, admittedly with double the
number of prisoners, the computer-assisted National Offender Management

or costed, on which the Bill is based. Until now, no one has pretended
that the market provides a better solution for enabling people to live
useful and law-abiding lives than other people, and there is no
evidence that it does so. The purpose of my amendment is to ask the
Government to take time and give us time to think all this through.
There has, so far, been no pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. It has
all been rushed through at breakneck speed, we have heard no reason why
the Government seem determined to rush it all through, and we have had
no explanation or answer to all the questions that were asked at Second

remind the House of some of the questions that I asked at Second
Reading but which remain unanswered. They are fundamental to the
protection of the public, which is what rehabilitation is all about.
What factors were taken into account in estimating that there would be
a cost of only £27 million a year associated with the breach of
licence and supervision conditions for short-sentence prisoners, which
is part of the amendment I have tabled today? How many offenders were
assessed as likely to breach? Were any facts, and therefore costs,
deliberately excluded from the assessment? What factors did the
Government consider in estimating that there might be additional police
costs of only £5 million a year? What is the Government’s
estimate of the cost of providing a rehabilitative service to offenders
released from custodial sentences of less than 12 months,
and how much of that are they looking to recover
through competition? What about the cost of extending rehabilitative
services anyway? There is no mention of any assessment of the ability
of the private sector—which failed so spectacularly to provide
security staff for the Olympic Games—to provide trained and
accredited staff who can be relied upon to provide the regular contact
needed with offenders whose chaotic and dysfunctional lifestyles are
described in the White Paper.</hs_para>

public look at all this objectively they will, quite rightly, wonder
how it was that the House of Lords, which is responsible for
scrutinising Bills, allowed something to go through when it had so
little information on which to base its judgment. That is in danger of
dragging not just this House but the whole parliamentary system into
disrepute. I question the need to proceed at such an absolutely
headlong pace. I was told last night that one of the reasons for
pushing ahead with the Bill is to encourage funding by illustrating
what needs to be funded. I was also told that, instead of payment by
results referring to individuals it will, in future, refer to what are
called cohorts of individuals. A cohort of offenders will mean the
group of people for whom a particular provider is responsible. The
result will be a reduction in the reoffending rate in that group from a
figure yet to be determined, and a reduction in the number of crimes
that they are alleged not to have committed. When I questioned the
Secretary of State about the word “reoffending”, he

shall also address Amendments 3, 5 and, in passing,
Amendment 3A. Amendments 1 and 3 are designed to give greater
flexibility to a sentencing court. As the Bill stands, everyone
sentenced to a period of custody of one year or less will be given a
period of 12 months’ supervision from their day of release.
This, of course, is something that we welcome as a useful addition to
the armoury of the probation 
<?notus-xml column=1185?>service. However, there will be cases where this period of supervision
is excessive, disproportionate and unnecessary. A court imposing a
short custodial sentence of, say, 29 days or fewer will be well aware
of the alternatives available—namely, a community order, which
could itself have been more punitive and more rehabilitative. If,
nevertheless, the court decides on a short custodial sentence, I would
argue that it can be safely assumed that no rehabilitative action was
required and therefore it should not be unnecessarily imposed on the
offender.</hs_para>

probation service. It provides that a court can direct, on advice from
the probation service, that there need be no period of supervision. I
should say that this would be in exceptional cases. The sort of cases
that I am thinking about relate to the one-off nature of an offence
where the offender is of previous good character, there were physical
or mental health issues, or the offender is extremely old. Another
factor might be the length of time that has elapsed between the date of
the offence and the date of conviction where there had been no
offending during the interim period.</hs_para>

amendments is to give the courts greater flexibility and prevent
disproportionate and unnecessary supervision. As we heard from the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in the previous debate, yesterday we were
fortunate enough to meet the Justice Secretary. The argument he
advanced in response to these amendments was that there needs to be a
stable cohort of offenders who are to be managed by the private
probation providers. He went on to say that the new group of offenders
who are to receive this new supervision need to be a stable group so
that a proper assessment of reoffending among this group can be done on
a year-on-year basis. The purpose is to make an accurate calculation of
the payment by results of the private contractors and, most
importantly, to assess the success or otherwise of the additional
supervision to be
provided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000088">I
completely understand that argument. In my professional life I have
done many similar calculations myself and I know it is very useful to
have a stable cohort when making those calculations. But I would argue
through these amendments that that simplicity and clarity of
calculation should not be set above the interests of justice of the
offenders themselves and, however low the level of supervision which
will be imposed on these people, there will still be an additional
cost. In the interests of justice for the offenders and a reduction in
costs, I move these
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000089">I
turn briefly to Amendment 3A in the name of my noble friend Lord
Beecham. A number of amendments address the transition of offenders
from under 18 to over 18. The object of all these amendments is to try
to maximise the input of the YOT service and to work flexibly with the
probation service. This issue may be addressed in Clause 6 (4), which
will introduce new Section 106B (4) (b), and may well cover the points
raised in this amendment. Nevertheless, I hope the noble Lord will
address this point about maximising 
<?notus-xml column=1186?>flexibility for the YOT service and enhancing its ability to work
constructively with the private probation providers. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13060564000291" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000291">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Ponsonby, for the way in which he moved that amendment. During
Second Reading, the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, told us about his
experiences as a sitting magistrate and the frustration that
magistrates often feel when they see offenders with long histories of
offending coming before the court time and again. The noble Lord told
us how magistrates genuinely feel that they use custody as a last
resort. In all the discussions that I have had with anybody who has had
an experience of the magistracy, that emphasis has been made. The
Government share the frustration of the magistracy. They seem to be
almost forced into successive custodial terms because of the cycle of
repeat offending. That is exactly why we have brought forward the Bill.
It is why Clause 1 extends release on licence and why Clause 2 tops up
that licence with additional
supervision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000091">The
Government believe that the only way we can break the high level of
reoffending among this group of offenders is to end the current
position whereby they walk out of prison after half of their sentence
with no support and no incentives to seek support to change. That is
why Clause 1 applies licensing conditions to all custodial sentences of
more than one day. I will explain why in Clause 1 licences apply to a
sentence of more than one day, before I turn to the Amendment 1 of the
noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby. First, there is a practical consideration.
The headline sentence imposed by the court is, as the House knows,
halved. It is not possible, nor practical, to half a half day of
custody. It is also the case, as the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, will be
aware, that there are some minor cases in which the court decides that
an offender could serve their sentence by spending a day sitting in the
court. So, for practical purposes and to retain the power of the court
to sentence to a day in court, we applied the licence and the new
top-ups of this supervision to sentences of more than one
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000092">Amendment
1 would raise that minimum period to sentences of 29 days or more. In
other words, a sentence of 28 days or less would result in
unconditional release with no licence conditions, no top-up
supervision, no power to recall the offender and no way to rehabilitate
the offender other than the hope that they volunteer for support. A
significant number of offenders who the noble Lord and his fellow
magistrates sentence to custody receive a sentence of 28 days or less.
The latest statistics from 2012 suggest that around 13,300 adult
offenders received such a sentence. The reason why many of those
offenders receive sentences of 28 days or less is because their history
of offending makes the offence more serious, therefore justifying a
custodial sentence. It is exactly because these offenders have failed
to break their cycle of offending that they received the short
custodial sentence in the first place, and it is because they have been
released from short sentences with no support that they continue to
offend and receive yet more short prison sentences. This is exactly the
group that we should be targeting for supervision. It is a group of
offenders for whom we 
<?notus-xml column=1187?>should do everything possible to help them face up to the issues that
have caused them to offend. Some of them will reoffend when under
supervision and some will not comply with the licensed conditions, but
that has to be better than the current position, where they are simply
imprisoned and released, only to reoffend and be imprisoned
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000093">I
understand why the noble Lord tabled this amendment but, given that it
will not provide the courts with more discretion and will leave a
significant number of offenders without support, I hope that he would
consider withdrawing it. As the Secretary of State explained at our
meeting last night, the intention is to have flexibility and common
sense in terms of the treatment that is applied during that period of
supervision. By the way, that was not a secret meeting—all noble
Lords were invited and I was very grateful to those who did come along
to hear him. At the very beginning of this debate, I would also make
the point that we must not think of the period of supervision as
punishment; it is a period of help and support, which we hope will help
people to avoid
reoffending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000094">I
now turn to Amendments 3 and 5, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord
Ponsonby. These relate to the top-up supervision covered by Clause 2,
which will introduce a new Section 256AA, applying supervision to all
offenders with a sentence
of,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13060564000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000188">“more

means that the period of licence will be topped up with additional
supervision so that the two, taken together, amount to 12 months.
Amendment 3 essentially follows from Amendment 1. If Amendment 1 was
adopted, those serving 28 days or fewer would have no licence, and
Amendment 3 would mean they would have no top-up supervision either. I
have already said why the Government disagree with Amendment 1, and it
follows that we would not support Amendment 3 for the same reason. It
is a small point, and I do not want to labour it, but I assume that the
noble Lord, in Amendment 3, meant to refer to more than 28 rather than
27 days, since his Amendment 1 related to sentences of less than 29
days—that is, 28 days or fewer. In other words, a sentence of 28
days would fall between the
two.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060564000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000095">Amendment
3A, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, seeks to amend the
categories of offenders who receive top-up supervision under Clause 2.
Amendment 3A would exempt offenders sentenced in the youth court when
they were under 18 from receiving top-up supervision, even if they were
18 when released from custody. I note that the amendment does not seek
to extend this exemption to those sentenced when under 18 in the Crown
Court. I understand the concerns, which my noble friend Lady Linklater
has also raised, and we will return in later amendments to the question
of supervision for those released from custody who have reached 18.
However, I would say now that the Government believe that our
commitment to provide 12-month supervision should apply to all those
aged 18 and over, when they reach the point when they would be released
from custody. We, of course, recognise that young offenders who have
just turned 18 can have different needs from older, adult offenders,
and we will 
<?notus-xml column=1188?>expect providers also to recognise this difference and to tailor their
supervision to the particular needs of this
group.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13060564000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000202">4.15

turn to Amendment 5, the last amendment in this group. The effect of
this amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, explained, is to give
the court the discretion to order that top-up supervision might not
apply. I understand the noble Lord’s thinking here and why he
has tabled the amendment. It is true that there will be offenders who
will not need significant programmes to address their offending
behaviour because they are unlikely to reoffend. The reoffending rates
suggest, however, that a significant number of people are likely to
reoffend and it is often difficult to anticipate who those offenders
are. With the greatest respect to noble Lords, the sentencing court is
not always the best position from which to determine what, if any,
supervision an offender is likely to need. Offenders who need intensive
supervision or specific programmes do not need to receive these
services. I return to the point I made earlier that this is not a
tunnel-vision approach and a clanking of a machine. We are making sure
that 12 months of supervision is available but we are assuming a good
degree of common sense about the intensity of that supervision, even as
the 12 months
progresses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000097">We
believe that by bringing all offenders within the compass of the Bill
but by giving providers a good deal of flexibility in application we
will avoid some of the problems that these amendments imply. The
provision in this Bill determines only the overall period in which
supervision will be available. It does not specify what that
supervision should involve or how intensive it should be. That will be
for the providers to decide, working within the framework set by this
Bill. That is where we give providers the room to innovate, to see what
works and, crucially, to pay for what does work. Applying top-up
supervision to all offenders and then setting the appropriate level of
supervision is a much more practical approach than deciding at the time
of the sentence not to supervise an offender only to realise too late
that they do pose a risk of offending and would benefit from
supervision. I hope in the light of these explanations that the noble
Lord will agree to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000098"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ponsonby of Shulbrede" PimsId="183" UID="13060564000292" xid="1393" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000292">Lord
Ponsonby of Shulbrede:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord

5 that the supervision period is not a punishment; it is a support for
the offender to help them get back and stay on the straight and narrow.
That is true but it is nevertheless a court order and there will still
be the scope of breaching the supervision period, which is a very
important factor.</hs_para>

Linklater of Butterstone:</Member></B> My amendment is for a proposed
new clause to the Bill. The Minister will be aware of the generally
very warm welcome expressed for the Government’s move to include
rehabilitative support for offenders in the community who have served
short sentences. This group of prisoners has hitherto had no
supervision. These sentences may range from a few days to less than 12
months, for which no support has been available. Support is desirable
and very necessary, as this group of ex-offenders has, as the Minister
said, the highest reoffending rates: rates that are greater than for
almost any other group in the prison
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000102">The
issue is how the support is best to be delivered. What is practical,
desirable and most likely to succeed with this particular group of
offenders is what matters. The typical profile of such people is that
they have chaotic lives, often have drug, alcohol or mental health
issues, have poor or virtually no education after the age of 14 and
were probably jobless before coming into prison. Everything else being
equal, they would probably have been better served with a community
sentence, although I accept that is for another debate. They will not
be a danger to society and are in need of basic support to help change
their lives around. Their prison experience will have done nothing to
prepare them for a law-abiding life because it is not required to do
so. Typically, these people will sleep their way through their
sentence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000103">It
is important that what is offered to them on release is relevant,
proportionate and, above all, flexible if it is to succeed. It requires
skill on the part of the mentor or deliverer of probation services, and
flexibility is the key. If it is tailored to the individual needs of
the ex-prisoner, it will have a chance of success. However, if there is
an additional statutory fixed period of one year’s supervision
as well as the licence period, it will be perceived as disproportionate
and unfair, and the risk of breach and recall to custody becomes very
real. It would be a terrible irony if a provision that is intended to
turn people’s lives around were to produce a rise in the prison
population, which is something we want to avoid and completely negates
the power and potential that the supervisory period offers. An extreme
example to prove—in the sense of “to
demonstrate”—this rule could be that someone given a few
days in custody for, say, a road traffic offence could then find
himself 
<?notus-xml column=1190?>with an additional statutory 12 months’ supervision in the
community, which is way out of kilter with the nature of the offence.
If he defaults and is recalled to prison for 14 days, that would be
much longer than the original
sentence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000104">Instead,
the Government should follow the example of successful mentoring
schemes that already exist around the country, such as the pilot in
Peterborough that I have visited, where the scheme is voluntary and
service providers can exercise their own discretion in the management
of the offender. Custody is a very last resort. These mentoring schemes
are delivering very promising results, and I hope that the Government
will look closely at what they are doing because I believe they show
the way forward, which is an improvement on the rigid year’s
supervision currently proposed. Rigid rules of one year’s
supervision might have a simple appeal, but what matters is what works,
given the nature of the offences and the needs of the offenders, and
here we have an example of what works. This means that we do not have
to try to reinvent the
wheel.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000105">Desistence—a
favourite word of criminologists, which just means stopping
reoffending, which is the subject of a great deal of research, debate
and everything else—will occur only if the individual wants to
stop offending, and the risk of breach is always high with this group.
Already, 6% are in prison for breach following the lengthening of
licence periods. A voluntary relationship based on trust is what will
succeed with this very low-level group rather than long, fixed periods
of supervision, however well
intentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000106">My
second, probing, amendment relates to juvenile and young adult
offenders and their post-release supervision. The Minister will be
aware that there is real concern among the key agencies that work with
this group of offenders, notably the Youth Justice Board, that those
who are under 18 when they start a sentence set by the youth court
should continue to be managed under the auspices of the YJB until they
have completed their sentence. This means that the YOTs—youth
offending teams—continue with the management of the young

young people who are in trouble with the law, and it is not rocket
science to understand that it requires people with particular skills
and experience to deal with those issues. The YJB is the pre-eminent
body to oversee their arrangements. Many noble Lords will remember the

offenders until they are 21 if necessary, thereby not breaking off the
crucial work that is being done with them. Account has to be taken of
different levels of maturity, and it is a well-established principle in
our justice system that people sentenced for offences committed as
juveniles should not be subject to the same expectations and demands as
adult offenders. The evidence of the excellent work of the
T2A—transition to adulthood—programmes has shown that a
young adult’s developmental maturity is at least as important as
chronological age and that variations might be directly related to
offending and the ability to comply with statutory requirements such as
community sentences or licence conditions. This is supported by work

of support on release. Hence my secondary amendments, which I hope I
can include at this moment because they are relevant, to delete Clauses
4 and 6, which come a little later on in the list. I would welcome
clarity on this from the Minister. It is not clear whether this group
will indeed still be regarded as young people for the purposes of their
management. If not, how will it work? Will any discretion exist as to
who will continue the supervision? If so, who will make that decision?
This is very important, as it is well known that the levels of support
and supervision drop dramatically in the adult system, so transitional
arrangements and communication between agencies will always be
critical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:30:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> I support Amendment 4 in the name of the noble
Baroness, Lady Linklater, with the suggestion that “18”
should be substituted by “21” in order to bring in this
vital group. I thoroughly agree with her about the work being done by
the Transition to Adulthood Alliance. Further than that, the probation
service was the first to admit that it has not been very good at
dealing with the 18-to-21 age group in the recent past, with the
exception of three very good programmes: the intensive alternative
custody programmes 
<?notus-xml column=1192?>in Manchester, South Yorkshire and London, which have been mentioned
before in this House. I am not sure that the Youth Justice Board for
England and Wales, which was very happy to take on the responsibility
for 18-to-21s in custody is quite so happy having them under the youth
offending teams, which are very much geared to the under-18s. On the
other hand, I know that the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales
is more than happy to work closely with the probation service in
developing these adult services. I therefore hope that, in considering
the rehabilitation of this vulnerable and impressionable group, the
Minister will agree that the probation service experience in Manchester
should be exploited and spread further. I know that it is poised to
make an advance on where it had already
reached<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:32:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the local authorities. It is therefore even more important that special
attention is being given to them above the age of 18. I particularly

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I join the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, in supporting the amendments of the
noble Baroness, Lady Linklater. She has a strong point in Amendment 2
on the need to avoid rigidity in the system, to look at particular
individuals’ needs and to ensure that supervision is
proportionate and flexible according to the circumstances of the case.
There is some danger, under the Bill’s present formulation, that
that will be rather more difficult than it should
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:33:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

enthusiastic about Amendment 4. It seems that continuity is
critical here, particularly as the people we are looking at are
themselves in a state of transition. It does not seem helpful that
those who supervise and assist such people should change in the course
of that transition. Of course, there has to be some cut-off point, and
the age of 21 is reasonable. I hope that the Minister will look
sympathetically at that. It also strikes me that it may be a more
cost-effective way of dealing with offenders in that category, because
you do not have the process of handing over and entering into separate
contractual arrangements with a different organisation and all the rest
of it when you have already got a provider with a budget and contract
which should be capable of being extended if required under the
circumstances of the case.</hs_para>

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the debate
that my noble friend has stimulated. She is absolutely right that this
group of people is the most challenging in terms of the prolific number
of offences for which they are responsible. In many ways, this can be a
key period in their lives and can determine whether they 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>live a life of crime or become constructive members of society. I also
take the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. For me, there is
a sense of shame that so many who have been in our care end up in our
criminal justice system. We must go into that more deeply and we shall
try to do so, in part, through the Children and Families Bill and other
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:36:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000118">What
gives me some optimism that we shall be able to make this new
legislation work is that there are good examples: the Manchester scheme
that the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, referred to and the mentoring in
Peterborough. This was raised in our discussion yesterday and I want to
explore further the mentoring by those who have committed earlier
misdemeanours but now play a positive role in life. I remember going to
Stafford and meeting a mentor who had been heavily drug dependent, but
he had cleaned himself up and was now having a really good effect on
young people through the advice that he was giving
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000119">The
noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, expressed the dilemma at Second Reading that
persistent offenders end up being given short sentences that send them
into a prison environment. I fully accept the point made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Linklater, that that puts them into a completely
ill-suited environment in terms of rehabilitation. That is one reason
why part of what we are trying to develop is to start rehabilitation in
prison, so that they get used to the world of work and address various
failings such as literacy or drug or alcohol dependency. One of the
first things I was told when I started visiting prisons and youth
offending centres was, “We just start to have some effect and
then we lose them”. I repeat that the period of 12
months’ supervision is not punishment but the continuation of
help<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000120">My
noble friend said that this amendment is designed to provide a power
for the Secretary of State to contract the rehabilitation services when
an offender volunteers for such programmes. I have already said why we
think that both licence and top-up supervision should be applied to all
offenders. I understand the point that often the most effective
rehabilitation occurs when the offender decides that they want to
change. However, the simple fact is that many offenders will not
volunteer for rehabilitation programmes. Those who initially volunteer
may change their mind when more challenging questions are asked of
them, or when they simply become bored of what they may decide is undue
hassle. Offenders who fail to comply with the programmes will simply
withdraw their consent to avoid any consequences of failing to
undertake the programme they initially signed up for.</hs_para>

the Bill we are ensuring that all offenders have the opportunity to
receive help and assistance on release from custody. We are saying to
offenders, “Here is your chance to rehabilitate yourself and
turn your life around, but you cannot walk away from this and expect no
consequence if you do”. That is why the licence and top-up
supervision is mandatory, but also flexible, so that providers can
tailor the type of support and intensity that is needed for each
offender.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060564000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000122">I
have taken time to explain that we think licence and supervision should
be mandatory, but let me deal very quickly with the powers of the
Secretary of State 
<?notus-xml column=1194?>to contract for voluntary-based rehabilitation services. The fact is
that the Secretary of State already has the power, and nothing in the
Bill restricts that power, even though our intention, in the vast
majority of cases, is to make licences and top-up supervision
mandatory. In short, therefore, the Secretary of State does not need
this power, and I ask my noble friend to withdraw her

4, on the top-up to 21 year-olds, also takes my noble friend’s
application of top-up supervision. I understand that the intention of
Amendment 2 is to ensure that offenders aged under 21 on release from
custody will serve a period on licence but not be subject to top-up
supervision. I understand my noble friend’s argument, but I
disagree with it. The Government believe that all those aged 18 when
released from custody should get the same level of supervision and
support. The amendment would mean that an offender sentenced to two
months’ imprisonment when aged 20 would serve only half their
sentence in custody and have only a month of licensed supervision. Yet,
as I said at the beginning, these young offenders have some of the
highest reoffending rate of any
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000124">Our
proposals in the Bill will ensure that offenders who are 18 when
released from custody get 12 months of supervision in the community. I
stress again that the type and level of supervision can be tailored to
the young person’s needs. I expect that providers will develop
specific programmes for this age group, offering a real chance to make
a difference to the needs of young offenders. The Government see this
as an opportunity for real support for young offenders, not as
something that they should be excluded
from<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:42:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000125">I
will clarify the point that my noble friend Lord Ramsbotham made about
the crossover from YOT supervision to probation supervision. The Bill
makes it clear that this will be a matter of judgment at that time, and
of consultation to make sure that what is done is most effective. If
the most effective course is to retain the YOT supervision, that
supervision will continue. It fits in with what I keep on emphasising:
this is not, to take the criticism of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, an
exercise in rigidity. It is quite the opposite. It builds in the most
flexible of approaches to try to tailor to the needs of the individual
the kind of help and support they are going to get. However, I disagree
with my noble friend, although, goodness knows, I am in awe of his
experience and expertise in this area. If saying to offenders in this
age group, “For the next 12 months you are going to
try to mend your ways” is somehow an unfair burden on them by
society, I am willing to take that risk.</hs_para>

suspect that if we can put this into place, we will start having an
impact on this age group. As I have said, one of the lessons that we
have to learn from the experience of this age group is that without
this help, they get out of our control, become repeat offenders, going
into the adult criminal justice system and the prison system with
disastrous results for both themselves and their society. Therefore, I
do not think that this long period of 12 months’ supervision
ahead of them is somehow a terrible burden on these young people. For a
significant number of them, it may be the best thing that ever happens
in their lives.</hs_para>

Bradley:</Member></B> Amendment 6 is in my name and that of the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. It requires the supervising officer to explain
the implications of licence conditions and the effects of
non-compliance in language that is appropriate to the offender’s
intellectual ability. As the Minister explained, Clauses 1 and 2 extend
statutory monitoring and supervision to offenders serving short
sentences for a mandatory period of up to 12 months. The introduction
of a new period of statutory supervision with its own requirements, in
addition to those of the licence period, adds an extra element of
complexity to a person’s custodial sentence. The amendment will
ensure that people with poor communication and comprehension skills,
such as people with learning disabilities, will be able fully to
understand the terms of their supervision requirements, and what might
happen if they do not follow
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:51:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060570000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060570000002">It
is generally accepted that between 5% and 10% of adult offenders have
learning disabilities, and that a significant number of juveniles
reaching 18 have speech, language and communication difficulties.
However, in the absence of routine screening, the support needs of this
group are often left unrecognised and unmet. Research undertaken by the
Prison Reform Trust—I declare an interest as a trustee of the
trust, and pay tribute to the brilliant work it does on behalf of
people with learning disabilities who find themselves in the criminal
justice system—showed that more than two-thirds of
prisoners with learning disabilities and difficulties experienced
problems with verbal comprehension, including problems understanding
certain words, and with expressing

by various academics has shown that many people with communication
difficulties lack the language skills to understand what is happening
to them, and the implications of what is being asked of them. For
example, many have problems understanding vocabulary that is commonly
used in the criminal justice system, including words such as
“victim” and “breach”. Many people with
learning disabilities have limited language, comprehension and
communication skills, which mean that they may have difficulty
understanding and responding to questions and recalling information,
and may take longer to process that information. They may also be
acquiescent and suggestible, and, under pressure, may try to appease
other people. Many also have memory problems, which may mean that they
need regular reminders of what is expected of them over their licence

how offenders could be made aware of these issues during the judicial

allows me to make another observation about the White Paper. Although
it is acknowledged that many of these offenders have mental health
problems, including learning disabilities, there is no mention of
commissioning mental health services for them, which gives the
probation service a problem. With the emergence of a new commissioning
process under NHS England and of health and well-being boards, it will
be important for the probation service to be associated with those
boards to make certain that the proper support is available, not just
in relation to the subject raised by the noble Lord, Lord Bradley, but
in relation to all aspects of mental health problems

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> My noble friend Lord Northbourne’s
comments on the word “rehabilitation” have stimulated my
thoughts on this matter. He is absolutely right: rehabilitation can
only mean a return to a condition which once existed. I am not enough
of a linguist to say exactly how the word is constructed, but that is
clearly what it means. I wonder, however, whether the word
“reform” might be appropriate in the circumstances. I
well remember one of the very first days that I attended this House, in
1981. A speech by the Lord Chief Justice, Lord Lane, a most
distinguished gentleman, was given very great publicity and attention
by the House. Its theme was that in the whole of his experience, both
as counsel and as judge, he did not think that prison had reformed a
single person. I remember 
<?notus-xml column=1200?>asking myself how that could be, side by side with Rule 1 of the
<I>P</I><I>rison </I><I>R</I><I>ules</I> of the time, which said that
the chief purpose of imprisonment was the reform of the offender. Both
could not possibly be right. Putting aside that irrelevance for the
moment, it may very well be that the word “reform” would
be a more appropriate description of the situation than
“rehabilitation”.</hs_para>

Bradley, raised the question of the condition of supervision that a
person should be of good behaviour. It may well be that Parliament
should define that situation more closely and specifically. There are
two aspects here. The first is the boundary that it is
Parliament’s duty to place and the second is the communication
of the exact location of that boundary to the defendant in appropriate
circumstances. It is part and parcel of the duty of the sentencer in
any aspect of sentencing to make it clear to a defendant exactly what
the court means. Over and above that, it is also their duty of the
interview solicitor and counsel before leaving the matter, to make
quite certain that the defendant knows exactly what is meant and what

from the fact that we have to consider whether the Title of the Bill
needs amending. I strongly support the very wise words of the noble
Lords, Lord Bradley and Lord Ramsbotham, in support of the amendment.
One of the most important tasks of a court is giving explanations to
offenders to make sure that those who are subject to the orders of the
state understand the requirements that are placed on them. If that is
the responsibility of a court and of judges, it must surely also be the
responsibility of a supervisor under this Bill. I like to think that we
have all had a stage in life when, until it could proved that we had
done something wrong, we were innocent of having done so. If
that is right, “rehabilitation” is a pretty good word to
cover what is being sought to be done. I rejoiced when I saw the Title
of the Bill and knew that focus was, at last, being placed on an
extremely important task of the criminal justice system: to protect the
public by preventing people offending again. I emphasise the word
“again”.</hs_para>

sentencing and dealing with offenders on which there is common
agreement. However, it is clear that there is consensus among all those
concerned about the particular needs of female offenders. I am very
conscious that the Secretary of State and Ministers are aware of this
issue, and I am confident that they will say that there is no need to
make any mention of it in this legislation because they accept it and
are seeking to give effect to it. However, I am bound to say that one
of the difficulties with relying on the good sense, judgment and
experience of particular Ministers is that you can never be sure that
they are going to continue to fulfil the office which they hold at
present, no matter how advantageous that would be. Of course,
legislation, once passed, is going to last for a substantial period of
time. I am firmly of the view that we must hope that the Bill does not
bite the dust but, as a result of the scrutiny by this House, becomes
worthy of its objects and proves to be a Bill which those involved in
the criminal justice system in the future look at as a turning
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060564000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060564000162">It may
appear arrogant for someone such as myself to suggest that a Secretary

is not arrogant of this House to take the view that that is a sensible
and desirable safeguard, because history has indicated that, sadly, all
too often, the criminal justice system, particularly when concerned
with sentencing female offenders has not recognised their needs as they
should. I know the Minister in his present role has been visiting
assiduously criminal justice institutions up and down the land and has
accumulated a great deal of knowledge. Unfortunately, Ministers
eventually have to go and new Ministers come in their place, and they
may not have the same knowledge that I know the Ministers in this

use the term “he” to mean any offender, of course. To
take the issue of female offenders’ concerns a little further,
it seemed to me that those include family circumstances and the need to
act as a carer, not just to children but perhaps to a spouse, an infirm
elderly parent or to other family members. Building on what we have in
the 2003 Act, I suggest that the supervisor shall “have regard
to”—using the same words as the noble and
learned Lord in that respect—“the compatibility”
of the supervision requirements with “the offender’s
family circumstances”. Caring is something particularly in my
mind. The requirements might include one to attend at a particular
place, such as one of the various centres which provide services and
activities of a rehabilitative nature. When the offender, generally the
mother, is responsible for a child and it is desirable that the child
goes with her, that should be taken into account. My noble friend, I
think on the first amendment, referred to both “flexibility and
common sense”. These seem to me to be common-sense points but it
does no harm to spell them out. Although the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Woolf, said that there should be no need to be specific, Section
217 is quite specific.</hs_parafo>

the Minister who is 
<?notus-xml column=1206?>answering—it looks as if it is going to be
the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad—can give me that reassurance. New
Section 256AA(6) provides that the Secretary of State has to

Judd:</Member></B> I hope noble Lords will forgive me but, to make a
clean breast of it, I came in when the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Woolf, was in mid-stream. I just feel I cannot sit here without saying
that I think this group of amendments is crucial. It puts into
perspective what we are doing. Are we primarily about finding
alternative means of punishment or are we primarily about
rehabilitation? If we are about rehabilitation, it must be tailored to
the individual concerned. If this in any way makes the rehabilitation
to full, productive membership of society more difficult—and we
all know that in many cases it is because people’s lives are in
chaos that they end up in these situations—then we are not
helping at all. These amendments are there to strengthen the intention
of the Bill, if it really is about
rehabilitation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_05_PT_1/7836B4DE05BA8FAE4ECE5B4D1768BFFF8F6229C2" __version__="1.16"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 June 2013">Wednesday,

tabled by my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf, rather thinking that
they would be grouped together. That was perhaps the result of not
being allowed the time to get our act together, but I suppose I must
apologise. I hope my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf will be happy
if I speak to this amendment and associate it with the other amendment.
As well as supporting everything that has been said by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, and by my noble and learned friend Lord Woolf on
this issue, my particular concern is for the effect on the families of
female offenders. I am concerned about their special needs because, as
we all know, these women often have mental health problems and, I am
sad to say, they have often been abused as young women. There is a lot
of history of that. Drink and drugs also figure quite highly. But above
all, the actual offences committed are often of a very minor nature. I
can remember a visit to a women’s prison on one occasion and
being asked by the women concerned why they had such harsh sentences
compared with what a man would get for a similar offence.</hs_para>

on the family, we need to know how many homes are broken up as a result
of women being given a prison sentence, because that is a huge cost. If
we are thinking, as we must, of financial costs as well as emotional

family and their need to be taken into care, this should rate very
highly on the list of considerations when sentences are being passed. I

moment the Justice Select Committee in the other place is conducting an
inquiry into women offenders. One of the areas on which it has had a
lot of evidence of concern is payment by results. With reference to
what we were told yesterday about cohorts, I presume that women
offenders will be separate cohorts as far as payment by results is
concerned and that the results that have to be achieved will be
tailored to women and very carefully

Elystan-</B><B>Morgan</B><B>:</B></Member> I do not think that my noble
and learned friend Lord Woolf need apologise in any way for the
amendment. There is no suggestion of arrogance in spelling out duties
such as these. In the past 30 years, we have had about 30 criminal
justice Acts, whether they carried that name or not, and I would be
very surprised if one were not able to find in each and every one of
them some structure not unlike that proposed by my noble and learned
friend. If one thinks of the very basis of a prison sentence, at least
25 years ago that structure was spelled out in a way that some might
think embarrassing to a sentencer, because it seems to me that no
sentencer would ever conceive of approaching the problem in any other
way. The statute states that the sentencer has to consider whether the
offence that has been committed is serious enough to justify
imprisonment in the circumstances and that he must then go back to see,
in the light of all the circumstances, including the personal
circumstances of the defendant, whether it is necessary for there to be
a sentence of immediate imprisonment. In one respect, one could say
that that is utterly insulting. Could there ever have been a sentencer
so lacking in understanding and conscience not to approach his or her
duty in that way? Yet, as a circuit judge, I had to look at that
section day in, day out, and I found it utterly reassuring. I plead the
point that there is nothing wrong in spelling out a duty, even though
that duty might be obvious to everybody looking at the
situation.</hs_para>

have been involved with the criminal courts, I have taken the view that
men commit offences on account of all possible features in the range of
human wickedness. In the case of women, it is very different. The
splendid report on women in prison written some years by the noble
Baroness, Lady Corston, reinforced the point that many of them are not
criminals at all and should not be in prison. I am not saying that some
of them have not committed 
<?notus-xml column=1208?>truly horrendous offences, but that must be a very small proportion, and
a very high proportion of women in prison should not be there.

Ponsonby of Shulbrede:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 9,
which is part of this group, would add a mental health assessment as a
supervision requirement in Schedule 1. As noble Lords will
be aware, a high percentage of prisoners suffer from mental health
difficulties, and the purpose of the amendment is that the sentencing
court should be able to add a mental health assessment as a requirement
that would benefit offenders when they came out of prison. Of course,
it is far more desirable that this is picked up far earlier upstream,
but there may be occasions where it has not been picked up, and it is
obviously an issue. Sentencers should be able to add this as a
requirement, so if it is not going to be picked up in prison it will be
when the supervision period starts. That is the purpose of Amendment

Amendment 7 and the others, I agree with everything that has been said.
I particularly agree with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, that many of the points
were common sense. I will, if I may, tell one brief anecdote. A friend
of mine recently visited a women’s prison in Scotland and talked
to the governor, who said: “If I were to open all the doors
today, only a very small fraction of the women would actually leave
this prison. Most of them would choose to stay here because of the

from the beginning that of course it is the Government’s
intention, as has just been acknowledged, to ensure that people in

that every Member of your Lordships’ House, no matter where they

supervision requirements to have regard to the particular needs of
women. The Government fully share the noble and learned Lord’s
intention and view it as essential that the justice system is properly

private sector services where appropriate. Similarly, we expect
providers to recognise and respond to the particular needs of female

female offenders are taken into account. The key difference is that in
future all offenders, both women and men, who are serving a custodial
sentence of less than 12 months will have an assessment of risks and
needs. This assessment will be undertaken by prison or probation staff
and will cover the key areas of need. These include accommodation,
mental health needs, skills and employment, children,

the sentence in custody and in the community that takes account of and
will address the particular needs of that individual. This information
will also be shared with service providers in the community, so that
they, too, fully understand the individual offender’s needs and

needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T17:52:21"></hs_TimeCode>. We are

noble Lords, since I have been involved in this area. When I visited

contact with the criminal justice system to be assessed at the outset

identified as having health needs, a referral to a treatment or
appropriate services is made. That means, of course, that health needs
can be taken into account at all stages of the process, including
charging and sentencing decisions. Information will be shared that will
support the continuity of treatment for as long as it is needed by the
individual. This should mean that more people are identified and that

these conditions are aware of the need to make them proportionate and

supervising offenders will have to refer any breach action that is to

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment seeks
to amend subsection (2) of Clause 2 which, in turn, seeks to insert new
Section 256AA into the Criminal Justice Act 2003. The
amendment seeks to amend new subsection (8) of the new
section in relation to the definition of a supervisor of persons
subject to the supervision which will, when the Bill is passed, take
effect for prisoners serving less than two
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060575000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060575000024">The
purpose of the amendment is to be clear that the provider of the
supervision should be a public sector organisation. At the moment,
presumably it would normally be a probation trust or an organisation
commissioned by such an organisation. It seems to me and to my noble
friend important that there should be a clear public line of
accountability for the provision of this service,
which does not necessarily seem to be 
<?notus-xml column=1214?>the case according to the wording of the proposed subsection as it that
now appears. It is a fairly basic point. Given that we are looking at a
significant responsibility, some of which at the moment is not
exercised at all by the probation
service—that is to say supervision of people serving less than
12 months—an important line of public accountability should be
established. That in no way precludes, of course, the engagement of the
third sector in relation to supervision of offenders, as long as they
have been contracted by a public authority.</hs_para>

many examples of probation trusts working with voluntary organisations
at the moment. I know that in my own area, Northumbria, a probation
trust has very good working relationships and in Newcastle there is a
successful scheme that has been commissioned in that way. There is no
intention at all to ensure that all the supervision is actually carried
out by the probation service but, if that is not the case, there should
at least be that line of public accountability. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060575000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060575000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13060575000049" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060575000049">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord will be quick to tell me
if I am wrong, but as I read it, Amendment 7A has a very clear effect.
It is to ensure that all top supervision of offenders should be carried
out by the public sector providers or those bodies commissioned by the
public sector. I have never hidden from this House that we believe,
particularly in the present economic conditions, that we will be able
to find the resources to carry through our rehabilitation revolution
only by employing payment by results and involving the skills and
initiatives of the private and voluntary
sectors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060575000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0001.htm#13060575000027">We
are breaking new ground in our approach. We are committed to providing,
for the first time in decades, supervision for those released from
short custodial sentences. One of our key objectives is finally to
tackle the unacceptably high level of reoffending among this group.
That prize is worth striving for. However, to achieve that aim we have
to be able to afford this additional supervision. To do that, we need
to reduce our current costs of dealing with offenders. The noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, does not think that we can do this. I say to him that
we cannot do so by only going down old ways and old costs. Competing
the majority of probation services will improve value and efficiency
throughout the system, making taxpayers’ money go further. For
example, competing the community payback contracts in London saw a
£25 million saving over four years. We will also look at
efficiencies within the public sector by consolidating back-office
functions and creating one national public sector probation service.
That is another real plus for the Bill. I remember the debates nearly a
decade ago, and I was never happy that the probation service was a kind
of junior partner to the Prison Service. One of the effects of the Bill
will be to create a national probation service with real status and a
real voice in these matters. We also want to encourage innovation among
providers of probation services, to ensure that we make a real change
in reoffending rates. By paying providers in full only when they are
successful at reducing reoffending we will not only make savings but
will drive down reoffending rates.</hs_para>

position that in our view that line of accountability at the level of
the provision of service should ultimately rest with a public sector

not be the case. I mention specifically third sector organisations
because they have a particularly valuable role to play. My amendment
would not exclude contracting with private sector organisations, for
that matter. However, they would be contracted by the public sector

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, it is common ground between all Members
of your Lordships’ House, and reflected in some of the
amendments that we have already debated, that the problems suffered by
and indeed occasioned by offenders are complex and often multiple, and
that in dealing with them no single agency is likely to be able to
resolve all those problems 
<?notus-xml column=1216?>or help people entirely overcome the difficult
issues that they face. On the contrary, it is quite clear that in a
number of areas, collaboration between various agencies will be
required if we are to achieve the shared objective of reducing
reoffending, both from the perspective of the advantage to society and
of the individuals concerned. Therefore, looking at what is most likely
to avoid reoffending, we know—and it has been rehearsed many
times in your Lordships’ House—that the principal steps
that can be taken to diminish reoffending relate to employment and in
particular to housing, but also to issues such as health.</hs_para>

agencies could and should be involved in all these aspects, both in the
direct provision of services and in the case of commissioning services,
so that, for example, local authorities clearly have a role.
I suggest that in shire county areas that is at both levels—of
adult services which are county level responsibility, and housing,
which is a district level responsibility. However, of course, in
unitary authorities they are located within the same authority.
Obviously the police have a role, but also in terms of employment one
has to look at the Department for Work and Pensions. In terms of
health, in the new organisation of the health service, I suggest that
one has to look at two levels: the clinical commissioning groups and
the national Commissioning Board, because they have responsibility over
areas of mental
health.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060575000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060575000034">All
these need to be involved, and many of them are already involved, in
local arrangements, such as community safety partnerships and crime and
disorder reduction partnerships. Some of them are involved in the
health and well-being boards, which prepare strategic needs assessment.
I would hope that the needs of offenders are reflected in those bodies.
However, the purpose of this amendment is to ensure that all providers
of the services which the Bill seeks to introduce, or at any rate
ensure are available, come together with the other relevant agencies so
that a genuine cross-sectoral partnership is dealing with these issues.
Of course, that puts a responsibility on the other partners, as well as
on the direct providers of probation services or supervisory

From the way that the amendment is framed, it looks as though
responsibility is intended to fall only on the provider of the
supervision but, of course, a wide range of other
organisations—some statutory—need to be involved. While
the Minister and the department will keep an eye on these matters, it
is important that other departments are also engaged,
including departments at a national level, particularly the Department
for Work and Pensions, the Department of Health and the Department for
Communities and Local Government. Then, at local level, there are
various bodies such as local authorities, clinical commissioning groups

the requirements that the Secretary of State may specify must be
adhered to by an offender on supervision. That is in relation to

one can well see the importance of residence, particularly in cases
where it is undesirable for an offender to reside in a particular
location—for example, if there has been an incident of domestic
violence and that is the subject of his or her conviction. Equally,
however, there are very vulnerable people in the system. If they were,
for example, to return to the family home—particularly in the
case of a young person, but not necessarily in only those
cases—where there are already problems, one can envisage
circumstances in which they may be unable to continue to reside there

order will presumably have to take the form of something laid before

under which the Secretary of State may top up supervision. I have

there is a reasonable period of

controls on the conditions that can be imposed during the supervision
period. When sentencing offenders to custody, courts will be unaware of
the limits to the conditions that may be imposed by the Secretary of
State. This could affect their sentencing behaviour if they decide that
they need to compensate for the risk of punitive supervision conditions
being imposed. It also, strangely, retains the detail of drug testing

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak also to
Amendments 16 and 17 in this group. All the amendments are in my name
and in the names of my noble friends Lady Hamwee and Lord Dholakia. Our
amendments concern sanctions for the breach of supervision
requirements. Clause 3 deals with such sanctions. Noble Lords will have
seen that failure to comply with supervision requirements may lead to
information being laid before a justice and to the issue of a summons,
with or without an arrest warrant, as appropriate. On proof of a breach
of supervision requirements without reasonable excuse, it is proposed
by new Section 256AC(4) that the court may do one of four things.
First, it may impose a sentence of 14 days in prison or in a young
offender institution, as appropriate. Secondly, it may impose a fine.
Thirdly, it may impose an unpaid work requirement. Fourthly, it may
impose a curfew
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:34:05"></hs_TimeCode>. The
clause is permissive, so it would be open to a court also to take no
action. However, as drafted, the clause establishes no test for when
action is or is not
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:34:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000002">As
has been pointed out, the Secretary of State very helpfully attended a
meeting of all Peers yesterday and explained the purposes of new
Section 256AC(4). The first purpose was, effectively, punishment. He
explained that because this section is concerned with offenders who
have been sentenced to prison and who then on release are subject to
supervision requirements, it should be made clear that if the offender
does not comply with those requirements, there will be a penal
sanction. That effectively is why the four sanctions that I
listed—imprisonment, a fine, unpaid work or a curfew
requirement—are penal in
nature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:35:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000003">The
second purpose he outlined was personal deterrence. He explained that
offenders should not think that the supervision requirements are in any
sense voluntary, and that if they choose to ignore them or fail to
comply with them, nothing will happen. He might have added that there
should also be an element of public deterrence, so that the world will
know that if offenders disobey supervision requirements, they will be
liable to penal
sanctions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:35:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

be sound; I do not dissent from them. However, they do not advance
rehabilitation, which is the purpose of the Bill. Furthermore,
offenders on release from short sentences are, as the Government and
many noble Lords have pointed out, particularly fallible. It may be
that in many cases a court would take the view that instead of imposing
one of the four penal sanctions, it would be better in the interests of
rehabilitation for the supervision requirements previously imposed by
the Secretary of State to be varied. It may be that they should be
varied to stronger requirements or to requirements that are better
targeted to the particular needs of the offender, which may have been
revealed by the breach of the requirements that had been imposed
earlier—or by the proceedings taken after the breach and the
investigation before the magistrates in court when the breach was
looked
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:37:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000005">The
possible requirements that can be imposed are to be found in Schedule
1. They cover a broad range and are very flexible. It is right that an
offender may start with a very relaxed regime but a court may take the
view on investigation that although the breach of those requirements
justifies the imposition of a much tighter regime, it does not require
one of the four penal sanctions. Amendment 16 would allow the court to
recommend to the Secretary of State that the requirements be varied.
Why should they be varied on the Secretary of State’s
recommendation? It is because the notice imposing requirements comes
from the Secretary of State by virtue of new Section 256AA. I accept
that it is therefore right that the court’s power should be to
make a recommendation for the Secretary of State to vary the
requirements rather than to make an order imposing such a
variation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:38:38"></hs_TimeCode>. The
proposed scheme allows the court much more flexibility than it has
under the Bill as drafted. That flexibility would both be useful and
advance the cause of
rehabilitation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000006">Amendments
13 and 17 are designed to ensure that the courts have some guidance
about the proper response to a breach. Noble Lords will remember that
at Second Reading, concerns were rightly expressed by a number of
Peers, including the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, and the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle, that the purpose of the Bill, which is
rehabilitation, might be frustrated by the excessive imposition of
sanctions for breach. As the Bill is presently drafted, the court has
no indication as to when it ought or ought not to impose a sanction.
Amendment 13 would give a clear direction as to what should be the
court’s approach to a breach of supervision requirements. It
would impose a threshold test so that the power to impose sanctions
would be exercisable where the court was satisfied that the interests
of justice require a sanction to be imposed. While I accept that it may
be said that that can be inferred from the permissive nature of the
power, it seems to me that the purpose and the test should be expressed
on the face of the Bill. Amendment 17 would help to secure some policy
consistency and uniformity in the imposition of sanctions by requiring
that the Sentencing Council should publish guidelines in respect of the
imposition of sanctions for breach of supervision
requirements.</hs_para>

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, my Amendment 14,
which is very similar in many ways to the amendment moved by the noble
Lord, Lord Marks, would help to ensure that the purpose of the new
supervision period is primarily rehabilitative by removing custody as a
sanction for technical breach of requirements. It would retain the
sanctions available to the courts of imposing a fine or a supervision
default order imposing either an unpaid work requirement or a curfew

Prison Reform Trust—it is good to see the noble and learned

to which I add my own for the invaluable work it does in the whole of
this area. It is particularly concerned that, without additional
safeguards, the proposals will result in an increase in breach and
recall to custody, which will drive up the short sentenced prison
population. As the Transforming Rehabilitation consultation
acknowledges, many people serving short prison sentences have complex
and multiple problems, including homelessness, unemployment, drug and
alcohol addictions, mental health needs and learning disabilities. This
in turn increases the likelihood of breach and recall to custody if
sanctions imposed for non-compliance are too onerous or the period of
licence or supervision is too
long.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000010">By

5,300 between 1993 and 2012. Growth in the recall population began in

of the proposal, given the poor record of prison at reducing
reoffending, particularly by short sentenced prisoners. Reoffending by
offenders sentenced to less than 12 months in prison is estimated to
cost the economy up to £10 billion annually and 57.6%
of prisoners sentenced to 12 months or less reoffend within one year of
release. For those who have served more than 11 previous custodial
sentences, the rate of reoffending rises to 68%, which is a horrific
figure. By contrast, community sentences for 18 to 24 year olds
outperform prison sentences by 12.8 percentage points in reducing
reoffending. Even when offenders of all ages are closely matched in

characteristics, the performance gap remains a robust 8%.</hs_para>

new Section 256AC sets out the sanctions available to the court where
it is proved to the satisfaction of the court that the

committal to prison for a period not exceeding 14 days, a fine and a

Woolf:</Member></B> My Lords, as regards the practicalities of this
issue, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Marks, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe, it is important to provide greater flexibility to
deal with breaches. Many of the offenders whom the Bill is intended to
help to go straight have deep problems which are often associated with
drugs. It would be a huge achievement if these offenders were able to
keep out of trouble for part of the 12-month period. Sending them into
custody would be most unfortunate and would fail to give them the
further opportunity they may need. Support can be much more helpful in
these circumstances than something that is more in the nature of a
sanction. Sanctions are important in appropriate cases, but other
approaches are sometimes more constructive.</hs_para>

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I join the noble and learned Lord and
the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, in supporting the amendments spoken to
by the noble Lord, Lord Marks, which would help considerably. The noble
Baroness’s amendment would remove the capacity to order a person
in breach to be committed to prison. She said that there was no
provision in the Bill for this measure to be used as a last resort.
That is the substance of my amendments in the next group. It may be
convenient for me to speak to those amendments now as I am advised that
that is possible. It makes sense to do so, as my Amendments 15 and 18
would qualify the provision in new Section 256AC(4)(a) within Clause 3
by providing that a sentence for breach not exceeding 14 days is to be
treated as a last resort. I hope that meets the point raised by the
noble Baroness. Concerns were expressed about this provision in
the consultation document, which the Government acknowledged
in their response. However, as yet, their response has not been
reflected in the Bill. In my submission, it would make sense to add
that qualification, so that, in addition to the provisions in the
amendments spoken to by the noble Lord, Lord Marks, the right of the
court to impose a custodial sentence of up to 14 days would be
preserved but it would be stated explicitly in the Bill that it is to
be used only as a last resort. That is the sort of declaratory
statement to which the noble Lord has referred in earlier
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000015">Is
the Minister in a position to indicate the anticipated number as
regards the recall provision? I could not find it in the impact
assessment. He may not be in a position to do that. However, the noble
Baroness rightly referred to the very large increase in this
regard—the 55-fold increase—in the past 20 years, most of
which, as she rightly says, occurred over the past 14 years. Many of
the custodial sentences for breach are imposed on young offenders.
Indeed, the Prison Reform Trust has reported substantially on that
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000016">I
suspect that there is no great distance between the
Minister’s position and that set out in the
amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Marks, and in my
Amendments 15 and 18. I would welcome the Minister
indicating tonight or on Report that those measures will be included in
the Bill, with the appropriate wording. The noble Baroness rightly
referred to concerns about there being an increased readiness to impose
custodial sentences for breach and the cost of this in material terms
and, potentially, for offenders and the rehabilitative process. This is
not a clear-cut issue and there are clearly arguments on both sides but
I have heard concerns expressed by a senior member of the
Magistrates’ Association as well as by the noble Baroness and
other organisations. Accepting these amendments would go a long way to
relieve those concerns while still leaving the court with the ultimate
power to impose a custodial sanction as a last

to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howe,
that I certainly do not want to see any benefits gained from a
successful rehabilitation programme being dribbled away in the

would be very self-defeating indeed and we must look carefully at that.
However, although this is a wonderful Chamber in which to discuss these
problems, I sometimes think that we try too hard to be understanding on
these issues. In trying to understand all these terribly complex
problems with which these people are faced, we do not face up to the
fact that they have a choice. As I have said in previous debates, I
remember from my childhood young people who experienced in their
upbringing many of the problems we talk about in this House but who
nevertheless grew up to be honest, decent, honourable members of
society. It is a
choice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000019">In our
efforts to understand, I sometimes think that we leave some of these
offenders with the belief that the gun is never loaded and that they
will never have to face the consequences. As the noble Lord, Lord
Ponsonby, has said in earlier debates, some offenders who have been
given every chance, shown every understanding and been offered every
opportunity still appear before the courts and the magistrates have no
alternative. I am as willing to be as woolly a liberal as the next man,
but we must also send a very clear message that as a society we do not
intend to tolerate anti-social and criminal behaviour without a firm
response. If we do not do that, some of the characters we are trying to
deal with will never apply themselves to the offers we are making them
that we hope will help them put their lives together
again.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_05_PT_1/062F0C6F074E57FB51041F75BE6890666D97FF07" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 June 2013">Wednesday,

to deal with the various amendments, and I accept with alacrity the
kind offer of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, to reschedule his
amendments into this group. I turn first to Amendment 14 from the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe. Its effect is simple to understand: it would
remove the power of the court to commit an offender to custody for
failing to comply with the conditions of their top-up supervision. I do
understand concerns about the risk of some offenders ending up back in
prison for breaching their supervision conditions. We should, however,
not lose sight of the fact that far too many of these offenders are
already ending up back in custody because they have been released
without any conditions and have gone on to reoffend.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060583000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000021">There has to be a
balance between the need to ensure there is some grip on offenders
under supervision and the need to keep them out of custody and on
programmes designed to rehabilitate them. The Bill gets this balance
right. First, there is discretion for supervisors to warn offenders
before bringing breach action. Secondly, the decision to bring breach
action will always be taken by the public sector. It is not in the
interests of the public sector to have lots of offenders recalled to
custody, which we all know is expensive.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13060583000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000022">Then we have the need
in the Bill to demonstrate to the court that a breach has occurred and
with no reasonable excuse. The court can find there has been no breach
or that there was a reasonable explanation for the breach. Only when it
is satisfied that there has been a breach can the court decide on the
action to take on the breach. I would stress to the noble Baroness that
the court may decide that, despite there being a breach, no sanction
should be applied to the offender. 
<?notus-xml column=1226?>This is because Clause 3 creates new Section 256AC subsection (4) of the
2003 Act, which states that, if there has been a breach, a court
“may”—not “must”—impose a
sanction. I am quite sure that my noble friend Lady Hamwee will make
that part of her bedtime reading because she likes to go back and check
whether we have got this exactly right.</hs_para>

decides there should be a sanction, it has three alternative options to
consider before it decides to commit an offender to custody. If it does
commit to custody, the maximum period available to the court is 14 days
and this period does not amount to a new sentence, meaning it does not
trigger a new period of supervision. As I say, I recognise the concerns
about returning people to custody, but we have to put these safeguards
in place. We also need to give the courts a range of sanctions that are
effective in punishing an offender for breaching conditions and in
getting the offender back onto the rehabilitation activities as soon as
possible, which is the intention of the supervision
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000024">The
noble Baroness’s amendment would create an inconsistency with
existing powers. This is because the courts can already commit
offenders to custody for failure to pay fines or for failure to comply
with requirements of community orders. It would, I suggest, create an
anomaly that courts were able to commit to custody for lesser sentences
but were not able to do so for breach of conditions attached to more
serious sentences involving custody. I hope my reassurance on the
safeguards and the discretion given to the courts, reassures the noble
Baroness so that, at the appropriate time, she will not move her
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000025">I
now turn to Amendments 13, 16 and 17, proposed by my noble friends Lord
Marks, Lord Dholakia and Lady Hamwee. Amendment 13 adds a qualification
that the sanction for breach of top-up supervision may be imposed if
the court is satisfied that the interests of justice so require a
sanction. I hope that I have already made clear that the provision as
drafted gives the court an option to decide not to impose a sanction
even if a failure to comply with the condition has been demonstrated.
This is because the court may impose a sanction for a breach but does
not need to. The addition of an “interests of justice
test” is unnecessary as the court already has the discretion to
decide not to impose a sanction and would do so only if it felt it
necessary. In other words, the court already has discretion to decide
whether to sanction in the interests of justice.</hs_para>

that the court considering a failure of the offender to comply with
top-up supervision conditions could recommend to the Secretary of State
that the supervision conditions should be varied and suggest ways in
which they may be varied. It will remain for the Secretary of State to
set licensing conditions and now to set the new top-up supervision
conditions. This is a continuation of what happens now with offenders
serving longer sentences that already attract release on licence and is
the most practical approach to setting conditions of supervision.
However, I take my noble friend’s point that there may be
circumstances in which a court dealing with a breach can point out that
the rehabilitation of the offender might be better addressed by a
variation of the Secretary 
<?notus-xml column=1227?>of State’s supervision conditions. That seems a sensible and
practical suggestion and I will take it away and examine the
technicalities of the process and return to this at a later
stage.</hs_para>

create a statutory duty on the Sentencing Council to publish guidelines
with regard to the court’s powers to deal with failure to comply
with supervision conditions. I expect that the independent Sentencing
Council will want to provide guidance on the treatment of breaches as
it does, for example, on breaches of other orders. I also expect that
this will be a key element of the training for the judiciary that the
Judicial College will want to provide. As noble Lords will know, the
Sentencing Council is an independent body set up and governed by the
provisions of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009. Apart from two
specific general matters relating to sentence calculation the Act, does
not specify what guidelines the council must produce.</hs_para>

power for the Secretary of State or the Court of Appeal to refer to the
council any matter that it considers the council should

said that I would expect that the council will consider guidance for
the courts in this area, but my noble friends will also appreciate that
I am anxious to maintain the independence of the Sentencing Council. I
would not want to encourage every Bill coming before the House to have
a provision that required the council to issue guidelines on matters
affected by it. I am confident that the council will consider the
provisions of this Bill and issue any guidance it considers necessary.

able to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000029">I
turn to Amendments 15 and 18 from the noble Lord, Lord Beecham. Are
those the ones? That is good. I know that it throws everything into
confusion if you move them out of order, but I will do my best. As I
said in relation to the previous group of amendments, and particularly
that in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, I understand the
concerns about the risk of some offenders ending up back in prison for
breaching their supervision conditions and I understand why a number of
noble Lords have expressed concern about this. The approach taken by
these amendments is somewhat different from that taken by the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe, in the previous group in that rather than remove
the option of committal to custody, they insert a provision which
requires the committal to be a last resort after all other means of
dealing with the breach have been exhausted by the
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000030">As I
have outlined already, there are a number of steps to reach before the
offender will be committed to prison. So there is an option for courts
to take no action at all before they consider the four sanctions
available to them. There is no hierarchy of sanctions here. It is for
the court to decide what the most appropriate sanction is for any
particular breach of conditions. Of course, committal to custody is an
onerous sanction, but the courts will be aware of this and will take
that into account in deciding the appropriate and proportionate
response to any breach.</hs_para>

is not necessary to set out the concept of the use of committal as a
last resort and I would point out that it is not clear exactly what
that would mean. I also suggest to the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, that
Amendment 18 is unclear about what amounts to exhausting all other
matters. Does it mean that a court must first use the option of
imposing no sanction, then a fine for a further breach? It seems simply
to be impractical and unduly restrictive on the discretion of the
courts. There will also be offenders who will fail to comply with
conditions in such a way that will justify committal to custody as a
first response. I suggest to the noble Lord that we have some faith in
the ability of the judiciary to make reasoned, proportionate and
sensible decisions about breach, and I ask him not to move his
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060583000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060583000032">Having
listened to the debate and heard the tenor of my reply, I hope that the
House will believe the point that the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, made
that there is not a great deal of difference between us on this. I hope
that I have demonstrated that in the way that we are approaching this
matter we are providing the supervisors at every stage of this process
with a great deal of discretion. However, we must face up to the
reality that there will be those who, by their response to the
assistance that they are given, will provoke the only response that we
can make—to return them to prison. I hope, however, that it is
also clear that we provide this wide discretion. This area is not a
matter of punishment but real assistance to those who are willing to
receive it. There should be a real commitment by society to make it

not be quick to impose even a 14-day sentence. It should be implemented
only after full consideration of such a measure. The experience of
committal for breach for young offenders, to which I have alluded,
lends some force to the suggestion that a clear message be sent that
such a provision ought not to be lightly adopted. Not all benches would
do that in any case, and obviously the court on which my noble friend

the objective is not for any operator to make profit from such work. My
understanding of the purpose of the amendment is that it would prevent
any offender who is carrying out unpaid work as a sanction for breach
of a supervision requirement from doing that unpaid work for any
private sector organisation. I would make a number of points in
response to the noble Lord.</hs_para>

as noble Lords will know, we intend to open up the delivery of unpaid
work, along with other services for offenders in the community, to a
wide variety of organisations. This will include the private sector.
However, the model for private sector organisations’ delivery of
unpaid work would, I should make absolutely clear, not involve the
offender working directly for them. The private provider
would be responsible for organising the community work and supervising
the offender’s progress. Unpaid work is intended to be of
benefit to local communities. The private provider would make
arrangements with a local authority, community group or charity for the
actual work to be carried out. The private provider may also
subcontract another organisation to deliver the unpaid work. This may
be particularly important for women offenders or offenders with
particular needs, such as learning disability. In these cases a smaller
organisation within the community with the relevant expertise is much
better placed to arrange the unpaid
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060587000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000008">However,
the amendment might prevent private providers even from making
arrangements with other bodies to deliver unpaid work. Consider the
case of a private provider with responsibility for supervising
offenders carrying out unpaid work and that wants to make arrangements
for placements with a local charity or community group. The amendment
could prevent the private provider from doing so, although I am sure
that this was not the intention of the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, in
tabling the amendment.</hs_para>

a number of purposes. As part of a community order or suspended
sentence it provides a credible punishment, but it can also help
offenders to learn new skills or disciplines of work. The noble Lord,
Lord Beecham, raised this important issue. Too often offenders are
looked at in a particular 
<?notus-xml column=1231?>way, but some lack the basic ability to turn up at a
given time to serve a particular number of hours. We need to help
develop these basic skills and
mindsets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060587000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000010">Unpaid<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
work is also reparative, allowing offenders to pay back the harm done
by their crimes to the wider community. This is equally true of unpaid
work carried out under supervision default orders. It is a sanction for
the breach, but this is not to say that it cannot also support the
offender’s rehabilitation, or allow them to put
something back into the community they have
harmed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060587000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000011">My<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
point here is that unpaid work needs to be meaningful, whether it is
carried out as part of a community order or as a sanction for the
breach of supervision requirements. Even if it is imposed as a sanction
for a breach, the work needs to be of sufficient quality. This remains
true whether the provider is a private sector organisation, a charity
or the public sector. For this reason I do not believe this
amendment’s singling out of private sector organisations to be
the right approach. The key issue is ensuring that whoever delivers
unpaid work does so to the appropriate standard. We will ensure that
our new arrangements deliver this. For these reasons I hope the noble
Lord will see fit to withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060587000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Beecham" PimsId="5821" UID="13060587000027" xid="2085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000027">Lord
Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, I cannot say that I am terribly happy
with the noble Lord’s response. It seems to me that there is
almost a moral issue here about what is in effect the exploitation of
unpaid labour. There is already some concern about the degree to which
this now forms part of the process of imprisonment. Bringing in unpaid
work has a potential impact on competitor organisations that do not
have the advantage of cheap labour, or as in this case unpaid labour.
If private sector employers are to be engaged in the process of
assisting rehabilitation by providing work—and there is no
reason why they should not be—it is incumbent on them to pay for
that labour. There is no reason why they should not pay at least the
minimum wage. It seems wrong that they should benefit from this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060587000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000013">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
regret the Minister’s response. I invite him to think again
about this, as it is not satisfactory. Otherwise we might have to
return to it on Report, because it strikes me as a wholly inappropriate
response. There are many opportunities outside unpaid work in the
private sector that would encourage the rehabilitation that we all want
to see. The Government should rethink their position on this
issue.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may clarify this.
The noble Lord’s point about paying someone who is caught up in
one of these arrangements or rehabilitation schemes is a slightly
separate one. I emphasise that the amendment as tabled would prevent
the private sector from providing any kind of service as part of the
rehabilitation process. I have made the point, which I wish to
underline, that the private sector organisation is there not to make
any profit. As I have said, the person actually performing this
particular arrangement within the community would be doing so 
<?notus-xml column=1232?>as part of their rehabilitation. The issue about
whether that person should be paid or unpaid is a slightly separate
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060587000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000015">As<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
the noble Lord has said, we will come back to this. For the benefit of
the Committee I would like to clarify that many offenders
are currently subject to unpaid work. Currently, around 60,000
offenders have successfully completed community payback sentences, for
example. That is 7 million hours of work on projects that
directly benefit local communities. To be clear, the intention is that
any unpaid work is of benefit to the community and to the individual as
part of their rehabilitation process. The underlying objective is not
for any provider, whether private or otherwise, to make a profit from
that
arrangement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060587000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000016"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Beecham" PimsId="5821" UID="13060587000029" xid="2085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060587000029">Lord

recent remarks, although the points that he made did not really come

Alton of Liverpool:</Member></B> My Lords, just over a year ago on 21
June, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi addressed both Houses of Parliament in
Westminster Hall. There was an understandable sense of euphoria and a
sense of “problem solved”. Daw Suu now sits in the
Burmese Parliament rather than under house arrest. Hundreds of
political prisoners have been released and ceasefires have been agreed
with most of the country’s ethnic groups. Space for media, civil
society and political actors has increased significantly, and in two
years’ time Burma will have elections. Sanctions have been
lifted, and Burma’s President, Thein Sein, is travelling the
world, feted by world leaders. Only this week the BBC World Service
became the first international 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>media organisation to deliver news on a mobile platform in Burma, where
it has some 8.4 million listeners. Does this not imply that
the problem is solved? Is it not time to move on and focus on the
world’s other
problems?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060588000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060588000002">During
a recent visit to Burma it became clear to me that the euphoria is

issues, I tabled today’s Oral Question and this Question for
Short Debate, and I am grateful to all noble Lords who are
participating tonight. The focus is on ethnic tensions and the
limitations of recent developments. The immediacy of those challenges
was underlined by the anti-Muslim violence last week in Lashio in Shan
state, which also involved attacks on journalists trying to document
what occurred. Mosques, schools and shops had been burnt down, and
violence took place in more than 18 townships hundreds of kilometres

visit, partly facilitated by Christian Solidarity Worldwide, and from
its reports and those of Human Rights Watch, if the challenges posed by
ethnic violence are not addressed, they have the capacity to derail

five further Parliamentary Questions, I again raised the conditions in
the camps. I asked about the core issue, the question of the Rohingya
claim to citizenship. The Government of Burma need to repeal the 1982
citizenship laws which stripped the Rohingya of their citizenship,
rendering them stateless. They need to introduce a new citizenship law
in line with international norms. They should also be challenged for
trying to impose a two child policy on the Rohingya, which in the past
seven days Daw Suu has described as, “illegal and against human
rights”. Perhaps the Minister can tell us whether the Government
would be willing to encourage the establishment of two independent
inquiries: one through the United Nations to investigate the violence
in Arakan state last year and to assess whether crimes against humanity
have been committed, a phrase that was used in your Lordships’
Chamber earlier today by the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock; and the
other perhaps consisting of independent academics and other experts to
assess the historical basis for the claims of the Rohingya in order
fully and conclusively to address the claims of the Government of Burma
and many in Burmese society that the Rohingya are, as they put it,
illegal Bengali immigrants. Years of misinformation about the Rohingya
in Burma need to be countered with a full, comprehensive and

of the Rohingyas is ever to

as part of a serious peace process, Thein Sein’s Government must
end the Burmese army’s offensive against the Kachin people.
While it is to be welcomed that the Government of Burma have agreed
ceasefires with many of the ethnic armed groups, over the past two
years they have inflicted a very serious offensive against the Kachin
people in north Burma. Last week, Ban Ki-Moon
welcomed the agreement reached between the Government of Myanmar and
the Kachin Independence Organisation, calling it a first step towards
reconciliation in the country. Perhaps the Minister can share with us

months, a number of fragile preliminary ceasefires have been agreed.
However, there is a need not only for a ceasefire, but for a peace
process. As one Karen put it, “A ceasefire is simply pressing
the pause button, and we need to find a way to press the stop
button”. That can be achieved only 
<?notus-xml column=1235?>through a peace process that involves a meaningful political dialogue

military campaign which began two years ago has led to the displacement
of 100,000 Kachin civilians, at least 200 villages being burnt to the
ground, and 66 churches destroyed. Grave human rights
violations have included rape, torture and killings. A recent report by
Christian Solidarity Worldwide detailed the story of one Kachin who had
been jailed for a year. During his interrogation, he was hung upside
down for a day and a night, beaten severely, mutilated with hot knives,
and a grenade was shoved into his mouth, his torturers threatening to
pull the pin. One Kachin has said that, “The impact of the war
this time has been enormous. Many have lost land,
plantations, livelihoods ... people are living in the middle of
nowhere, hopeless, desperate, suffering”. What are the
Government doing to encourage the Government of Burma to develop a
serious political dialogue with the ethnic minorities? Those
nationalities comprise 40% of the population, inhabit 60% of the land,
and live predominantly along the country’s borders in some of
the most resource-rich areas that lie along the major trade routes. It
is therefore in Burma’s own interests, and those of the
international community, to see decades of war end and peace and
stability established. That can be achieved only through real political
dialogue. So far, the changes on the ground in Burma, welcome though
they are, amount primarily to a change of atmosphere rather than a
change of

to end by returning to the recent and shocking rise in religious
intolerance, hatred and violence. During my recent visit, I visited a
Muslim community in a village called Ayela, two miles from Naypyidaw,
which is the new capital. I arrived just three days after a large mob
of Buddhists from another area had attacked the village. In this
particular case no one was injured or killed, but only because they
were able to escape. In many other places, notably Meiktila and Oakkan,
there has been appalling loss of life. The tragedy is that, previously,
the Buddhists and Muslims had lived together for 200 years. However,
someone said to me, “We don’t even dare greet each other
in the street”. There are various theories about why this wave
of anti-Muslim violence has erupted. I would be interested to know what
role the Minister thinks that the militant group known as
“969” has played.</hs_para>

have made three earlier visits to Burma, the first 15 years ago,

However, the international community has a responsibility to do all it

Patten:</Member></B> My Lords, Burma is at grave risk of joining the
list of permanent world trouble spots as a failing state. On present
trends, it is sinking fast into a terrible cesspit of racial violence
and ethnic cleansing, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has just portrayed
so 
<?notus-xml column=1236?>graphically; he knows much more about it than I do. I believe that Burma
desperately needs three things. First, it needs enlightened
and outspoken healing democratic leadership; secondly, it needs a
miraculous outbreak—I believe in miracles—of religious
understanding and human decency between Buddhist, Muslim and Christian
alike; and, thirdly, its people need to recognise that unless they
bring about stability, they will fail to hoist themselves out of
poverty through economic development, something that is achievable

generation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:39:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with hindsight it seems much easier in Burma, as elsewhere, to foment
change out of a repressive regime than to embed the further necessary
changes thereafter. Remember the soundbite delights of the so-called
Arab spring a couple of years back. Tell that to the Copts in Egypt or
the Christians in Iraq or Iran alike. Where are the outright and
immediate appeals to human decency from the heroines and heroes of
recent political change in Burma? They are sadly but understandably
muted so

evidence at all of an outbreak of religious understanding in the face
of Burmese, Burman and Buddhist persecution of Muslims and Christians,
increasingly led—surprisingly, as they are religious—by
some gung-ho Saffron Revolutionary Monks, such as the Venerable
Wirathu, who said after last week’s burnings and killings, which
spread on 29 and 30 May to the north-eastern town of Lashio, to which
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has already referred:</hs_para>

say that the burnings and killings by Buddhist mobs in Meiktila was
“forgivable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:40:56"></hs_TimeCode>”.
The story is similar for the poor Baptists and others in Kachin, who
look as though they will face the fate of the Kurds in ever more
repressive Turkey, as we have seen in recent days in that country. To
an outsider like me, it looks as if the lessons of these recent changes
in Burma simply express that it is best not to be a minority of any
kind at all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:41:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The

one can only hope that economic change can ride to the rescue as the
majority of hard-working, decent Burmese of all religions realise that
this increasing endemic violence will prevent their experiencing the
rapid advances out of poverty that an Indonesia or a Thailand managed
so quickly in a couple of decades. The Burmese could grow their economy
by four or five times over the next 25 years with all the inward
investment that is needed to build a new deep-water port at Dawei or
roads into Thailand. It is a country that I read may soon experience
the delights of having a Coca-Cola bottling plant, but it will be among
pitiful poverty, with hardly an ATM in sight and hardly any mobile
phones or the other things that increasingly power democracy through
the messages that they

in the end, the realisation that they can lift themselves out of
poverty will produce that national miracle where there is, as yet,
neither much uplifting political leadership or an outbreak of human
decency among majority and minority groups. It could well be the engine
of social cohesion and national salvation for Burma—something I
never thought I would say of economic growth.</hs_para>

Williams of Baglan:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome this debate
and commend the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for initiating it and also for
his long-standing interest in human rights in Burma. I first visited
Burma in 1988, a few months after the suppression of the student
revolt, which left many thousands of students killed. Brave
students—braver than me—whom I met faced subsequent
harassment and in many cases imprisonment. I worked then for Amnesty

have visited Burma many times since, most recently in 2008, following
Cyclone Nargis, which ravished the country and claimed more than
140,000 lives. Terrible though that tragedy was, it may well have been
a turning point in modern Burmese history, forcing a reluctant and
harsh regime to recognise that it could not cope with the scale of the
disaster.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060592000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060592000003">When
I last visited, 12 months ago, I found a county much changed, despite
the continuing human rights violations that the noble Lord, Lord Alton,
and others have addressed this evening. That transformation is, I
believe, the most significant in Southeast Asia since the ousting of
President Suharto of Indonesia in 1998.
Over<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:59:12"></hs_TimeCode> the past 18
months, we have seen significant progress, although it remains one of
the poorest countries in the region and one with a human rights record
which, to say the least, needs to be addressed and improved greatly.

Cameron’s visit in 2012 was critically important and I wonder
whether the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, has any news of a return visit
by President Thein Sein, when many of the issues that have been brought
up here this evening could be addressed. I commend the Government for
what they are doing; in particular, DfID’s support in assisting
the process of ethnic reconciliation. Can the noble Baroness also say
more in that regard? I believe that the UK can, and should, play an
important role and am especially pleased by the current visit of the
Chief of the Defence Staff, General Sir David Richards. I hope that
that visit will lead soon to the appointment of a British military
attaché in Yangon. Any news on that would be welcome. The
Burmese Government have agreed to many ceasefires—or, more
appropriately, cessation of hostilities—over the years but they
lack the will and the capability to transform those tenuous agreements
into lasting political accords.</hs_para>

during that meeting. I hope that that is perhaps an indication of a
greater involvement by the UN in helping Burma in this difficult task
of ethnic reconciliation. The most difficult aspect of that at the
moment, as has been rightly addressed, is the situation affecting the
Muslim population of Rakhine state. The UK must follow that situation
closely, and guard against further substantial

contribution to this debate. Secondly, I co-chaired the Conservative
Friends of International Development. I recognise that Burma is a major
recipient of British aid but it is in need of even more humanitarian
assistance. Thirdly, I am contributing to this debate having met and
talked to Benedict Rogers, deputy chair of the Conservative Party Human
Rights Commission and a well known Burma specialist, who has visited
Burma many times, most recently with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in
March. Fourthly, last summer I put my name to a letter to the <I>Daily
Telegraph</I>, along with noble Lords from across the Chamber,
expressing concern about the desperate plight of the Rohingya people.
We called for emergency aid to all the victims of violence in Rakhine
state, pressure on Bangladesh to allow refugees fleeing persecution
across its borders, pressure on the Government of Burma to stop the
violence, a serious effort to revise, or repeal, the 1982 citizenship
law, which stripped the Rohingyas of citizenship, and a new citizenship
law in line with international human rights norms. I repeat those calls
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060592000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060592000008">I echo
many of the points already raised in this debate. Although it is indeed
absolutely right to recognise the extraordinary and welcome changes
taking place in Burma, to encourage further reform and to open a hand
of friendship to the people of Burma as the country opens up and moves
towards freedom, it is also essential that we recognise that Burma is
just at the very beginning of change, that the early signs of
increasing freedom are fragile and that there are many grave challenges
still to be
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060592000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060592000009">In
the time available, I wish to focus my remarks on a couple of these
challenges. First, as others have already noted in depth, the recent
anti-Muslim violence is of serious concern. Clearly, there are
attitudes within parts of Burmese society that are deeply troubling and
need to be addressed through public education and inter-religious
dialogue. Such efforts must be encouraged at grass-roots levels, as
well as at a national level. However, more urgently, it must be a
priority for the international community to urge the President and his
Government to end the climate of impunity and to ensure that the
security forces act swiftly, effectively and fairly to prevent
violence, stop violence when it is occurring, protect vulnerable
communities and bring the perpetrators of hatred
and violence to justice. Can my noble friend give her assessment of the
Burmese 
<?notus-xml column=1241?>Government’s response to these crises and say
what concrete steps Her Majesty’s Government are taking to
address these serious concerns with the Burmese
Government?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060592000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060592000010">Secondly,
I am very pleased that Britain has continued to increase aid to Burma
and has been the largest single donor to the country. That is a record
to be proud of. I am also pleased that, as part of our aid to Burma,
Britain has provided humanitarian assistance to displaced people within
the country and along the borders. However, as my noble friend will
know, there are two areas which are in particular need of further and
urgent assistance: Kachin state and Rakhine state. The war in Kachin
state has displaced at least 100,000 people and left more than 200
villages destroyed. In Rakhine state, more than 130,000 people, mainly
Rohingyas, have been displaced and are living in camps which the UN
Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief
Co-ordinator, the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, described six months ago
as “dire”. Will my noble friend tell the House what
efforts Her Majesty’s Government are making to secure
unrestricted access for international humanitarian aid to all displaced
peoples in Kachin and Rakhine states, including those outside
government-controlled territory, and what contribution Britain is
making to the needs of displaced people in these
areas?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060592000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060592000011">I wish
to end with one of the most serious challenges in Burma and an issue
that should be at the centre of Her Majesty’s
Government’s focus on the country, given that it is a personal
priority of the Foreign Secretary: sexual violence and rape as a weapon
of war. Over the past decade, hundreds of cases of rape and sexual
violence have been documented by women’s organisations in six
different states. Of the cases of rape that have been documented,
almost half are women who were raped and also killed. In Kachin state,
many women have been raped during the conflict over the past two years.
According to an article in the <I>Guardian</I> in February, Muslim
Rohingya women, including teenagers, were raped. Will my noble friend

on his tireless work for oppressed people and his commitment to obtain
first-hand evidence, enabling him to introduce this debate with
characteristic authority, knowledge and concern. I will focus on my
experience of recent visits to the Shan and Kachin peoples and meetings
with representatives of the Rohingya, Karen and Karenni ethnic
nationals. Of course I also welcome reforms, including the freedom of
the iconic democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi and the release of several
hundred political prisoners, although hundreds more remain in prison.
But all ethnic national peoples share fears that reforms may be used by
the Burmese Government to further their own agenda, including more
exploitation of their resource-rich lands. When I was in Shan state

Alton and other noble Lords, their plight remains dire with an increase
in anti-Muslim propaganda, attacks on communities and the destruction
of mosques, homes and businesses. The condition of those who have had
to flee into camps is desperate, with many dying from lack of medical

essentials.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13060593000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060593000004">In

bombardment of civilians and widespread violations of human rights such
as extra-judicial killings, rape and torture. We in HART visited Kachin
state in February and we saw the suffering of the people,
100,000 of whom have had to flee from aerial bombardment and ground
defences. We visited some of them living in destitution in makeshift
camps along the border with China and we heard gruesome accounts of
brutality inflicted on civilians. In Shan state fighting continues in
the north and the Burmese Government continue exploitation of this
resource-rich land. During our last visit to Shan state we met
civilians who had to flee their lands because of military offensives by
the Burmese army or expropriation of their land by deals made by the
Burmese Government with foreign investors, such as the pipeline being
built from India to China which has driven countless Shan civilians off
their lands with derisory or no compensation. We met one lady in a camp

the ragged clothes she was wearing, and she was one of

the gravity of the suffering of these ethnic national peoples, there is
widespread concern over the Burmese Government’s refusal to
allow access to international aid organisations, a point that has been
raised by other noble Lords. Other ethnic national peoples who have
signed cease-fire agreements, such as the Karen, emphasise that those
ceasefires are used by the Burmese Government to extend roads into
their lands, for possible future hostile military activities or to
increase the expropriation of their natural resources, such as teak and
other forms of timber. Although the Kachin leadership and the
Government have resumed talks, as has been mentioned by other noble
Lords, this is also simply seen as a precursor to a ceasefire and not
real peace. The Burmese Government have a sorry record of brokering and

Berridge:</Member></B> My Lords, when faced with such expert eye
witnesses to the tragic facts on the ground in Burma as those of the
noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and the noble Lord, Lord Alton, it is hard to
know what to add. But for outside observers I suspect the abiding image
is the satellite photo from late last year that so clearly showed the
destruction in Rakhine state. A picture does indeed speak more than
1,000 words. I will concentrate on the proposed international and
domestic actions which could assist in bringing to an end the ethnic
and religious intolerance against the Rohingya people. I declare an
interest as the chair of the All-Party Group on International Religious
Freedom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060593000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060593000009">At
international institutional level in the UN and the OIC there has been
much debate around international religious freedom as outlined in
Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Unfortunately,
the events in Burma bring sharply into focus the distinction between
protecting individuals’ human rights, which is what Article 18
enshrines, and protecting religions—in this case
Buddhism—which is not what Article 18 protects. The UN and
member states need to show in this situation that they can use soft
power, institutional mechanisms and financial pressure to protect the
Rohingya Muslim population. I had the privilege of accompanying the
Minister on a trip to Srebrenica in 2009. Of course there is a
different dynamic for the UN when you are actually physically present
as an atrocity such as Srebrenica occurs. But bearing in mind the
situation in Syria, I sense that there is a particular need for the
international institutions, especially the UN, to show that they can
effectively protect a Muslim population like the Rohingyas. Can the
Minister tell this House whether there is a danger of extremists
influencing Burma’s Muslims from neighbouring nations if the UN
fails to act to protect the Rohingya people? Also, could she outline,
due to her role in the Department for Communities and Local
Government, whether she has received representations from British
Muslims on this issue? Nowadays there are very few international issues
that do not have a potential domestic dimension.</hs_para>

religious issues are not always separable, it is clear from the
propaganda of the Buddhist monk Wirathu and the 969 campaign that
there is a religious dimension to these atrocities.
It is 
<?notus-xml column=1244?>sad to note that with the Rohingya people there
is almost certainly a racial dimension as well. There is
mention made in news reports such as in the<I> Guardian</I> in April
2013 that Wirathu’s teachings have large followings on YouTube
and Facebook, but does the Minister know if these followings are in
Burma as well? I join with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in
congratulating the BBC World Service for being the first international
news service to broadcast from a mobile platform in Burma where there
are now estimated to be 4 million mobile phone subscribers. But highly
developed states struggle with the issue of the boundaries of freedom
of expression on new technology. How are the Burmese Government coping
with this issue and might some simple assistance with monitoring and
removing footage have a huge effect and assist long-term peaceful

would particularly value my noble friend’s assurance that Her

Perhaps also the UN special rapporteur could be asked to look at the
use of new technology in promoting religious hatred. There is much that
can be done by the UK Government. Between 2011 and 2015 £187
million of UK taxpayers’ money will be spent on aid, according
to DfID’s operational plan for Burma. In that plan there is a
section entitled “Alignment to DfID and wider UK Government
priorities” and the Minister has been prioritising the work on
international religious freedom and Article 18. This alignment section
does not mention her priorities and as it is clear that there are
violations of Article 18 on the ground in Burma, should this not be
reflected in DfID’s plan? DfID support is given not to the
Burmese Government but only through United Nations organisations and
trusted international and local NGOs. Is Her Majesty’s
Government ensuring that the UN and these NGOs which are spending UK
aid are funding work that assists the understanding of religious
freedom at community level with Burmese
citizens?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060593000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060593000012">No

Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Lord,
Lord Alton. This debate takes place at a point where it is hard to make
completely clear judgments because the evidence has not, as yet,
pointed conclusively in any one direction. I found the latest report by
the special rapporteur on the human rights situation in Myanmar
particularly helpful. I know it is unedited, but it was published on 6
March and is therefore very recent. It is an attempt at a balanced
review, occasioned, 
<?notus-xml column=1245?>it appears to me, by a wish to give encouragement to former prisoners of
conscience and to sustain, and even increase, their remarkable and
brave efforts.</hs_para>

visited our Parliament, the admiration felt for her was evident. The
facts that she was no longer a prisoner, she was active in political
life in Burma and that she was able to speak and publish very widely
were all powerful signs of progress. Her measured optimism was an
encouragement and from what I heard of what she said, I conclude that
she was not overoptimistic. She is plainly wholly seized of the massive
issues in democratic life, the continued violence against opponents of
the Government, their military leadership’s actions, the deadly
assaults that still continue and the cultural subjugation of minority
peoples. In part because of what she had to say and in part because of
the changes that we can observe, we have also tended to add qualified
encouragement. Earlier today the noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford,
invited the Government to recognise the progress that has been made,
and in a way, he is right, as is the noble Lord, Lord Williams,
tonight. I know they are both far too wise to believe that things are
now okay or may not go into reverse. None the less, as the noble Lord,
Lord Williams, said this evening, ceasefires, prisoner releases and so
on are
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060593000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060593000015">The
noble Lord, Lord Alton, invites us to ask whether it is reasonable
enough for us to look at both sides of this balance sheet rather more
acutely and without any euphoria. Uncritical optimism is not a policy.
Last September, the President of Burma said that changes are
irreversible. Is that true? Eight amnesties have freed about 850
prisoners of conscience, but there are certainly in excess of 250 still
in prison, and it is unclear to me why any kind of special committee is
needed to oversee the process of their release. Does the Minister know
the rationale? How have representations made by the Government about
medical help for current and past prisoners or those who are in the
revolving door of repeated arrests been received? Do the Government
think that the Burmese authorities will ratify CAT and OPCAT and, if
so, when? Do the Government regard this, as I would, as a benchmark
test for eradicating the torture of detainees and others? How have the
Burmese Government reacted to representations that we have made on the
impropriety of imprisoning peaceful demonstrators? I know there have
been improvements in this area, but there have also been significant
lurches backwards.</hs_para>

Lord Patten, have illustrated the economic potential, if it were to be

process somewhat faster than evolution, which is a slow process. Let us
include active sponsorship of ethnic reconciliation, no impunity and
closer co-operation with China on these matters. Their roles, alongside

once again calling a timely and important debate. Burma is going
through a complex political and economic reform process. It will take
time and requires scrutiny, support and guidance from the UK and
like-minded partners in the international community to realise the full

Alton, who has visited the country, described horrific incidents, but
he noted the progress that is being made. Perhaps the most visible is
the growth in freedom of expression, including for NGOs and civil

civil society is active. We provide funding to support this, which

one that we will continue to monitor closely to ensure that progress is
made. We particularly welcome his clear commitment not to enforce
Section 401, under which released political prisoners can be returned
to jail to serve the remainder of their original sentence. We have
always emphasised that releases of political prisoners should be
unconditional and we are pleased that the Burmese Government have
publicly confirmed that they share that view. We will also continue to

accountability and the president has endorsed this but these

the Burmese Government to bring to justice all those accused of having
instigated, incited or carried out violence in Rakhine state. This
accountability needs to be delivered in a way that is transparent,
credible and in line with international standards. The EU-sponsored

citizenship was raised by a number of noble Lords. This remains
fundamental to resolving their statelessness. We have consistently said
that there needs to a sustainable solution to citizenship for the

make the point. The Rohingya community, most of whom have lived in
Burma for many generations, should be entitled to citizenship in line
with Burma’s current legal framework. Any further independent
work into the origins of the Rohingya community could have value on the
question of their citizenship. We are in close contact with the UN
which is reviewing the 1982 citizenship law to assess whether it is
consistent with international treaties to which Burma is a signatory.

last week has shown that there is still much more to do to prevent

the Burmese Government must ensure, in line with statements made by the

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, we now come to the black hole in this
legislation. Astonishingly, given the scale of the changes proposed for
a major national public service, the Bill does not deal with the
proposed restructuring of probation. It is quite remarkable that this
should be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:31:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

time to time about the Government’s habit of engaging in
pre-legislative implementation. What they are doing to probation is, in
fact, worse: they appear to be about to implement their
proposals without any legislation at all. What we see in the Bill is a
series of consequences of their proposals rather than a proposal. This
is in connection with a service which has met and exceeded all its
targets, which won the British Quality Foundation gold medal for
excellence for its achievements over many year and which has very high
ratings from those with whom it has to deal: 98% of victims approve of
the work of the probation service in the feedback that they have
supplied and 82% of supervisions were completed satisfactorily. The
record on the timeliness of reports to courts was as high as 99%. Only
just under 50%—49%—of what is by any standards a
difficult client group were placed in employment after serving their
probation order.</hs_para>

propose a massive change which will effectively exclude around half the
work of the probation service from its future deployment. Some 70,000
cases will be effectively privatised. The probation service will be
unable, in its present form, to bid to carry out the work which the
Government have determined will be subjected to competitive
tendering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:33:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

well in reducing reoffending. The Secretary of State has drawn
attention to the reoffending rates. He has noted that, for those
serving sentences of less than 12 months, reoffending rates have been
rising. We have heard today about the scale of the problem of that
group. Of course, that is a group for which the probation service has
no responsibility. Where it has responsibility, for those with longer
sentences, it has done extremely well in reducing reoffending. The
Government propose effectively first to nationalise and then virtually
to privatise most of the probation service. They will centralise
control. Probation trusts will disappear. There will be 21 areas in
which the work will now be carried out by tendering. This will mean
that much of the work currently carried out by the probation service,
and all the work on short-sentence offenders which has not been carried
out by the probation service but which the Bill seeks to
address—I repeat that we welcome that—will now be carried
out on a contractual basis.</hs_para>

one of the effects is likely to be a reduction in the degree to which
justice is local and greater difficulties for voluntary 
<?notus-xml column=1252?>organisations wanting to be involved in the work. There would
effectively be a binary system of risk, with categories of low and
medium risk to be dealt with by organisations other than the probation
service, but with the probation service being responsible for high-risk
cases. Of course, this appears to ignore the fact that there is
movement between the categories. Around 25% of offenders will change
from one category to another, many of them becoming
higher-risk.</hs_para>

shall return in greater detail when we discuss an amendment

protection that a properly administered probation service can afford in
the 15,000 or so cases a year that move into the higher risk category.

need a proper legislative framework for this exercise of transferring

usual, a touching faith in the competence of the private sector but
their record in this area of justice is not very convincing. There have
been the huge profits made in relation to an inefficient and inadequate
system of tagging, with many failures of the system and a great cost to
the public purse. The Minister will no doubt say that that has been
changed, that there will be new equipment, and so on. Be that as it
may, the original providers certainly did very well for themselves but
not very well in relation to the purposes for which they were
contracted. Just yesterday we heard the appalling news about the young
offender institution run by Serco, one of those massive organisations
that purport to be able to do everything anywhere. It was a terrible

Amendment 20 in the names of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and
myself is to seek to ensure that any change in the probation service
will take place only after the full details have been discussed and
approved by Parliament, rather than by executive order or, as it may
be, by statutory instrument. This is so important that it deserves to
be dealt with by primary legislation. That would certainly be my
preference. At the moment we do not have the details and I do not think
that the Government have worked them out. They are rushing to implement
this programme. Mr Grayling wants things in place in time
for the general election. This is too important an issue to be rushed

they will see the force of having their proposals properly scrutinised,

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord McNally):</Member></B>
Glottal or not, that is an extraordinary piece of chutzpah. He knows
full well that the powers that we are taking to reorganise the
probation service were embedded in his Government’s 2007 Act. It
is interesting to recall that during the passage of that Bill through
the House of Lords, the issue of parliamentary scrutiny of orders
creating, abolishing or amending probation trusts was highly
controversial. Originally the Bill did not include any parliamentary
scrutiny but the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee
identified it as an issue for further investigation. My noble friend
Lady Anelay of St Johns tabled an amendment successfully introducing
the affirmative resolution procedure to this clause in the Lords. The
then Government overturned the amendment during ping-pong by tabling
their own concessionary amendment providing for the negative resolution
procedure on the basis that that would provide sufficient scrutiny
without unduly taking up parliamentary
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:43:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Nothing was done behind the curtain or anywhere else. No one has ever
heard me, from this Dispatch Box or anywhere else, attack the record of
the probation service. The probation service does an excellent job, and
I hope it has a very clear future ahead of it a national
role<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
we have to ask whether these things could be done better and more
efficiently. As well as the successes of the probation service, we have
had as a background to this debate the very disturbing levels of
reoffending. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Beecham; the private
sector will be very much on trial during this period. We in government
who have been preparing the contracts and guidelines for this new
partnership will have to work very hard to make sure that they are
watertight in terms of delivering value for the
taxpayer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:44:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13060594000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060594000048">8.45

I said earlier in this debate, I have never hidden the nature of the
deal that was on the table to enable us to achieve the
reforms—the rehabilitation revolution— that we want,
which we said we wanted from the very first days we came into
government. <I>The Rehabilitation Revolution</I> was the
first Green Paper we published. It was abundantly clear that we could
not move forward on this front unless we found the elbow room, in a
budget that was already under the cosh, by looking for savings and
bringing in the expertise and experience of both the private and
voluntary 
<?notus-xml column=1254?>sectors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
We have made it very clear that whichever groups, confederations or
partnerships win this work, anybody with any idea of winning it will
have to demonstrate good working relationships and partnerships with
the voluntary and community sectors. We have invested some
£500,000 in grants to support the voluntary sector
organisations, enabling them to participate actively in the
rehabilitation
reforms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:46:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060594000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060594000035">That
is the background. Amendment 20 would require that any reorganisation
of the structure of the probation service would have to be approved by
a resolution of both Houses of Parliament. As noble Lords will know, on
9 May the Government published their strategy for reforming the service
to deliver offenders in the community. As part of that strategy we will
create the new public sector National Probation Service. I have said
before that I very much hope that the probation service will grasp the
opportunity to build, at national level, an influential and respected
organisation that will have massive responsibilities within this new
structure and whose fundamental role will be to protect the public from
the most dangerous offenders in our communities. Alongside this will be
open delivery of services for offenders in the community by a diverse
range of new rehabilitation
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T20:47:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060594000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060594000036">The
Government’s strategy for reform sets out concrete plans to
extend and enhance rehabilitation in the community. The Bill corrects
what is probably the biggest gap in the current system—that
those with the highest rates of reoffending currently get no help with
rehabilitation. The creation of the National Probation Service is
crucial to delivering this extended provision. Alongside the use of
competition and the introduction of voluntary and private sector
providers, the creation of a national service will allow us to deliver
the retained public sector functions in an effective, affordable
manner, deriving efficiencies from the economies of scale and
streamlined management structures. Without those efficiencies, we would
not be able to take forward our new approach, or to extend
rehabilitation to short-sentence offenders.</hs_para>

establishment, amendment and dissolution of probation trusts was
thoroughly debated in both Houses during the passage of the Offender
Management Act 2007. At that stage, the then Labour Government were
content that the negative resolution procedure provided an appropriate
level of parliamentary scrutiny for any changes. Bearing that in mind,
and the consultation that we have already undertaken on in this issue,
I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw his

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, we are in Committee and it is 9 pm, so
I certainly will not press an amendment on this occasion. However, I
must say that I am not persuaded by the arguments, such as they were,
put forward by the noble Lord. At a fairly early stage in his reply he
spoke of the savings that would be generated by the experience of the
private sector. However, the private sector does not have experience of
running probation. Serco, Group 4 and all these huge outfits which
purport to be able to run all kinds of things, from the Olympic Games
to prisons and many other services besides, do not have experience of
running probation.</hs_para>

from the impact analysis, about which we heard earlier, what the
financial implications will be. The noble Lord says that there will be
a good relationship with the voluntary sector. That was part of the
message that the Secretary of State used to sell the Work Programme in
his previous job. So successful was that scheme that some 3.5% of
people on unemployment benefit have actually been found a job. The
voluntary sector, which was at first quite enthusiastic about the
prospects, found itself effectively treated as bid candy and largely
excluded from any of the major programmes that were advanced. It is
rightly fearful that that will be the case if the Government’s
proposals are
implemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060594000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060594000040">The
noble Lord says that there is a need for a National Probation Service.
That is questionable. I certainly was not party to the discussions of
the legislation to which the noble Lord referred, but it is quite
conceivable that changes to the probation service as envisaged, to be
approved by the negative procedure, related to changes in the structure
of 35 probation trusts. What is being proposed here is something much
more radical. It is effectively the abolition of a probation
service—certainly the abolition of all the probation
trusts—and a centralisation that will be crucial to ensure that
the Government’s intentions in this Bill are carried
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060594000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060594000041">Of
course, however, the probation service, national or otherwise, is not
going to be involved in the short-sentence provisions. The probation
service will be excluded from providing for medium and low-risk
offenders. As I have said, the estimate is that 70,000 cases a year
will be run by the new private providers. There is no question, unless
the Government accept a later amendment of mine—I am not very
optimistic about that—which will allow the probation service to
tender for such work. The Government are so keen on competition that
they will not allow the probation service to tender for that work at
all. Therefore, I cannot see the argument that the noble Lord is trying
to make as being at all
plausible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060594000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060594000042">In
my view, we are seeing an ideological determination to limit the role
of a major public service. In so far as there is a national service, I
do not think that that is conducive to what is needed on the ground,
which is, as we have heard and as the noble Lord accepted when
discussing an earlier amendment, the need for close working
relationships between all the organisations involved in the
rehabilitation programme at local level. I cannot see how that can be
driven by a national body without any local organisational
manifestations. I have to say that it is arguable that 35 trusts is too
few anyway, but it is certainly better than none at all. It is
certainly better, whatever contracting system is being proposed, than
the 21 areas to which the Government will be reducing the tendering
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060594000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060594000043">This

then on Report we will have to take this issue further and at that

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, another aspect of the
Government’s proposals is the development of payment-by-results
programmes. I will begin by quoting the report of the Justice Select
Committee in August 2012. The committee said, of contracting out on a
payment-by-results basis,
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13060596000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060596000057">“we
are not convinced that the Department has the necessary commissioning
and contracting capability to achieve its objective. Currently its
commissioning processes are often poorly designed, the stages involved
do not whittle down contenders appropriately and bidders do not receive
sufficient feedback at the end of the process. Furthermore, the
potential benefits of payment by results programmes may not be realised
because of structural problems in the Department and the National
Offender Management
Service”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13060596000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060596000037">That
was as recently as August last year. Will the Minister say to what
extent these matters have been considered by the department, to what
extent the situation has now improved and in what respects it has
improved? It was a fairly damning indictment by the Justice Select

was some discussion of this issue at Second Reading, and many questions
were asked. The Minister—I think it was the noble Lord but it
may have been his colleague—said then that discussions were
taking place with potential providers. It would be interesting to know
at what stage those discussions now are. What is the basis on which a
payment-by-results scheme will be made? We have heard various
suggestions that there will be a flat fee, which will be topped up by
some kind of bonus. However, that is likely to be modest in relation to
the total cost of the service. If it is not modest, will contractors
take the risk? Who knows on what basis this will happen? There is very
little about this—of course—in the infamous impact
assessment. Will the noble Lord indicate what percentage of the total

are more questions to be asked. Will the scheme be the same for all

<?notus-xml column=1257?>whole group and study the reoffending
rates—or rather, as we heard earlier by way of clarification,
the reconviction rates. However, we do not know for what period that
will apply. Will results be judged on a year’s basis, or will
any offences taking place over a period of, say, two or three

entitled to an answer to that. If the Minister cannot supply it
tonight—I am not blaming him personally—I expect a reply

place?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060596000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060596000010">There
is another organisation—DrugScope—which has commented in
an interesting way about the proposal. It is not completely opposed to
the notion. However it recommends what it describes as a cautious and
gradual transition. It talks about the need to accumulate evidence and
for stocktaking in the light of experience. It suggests that only 10%
to 20% of the workload should be subjected to payment by results in the
first phase. It is taking a less oppositional view than mine and that
of my colleagues on this matter. Are the Government disposed to listen
to that point of view? If not, why not? These people are not as opposed
to it as some of us necessarily find ourselves. Incidentally, this is
an organisation which has been mounting pilots of its own in a
different area of policy, in drug and alcohol recovery. It started
pilots in 2012. The project is being monitored and evaluated by
Manchester University in a three-year study. DrugScope’s
recommendation is reflected, in part, in my amendment, which refers to
a three-year period. Incidentally, I did not know when I tabled the
amendment that this other experiment, as it were, was being piloted. It
was fortuitous that I proposed the same period as that endorsed by
DrugScope, but it seemed to me a reasonable one.</hs_para>

the Government wish to proceed on these lines, why will they not follow

troubling that so little has been disclosed about what is in the

service. I hope that the amendment’s aim of piloting proposals
properly before rolling them out will, on reflection, commend itself to
the Government. It is a much better way to approach this problem. The
Government clearly wish to pursue the concept of payment by results,
about which many of us have doubts. However, we might be convinced by

is all very well to talk about pilots and taking the time to conduct

so and then backed off. A lot of what we are dealing with here is a
long-standing problem that is still costing the economy a great deal of
money. Therefore, I think we are entitled to look at what works best in

and we already had the feedback from the pilots started by the previous
Government in Doncaster and Peterborough. I hear what the noble Lord,
Lord Beecham, is saying about our following a high-risk

doubt, demand significant effort by my department. What we have learnt
from the pilot schemes that have taken place, from the experience of

reoffending rates; of designing payment mechanisms that reward
providers only for achieving genuine success. We have looked at the
benefits of co-design with the market; early provision of data, where
possible; the importance of engaging with a wide range of voluntary

easy to get quotes from various organisations about this but we are

comments that the payment mechanism must incentivise providers to work
with all offenders, not cherry pick them, including the most prolific,

other areas, but this is a unique area. To begin with, it relates
ultimately in its potential impact to public safety, and we will
shortly discuss issues of risk. People’s lives and livelihood
are at risk in this area and that makes this a different case from less
dramatic eventualities, whatever the normal process of payment by
results might mean. The Government no doubt piloted the Work Programme;
that experience has been pretty much a disaster. What have the
Government learnt from that in terms of payment by results, whether on
the supply side, which turned out to be pretty exclusive when it came
to voluntary third-sector organisation, or in terms of the outcomes? It
would be interesting to know what areas the Government have tested and
with what results. I could table a Parliamentary Question but perhaps
the noble Lord can give an undertaking that either he or whatever part
of Government is responsible—perhaps the Cabinet
Office—will write instead and explain more fully the basis on
which the comparisons have been made. That would be an interesting
exercise.</hs_para>

in territory where it seems that decisions have been taken pretty much
on the hoof. Although I do not blame the noble Lord, we still have not
received an explanation for the withdrawal of the two pilots in this

know why they were stopped or what the evaluation was. I repeat now for
the third time—that makes four questions in all—why were
the pilots stopped, why have the Government refused the FOI request for
the evaluation and will they now release it? If they are not prepared
to do so, they must have something to hide or something which at least
they wish to ignore. That is not a satisfactory basis for a change of
the magnitude envisaged without discussion, other than by virtue of the
amendment. However, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

gavotte once again with the Minister. The issue of risk is serious
because it illustrates the potential dangers of this binary system of
provision, to which I referred earlier. The definition of the
categories of risk is somewhat controversial, to put it mildly, but we
leave that aside for the moment. The probation service will not be
responsible for low and medium-risk offenders, as defined, and is not
even allowed to tender for these offenders. Yet high-risk offenders
will be consigned exclusively to the probation
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060596000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0002.htm#13060596000025">As I
indicated earlier, there is a movement between categories of some 25%,
suggesting that something like 15,000 people were moved from the medium
to the high-risk category. How will that be dealt with under 
<?notus-xml column=1262?>the contracts? At what stage will the contractor who was looking after
offenders on the basis that they were medium and low risk be required
to notify a change of risk? Will they indeed be required to do so? Will
they be able to make that assessment? Will they be required to advise
the probation service about it? These seem to me to be important

recent assault, who was regarded as medium risk. Another was convicted
of wounding and had previous convictions for the possession of cocaine.
Another was convicted of manslaughter and also had a previous
conviction for manslaughter, but he was regarded as only medium risk. A
current offender convicted of grievous bodily harm, with previous
convictions for criminal damage and possession of a knife, was also
regarded as medium risk. There was an offender with a Section 20

all their past convictions, will be beyond the reach of the probation

rest of us. There are clearly very real risks in this course. My next

System provides a structure for National Offender Management Service
staff to assess an offender’s static and dynamic risk factors
and risk of serious harm. It is a nationally recognised and understood
tool that is supported by national guidance for probation and prison
staff. The OASys combines actuarial factors, such as age at first
conviction and gender, and dynamic factors such as substance misuse or
anti-social attitudes, as well as clinical judgment. Following a
structured assessment process, offenders are allocated to a risk of
serious harm category that ranges from high to medium to low. A range
of potential future harms are considered, including harm to self, to
staff, to known victims and to members of the public. Within the
current assessment process, there are already agreed definitions for
what constitutes high to low risk of serious harm. “Serious
harm” is defined as an event which is life threatening and/or
traumatic, and from which recovery, whether physical or
psychological, can be expected to be difficult or impossible. The risk
of serious harm is the likelihood of this event happening.</hs_para>

that the risk of serious harm that an offender poses is dynamic and
should be kept under regular review. There are numerous behavioural
changes that could indicate an increase in the level of risk of serious
harm. It would be difficult to enshrine that range of behavioural
change in law which could apply meaningfully to individual cases. The
current assessment process enables a practitioner to use all the
available information to assess whether an offender is at risk of
causing serious harm and give differential weight to the information as
it relates to that individual. Under the rehabilitation programme, the
National Probation Service will decide on allocation, in each case
using a set of clear rules. They will retain management of every
offender who poses a high risk of serious harm

paid by results. I apologise for skipping, as it were, Amendment 22. I
heard what the Minister said, but the reality is that the probation
service will not be allowed to tender for the short-term prisoner
contracts. Whether there are probation trusts or not, that is a
mistake. If we are going to have a mixed economy, let it be a mixed
economy, and let at least the probation service be allowed to tender.
But even if it is not allowed to tender, perhaps the noble Lord would
consider whether other agencies—for example, local authorities
as they are involved in crime and disorder reduction
partnerships—might be allowed to tender. The Minister may be
able to respond to that. I do not

relation to the risk issues, the problem will potentially arise out of
the change of risk. Perhaps the Minister will not be able to reply to
this immediately, but if a proportion are deemed to have changed their

talking about cohorts not individuals, but we are talking
about potentially 15,000 cases. Even with 35 contract areas,
that is several hundred people per contract area. Presumably, it will
have some significance. We are not talking about a minuscule proportion
of cases. How will that impact on the contractual
arrangements? What provision will there be in the contract regarding
that particular outcome? Again, this is not something that I
necessarily expect the Minister to be able to respond to tonight, but I

The amendment simply seeks the collation of information from providers,
whether of probation services or otherwise, so that it can be collated
in an annual report and received in Parliament. I think that is
certainly necessary in the early years, although maybe when the system
settles down, in whatever form it ultimately takes, it will be a
different matter. However, given the sensitivity around the proposals
and, as the Minister himself puts it, the “radical”
nature of the proposals—and bearing in mind our shared objective
here, which is to reduce reoffending and to afford as much support as
we can to people who have offended but need to reintegrate into
society—it seems to me that the request that the information
should be available to us is a fairly basic one. I hope the Minister

McNally:</Member></B> An extended determinate sentence or EDS is the
sentence that is given to dangerous offenders. This is the sentence
that replaced the IPP sentence in December 2012 as a result of the
changes made in the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders
Act. An EDS is made up of a custodial term whereby offenders serve at
least two-thirds of the sentence, after which the most serious
offenders are considered for release by the parole board. After
release, offenders are subject to extended-licence supervision. Clause
8 essentially closes a loophole whereby offenders serving an EDS could,
although only in wholly exceptional circumstances, spend less than 12
months under supervision on release. Clause 8, by requiring the
extension period of licence for these sentences to be at least a year,
ensures that in every case offenders released from custody will serve
12 months under supervision. It is highly unlikely that an extended
sentence would be imposed that resulted in less than 12 months of 
<?notus-xml column=1267?>supervision. For this to happen, the sentence
imposed by the court would have to relate to a dangerous offender who
had received a surprisingly short custodial period where the court had
chosen not to extend the licence period. I should stress that this is
extremely unlikely to occur and there is no example of it having
happened but we are taking the opportunity of this Bill to ensure that
it does not happen in the

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I am thankful to the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, for summarising his thinking behind this amendment. Clause 10
amends Section 64 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000,
which allows for the Secretary of State to impose a drug testing
requirement on offenders aged 18 or over released from prison on
licence. The Bill deals with efforts to improve the rehabilitation of
offenders and to cut reoffending. Many noble Lords will agree that
tackling offending behaviour will often mean tackling an
offender’s problem with drugs. Drug use is common among
offenders serving custodial sentences. One study reported 64% of people
surveyed as having used class A drugs and 74% as having used class B or
class C
drugs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060598000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0003.htm#13060598000012">Research
has also shown that drug use among prisoners is strongly associated
with reconviction on release, with the rate of reconviction more than
doubling for prisoners who reported using drugs in the four
weeks before custody, compared with prisoners who had never
used drugs. And it is not just class A drugs that are 
<?notus-xml column=1268?>associated with higher reconviction rates. Offenders who use class B or
class C drugs in the four weeks before imprisonment had a reconviction
rate of 48%, compared to 30% for those who had never used drugs. What
drives this association will vary from offender to offender. For some
offenders who are dependent on, say, cannabis or amphetamines, their
crime may be linked to the need to fund their drug habit. For others, a
propensity to misuse such drugs may expose them to other offenders,
risky environments or situations that encourage further reoffending.
That can make the process of rehabilitation that much harder. If a
connection, direct or indirect, with class B drugs, such as cannabis or
amphetamines, is a factor in a significant number of offenders ending
up in custody or reoffending, we should do what we can to support
offenders to break that connection. Testing for class B drugs is
designed to complement those
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060598000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0003.htm#13060598000013">Turning
to the substance of the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham, Section 70 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000
currently provides a power for the Secretary of State to specify via
statutory instrument the class A drugs for which an offender released
on licence can be tested. This power is subject to the negative
resolution procedure. In extending this order-making power to cover
class B drugs, we have proposed to keep the negative resolution
procedure. It is important that if changes need to be made to the
list—for example, if drugs are reclassified or renamed or new
drugs appear—that can be done quickly. When initially specifying
what class B drugs are within scope, we will, of course, want to look
in detail at the evidence for their usage by offenders, their links to
reoffending and the availability of testing equipment. I should also
point out to noble Lords that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee did not raise any issues with this extended power
remaining subject to the negative resolution procedure. I hope the
noble Lord, Lord Beecham, will feel able to withdraw his

Beecham:</Member></B> My Lords, this is yet another proposal from the
Government that is not included in the Bill and about which there again
seems to be no real opportunity for parliamentary oversight. The notion
of resettlement prisons is attractive, but there are a number of
questions to be asked about it, in particular, about how the system is
going to work and the potential costs. There are also questions in
relation to women prisoners especially because at the moment there are
only 13 prisons for women and there is concern that, since they are not
evenly geographically distributed, women may be housed in one place and
then moved to what is, effectively, an all-male institution close to
their home because there is no women’s prison in that area.
There is concern that that would be potentially very difficult. I do
not know whether the Government have in mind locations for the
resettlement prisons. The figure was about 70, if I remember correctly.
Have they given any thought to the position of women in that context,
given the relatively small number of women’s prisons dedicated
for that
purpose?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1306061000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-0003.htm#1306061000002">By
sheer coincidence, the Minister has kindly replied to a Written
Question today giving me information about the home locations—he
is looking puzzled; I assure him he has—of prisoners held in the

concern that I and other noble Lords have or might have about the
situation. They show that 59% of young offenders have home addresses
outside the north-east region and 39% inside it. So 39% of young
offenders are in prison in the area where resettlement would occur but
59% are not. The 2% difference is because the data are not clear. The

The letter says that the vast majority of prisoners transferred to NOMS
North East Region are from adjacent areas. An adjacent area could be
the north-west of England. I know that there are significant numbers of
prisoners from the north-west of England in prisons in Northumberland.
The north-west region runs from Cumbria to Cheshire. To say that is an
adjacent region does not take us very far, especially as I suspect most
of the offenders will come perhaps from the Merseyside and Manchester
conurbations. That would be a reasonable inference. This is a
significant number of people to be resettled somewhere nearer home and
that is just from one region. How much have the Government thought
through the implications of dealing with this? Have the Government
given consideration not only to the numbers but the length 
<?notus-xml column=1270?>of time during which the resettlement will take
place? I raise this point because it has been raised by organisations
concerned with women prisoners especially. Has it been looked at from
their perspective?</hs_para>

says, in a point which rather echoes the point about women prisoners
and which may account for the figures for young offenders, that there
are fewer establishments holding young offenders and they are on
average likely to be further from their home area. How realistic is
this resettlement process likely to be? It looks to me as though the
north-east region is accommodating considerably more than its
“fair share” of prisoners. It would be interesting to
know how many north-east prisoners are housed elsewhere but I suspect
that we have a surplus of accommodation in the north-east and that is
not going to assist in the resettlement process. How developed are the
Government’s plans? The amendment therefore seeks details and
for a scheme to be set out in regulations and laid before both Houses
for debate. That would be ideal but at any rate some oversight of the
detail and the implications of this scheme are needed, which as I say
is welcome in principle but it is difficult to see quite how it is
going to work. It may be that the Government are going to take some
time over this and that may be necessary, but any indications at this
stage would be gratefully received. I beg to

would restrict the ability of the Secretary of State to set up a system
for sending prisoners to resettlement prisons prior to their release by
requiring this to be done in regulations. Such a restriction would be
unprecedented intervention by Parliament in the operational management
of prisons. The role is conferred by the Prison Act 1952 on the
Secretary of State, although, in practice, the Prison Service is run by
the National Offender Management Service, as noble Lords are aware. The
power is a broad one for a very good reason: NOMS needs
operational flexibility to respond swiftly to fluctuations in prison
numbers and to move prisoners around the prison estate for a number of
reasons, including access to appropriate interventions as a result of
security information or, indeed, for the prisoner’s own
protection. Policies for the allocation of prisoners are set out in the
Prison Service instructions, which are published; accordingly, such
policies are both accessible and transparent. I therefore hope, with
the explanation I gave given, that the noble Lord will find it
appropriate to withdraw his amendment and agree that operational

Second Reading, the Minister said that the Bill would establish a

mesothelioma and their eligible dependants but he later amended that

the Secretary of State power to create, amend, replace or abolish the
scheme within the certain broad parameters referred to in Clauses 4, 5,
6 and 10. Parliament has no say in the details of the scheme or in any

by regulations, but in Clause 4 there is provision for the payments to
be made subject to conditions, or for the payments to be repaid in
whole or in part in specified circumstances. Again, these decisions are

are further provisions relating to the scheme in Clauses 6 and 10 which
are left to the unfettered discretion of the Secretary of State. These
may not be in the best interests of claimants—we simply do not
know—and it would be helpful if my noble friend could say
whether, before any of these decisions, drafts will be published for
consultation with the stakeholders. In the period leading up to the
publication of the Bill, the Minister told us at Second Reading, there
were 15 meetings with the insurance industry and 11 with
representatives of victims’ groups, lawyers and members of the
APPG. If the Government had to come back to Parliament they would have
some incentive to continue with these consultations on the scheme and
on the amendments to it which may be made in the

am sure that the Government would not like it to be suspected that the
industry’s largesse entitled it to any special favours. Your

having taken only a brief glance at the draft rules, I believe that
they are well capable of being embodied in a statutory instrument and
achieving the force of law on that basis. That must be right because
the authority to create the scheme is vested in the Secretary of State
by statute. Parliament will have a continuing close concern as to the
way the scheme operates and Members of Parliament in another place, in
particular, will want to be able to hold the Government to account on
the specifics of the scheme in the interests of those of their
constituents who, most unhappily, have contracted this disease or are
dependants of people who have contracted mesothelioma. We are happy
that the Minister should negotiate the scheme, but the Secretary of
State will take responsibility and Parliament needs to be satisfied as
to the specifics. All

it is curiously inconsistent; it dips in and out. At a number of points
it stipulates that the details of the scheme are to be determined by
statutory instruments but in other important respects it does not. The
rules of the scheme at the moment, and the manner in which the
technical committee is to be established, are also to be made by
so-called arrangements. Yet these arrangements would create a
jurisdiction, in the language of the Bill, and it cannot be
satisfactory that matters of this importance should be established
under either negotiation or so-called arrangements. Accountability to
Parliament, by way of statutory instruments, is weak enough, and it
would evaporate entirely if these matters were established merely on
the basis of
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060573000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060573000017">Amendment
3 says that in the absence of a requirement for a procedure by way of
statutory instruments, the Secretary of State should at least publish
his proposals for a scheme and arrangements, together with a rationale

have started on that process and I draw some encouragement from
that.</hs_para>

6 is a little different because it does not say anything about
statutory instruments or parliamentary procedure. It requires that the
Secretary of State should publish an annual report about the
performance and progress of the scheme. The reason why I thought that
it was appropriate to put it in this scheme is that it is another
device to achieve accountability to Parliament. This would be ex post
facto accountability; it would not remedy a failure to enable
Parliament to scrutinise the details of the proposals in advance and to
make a decision as to whether to accept, amend or reject them, but it
would enable Parliament to review the scheme annually.</hs_para>

annual report should be published and the procedures whereby Parliament
would examine that annual report and hold the Government to account on
it are for consideration. However, I would suggest that its content
should include details on the body that is administering the scheme,
the levy, the volume of cases, the proportion of mesothelioma sufferers
who are assisted by way of this scheme, the speed and ease of the
procedures for claimants, information on how the portal is working, the
activities of the technical committee, how many cases have gone to
arbitration, the range of payments that are made under the scheme and
their relation to court awards, what the legal outlays for the scheme
have been, the number of appeals and of cases that go to the tribunal,
the amounts recovered by the Department for Work and Pensions in
different categories, the administrative costs of the scheme, and any
modifications or reforms that the Secretary of State might be minded to
propose. No doubt there are other matters that could usefully be

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, the two amendments in this
group, Amendments 7 and 8, would extend eligibility under the scheme to
two classes of people who, as I understand it, are not eligible under
the Bill as drafted and the scheme as proposed. The two classes of
people are those who are self-employed and were exposed to asbestos and
in the course of time contracted mesothelioma,<I> </I>and family
members who have contracted this appalling and fatal disease as a
result of doing the laundry of an employed person who came back home
with asbestos fibres on his workwear. There will have been many people
who were self-employed in the building trades and the construction
industry over the years. I do not know whether the department has any
information as to the numbers. It would be helpful to the Committee if
the Minister were in due course able to give us an idea of the scale of
this problem.</hs_para>

severe view of the case of a self-employed person who did not insure.
He may argue that it is unfair to insurers that they should pay a levy
into a scheme to compensate someone who failed to insure when it was
his own responsibility as a self-employed person to do so. To that, I
would say that the whole Bill is based on rough justice; competent,
respectable insurers are required to pay for the dereliction of their
colleagues in the insurance industry who lost or even wilfully
destroyed documents. There is also rough justice for the recipients,
who are invited to be content with 70% of the amount that they might
receive in an award from a court. On the other hand, the self-employed
and their dependants suffer exactly the same as employed people and
their dependants. There seems to me to be a strong moral case for
treating them
alike.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060573000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060573000037">The
Minister may pleasantly surprise me, but if he does not take that
severe view of the case of those who did not insure on their own
behalf, what of self-employed people who died insured but whose
documents have gone missing? The insurance company no longer has them
and, although there is tentative evidence that a self-employed person
was insured, it is not substantial and the case cannot be proved. Why
should not a person in that predicament be covered by the scheme? They
and their dependants are in exactly the same boat in terms of suffering
and loss as employed people.</hs_para>

us also consider the predicament of wives, partners,
daughters—family members, people in the same

washing. I am personally aware of the cases of three people where that
has occurred. It is entirely possible that someone could catch
mesothelioma through washing the workwear of their partner or parent
where the employed person has not, although they may contract it
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:06:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
dependant, the family member, the person caught in that situation, is
equally the victim of an employer’s neglect. It seems morally
wrong not to include such people in the scheme on the technicality that
the person who was the employee has himself not been diagnosed.
Insurers ought to be willing to embrace those people within the

in that predicament are eligible for compensation under the 2008

that we are now considering. Again, it would be helpful if the Minister

bigger issue, which I do not think that he has spotted. That is that in

re-equip its own boiler rooms on the three vessels which have had the
biggest ever death rates: HMS “Britannia”, HMS
“Albion” and HMS “Furious”. Therefore, all

a very serious concern here regarding the naval forces. As the Minister
knows as a result of our meeting the other day, there was a discussion

to my concern about the repeal of Section 10 of the Crown Proceedings
Act 1947 and its replacement by the Crown Proceedings (Armed
Forces) Act 1987, which had the effect of precluding any claim for
asbestosis against any single person of the Armed Forces from anyone
who had failed to put in a claim for an identifiable disease at that
time. There were only 10 years in which such a disease could be
identified, but we are talking here of a 30-year incubation period. In
the region of 200 members of the Armed Forces are currently
still at huge risk—it is virtually an inevitability—of
suffering from this terrible disease and absolutely nil provision or
obligation rests on the armed services to look after them or their
dependants. I think that somewhere down the line we need to alter this

worked in the shipyards on the Tyne and the Wear, and who had been
exposed to asbestos. However, I also saw, not under my direct care but
under the care of colleagues, some women who developed mesothelioma
because they had been involved in washing the clothes of their
husbands, who had been exposed to asbestos—clothes which were
deeply impregnated with asbestos fibre. For that reason, I would say
that this issue does not rest just on the balance of probabilities; in
my view, it is beyond all reasonable doubt that they developed
mesothelioma because of that

Martin of Springburn:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very interested in
the question of families being exposed to asbestos. I draw on my own
experience as an apprentice metalworker in the mid-1960s. Sometimes
there would be a rush job to manufacture electric heaters. Asbestos
board was used to hold the elements in those heaters. It was therefore
required to drill dozens of holes in that board. As young apprentices,
we were not trained in the dangers of asbestos. Strangely enough we
quite liked it when there was a rush job, as we got some overtime. The
metal was covered in oil and it used to go on our clothes. Meanwhile,
you just blew the dust off the nice white board and you did not realise
that any harm was being done.</hs_para>

raising is that in the factory where I worked there were dozens of
young ladies, in the same age group as myself, who assembled the
electric heaters. They were usually given the same job to do every day.
Two of my female colleagues, two sisters, spent all day drilling the
asbestos board, regardless of whether there was overtime. There was
what was called stack drilling: there were maybe five or six boards
packed together in what was known as a jig, and 24 or 25 holes were
drilled. When the drill went through, the asbestos went all
over.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060573000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060573000056">It was
those sisters’ mum who did the washing in their household. In
the communities that I lived in, in the mid-1960s, washing machines
were a luxury; they 
<?notus-xml column=215?>were not in every home. Later, I had the good fortune to represent the
constituency where I had served my apprenticeship. At that time I spoke
to one of these young ladies and asked her how she was getting on and
how her mum was keeping. She never mentioned asbestos but she said,
“Mum’s getting breathless”. I did not have the
heart to say directly, “Have you checked out whether it’s
asbestos-related?”, but I said that she had best make sure that
her mum got to the doctor. It was a worry of mine that her mum may well
have contracted a condition because she had two hard-working daughters
who worked every day with white asbestos
boards.</hs_para>

I received about one of my noble friend’s amendments, but not
about the other. It is the omission of the other amendment that

is the argument that the insurers make and I understand why they make
it. The association then goes on to imagine that most people who worked
in this industry may have been employed at one time and self-employed
at others, and that is probably right—there will have been
people who were exposed to these fibres both in an employed and in a
self-employed capacity. Because of the way in which these cases are
dealt with in the courts, that will not disqualify these people from
being included in the payment scheme. However, the 
<?notus-xml column=216?>association goes on to make a point which I think it believes is crucial
to its argument but which actually grossly undermines it. In the last
sentence it
says:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="13060573000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060573000078">“There

us assume that the phrase “very small category” is the
equivalent of “a very small number”. I am not quite sure
why the association used the word category; I think that it means a
very small number of people. If indeed that is right, and if indeed we
are doing an injustice by excluding a very small number of people from
this scheme, that is an argument for extending the scheme to that very
small number of people, because it would be
grossly—disproportionately—unfair to exclude
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:23:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060573000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060573000062">The
second point relates to Amendment 8, which essentially proposes
extending the scheme to those who have been exposed in a secondary way
to asbestos but through exactly the same route as those who are
employed and covered by compulsory employer’s liability
insurance, or who would have been covered had it been in existence
prior to 1972. That is the way in which the payment scheme is
constructed. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:24:38"></hs_TimeCode>
strikes me as very odd that the Association of British Insurers does
not deal with this issue at all in the brief. As I have listened to the
debate unfold in the Grand Committee this afternoon, I have wondered
why that was the case. I can certainly figure a set of circumstances
where there is a traceable employer and where there is a secondary
infection. If a man comes home from the shipyard with fibres on his
clothes it does not matter whether they are washed—if the fibres
get into the air of the environment in which his children or other
relatives live and they breathe them in, they are at risk of developing
mesothelioma eventually if these fibres are trapped in the fibres of
their
lungs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T16:24:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060573000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060573000063">There
must be cases where that negligent act has caused secondary infection
and mesothelioma and there has been a successful litigation against the
employer of the person who carried the fibres. So there is a
chain—a direct link—and the person who would be sued
would be the employer.</hs_para>

answer to this, because I do not know the details of the
employer’s liability compulsory insurance scheme well enough.
However, I ask the Minister, if he can tell us at some stage during the
course of our deliberations, whether the insurers pick up the payment
for the successful litigation because they were the insurers in the
employer’s liability policy, or because of public liability
insurance, which is a separate and different but compulsory insurance
for people who are in workplaces. Either way, this is likely to be the
same group of insurers. I suspect that it may be through the route of
the employer’s liability compulsory insurance, and if that is
correct, may it be the case that this payment scheme already applies to
their efforts? I am not sure whether it does or not, but if it
definitely does not, it definitely ought to. Since these general
insurers, who carried or presently carry the risk of employer’s
liability compulsory insurance, are likely to be the same people who
are carrying the risk of public liability insurance, I am sure that the
Minister can persuade them that it should.</hs_para>

Golding:</Member></B> My Lords, I have been discussing this Bill with a
number of people in my former constituency. I was told by a former
employer that, 10 years ago, his firm was employed to do
some work in the boiler house of a prison. He was told that there was
no asbestos on the site and the men started work. On visiting the site
himself, he was not convinced that this was correct, so he got samples
and paid for a scientific analysis of the work on the site. The site
was dangerous and contained asbestos. The Health and Safety Executive
was called in and immediately closed down the site. The employer was
told that he could not prosecute the Crown but that he may be able to
prosecute the governor of the prison. Needless to say, he did not
bother to do that. He did, however, keep a file of all the details of
what had happened in the firm’s papers. He sold the firm on, and
it has been sold again since. I hope that the papers are still there.
What will happen in a case like that, where the liable employer was the
Crown, which the contracted employer was told could not be sued? The
contracting employer was not to blame but the Crown certainly was. Will

brief point. The first formal recognition of this disease in Britain

other than in a situation where the fibres are present. Therefore I am
speaking specifically in support of the wives and families who may have
been affected. There must surely be a case for accepting, after 80

series of dominoes. First, you had to prove that X employer

points to the very extensive and knowledgeable debate that has taken
place. It seems that some very telling points have been made and
pressed upon the Minister about the scope of the scheme before us,

want to be doing so in a way which does not hold up the core of this

self-employed, can the Minister clarify quite what definitions we are
using here? Over the years in various circumstances, the
differentiation between somebody who is employed and somebody who is
self-employed is quite narrow. We know that in some
industries—the construction industry in
particular—self-employment arrangements were, in a sense,
manufactured when the reality was that there was an employment. That
might have been done for tax reasons or for other reasons, so
clarification of the definition of “employee” and
“employer” for the purposes of the Bill would be
helpful.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060580000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000011">The
issues raised by my noble friend Lord Browne are of particular interest
in relation to those who were not necessarily formally employed but for
whom the negligence of an employer might have caused them to contract
mesothelioma. That is important because through the Child Maintenance
and Other Payments Act 2008—it was the other payments that
related to mesothelioma—the last Government introduced a support
scheme for those who contracted mesothelioma but not directly because
of employment. If those employers or their insurers can now or could in
the future be reached, it seems that the Government themselves have an
interest in recouping some of the compensation paid, which I hope can
be redeployed to improve those schemes for others.</hs_para>

the question of the liability of the Crown and of public departments

scope of the scheme or the compass of this particular Bill to take

one amendment in a group that deal with the start date or, as it might

amendment in the group. It would simply abolish the start date of 25

then encompass anyone who is still alive and contracts mesothelioma in

Freud, explained to us at Second Reading that the case for
disqualifying anybody who was diagnosed with the disease before 25 July
2012 was that it was only at that moment, when he made a Statement to

introduce this scheme, that the insurers could start to reserve to meet
the costs of the scheme. I would certainly take the view that at the
very least, we should go back to the date at which my noble friend Lord
McKenzie of Luton, the Minister’s predecessor, announced his
consultation with a view to introducing the scheme on 10 February 2010.
From that moment onwards, the contingency was clearly foreseeable by
the employer’s liability insurers. I would go further even than
my noble friend Lord McKenzie goes in his amendment. I would simply say
that the insurers should always have reserved. That is what insurance

their duty, as it always has been, to reserve adequately to meet

money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060580000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000044">The
Minister said in response to my intervention on Second Reading that if
there were to be an amendment such as I have now tabled, it would cost
a huge amount. It would be helpful if he were able to tell the
Committee his best estimate of how much that would be. I contend that,
although it will undoubtedly be a substantial sum, the industry can
afford it. It would hate to have to pay it, but it can afford it. My
noble friend Lord Wills made this point in the preceding debate. For
decades, they coined money. They made a very great deal of money,
particularly in insuring against long-latency diseases, because they
did not have to pay out for such a long period.</hs_para>

course, there were insurers who made a mess of their business and got
themselves into terrible trouble with long-term insurance, but the
opportunity was  
<?notus-xml column=225?>there for them to make money on an heroic scale, if we consider the
effect of compound interest. I do not have the figures to hand, but DWP
officials are adept at making computations and one of the officials
sitting behind the Minister may be able to do this sum before the
Minister responds. Supposing, illustratively, a premium of £100
was paid and was invested at 5% compound annual interest over 30 years,
that will have turned into a very substantial sum indeed. If it was
invested over 40 years, which can be the period of incubation of the
disease, it will be a very much greater sum still. It would be
interesting to know what the cash figure would be and what the
percentage increase would have been in those

make that point because I think that the figures would be startling and
illustrate that, provided that the insurers have not simply squandered
all that premium income or invested it disastrously badly, they could
not but have made substantial sums of money. I think that they are
better placed than they have let on to the Minister in his strenuous
negotiations with them to pay decent amounts of money towards the
scheme and to extend the range of
beneficiaries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T17:02:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060580000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000047">It
seems desperately arbitrary and unjust to exclude victims who were
diagnosed before 25 July 2012. All of us have received briefing that is
distressing to read about the hardship that families have experienced,
such as bereaved people losing their homes. The Minister has a heart;
we know that. He has toiled long and hard to achieve agreement with the
industry on the scheme before us. I do not doubt that he has battled
with the Treasury, which was no doubt less than enthusiastic about it.
I am sure that he is susceptible to the emotional force of the case. If
he fears that the insurance industry will revert to its default posture
of litigating against any attempt to extract money from it, I hope that
he will be fortified by two considerations. First, if he accepts my
amendment, or any of the others, he will have statute on his side.
Secondly, if he fears that the employer’s liability insurers
will take legal action against him, he might also fear that the
families, the claimants, might take legal action on the basis that they
have been most unjustly discriminated against by the cut-off
date.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060580000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000048">The
principle is there and the practicalities ought to be thought about. On
a rough calculation, if 1,200 people were to be added to the number of
beneficiaries by extending back eligibility by a year—people who
were diagnosed with mesothelioma before then will, sadly, be
dead—and if the average payments under the scheme is expected to
be £87,000, it might cost an additional £100 million to
allow for full back-dating. Of course, £100 million, in my view,
is not a trivial sum, but it just happens to be the same sum as the
saving that my right honourable friend Ed Balls has just proposed to be
made by not paying the winter fuel allowance to richer pensioners.
Downing Street dismissed that and said that £100 million in
public expenditure is a trivial sum. Therefore, if the Minister thinks
it is unreasonable to require the industry to pay, and if it is the
stated view of this Government that £100 million of public
expenditure is trivial, then they should pay for the inclusion of all
mesothelioma sufferers and their dependants and get on with it. I beg

that he raised during our discussion on Monday, the Minister may also
say that the insurers may be concerned about their right to
property—that is, to compensation—under the Human Rights
Act. However, asbestos victims lost not only their compensation, or
right to property, but their right to life, and two years’
back-dating seems a very small concession to make in that context. The
noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport, is right: surely there would be a
case for some of those affected by the Bill to challenge the Government
in the courts. I should be grateful if the Minister would tell us what

perhaps especially consider that the commencement of the consultation

a point that the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, mentioned concerning
reserves. The Minister says that he cannot set an earlier date because
only at the date of the announcement could insurers have begun to
reserve against making payments. However, for two years the ABI
discussed the detail of a payment scheme with the Minister, and it can
hardly have woken up on 25 July 2012, shocked that it would have to
reserve against making scheme payments. Just as importantly, surely it
should have been reserving against asbestos claims 50 or more years
ago, as the noble Lord, Lord Freud, himself implied when prefacing his
speech at Second Reading. He did so with a reference to the Newhouse
Thompson report, to which I have already alluded and which was

honoured at least from the date of the publication of the consultation.
The date of the publication of the consultation set alight that
expectation and it has flamed ever since that time. It took more than
two years for Ministers to respond to the consultation on 25 July 2012,

main issue underpinning these amendments, I, too, have had
representations from those supporting people with mesothelioma
concerned about their exclusion or potential exclusion from the scope
of the scheme. Imposing a limitation to people diagnosed on or after 25
July 2012, which of course is more than two years after the close of
the consultation, means that, as my 
<?notus-xml column=229?>noble friend Lord McKenzie noted at Second Reading, probably some 600
people will have died from mesothelioma during that time. As those
representations have said, it seems very unfair that they should be
excluded from the scheme. This is a point very well made by the noble
Lord, Lord Alton, and others: the date of consultation would be a
natural point. It falls to the Minister to persuade the Committee and
then the House of any other date, which so far I do not think we have
had.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060580000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000068">The
Minister said at Second Reading that the reason for not keeping the
scheme totally open-ended is that the costs would be prohibitive. The
reason for picking the particular date of 25 July, we learnt from a
subsequent briefing, was that that was the point at which there would
be a reasonable expectation that sufferers could get a payment and
therefore relevant insurance companies could provide in their accounts
for the liability that would ensue.</hs_para>

Minister could help me to understand this a bit more. What is the
regulatory or legal framework under which insurers either may or may
not provide for a liability at a particular date? I would also be
grateful if he could explain whether he actually means reserving for a
liability. If so, how is this a liability? Unlike for people who claim
under the courts in the normal way, for which there clearly is a
liability for which an insurer will provide in the normal way, based on
the premiums and the exposure that they have had for business written,
is the payment that will be made in the levy not simply in fact an
annual payment rather than a liability? If so, how is it in any way
covered by rules on provisioning or reserving in the accounts? I would
be grateful if the Minister could explain that to me. If not, maybe he
could explain where it comes
from.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060580000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000070">Whether
or not the industry has to reserve, it clearly would have to plan to
face a change in its cost base as a result of any decision taken at the
end of the Bill, so it is worth revisiting how we got here. The noble
Lord, Lord Alton, has made reference to the <I>Accessing Compensation
</I>document issued in February 2010. He quoted the most apposite
point, where the Government of the day, in the person of my noble
friend Lord McKenzie, made clear that their intention was to take some
action in this area. In terms of funding for the ELIB to which he
referred, though, the document was brief. It said:</hs_para>

would be for the insurance industry to provide the funding. The
argument for this is that the industry has, in most cases, taken the
premiums for policies that are now not being traced. The industry
should therefore fund the full costs of an ELIB, including the set up
and running
costs”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13060580000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000099">Well
put. No other funding source, at least that I have found, was proposed
in that document. In other words, if I am right, there was no option
two. An impact assessment produced with that document showed that there
was an assumption of an implementation date of April 2011. The document
also looked at the scope of the fund and therefore the potential scale
of the cost that insurers could reasonably expect to have to face,
having read that

impact assessment assessed costs along two axes: whether or not to
include all relevant diseases or just mesothelioma, and whether simply
to take people 
<?notus-xml column=230?>from the start of the scheme or all claims brought in the past three
years. It is clear that, whether or not the extent of the liability was
certain, the Government’s intention was clear at the point of
going out to consultation. Furthermore, the proposals in the Bill are
very much at the modest end of the spectrum of options explored within
that consultation document, so it does not seem unreasonable that the
insurers might well have foreseen the liability, or the cost, that they
are now going to face.</hs_para>

Government have any evidence that insurers have in fact been reserving
since July 2012, the point at which the Minister is confident they were
clear as to the liabilities? Finally, if the Minister is not willing to
share legal advice—and I may yet be surprised on that
front—can he tell us if the Government have a concern that they
could be exposed to legal action were they to impose a requirement

James of Blackheath:</Member></B> Perhaps the Minister will allow me to
make one last entry into this debate. I believe that I can answer part
of the question asked by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock. I am
probably the only person in this Room who has ever made a financial
provision for asbestosis. I did so on the last day of December in 1998
when I signed off the creation of Equitas; £12.8 billion of
assets were locked in an investment fund put together by
Warburg’s, with the countersignature of the Bank of England on
it, so it was pretty good. The £12.8 billion has been sitting
there and can be used only for each category of settlement of claim.
One category is labelled asbestosis. I left £6 billion in there,
but it is £6 billion with an annual growth rate of 6%.</hs_para>

for a knock-down price to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway in
2009—I hasten to add, not with my approval—he took over
all the asset reserves that were left. So even after Equitas had traded
for 13 years, he got a residual balance of £8 billion
of my original £12.8 billion—still growing at 6% per
annum. My calculation at that time was that he 
<?notus-xml column=231?>was left with £5 billion for asbestosis. But the
£5 billion effectively included a great deal of
unidentified claims, because it was largely rolling up the reinsurance
claims around the world. It is very incestuous, this claiming business:
everybody insures each other and they come up with these collective
figures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060580000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000077">At
the moment, my estimate is that the global reserves for asbestosis of
all the insurance companies in the world are £65 billion,
including all the reinsurance markets around the world as well. But
they do not expect that that £65 billion will be paid out. Let
us suppose that you settled Turner &amp; Newall for
£1 billion—you will not, but let us suppose
you did. You would take £1 billion out of the Lloyd’s of
London reserve of £5 billion and you would have £4
billion left. But immediately you would have wiped out the
consequential reinsurance demands down the chain, so the whole industry
would write back as profit something in the region of £15
billion to £20 billion of released reserves.</hs_para>

potential gift to the insurance industry here and we must not give it
away too cheaply. We can screw this insurance industry into paying what
it long since has deserved to pay. Why has it not settled so far? Right
through the six years of the collapse and rescue of Lloyd’s of
London, the great myth was that there was a massive amount of claims
arising in the USA that we had insured and that those claims were
largely spurious because they had used television advertising to get
people to join up. You did not have to have any illness or even to have
been in an asbestos building; you were just told, “Sign up, join
in, it is a free lottery ticket”—that was the advertising
in America.</hs_para>

having worked at government level and failed, to get the American
President to impose strict standards on the American industry to force
it to have only legitimate claims. If that had happened, we would have
taken billions out of our liability and saved Lloyd’s of London
without the need of Equitas. It never happened, but then up comes
Warren Buffett and buys it for a knockdown couple of billion. I would
put a very substantial sum of money on him having a letter in his back
pocket from the President, agreeing to write off those claims or to
curtail them. He is going to rip out the whole of that profit. We
should not sell cheap on this; there is a huge amount out there, which
we can get, and we need very much to play
hardball.</hs_para>

sharing his considerable expertise and experience and for helping me to
understand that I clearly phrased my previous question poorly. I was
trying to ask the Minister whether, when he refers to insurance
companies reserving for the liabilities, he makes any distinction
between the fact that an insurance company would in the ordinary run of
things reserve against a future liability that would crystallise if and
when somebody whose employer had been insured by that insurer were to
develop mesothelioma, and the fact that what an insurance company will
have now is arguably not a liability but a requirement to pay something
that is more like a tax. Here, I declare an interest as a member of the
board of the Financial Ombudsman Service. Is this situation not more
like some aspects of the levy applied by the FCA on relevant financial
services companies, which requires them to contribute, for example, to
the cost of the Financial Services Compensation Scheme? In other words,
it is an annual cost that is fixed by the body imposing the levy and
not a liability that arises directly from activities of the company.
Therefore, does the question of reserving not apply at
all?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060580000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000092"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="13060580000141" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060580000141">Lord

they have sufficient funds to meet their liabilities. The levy is a
hypothecated tax that they have to pay so that their ability to meet
their liabilities is monitored by the Financial Conduct Authority, the

by staying in the market and providing active employer’s
liability insurance are going to be higher, it will need to make sure
in its usual planning that it has the resources available to enable it
to pay the annual costs of doing business to stay in that market. That
is not the same thing as saying it must reserve formally against
liabilities that it has. That, as I understand it, is the
Minister’s main argument as to why they could not have begun
this process earlier. If it were about reserving for liabilities, there
are clear regulatory requirements and negotiations with auditors that
would constrain the point at which the insurance company could start
doing

simply looking at a higher annual cost—and I am not suggesting
that that is not a relevant or material consideration to the

nature of the specific policies that were written, there is presumably
no reason why the insurance company could not have planned for that by
reading carefully, as I am sure it did, the document published by my
noble friend Lord McKenzie. This showed clearly that the Government
wished to intervene in this area and the options on which they were
consulting, all of which would clearly have required the industry to

happen if we push up the levy too much, particularly if there is a
sharp increase. As noble Lords are aware, the way in which these
matters normally work is through a sharing of the levy. The likelihood
is that some of the levy may be passed on in the marketplace. However,
the levels at which we have established the levy—and the
smoothing mechanism to which the noble Lord, Lord Browne, referred was
part of it—were achieved by taking some of those other payments
and circulating them in the first year to give us the best possible
chance that the insurance industry will absorb the bulk of the

figures that noble Lords have been waiting for so incredibly patiently.
If this scheme started on 20 or 21 February 2010, the extra costs would

Lord Howarth, our best estimate is that if we went back to 1968, the

would just like to finish off the figures. I am not going to spend too
much time going over the noble Lord’s “cornucopia”

the insurance industry does, at least when it is in a competitive
position, is look to build in what the returns on its reserves and its
income may be when it sets rates. It is not just a kind of a
surprise—“We got all this extra money out of those
returns!”—but is built into the marketplace. Otherwise,
everyone in the whole world would become an insurance operator, and we
would all have been wasting our time because it would have been a free
lunch. There is some competition in the market. Clearly it is a very
interesting and complicated market, and it depends on how much capital
goes in and out of it. Let us not go into that. We have had a lot of

Lords would like to do more, as indeed would the Government, but we
need to consider the effect of an open-ended scheme against one that
can be afforded whose costs can be absorbed as much as possible by the

the question of reserving, I venture the observation that, whatever the

reserving prudently against liabilities that they can reasonably
foresee. I am not impressed by the Minister’s argument that the
scheme’s eligibility should run only for people diagnosed after
the date on which he made the formal announcement that the Government
would bring in a scheme, and that it is only from then that insurers
could begin to reserve against that liability. I just do not accept
that. We will need to think much more carefully about the obligations
on reserving, but there was never anything to prevent insurers from
reserving against something which they could and should have foreseen,
not just from February 2010 but from the very first date at which they
began to provide employer’s liability
insurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060590000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000023">As
for the noble Lord’s fears that if the levy were increased to
pay for a more expensive scheme, the insurers would simply pass on the
extra costs to employers—well, they will pass on whatever they
can to employers just as soon as they can. As I understand it, that is
how insurers operate. They pitch their premiums at a level that they
believe the market can afford. There is some downward pressure because
of their need to compete with fellow insurers but collectively they
will all rejoice in market conditions that make it possible to raise
their premiums. Of course, they will use any excuse they can to raise
their premiums because they want to maximise their profits. I do not
see that holding down the levy is going to stop employer’s
liability insurers raising their premiums just as soon as they can. Any
additional costs from extending eligibility for this scheme to
different categories of people or people who were diagnosed at an
earlier date are not likely to make a material difference to the
premiums that are sought in the market because there is a host of

altruistic reasons for supporting funding of mesothelioma research, but
for the Government and the insurance industry there are straightforward
financial considerations too. As well as adequate compensation, we
should be prioritising much more of our time and money to finding a
cure to prevent the ravages of this fatal disease. Of course it would
be impossible to eradicate all asbestos from our homes, schools,

the £22 million for bowel cancer, the £41 million for
breast cancer, the £11.5 million for lung cancer, the £32
million for leukaemia. Indeed, there are 17 other forms of cancer for
which far more research resources are reserved than for mesothelioma.
Mesothelioma is quite literally at the bottom of that
list.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060590000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000032">In 2011
the voluntary sector invested £5 million in myeloma research and
£5.6 million on malignant melanoma, the cancers immediately
above and below mesothelioma in the table of mortality figures. Yet,
even with such limited funds, there have been some exciting
developments. I think that some of my noble friends will refer to
these. They include the creation of the world’s first
mesothelioma tissue bank for researchers, a transatlantic collaborative
study of the genetic make-up of mesothelioma and work on overcoming
resistance to drugs used to treat the disease. It shows what can be
done with the right investment. We have an opportunity in the course of
the proceedings of this Committee to create a sustainable fund for
mesothelioma research to help ensure that future generations do not
have to suffer in the same way that so many have in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060590000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000033">At

Minister met with me on Monday, as I said earlier, and again I am
grateful to him for the patience and courtesy that he always shows in
dealing with this and the proceedings of the Committee. We discussed
the detail of this amendment. One aspect that I know that the Minister
does not like is the £10,000 levy that would be paid by all
insurance companies. The Minister feels that if there were such a
scheme it would better if it were tied to market share or turnover,
rather as the levy for compensation is, in the context of the Bill as a
whole. I accept that this approach would be in line with the way in
which the compensation clauses of the Bill work and I would be very
happy to modify the amendment to accommodate that point. A
proportionate levy would be equitable and wholly acceptable to me.

then the vexed question of hypothecation. I have drawn to the
Minister’s attention, and I also draw it to the attention of the
Committee, the precedent of Section 123 of the Gambling Act 2005. It
contains a provision for a hypothecated industry levy. That counters
the suggestion that I have heard that it is somehow impossible to
hypothecate in legislation. That the Section 123 power may not yet have
been exercised is entirely irrelevant. The fact that the levy provided
for in the Gambling Act has not so far been used is neither here nor
there. In that case, the idea was to have a back-up in case voluntary
systems proved inadequate. It may simply be that it has therefore not
been necessary to impose a formal levy so far, and that, too, is a very
helpful precedent when considering what we want to do in this
amendment. It is a power that Parliament has, rightly, chosen to place
on the face of legislation, and in this instance we should do precisely
the same. Ultimately, it will then be a question of political

the Bill was compatible with the convention rights, despite it
containing a clause, which eventually became Section 123, providing for
the imposition of a

he says that that is simply not the case because there is no such thing

anything that Parliament says they can do. After quite a long time in

question of joined-up government. Perhaps the noble Lord can tell us
about the conversations that he has rightly had with his noble friend
Lord Howe about the possibility of the Department of Health being
included in the legislation as the agency through which funds could be

the proposal? Surely it is the principle contained in this amendment,
with which I know the noble Lord will have some sympathy. Surely, if he
does have sympathy with that principle, he should now help us all to
overcome any of these objections, rather than raising objections.

Walton of Detchant:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord Alton, particularly in the light of the lucid and
forceful way in which he has proposed this amendment. I have added my
name to the amendment because I believe very strongly that, as he has
pointed out, the amount of funding in this country that has been
devoted to research into mesothelioma, its causation, its development
and its treatment has been miniscule. I join him in paying tribute to
the contribution over the years made by the voluntary organisation, the
British Lung Foundation, in examining ways in which research into this
wretched disease can be
conducted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:04:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, the Government’s contribution to this
research—for instance, through the Medical Research Council, of
which I was once a member—has been minimal. Therefore, I am very
much in favour of the principle underlying this amendment.</hs_para>

medical students that while there are plenty of incurable diseases in
medicine, there are none that may not have their effects modified by
pharmacological, physical or psychological means. Mesothelioma is
almost an exception to that rule, although it is clear that in the
early stages of the disease certain physical mechanisms can alleviate
some of its worst effects. The tragedy of mesothelioma is that the
deposits of this cancerous process are laid down in the pleural cavity,
between the surface of the lung and the internal surface of the chest
wall. Gradually, as those deposits increase, the actual flexibility of
the movement of the chest wall—in the muscular contractions
which are responsible for our involuntary taking in and expiring of
air—is slowly but progressively lessened, so that in the end the
patient is almost subject to the feeling of having a straitjacket
around their chest that prevents them from respiring. Eventually, it is
fatal. Happily, there are mechanisms with drugs, sedatives and many
other things that can help to ease the terminal phases. Nevertheless,
the end result is tragic and appalling for anyone who has witnessed
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060590000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000043">A
colleague of mine who was a consultant neurologist developed
mesothelioma—the result, it appears, of being as a youth a keen
club cricketer in villages in County Durham. It turned out that the
changing room in which he regularly changed before appearing on the
cricket field was lined with asbestos. That was eventually thought to
have been the source from which he acquired this disease. It is a
tragic condition and it deserves close and careful
attention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060590000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000044">I
also used to teach my medical students that today’s discovery in
basic medical science brings tomorrow’s practical development in
patient care. As yet, there has been no such basic discovery in the
science underlying the causation and development of mesothelioma and,
as yet, no drug has been discovered that is capable of reducing that
progressive, cancerous deposit and the progressive process of
strangulation. That is not to say that there have not been some limited
discoveries that have benefited individual patients, but much more is
needed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060590000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000045">I
know what the Minister will say: that an amendment such as this has no
place in a Bill or a statutory instrument because it is, in a sense,
permissive. I can understand fully the view that he is going to take in
that regard. However, I do not believe that it is beyond the wit of
man, and certainly not beyond the wit of the Minister, to achieve some
kind of Machiavellian political intervention or manipulation enabling
the principles underlying this amendment to be fulfilled in
law.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060590000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000046">Although

<?notus-xml column=243?>will find the means to fulfil the principle underlying this crucial
amendment in managing to persuade these insurance companies—
perhaps “persuasion” is not exactly the right word; it
might need something a bit firmer to get the money out of those

two formidable speeches that we have just heard. Having put my name to
the amendment, though, I want to say something to support it. It is
indeed a modest amendment but it has enormous potential advantages for
important research seeking new treatment and a possible cure. We have
already heard from the noble Lord, Lord Walton of Detchant, what he
thinks could be done and why it needs to be done. Of course, I defer to
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060590000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000048">As one of
three judges in the Court of Appeal, I heard a number of these cases,
and each story was tragic. Although I was a judge for 35 years, these
stories have remained with me. We know that currently there is no cure.
We know that currently the treatment is poor compared with that for
other forms of cancer. It is crucial and urgent that we have proper
research. As the noble Lord, Lord Alton of Liverpool, has said, it is a
scandal that this is so poorly supported, when it is a killer but other
forms of cancer can be treated and people can live for a long time.
Sufferers die two years after the diagnosis—it is like motor
neurone disease, and even that, as I understand it, gets more research
funding than this does. It is extraordinary that the people who suffer
from it are not properly regarded by the state or indeed by insurers.
It is high time that the lack of financial support should be remedied

extent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060590000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000049">I very
much support the principle of the amendment. Like the noble Lord, Lord
Walton of Detchant, I do not entirely support the wording. I do not
think that matters because we are not going to vote on it today, and if
the Government can come up with better wording and be supportive, that
is exactly as it should be. The amount of money that would be raised
under the present scheme is a modest £1.5 million. It would be
much better if the Government felt able to match it; that would be
valuable.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13060590000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060590000050">I
was entertained by the reference by the noble Lord, Lord Alton of
Liverpool, to the Gambling Act, which shows a very useful precedent. It
is just possible that if some law were passed in this Bill, we could
then to go the insurers on a voluntary basis and say, “If you
don’t, it will be backed up by primary legislation”. So
we want it there as a spur. If that can be done in gambling, I really

what the noble and learned Baroness said a moment ago with regard to

£10,000 from each insurer. One can argue, certainly, that there

that we are after here. The clause sets out that all funds raised from
this fee would be invested into research for treatments for this awful
disease. Listening to the noble Lord, Lord Walton, speak from his own
experience of the medical world, we see the pressing need for these
funds to be made available. They should be available already. They
should be coming from the normal course of research funding. But as

are active in the employer’s liability insurance market. If a
£10,000 annual fee were charged to each of those bodies it would
raise, as has been suggested, £1.5 million every year towards
mesothelioma research. That would be a tremendous sum. Funding of that
order could make a difference. As has been said, with some 2,400 people
a year dying in the UK from this debilitating disease—the
highest rate in the world—something needs to be done. The
British Lung Foundation estimates that over the next 30 years, as a
number of colleagues have mentioned, some 50,000 people will die from
it if the cure is not found. There is a need to put the resources in to
find a cure and to act now, surely, for the sake of the people for whom
the clock is already ticking.</hs_para>

is that in 2011 it was able to put in only some £850,000, but
that was certainly worth while, while only £400,000 was invested
in mesothelioma research by other charities. None of the funding came
from the Government.</hs_para>

years, four leading insurance firms have invested about £1
million a year between them in mesothelioma research, following an
agreement brokered by the British Lung Foundation, and we are indebted
to the work that it has done. As a result of this, Europe’s
first mesothelioma tissue bank has been created in order to collect and
store biological tissue from mesothelioma patients, which can be used
in research. I understand that research is currently ongoing to
identify the genetic architecture of this disease but, as the agreement
was only for a three-year period, that funding will soon come to an
end. The small number of insurance firms that funded this initial
research have indicated, as I understand it, that any long-term funding
into treatments and possible cures for this disease should be funded by
the industry more widely. 
<?notus-xml column=245?>They have also argued that a voluntary agreement covering all the firms

played to date, providing some £1 million a year between them to
support research in this area, supplemented by important charitable
contributions. We cannot underestimate the importance of even this
small contribution to having kick-started research and academic
interest in this area. The meso-bank that we have heard of is a very
important national initiative that will have global significance,

provides the opportunity for fundamental and translational research on

the contribution of insurance companies and the work of the British
Lung Foundation in having facilitated that. However, this

of mesothelioma. That would not have happened without the funds

together, now in reasonable numbers, to focus on the question of
mesothelioma as a result of recognising that funds to support their
research would be available. If the signal cannot be sent in future

no research will be undertaken. That is the simple truth: without

targets for future drug development. A disease in a similar situation
to mesothelioma some years ago was melanoma, the malignant skin cancer.
As a result of research focus and a better understanding of the
molecular biology of melanoma, we can now offer patients biological

stimulated important research into better palliative care for patients

for that disease is only 12 months. Those few who respond to current
chemotherapy have only an additional two months—eight
weeks—of added median survival. For the vast majority, the

appropriate palliation is vital, again supported by those limited

either through having available in statute but not using—as, we
have heard, is the case with the Gambling Act 2005—or having a
tool available to apply to members of the compensation scheme. There is
an important discussion to be had about how those funds would then be

31, for all the reasons powerfully advanced by the noble Lord, Lord
Alton of Liverpool, and other noble Lords this afternoon. I should be
very surprised if the Minister were to suggest that there is something
inappropriate about a statutory levy on an industry to promote a
valuable public purpose. It is not only in the Gambling Act 2005, there
are other statutory examples that one could refer to. As long ago as
1963, Parliament decided that, under Section 24 of the
Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act, the levy board has a power to charge
on all bookmakers involved in horserace betting, the levy to be spent
for the purposes of improving the breeds of horses, the 
<?notus-xml column=247?>advancement or encouragement of veterinary science or education and the
improvement of horseracing. So there is nothing novel about
a statutory levy on a particular industry for a particular valuable

this context. Parliament has a very broad discretion in the context of
property rights, because that is what we are talking about, on the
proper balance between individual interests and the public interest. It

that this is a Bill about the insurance industry and its contribution

funds only within its own remit, and medical research lies within the
auspices of the Department of Health. We do not have the freedom to
raise funds for research within a DWP-sponsored Bill. One of the issues
with hypothecated research like this is that, from the point of view of
the Department of Health, that cuts across its strategy of directing
funds at quality research. This is how we have ended up in this odd

that this is a DWP Bill and research is a Department of Health matter?
If that is the point, I think it will come as a great surprise to this

come up with an agreed position to place within a Bill—not least
because, as he will well know, as a matter of constitutional propriety,
when a Bill talks about a Secretary of State, it covers all Secretaries
of State. There is no division of responsibilities between Secretaries

raise money for itself, or that the department cannot approve of a levy

department? Can Parliament not put it into the Bill even if the DWP
says that it is not part of its remit? The two points are, first,
whether you can support a levy even if you cannot raise the money
yourselves, and, secondly, why can the Bill not go forward with it
while we discuss whether another government department will be helpful?

great success in our country because it is strategic and, as the
Minister has said, rightly targets areas to drive excellence and
research. However, there are very good examples of collaborative
research efforts between industry and Her Majesty’s Government
in certain targeted areas to ensure that the volume of funds is
available to address specific research questions. Would it not be
possible for the Department of Health to consider, as a result of the
discussions in this Committee and the passage of this Bill, whether
there should be a move towards a strategic research effort in the area
of mesothelioma? This could go through the normal processes identified
within the Department of Health, the National Institute for Health
Research, the Medical Research Council, and the Office for Strategic
Coordination of Health Research in the Cabinet Office. Having gone
through those normal processes, funds could then be generated through
this particular levy. Funds defined and voted on through the national
research funds available in the Department of Health could then be
combined in a strategic way and focused on institutions that were
prepared to make a commitment in this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:48:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060599000044"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Moonie" PimsId="4889" UID="13060599000168" xid="1885" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0001.htm#13060599000168">Lord
Moonie:</Member></B> Perhaps I may add a small point from my own field
in medicine. One of the problems with mesothelioma is that it is
diagnosed so late that it is generally considered a hopeless condition.
That was certainly the case with friends of mine who died of it some
years ago. Gradually things are beginning to look a little brighter. It
is important to get treatment early. We know largely who the potential
case bodies are likely to comprise—those who have historically
been exposed to asbestos—and the numbers should not really be
added to at this stage. Therefore it ought to be possible to devise
research, either through markers or through surveillance of the case
load, to establish diagnosis of mesothelioma earlier and provide more
hope to the patients who suffer from
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T18:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>. That might
be a fruitful argument for the Minister to make to his colleagues in

the best thing that I can do is to take it back in to Government; my

industry are the only ones who have been paying anything of any

money voluntarily. It does not need this pressure. What we need to

try to find out why the money has not been forthcoming so far? Is it
political, because the view is taken that there are not terribly many
sufferers from mesothelioma as a proportion of the population as a
whole and therefore they are not a priority, or is it because this
field is unfashionable among academics? We need an explanation because
it is very puzzling. Given the existing structures, conventions and

Freud:</Member></B> I have actually got round to asking that question
already, so I can answer it now. The reason is that it is an
unfashionable area because it was believed that there was no hope. We
caught it late, it was happening over a very short period and it was
fatal. It was an unfashionable area to go into and therefore the people
who wanted to make their careers in research turned to other cancers.
As a result, good-quality research proposals were not coming in and
therefore the research council did not feel that it could supply funds.
That is the reason and it has been the reason for decades. With regard
to breaking that cycle, the insurance industry and the voluntary groups
working with the BLF have started rolling the stone down the hill, and
I think that we are now in a position to get something moving. However,
it is a bigger issue than just getting a little bit of money through
this
device.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-06-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_06_05_PT_1/3306C5E3A5AD93CB24A07EC69BB9396F62FCC242" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 June 2013">Wednesday,

help Ministers who are clearly committed to the underlying principles
enunciated in the amendment actually to achieve them. He said that he
has been banging his head against a brick wall and that he has been
dismayed at the failure to provide adequate resources to deal with
these things. The one thing we can do for a Minister in that situation
is to provide him with an amendment to the Bill, which he can then take

research has to be kick-started. In other words, there has to be some
kind of seed funding—in the absence of state funding. Of course,
austerity will inevitably be one of the reasons given when the Minister
goes back to the Treasury or elsewhere. Other people will have their
own priorities and projects, which they say that the money should be
spent on. Again, we need to provide the Minister with something that
overcomes those objections. The approach adopted in this amendment of a
levy is one way of doing that. My noble friend Lord Kakkar also
reminded us about something that I had not thought about previously:

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this is, I hope, a brief and
probing amendment. To be eligible for a payment under the scheme,
Clause 2(1)(c) requires that a person has not brought an action against
an employer or insurer and is unable to do so. The amendment requires
that action to be successful. The implication is that an unsuccessful
action would not preclude access to the payment scheme.</hs_para>

with the Bill team on this, and I think that the government response
will be that if an action cannot be successful, it would necessarily
preclude access to the payment scheme, because the conditions could not

against an employer found not to be the right one but when the right
one had gone out of business and the insurer could not be identified?
Similarly, if an insurer were pursued by an action but proved to be the
wrong one, why should that then preclude access to the scheme? I beg to

person should be eligible for a payment from the scheme if they have
not brought an action against a relevant employer or insurer through

they should do so. But a person should not be eligible for a payment
from the scheme if they have brought an action against a relevant
employer or insurer through the courts and they have not been
successful in that action because they have not been 
<?notus-xml column=257?>awarded civil damages. This may happen for a number of reasons. For
example, the courts may consider that the employer did not expose the
person to asbestos as a result of negligence or breach of statutory
duty, or that the person was not an employee. It is not right in these
circumstances that the person should be able to make an application to
the scheme. It is a scheme of last resort, not a no-fault scheme. The

on the Minister when he is reading a very carefully constructed
argument but, with all due respect, what he has just read defies logic.
Bearing in mind that the person must have been diagnosed with
mesothelioma after July 2012 and, if the draft rules become the rules
of the scheme, must have brought any claim within three years of that
diagnosis. It is envisaged that in that period the person would have
sued somebody despite the fact that they were unable to find the
relevant employer or the relevant insurer. It cannot possibly have been
the relevant employer or the relevant insurer that they sued so the
determination of the case is an irrelevance. I do not understand how

say, “Go to your relevant employer or insurer, if you can find
them, take them to court and go through the legal process. If that

scheme”. If that was a mistake, you could find another employer.
To answer the question of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, there is

these cases in this way is because of the history of the way in which
mesothelioma litigation has developed. In mesothelioma cases, one can
sue any employer. So if one finds a relevant employer or insurer, one
can sue that person—I think that is agreed. That is part of the
reason why this group of people are able to have access to this payment

McKenzie of Luton:</Member> My Lords, Amendment 13 is
another probing amendment which addresses another aspect of
eligibility. Under Clause 2(1)(d), it is a requirement that a person
has not received damages or a specified payment in respect of diffuse
mesothelioma, specified payments to be defined in regulations. This
probing amendment is to clarify that any payments receivable under the
Pneumoconiosis etc. (Workers’ Compensation) Act 1979 and Section
47 of the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act 2008 are not to be
treated as specified payments. Such payments may be recoverable under
benefit recovery provisions, but their receipt would not deny access to
the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000078">From
a discussion with the Bill team a few days ago, I understand that that
is the case, but it would be very helpful if the Minister could put
that on the record and say something about what other types of
arrangement—I think that term of renewal has been
mentioned—will be included in specified
payments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000079">Amendment
41 is grouped and is another probing amendment. Clause 13(2)(b) enables
the Secretary of State in setting the levy to deduct the amount of any
recovery of benefits. That would therefore reduce the amount borne by
insurers. Clearly, the principle which should apply generally is that
any benefit recovery accrues to the Government, not to insurers.
However, it is understood that this provision is to apply only to the
initial period of the scheme, where benefit recovery in respect of
cases diagnosed from July 2012 to March 2015 will be used to fund the
scheme. If that is the case, again, perhaps we can have that on the
record. In any event, perhaps the Minister can explain the analysis
behind the government contribution and why in the scheme of things any
contribution should be made. I beg to

41 is consequent upon benefits and state lump sum payments not being
recovered from scheme payments. The Bill allows for the Secretary of
State to make regulations under which insurers have to pay a levy with
a view to meeting the costs of the scheme. In deciding the total amount
of levy, the Secretary of State may deduct the sums recovered, or
expected to be recovered, under the recovery of benefits legislation
during the period in respect of scheme payments made during the period
or before it. On the basis that social security benefits and government
lump sums are recoverable from scheme payments, the effect of this
amendment would be to prevent the recycling of money generated through
recovery of benefits and state lump sum payments in order to reduce the
amount of the levy in period one. To be clear, we only intend to
recycle this money in year one of the scheme’s operation in

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, as the Minister will be
aware, while I am supportive of the scheme that he brings forward,
there is a need for key improvements. Foremost among these is the
proposed level of scheme payments. We have seen nothing definitive, but
the impact assessment suggests that it could be pitched at 70% of the
tariff. The tariff will be set in age bands of one year and it is
understood that it will be based on average compensation awards of
claimants and dependants, in respect of those diagnosed with diffuse
mesothelioma. The impact assessment also states that by linking
payments to age, the overall cost of the scheme will be reduced because
of the rise in age of those
diagnosed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000091">The
suggested likely level of payout of 70% is the component of the scheme
which most noble Lords at Second Reading considered unacceptable. An
increase in this level of payment is the most important change we can
make to the Bill. It is difficult to pin this down in the primary
legislation but we need to have something clear in the Bill. What
levels of payment are actually made depends upon the computation of
average compensation claims as well as the percentage
award<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:20:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000092">As
to average compensation claims, we need to be assured that this is a
fair basis for constructing the tariff and that it does not unfairly
depress the amount of compensation claims which would have been payable
to scheme beneficiaries had they been able to access compensation on an
individual basis. There is no 
<?notus-xml column=261?>inherent reason why the cohort of scheme claimants should not reflect
the average of those accessing compensation in the usual
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:20:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000093">We
have seen the national institute’s statistical note, which
merits more detailed scrutiny. However, we have not seen that
translated into a tariff schedule which supports the impact assessment
levy calculations. When might this be available? The national institute
note sets out various measures of average compensation, including the
arithmetic mean, the median and a variety of trimmed means. Which
average is to be
used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:21:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000094">Table
3.4 of the paper sets down some average compensation tabulations but it
is unclear whether either of model 2 or model 4 will be adopted.
Further, it would appear that in Scotland, for example, actual awards
are on average some £60,000 higher than in the rest of the UK.
Is this right and are there any other large regional disparities of
which we should be
aware<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000095">At
Second Reading the Minister referred to setting payment figures at 70%
as a “real juggling act”. The argument runs that if the
levy is small, in a reasonably competitive market providers will absorb
it and not seek to pass the cost on to British industry. The impact
assessment points to research both ways on this matter, although it
also suggests that it is worth noting that even if insurers did pass
the costs on to employers the impact on employer customers is likely to
be relatively
low<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000096">The
argument being used to significantly depress payments to sufferers of
mesothelioma is thin to say the least. Where is the evidence that at a
3% level they will absorb the costs but above that they will not? Is it
not the case that there is a variety of issues and costs which will
feature in employer’s liability insurance pricing and that these
policies might anyway be bundled with other insurance
products<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:23:09"></hs_TimeCode>?
Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:22:53"></hs_TimeCode> taking the
Government’s argument at face value, their position cannot be

into account the government contribution in year one, the levy on
insurers is, on average, estimated to be 2.24% of a 70% level of
payment. This would imply an average level of some 3.2% if the payment
were set at a 100% level, an extra 1% of gross written premiums, or
£15 million per year over the 10-year period. From the point of
view of the insurance industry, this would not appear to be an
unmanageable additional amount.</hs_para>

should be borne in mind that the industry is still not bearing the
costs of other asbestos-related and long-term diseases where
employer’s liability policies cannot be traced. The Minister has
suggested that the diffused mesothelioma scheme covers 70% of the
payment amount that would fall due if there were full coverage, so
there is benefit still accruing to the sector just because old policies
have been lost or
destroyed<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000099">However,
this aside, we should not be looking at this only from the point of
view of the insurance sector. We need to give full consideration to
those affected by this terrible disease. If their condition is a result
of negligent workplace practices, why should support for them be
discounted by 30%? Indeed, on a matter that we have to pursue in the
future, we remain to be convinced that the scheme payment could not be 
<?notus-xml column=262?>subject to greater benefit recovery than a composite level of
compensation payment. However, we will return to that

right—and it is—that payments should be made, they should
be the full compensation equivalent. It has taken a long time for a
scheme to be developed and we continue to pay tribute to the Minister
for advancing this, but there is no excuse for now short-changing those

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, my Amendment 18 is grouped
with Amendment 15, just moved by my noble friend Lord McKenzie, and it
drives at very much the same purpose. Both of us seek to ensure that
the scheme payments will match the average of court awards for people
in comparable circumstances, thereby lifting the figure from 70% of the
tariff to
100<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:26:02"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para>

discern any principled basis for this figure of 70%. I think that it
was the best deal that the Minister could secure. I do not
underestimate his achievement in securing that deal against an
insurance industry that for decades fought a rearguard action to try to
escape from its proper liabilities. At Second Reading, the Minister
told the House of the press investigations into the mesothelioma
scandal in its various dimensions from 1965 onwards. As time went by,
we understand that policies went missing wholesale. As the Minister
also told us at Second Reading, it was not until 1999 that the industry
created a code of practice for the better tracing of employer’s
liability
policies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

debate, I do not think that Parliament needs to feel that it is bound
by the deal that the Minister has secured with the industry. We respect
the Minister’s efforts in securing that deal but it is our duty
to take a view on where the public interest lies, and I do not believe
that it lies in palpable injustice or in the convenience of the
insurance industry at the expense of mesothelioma victims. It is surely
unacceptable that mesothelioma victims should be penalised because,
through no fault of theirs, documents have gone missing, and it is
unacceptable that the insurers, whose duty it was to keep proper files,
should benefit to the tune of 30% in precisely those cases where they
failed in their
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:27:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to us again, I think, that there needs to be a discount in order to
incentivise claimants to go to the courts first. However, I am not
persuaded by that argument because it seems to me that the procedures
of the scheme—the portal and the remit of the technical
committee—will all ensure that they do go to the courts first if
they can and that they pursue that avenue until they find that they
cannot proceed satisfactorily or successfully along it. Be that as it
may, in any case a 30% discount is simply too large. The Financial
Services Compensation Scheme provides cover for 90% of the liabilities
of insolvent insurers where insurance is compulsory. That 90% should be
the very minimum and 100% would be
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:28:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend should pay attention to the fact that this was one of the
subjects on which all the speakers at Second Reading were unanimous in
saying that 70% was simply unacceptable. Whether it should be 100%, 90%

between us. However, there are certainly very strong reasons for saying
that the 30% deduction is totally unfair and unacceptable to the
majority of your Lordships.</hs_para>

Second Reading that he was keen to avoid the insurers passing all, or
virtually all, of the levy on to existing insurers. As the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, said, this would not require a very large increase in
the premiums to be imposed. It is logical to assume that insurers would
also be constrained by the effects of competition. Some might be
inclined to pass the whole burden on to other insurers, but would be
constrained from doing so by the thought that if others did not then
they would obtain all the business. The threat of the insurers passing
on the burden is a very slight one.</hs_para>

increase from 70% to some higher figure, that would not happen
suddenly. Presumably, a proportion of the insurers might pass on some
of the burden as we approach 100%. I do not think that the Minister has
any objective evidence to show to what extent this would happen. I
would be very glad to hear from him if he thinks that there is evidence

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, the fact that we are at a late stage of
the debate today should not stop us from speaking and pressing this
most important of the amendments to the Bill that we are considering.
If we get nowhere on it today, I suspect that we may need to come back
to it on Report. As was rightly said a moment ago, this is something
that was referred to by almost all the speakers at Second Reading, and
it should not go by default at this point in time.</hs_para>

someone is entitled to 100% of the compensation because of their
condition, their suffering and what they have gone through, but they
have not had that compensation because at some time in the past some
insurer failed to deliver it, that does not in any shape or form
justify a 30% abatement of what they will get. Their suffering should
justify the 100% level. There may be an argument about 10% here or
there, although I do not like even that, but I certainly do not like
the idea of it being abated by 30%.</hs_para>

some horse-trading on this. It would be interesting to know where the
Minister started his argument. If 70% was the first offer made by the
insurers, then I suspect that there is room to move up from that
figure. If there is not, then this is something that Parliament should
be addressing further. I do not recall with the 1979 Act that there was
a reduction in the compensation on the basis that it was 
<?notus-xml column=264?>going to be easy. The argument put forward at the time was that it was
fair compensation for the suffering. If that is the case with other
legislation, why on earth should there be less for people who have
suffered so much? This really is something that should be

very best deal that he thinks possible, particularly given the need to
get a resolution quickly so that those who are suffering from this
terrible illness get the support that they deserve as quickly as
possible. I am sure that that has been at the forefront of his mind. He
has said already in Committee that he is going to return to his
discussions with insurers, and I hope that he can assure the Committee
that he will convey to those insurers the strength of feeling that he
has heard, at this late hour in our proceedings, about this issue. He

a range in between about the effort that is put in to find the

130% instead of 70% because that might make some people try a little
harder to find the paperwork. I really should have put an amendment in

we will circulate all of that to Peers tomorrow. It is based on a
survey of civil compensation undertaken between 2007 and 2012
registered with the Compensation Recovery Unit, so it is a broad mix of

make a point that is really at the heart of this, and as many noble
Lords have pointed out, if we were going after the people who should
pay the money, it would be a very different proposition in terms of
justice as opposed to our asking for money from a group of insurers
that may or may not have been doing this business during the time. We
are actually asking a group of active insurers to carry a particular
burden when we know that of the industry as a whole, 40% are in
run-off, including many of the biggest ones involved in mesothelomia.
If one looks at insurance as one industry, all in one category, that is
one way of thinking; if one starts to individualise what different
insurers are doing, it becomes a different
debate.</hs_para>

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> I understand that argument, but can I
put two other considerations to the noble Lord? When the Lloyd’s
insurance market ran into very severe difficulty on account of
asbestosis claims—I forget when that was—it had to act
collectively to rescue the reputation of the London insurance market. I
think we are in a similar situation here. I also put it to the Minister
that the active insurers are advantaged by the fact that other run-off
insurers have either failed or given up the business. They are the
insurers who are now in the market and dominate it. Considering that
they benefit from the absence of those erstwhile competitors, they are
in a perfectly strong position to shoulder the moral and indeed the
practical responsibilities left behind by those who have abandoned the
field<hs_TimeCode time="2013-06-05T19:40:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> It is always a dangerous thing to base it on a
moral argument, particularly in this area. It is a differentiated
industry. There is a group which we are now looking at to shoulder
this. There was an enormous amount of negotiation in getting to this
level of levy. That then feeds into the amount that we can pay eligible
people. You could have an infinite amount of levy but if we went too
high, the risk would be very clear. The genuine danger is that it would
just go straight to British industry. Many of the insurers who will be
paying it were not in business at the time or may have kept good
records, so there is a differentiation within the industry.</hs_para>

could pay people more, of course we would. This is a balancing act and
70% is the compromise that we have arrived at after long negotiations.
I hope that noble Lords can appreciate that there is a real achievement

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
reply, none of which comes as a surprise. I thank all noble Lords who
have participated in this debate and supported the amendment. My noble
friend Lord Wills urged that Minister to convey the strength of opinion
about the level of payment. The noble Lord, Lord Wigley, referred to
the fact that this sort of horse-trading did not go on when the
1979 Act scheme was being put in place. I think that my
noble friend Lord Howarth dealt with the point about why it is not
unreasonable for the insurers still in the market to bear the full
costs of compensation. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, reminded us that
everybody who spoke at Second Reading opposed this 70% level. I was
rather attracted to my noble friend Lady Donaghy’s proposition
of 130%; perhaps we might try that.</hs_para>

it is wrong to deal with this as a moral issue. I am not sure that that
is right or something that I would agree with. I took it from what he
said that the negotiation was around the rate of the levy, which then
drove the compensation levels, rather than the rest. In that case, I am
interested in a negotiation that would end up with a levy of 2.24%. How
on earth was that arrived at? Why was it not 2.25% or 2.26%, or 3%? To
have that driving the outcome seems a little strange, but in any event
it is
unacceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060599000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-gc0002.htm#13060599000124">I
am grateful for the fact that it looks as though we will get the tariff
tables tomorrow. That is obviously a key part of this. The percentage
is key, but it depends what it is a percentage of. We will have to see
how that all works out and which of those averages have been taken in
compiling that schedule.</hs_para>

Minister again made the point that it is not totally fair that people
currently in the market may not have been in the market at the time.
However, the corollary to that is that those who are currently in the
market could well have been those who were in the market previously and
are still benefiting from the fact that many cases are not covered by
this payment scheme. Therefore, we need to see it from that point of
view. However, it seems to me that, fundamentally, we need to see it
from the point of view of the sufferers and consider that just because
the paperwork cannot be found—in my noble friend’s
terms—people will lose 30% of what their entitlement might
otherwise have been.</hs_para>

going to come on to some other debates about whether the nature of the
scheme payment, in so far as it is different from compensation under
various heads, means that there is a worse outcome on benefit recovery.
That, too, needs to be factored into the bottom line that people will
get. We continue to believe that 70% is inappropriate. It has to be
increased and, if it is a question of driving up the levy rate, all
that is needed is an increase from 2.24% to just over 3%. I am just
trying to envisage the nature of the discussions and the things that
would have been on the table when 2.24% was settled on after the
initial smoothing.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> Perhaps I may quickly clear up that matter. When
you look at the totals, you have to take into account the effect of the
extra two years, because we are starting with two years in hand. So the
first year counts as three years, which we are going to smooth over the
first four years. Therefore, in practice we start off with a much
bigger amount of money. The 2.24% is a raw figure, if you like; it is
not going to affect how much the levy will be when it is
smoothed.</hs_para>

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> I think that £17 million is the
cost of the government contribution. I still do not think that we have
had a definitive answer to the question of the impact on all this, if
any, of what is happening in the pre-action protocol and all the
negotiations that are going on there. From submissions that we have had
from the ABI, it is clear that it sees that as part of a wider
integrated package. I do not know whether the Minister can say anything
about the extent, if any, to which the negotiations took account of
what was happening there or was likely to happen and how that impacted
on the negotiations.</hs_para>

have heard nothing that convinces us that the 2.24% is where we stop in

Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has today published interim

guidance, which takes immediate effect, follows a judgment by the Court
of Appeal (Thomas U, Dobbs J, and the Recorder of Redbridge) in R v
Christopher Killick [2011] EWCA Crim 1608 that a victim of crime has a
right, derived from the ordinary principles of English law, to seek a
review of a CPS decision not to prosecute; meaning a clear procedure
for the exercise of this right is
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060563000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-wms0001.htm#13060563000013">The
guidance sets out when the victims’ right to review arises, the
process for victims to request a review and how the review will be
conducted by the CPS. Victims will be notified of their right to review
when a CPS prosecutor decides not to charge or to terminate criminal
proceedings involving that person as a victim. If the victim requests a
review of the decision, a different prosecutor will consider the
decision afresh and determine whether or not the decision of the
original prosecutor was wrong. The decision on whether to reinstitute
proceedings as a result of that review will be made at the level of
deputy chief crown prosecutor or
above.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060563000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-wms0001.htm#13060563000014">The

council held an exchange of views on the Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership. The Commission highlighted the need to secure
an ambitious negotiating mandate, while acknowledging that it is
essential to protect European culture, particularly in relation to the
audio-visual industry. The Commission was clear that it believes the
current text of the mandate is consistent with this approach in seeking
to protect the audio-visual industry by maintaining existing EU
measures, protecting existing national regulations and financial
support, and reserving future policy space for new technologies. France
argued strongly for audio-visual services to be excluded entirely from
the trade agreement. This position was supported by Belgium, Cyprus,
Greece, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia. For the
UK, I welcomed the Commission’s commitment to securing these
vital cultural protections, but argued that this trade agreement
presents a historic growth opportunity for the European economy and it
would be wrong to risk damaging our overall level of ambition by
excluding a particular sector completely before negotiations have
started. This position was supported by Czech Republic, Denmark,
Estonia, Netherlands, Portugal and

value and not dilute the work which is already going on in member

council also held a policy debate on the role of public authorities in
combating increased sophistication of doping in sport. The debate
opened with a presentation from Travis Tygart, chief executive of the
United States’ Anti-Doping Agency, who identified four key areas
in which public authorities need to take action: legislation,
independence, funding and engagement. Member states described some of
the solutions they have adopted to tackle doping, including
awareness-raising, co-operation and improved methods to uncover doping.
The UK noted that the national anti-doping agency had adopted an
intelligence-based approach to tackling doping, which had been used as
the basis for conducting tests on athletes before the Olympic Games,
and emphasised the importance of education, such as through the Win
Clean campaign, developed during the Olympics, to inform athletes of
their rights and
responsibilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060563000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605-wms0001.htm#13060563000042"><I>Any

confirmation that our film tax relief remains in line with the
communication, but I expressed our concerns about the publication of
information about aid beneficiaries which could influence the price for
which films are sold. I called for a speedy conclusion to the revision

also introduced an item on the proposed exemption clause for state aid
for culture. Germany argued that there should be a complete exemption
without the requirement of a maximum amount of aid, and that there
should be timely notification procedures which did not interrupt the
aid from public sources. France expressed concern about the extent of
the exemption and where the boundary lay. I intervened to support the
Commission, noting that the proposed changes would provide more
flexibility for member states and remove the need for burdensome
processes. In response, the Commission accepted that the scope for
non-notification needed to be made

work. However, the department understands that, either alongside, or
following completion of, their work on PNAs, some PCTs undertook
reviews locally to ensure that any dispensing patients continued to be
eligible, under the regulatory criteria, to receive dispensing services
from their doctor. That was good administrative practice on the part of
PCTs since it was their responsibility under the 2005 and earlier
regulations to ensure that patients, who received dispensing services,
were, or continued to be, eligible to receive them. The department
holds no information centrally on the number of PCTs that undertook
such reviews at that time, or whether such PCTs consulted dispensing
patients prior to, or as part of, any review
held.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13060566000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130605w0001.htm#13060566000030">Following
the abolition of PCTs, under the 2013 regulations, responsibility for

patient’s eligibility to receive NHS dispensing services from
their doctor is primarily based on the patient living in a designated
rural area, at more than 
<?notus-xml column=194?>1.6 kilometres from their nearest NHS pharmacy. This

if a doctor applies to provide dispensing services on behalf of some or
all of the practice’s patients, the applicant has a right to
appeal a NHS decision to refuse the application, but not the individual
patients concerned. Similarly, under the 2013 regulations, where a
patient is notified that a decision has been made requiring a
dispensing practice to discontinue dispensing services to some or all
of their patients, the dispensing practice, but not the individual
patients affected, has a right to appeal that decision. Where 
a patient is no longer eligible, the NHS may allow a period of time,
typically three to six months, after which such patients start to use a
NHS pharmacy. This is known as “gradualisation”. A
decision to allow this grace period can be appealed by the NHS pharmacy
affected, but not by individual patients

would be prejudice, the NHS must refuse the application. This
