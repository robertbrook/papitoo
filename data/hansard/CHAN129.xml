Clive Betts</B> (Sheffield South East) (Lab):</Member> One of the other
major problems facing private sector tenants is the actions of letting
agents. There was widespread support for the Government’s
commitment to a redress scheme, and for the promise made on 20 May last
year by the then Housing Minister to have one code of practice to
underpin it. However, the Government now say that they cannot go ahead
with one code of practice and must rely on voluntary codes, with agents
being part of various bodies and with a test of reasonableness in other
cases. Why are we not going to have one code of practice? Is it because
the Government did not take the necessary powers under the legislation
to enable them to do so?</hs_Para>

transferring an asset it is immensely important that they do not see

Keeley</B> (Worsley and Eccles South) (Lab):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Speaker. Last week we learned that insurance actuaries had
been able to obtain 13 years of hospital medical records on
every NHS patient in the country. A report on the use of the data said
that the 188 million records were at individual episode level, and the
hospital data obtained had many identifiers, including diagnosis, age,
gender, area where the patient lived, date of admission and discharge.
On Thursday, in a debate in Westminster Hall, the public health
Minister, who is in her place, said that she wanted to put it on the
record that the data released to the insurance actuaries were publicly
available, non-identifiable and in aggregate form. The
Minister’s comments on the data released are at complete
variance with the reported facts, which were also discussed extensively
at the Health Committee last week. There is now a further damaging
story in the news that that released patient data were made available
online. I understand that the Health and Social Care Information Centre
has today had to ask a company to take down a tool that used that
hospital patient data
online.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1403033000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0001.htm#1403033000208">May

for Ministers as to whether they make transfers. The transfer that took
place, though immensely disagreeable to the hon. Gentleman, was
entirely orderly, and I conclude by saying in the friendliest possible
way to him that there are Members who do have something about which to
complain but are disinclined to do so and there are Members who
sometimes have very little about which to complain but make a very
considerable meal out of doing so. It is my firm conviction that the

the Exchequer must ensure that investment increases by some £20
million year on year. We need that money over the next 25 years to
protect homes and businesses better. Maintenance of these defences and

areas. If we build houses on floodplains we cannot complain when we get
subsequent problems. In South Cerney, for example, a recently passed

statutory consultee for large investment, but it has to take into
account only one-in-100-year events when considering whether a
development on a floodplain is viable. That is completely unrealistic
and should rapidly be brought down to a design phase of one-in-25-year
events. The statutory water undertaker, Thames Water, is not even a
statutory consultee; it is consulted by the local planning authority
often only as a matter of principle. Even then, all it has to do is to
say that the sewerage system is capable of being connected to the new
development, not whether the new development will make existing sewage
flooding worse or whether the sewer needs upgrading. This is a legal
grey area. Thames Water has been taken to court several times for

important aspect of the planning system is drainage: sustainable
drainage systems. We are building up for ourselves a huge and unknown
liability from the lack of proper design of drainage systems.
Currently, the local planning authority monitors the drainage system
for a new development. Developers, with plenty of funds behind them,
employ clever drainage engineers who take their percolation tests in
the summer when everything is nice and dry—when, of course, the
drainage works properly—instead of being made to take them in
the winter when the water table is high. They then ask the developer
for a section 106 payment. Often, that payment is inadequate. Under the
Water Bill, as my hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton knows,
SUDS will have to be licensed by the county council. Until that
happens, we have a huge and unknown liability from SUDS, which are
often completely inadequate and designed for one-in-100-year events. I

three instances in which I believe that we should be doing things
differently. First, we need a new framework for the management of flood

be simplified and streamlined. There is too much duplication of effort
and inefficient use of resources, with funding shared between five
levels of government. We need better co-ordination and simplification.
All work related to flooding should ideally take place in one
Department. Locally, a whole-river approach to flood management should
be adopted, from source to the sea. Each catchment and each
river is different, and each should be managed by local people, who
invariably know
best.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030317000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030317000062">Since
the scrapping of the National Rivers Authority in 1994, a more
fragmented approach has been adopted, and we now need greater certainty
and local flexibility. It is also important not to become fixated on
specific ways of managing flood risk: it must be recognised that
different solutions will be appropriate in different settings and on
different rivers. I make this comment with specific regard to the issue
of dredging. In some places it will solve a problem by creating
additional capacity for holding water, while in others it may
exacerbate a problem. In managing a river, it is important to use all
the tools in the box, whether dredging, desilting, repairing of banks,
the managing of vegetation downstream, slowing the flow, storing water

on 5 December. In order to attract that investment, which would
regenerate the area, bringing new business and new jobs to the town, it
is important that robust and comprehensive coastal and flood defence
arrangements are in place. Proposals to achieve that will be submitted
to the Department shortly, and I shall be lobbying vigorously for the
necessary funding.</hs_Para>

there is a need for a new approach to coastal erosion and protection,
and for a longer-term plan and increased investment in sea defences.
Many of the sea defences in Suffolk and Norfolk were put in place by
the Eden and Macmillan Governments after the 1953 floods and are now in
need of urgent repair, upgrading or replacement. Given the events of
2007 and 2013, it seems these sorts of problems are likely to become
more frequent in the coming years. Sea levels on the Suffolk coast have
been rising since records began in Victorian times, and since 1953 they
have been rising by 2.4 mm per annum. When the impact of climate change
is added, it is clear that there is a need for urgent action. In
Lowestoft, Halcrow and BAM Nuttall have made the assessment that
whereas the previous estimate was that a 1953-type flood would occur
every 1,000 years, it could now take place every 20 years.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030317000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030317000076">The
UK’s approach to coastal defences over the past 20 years should
be contrasted with that of the Dutch. After the 1953 floods, they
designed their sea defences to withstand a one-in-4,000-year flood,
whereas ours were designed to withstand only a one-in-1,000-year flood.
The Dutch have pursued a different approach: the provision of their
coastal defences is fully integrated with the provision of other
infrastructure, be it airports, harbours, roads, houses or factories.
In the UK, coastal flood defences have tended to be an add-on and have
all too frequently been cut in times of austerity. The Dutch do not
rely solely on hard defences, and a system of dams, dunes and dykes has
been put in place which enables them to withstand a one-in-10,000-year
storm. By contrast, neither the Pitt review nor the flood and coastal
erosion management plan properly addresses coastal erosion and
flooding. The latter does not fully reflect the differences between
inland flooding, which is temporary, and coastal flooding and erosion,
which can be terminal for affected properties and assets.</hs_Para>

surges that occurred along the east coast in 1953 and 2013 were the
result of a combination of events: very low atmospheric pressure over
the North sea, which caused the sea level to rise dramatically; high
astronomic tides; gale force winds; and rainfall. On both recent
occasions, we escaped by the skin of our teeth, although I concede that
what happened in 1953 was horrific; in 2007, the wind dropped in the
nick of time, and in 2013 the wind was blowing in a northerly direction
and there was no heavy rainfall. I fear that it will not be third time
lucky, and it is important both that new defences are put in place as
soon as practically possible and that we adopt a different approach to
the managing of flood risk.</hs_Para>

rude comment about the way we enacted the Flood and Water Management

it was all terribly bad and a waste of money” and that she
strongly believed it should all be centralised—I may be

to say that what she had said was not so simplistic. Where local lead
flood authorities are good, we are seeing the best sort of devolution
of power and responsibility, and we need to see more of that. Where
they are not living up to that, we should find ways of making it
happen. We discovered through Exercise Watermark, for example, that
some are not playing their part, and that some agencies are not fitting
into that locally. Water companies were partly to blame at that time,
but I do not know whether that is still the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030317000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030317000102"><B><Member ContinuationText="Alok Sharma" PimsId="5638" UID="14030317000178" xid="1102" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030317000178">Alok

Department and the Environment Agency will also assist local

communities that have never been flooded will be flooded. I entirely

report. I brought it with me, but someone has nicked it.
<I>[Laughter.]</I> That is what people get if they leave their papers

experts in our constituencies. One of mine is Dick Greenaway, who was
the surveyor for the Thames Conservancy but has now retired. He has
fascinating knowledge of the history of flooding. After the 1947
floods, an enormous amount of dredging took place in the River Thames.
A lot of the experts of the time said that it would not work and it was
being done for political rather than proper hydrological reasons. The
dredging was picking up bronze-age remains close to the surface of the
river bed, showing that it had not changed for a long time. Dredging
can cause more problems. Since we stopped dredging the Thames to any
large degree, the base of the river has dropped because of the action
of the river and the change in climate. We ignore people such as Dick
Greenaway at our peril.</hs_Para>

investment in flood defence needs, to be frank, a step change. It has
been said that an increase of £20 million a year is needed over
the course of 25 years to get to the right level. Given how fast the
climate seems to be changing, however, I do not think that is enough.
We need to get to the level of expenditure envisaged by the Pitt review

have to try to carry the other nations of the world with us in order to
do what we can to try to improve the climate, but I agree with his
general proposition that limiting our ability to grow our economy and
to have the wealth to create the protection schemes would be the wrong
approach. If we hobble our economy by trying to reduce climate change
through occasionally economically illiterate energy schemes, we will
simply not be able to afford flood defences or have the money to defend

should not be prioritised over people’s homes and livelihoods.

tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgwater and West Somerset

Somerset, parts of the Thames valley and our coastal regions, but for

frequency of flooding events in different parts 
<?notus-xml column=660?>of the country and the impact on the lives of individual communities
leads me to the conclusion that we need a far more radical approach to

cite my town as an example. In 1998, Northampton was inundated with
major flooding over the Easter period when a stationary band of rain
caused extensive flooding in the midlands from Worcestershire to the
Wash. The water levels affecting the area, including Northampton, were
recorded by the Met Office as higher than the 1947 floods, which were
designated the benchmark for inland flooding in this country. Of more
than 4,000 properties affected by the flooding, nearly 2,500 were in
Northampton. Two people died, thousands had to leave their homes,
electricity supplies were lost, and cars, boats and caravan parks were
damaged. Falling as it did on a holiday weekend, the disruption was
exacerbated. It has been estimated that the cost of that flooding
incident was as high as £350 million, and 70% of those flooded
did not have insurance for their homes.</hs_Para>

the flooding was devastating. As a local council, we were determined
not only to learn the lessons but to do what was necessary to minimise
the risk of future flooding. An independent review described the
lessons in terms of floodplain management, forecasting, and investment
in flood defences and warning systems and—this is a vital
point—their maintenance. Thanks to sizeable pressure exerted by
the Northampton flood alleviation group, among others, flood defences
were upgraded to a one-in-200-years standard of protection. A £7
million package of works included reinforcement and construction of
flood walls and earth embankments, and channel improvements included
dredging and widening.</hs_Para>

flooding, but our response in Northampton has proved effective in
preventing some sizeable potential flood incidents since 1998. That has
happened because we had a local group fighting constantly to ensure
that flood protection was high on our agenda. Once the sympathy and
immediate response to the flooding in Somerset and the parts of the
Thames valley and the coastal regions most recently affected calms
down, those residents will, rightly, be asking the self-same questions.
The answer will be judged on the quality of the responses, and
it will be judged to be satisfactory only if the views of people in the
locality are taken into

relevant to the subject in hand. One of the largest, all-encompassing

way with our information and limited finances. Unlike some who would
cast Lord Lawson into outer darkness for daring to question any of the
orthodoxies, I do not think that is the right way to go. We need an
inclusive debate in which we assess the science, taking it with an
appropriate pinch of salt as we in this place learn to do with all
expert opinion. However, the mounting, growing, consistency of
information makes it hard not to accept that the emissions we create in

say that they do not understand it all. Perhaps even more complicated
than understanding which areas will be colder, wetter or warmer as a
result, is working out the best response to that threat, and that is
the fundamental context for this debate on managing flood risk. All
scientists—certainly those I have seen—seem to agree that
greater energy is 
<?notus-xml column=662?>coming to the earth, which will lead to greater
levels of precipitation. In some areas there will be intensified
drought, and in others intensified rainfall. In that context we must

change—but about he long term.</hs_Para>

tried to look at the evidence, drawn a line, and worked out the areas
they cannot afford to defend because they are indefensible or so costly
that it is unreasonable. Behind that line they have statutory standards
and flood boards with much wider tax bases, who are
elected—admittedly sometimes with derisory turnouts—to
put in place and, as various hon. Friends have said, to maintain the
defences, so that that standard is delivered. The Dutch would say that
that is far from perfect, but it provides a framework in which people

allow very slow-moving water to get out, leading to anything 
<?notus-xml column=663?>other than an improvement. It will not stop one-in-200-year flooding
events having a negative effect, but it will make them last slightly
less long with a less wide impact. Dredging also appeals to local
people, who like to feel that those bits of the system that drain water
away are kept in a state of usefulness.</hs_Para>

would like to make to the Minister is that when the Keyingham internal
drainage board in my constituency was looking to carry out dredging at
Stone Creek and Hedon Haven, the new Marine Management Organisation
decided to charge it for a licence. We spent years pulling all the
pools and the political will together to get the sign off to allow us
to dredge and let the water out, but what happened? This glorified new
quango came along and sent in a suggested bill for thousands of pounds
to grant a licence, even though the Environment Agency, when it had
done similar work elsewhere, had not charged anything. The MMO decided
that it had to do so much more work it ended up charging £10,000
for that one bit of dredging. Will the Minister please ensure that
quangos do not inflict charges that stop local people doing what is
necessary to make sure that things are more sensibly
managed?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000039">After
2007, there was a good response from people who had, up until that
point, not performed as well as they should; whether that was Yorkshire
Water, the Environment Agency or the council. In our area, people did
not know who owned the pumps, let alone whether they were responsible
for keeping them going, but since 2007 they have worked together. In
front of Willow Grove in Beverley, Yorkshire Water has done a great
deal of work, and the local council then came in and worked closely
with local residents. In 2007, a very beautiful row of houses was
famously pictured all flooded. The picture went out around the world. A
flood wall has now been erected in front of those homes, trees have
been planted and the Westwood area has been restored. Local ownership
really can work and we need to ensure we keep it that way.</hs_Para>

which I chair. The Environment Agency and others have supported finding
the funding to try to have better modelling of the River Hull

do not wish to prejudge the position, but I hope to be able to make
common-sense recommendations that will enable the representatives of
the city of Hull and the East Riding to speak with one voice, and
suggest changes to the framework that will facilitate the adoption of
an approach that is as reasonable and joined-up as possible. I

think they have shown that they are committed to dealing with this
issue. I mentioned the framework because I want that commitment to
continue long after the issue—along with the water—has,
we hope, drained away. The Government have introduced a series of
measures that have already been mentioned, providing not only grants

must do is cut through the bureaucracy. Perhaps the Minister can help
with that. For instance, a small business person in my constituency who
owns a pub in Hull contacted the city council when it was
flooded. He said “I was delighted to hear on the news that the
Government can help me to get through this. I am paying my staff at the
moment, because I do not want to lose them and I must look after them,
but my pub is taking no money.” He was told “We have not
got any forms yet.” “So I cannot apply for help?”
“No. We have not got any forms yet.” That kind of
nonsense must end. We must ensure that whichever council or other
authority is involved can move quickly, because there is nothing more
frustrating than hearing people make promises on television, and then
finding that the door is barred by some foolish bit of
bureaucracy.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14030319000092" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000092">5.52

Nokes</B> (Romsey and Southampton North) (Con):</Member> The issue of
managing flood risk has inevitably come to the fore in my constituency.
Since 24 December, some properties have been flooded not only by river
water but by foul sewage. Environment Agency records show that back in
2007, Romsey, along with Winchester, was identified as one of the areas
in Hampshire that were most prone to
flooding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000046">I
want to touch on some specific issues, including development, which
other Members have already mentioned. We should think about development
not just on the floodplains, but in the catchment areas. We should
think about the impact of building yet more houses on land that has
previously acted as a natural sponge. We should think about the run-off
caused by more tarmac and more roof tiles.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000047">In my
constituency, during the run-up to Christmas and into the new year,
significant problems were caused by surface water run-off and combined
drainage systems that simply could not cope with the amount of
rainfall. Since then, however, the problems have been caused not 
<?notus-xml column=665?>by foul drainage but by the beautiful River Test,
which has burst its banks in several places, and by its carriers and
tributaries. That has had an impact in many parts of my constituency,
not just in
Romsey.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000048">I
agree with other Members who have said that we need a coherent
strategy. We cannot view Romsey in isolation from the villages further
north along the river valley, because any work that is done further
north will have an impact on Romsey. In the villages, I have heard many
calls for dredging, for a widening of the streams and water courses,
and for better weed clearance. However, that could have the effect of
sending water down to Romsey and the River Test even faster. We know
that the Test has a maximum capacity of about 50 tonnes of water per
second, but according to some figures it has run at 55 tonnes per
second over the past few weeks. It does not take a rocket scientist to
work out what will happen next: the river will flood. We need a
coherent strategy that will establish ways of slowing the river down as
it passes down the beautiful Test valley.</hs_Para>

engineer and I do not pretend to have the solutions, but I think that
we can work something out. Just over a week ago, I was told by the Army
that it was necessary to find bits of land that could be flooded safely
without affecting people’s homes and without necessarily
affecting sites of special scientific interest, in a manner designed by
the Environment Agency. The water needs to be slowed somewhat, so that
when it arrives at Romsey—where all of it has to pass under one
bridge at Mainstone—there is not a deluge but a controlled
flow.</hs_Para>

for us to use the knowledge we have gained over the past month or so.
The help from the military has been invaluable, but I also pay tribute
to the Environment Agency, many of whose staff have been working 24/7,
literally around the clock, putting in more than 80 hours per week just
to ensure that homes are kept safe and people are not flooded out. We
have learnt a great deal. Aerial photographs taken in my constituency
show exactly where the Test has flooded. A massive amount of work has
also been done on a little-known river, the Fishlake stream. I do not
think that anyone knew quite how fragile the bank of that stream was
until the Friday at the beginning of February when it started to
overtop the bank and erode the outside of it. Suddenly, it became a
crisis point. I do not believe that the Environment Agency identified
it as such back in 2007, but we have learnt this time. We have had
thousands of man hours of assistance—engineers have tried to
establish the best way of preserving and protecting the bank for the
future—and we have had critical lessons to
learn.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000051">I
should pay tribute to a host of organisations in addition to the
Environment Agency, particularly the emergency services, but also the
Houghton fishing club, a wonderful riparian owner in the north of the
constituency. Its members were out digging relief channels and making
sure that houses in Stockbridge were protected during the critical
first weekend of the flooding. There has been flooding in Stockbridge,
but it has been limited to three houses. Stockbridge is a beautiful
village on the banks of the Test, and many carriers run under the high
street. It is phenomenal that only three houses were flooded; the
situation could have been much worse had it not been for the immediate
response of the fishing club, which, as an organisation that has
existed for many years, knows the river better than almost any 
<?notus-xml column=666?>other. It was able to identify what could safely be done to create
relief for the properties on the banks of some of the carriers that
were in the most peril, without endangering further
houses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000052">I
also pay tribute to all those who have been involved in the
multi-agency approach, and to the independent companies that have made
fantastic offers of help with the flood effort. I am thinking
particularly of NGS, a company in Southampton that is best known for
supplying grit and salt for roads in icy weather. It donated sand for
sandbags at a critical time, just as Romsey had established that an
additional 40,000 sandbags were needed. I gather that about
80,000 sandbags have now been laid down in the affected part of the
borough, thanks to a phenomenal effort. Travelling around the
constituency over the weekend, I saw areas where the provision of
sandbags was still essential.</hs_Para>

of the Test, the groundwater-fed river is causing a considerable
problem. Water levels are still rising, and groundwater springs are
still popping up in places where they have never appeared in the past.
The village of King’s Somborne, for example, has a wonderful
stream passing through it, but that stream is overflowing into many
houses across roads, and has made it incredibly difficult for people to
get out just in order to buy essentials. Many businesses such as
village pubs and shops, which are critical to village life, are unable

horrendously flooded. The emergency services had to shut the
Greatbridge road because of the depth of water, yet some businesses in
the industrial estate were dry. There was no access to them, however,

want to conclude with a plea. Almost inevitably, it comes from the lead
flood authority, Hampshire flood authority, and it refers specifically
to the flood defence grant in aid. The deadline for the submission to
Government is incredibly tight. It was moved from 3 March out to
12 March, but that is only next week, and there are concerns
that what will happen as a result is that the most developed and
worked-up schemes will be submitted, which might not necessarily be the
schemes that would 
<?notus-xml column=667?>best protect the villages in my constituency or
Romsey itself. That is a very real concern, because what we have
learned over the past three and a half weeks is where the crisis points
are. We perhaps did not know in detail where they were previously, but
we do now. It is absolutely critical that the areas which need the help
most, in that they need the most investment to prevent future flooding,
are the ones that get it. We need to have not simply the
schemes that are furthest down the pipeline, but the ones that address
where there is the biggest point of crisis.</hs_Para>

just with river flooding, but with ground water; as we are a county

some simple lessons that can be drawn from the experience of this
winter, particularly on Romney marsh. There is no mystery to keeping
the Romney marsh from flooding. It has been designed to manage large
amounts of water. To keep the water moving, there need to be
pumps when the water gets too high and ditches need to be clear to push
the water out, ultimately into the sea, through the main drainage
canals.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000067">There are a
few very important areas of work that have to be done well and
consistently in order to make that happen. First, the drainage ditches
must be kept clear, especially of the build-up of reeds. That needs to
be done methodically and all the time. It does not require the ditches
to be dredged. The regular cutting of reeds serves to remove silt and
keeps the waterways moving.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000068">This work is
done by two bodies: the Romney marsh internal drainage board and the
EA, with the agency taking responsibility for the larger watercourses.
I would pose the question, however, as to whether we should have one
body that deals with all this work in a co-ordinated fashion, and
whether it would be better for the local internal drainage board to
take over the responsibility for all the cutting on the marsh, thereby
recouping some of the money it pays to the EA to do that work for it.
Sometimes the drainage board will cut smaller ditches that run up to
the larger ones and then stop because that then becomes the
responsibility of a different agency. It seems to me that it would be
more efficient to have one body that is responsible for this
work.</hs_Para>

other important area is pumping. All Members have talked about the need
to pump water. When there is a build up of water on flat land, we need
to get it off and get it moving. The EA has done a fantastic job in
getting pumps installed to keep water moving on Romney marsh. It has
installed 15 pumps during the course of the winter flooding. On one
occasion I had a meeting with the agency and the internal drainage
board on a Friday afternoon to see what more we could do to get more
pumps in place to relieve the pressure on residents in Lydd, and most
pumps were in place on the Monday. They were therefore very
responsive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000070">One
reason why we needed the additional pumps, however, was that some of
the older pumps in place on the marsh had stopped working. Maintenance
is important. There will need to be substantial capital investment at
some point in the near future in some of the older pumps. This will be
an investment that will save money because the need to bring on relief
pumps at short notice often costs more than maintaining the ones we
have. We will have to consider where the extra capital investment will
come from for the pumping equipment on the marsh. Having efficient
pumps working well and the ditches kept clear is a cost-effective and
efficient way of ensuring the water gets off and away as quickly
as it needs
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000071">Co-ordination
between different services is another issue. People have spoken about
the need for co-ordination between the EA, the emergency services and
local councils, and I would also include organisations such as UK Power
Networks. We have had incidents where, because of storms, there has
been a power outage, and therefore power that was being supplied to one
of the pumps has gone down, yet when the EA sought to take that up with
UK Power Networks, as the responsible body, it might as well have been
calling a call centre. There did not seem to be a fast-track response
mechanism whereby the EA could speak immediately to someone at UK Power
Networks who could tackle the problem. That led to too long a period of
time before action could be taken to get the pumps working again or
before going to the extra expense of relief pumps being
brought in because some of the main pumps had failed.
How we build resilience into the network by having better
co-ordination between UK Power Networks and the EA is a very important
question.</hs_Para>

also be greater clarity about the roles of the local authorities and
the EA, and sometimes also the Highways Agency when there is flooding
on roads or water running off roads because the drains and ditches have
not been maintained properly. It must be clear who is responsible.
Constituents of mine in East Brabourne were affected. They dealt with
the situation directly themselves by paying for the relief measures
that needed to be put in place. The question of who is responsible for
this work needs to be addressed, however. Who should be doing this work
on a regular basis? When there is a crisis, do residents know who are
the first people to go to? I do not think it is clear, and sometimes
this basic maintenance work falls down because of a breakdown in
communication between different local agencies. That is relatively easy
to fix.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000073">There is no
doubt that we have had a huge amount of rain. One resident I met in
East Brabourne, Oliver Trowell, has lived in his house for more than 80
years and he had never seen flooding like it—I hope he does 
<?notus-xml column=670?>not see it again. Residents in the Elham valley,
where I live, say that the level of water in the River Nailbourne is
such that it may be decades before we see the same level again, but we
are having to deal with it. We need to build in elements of stronger
local resilience, ensure that the maintenance work is done and consider
how the capital investment in some of the basic pumping equipment can
be put in place over the next few years to ensure that when the next
big winter flood comes we have all the local defences we need in place,
the resilience built in and good co-ordination between the emergency
services. That is the best way to make sure that the money the
Environment Agency is investing in tackling flooding is having the best
possible impact and providing the maximum possible benefit to local
communities. That is the best way to plan for the future risk
of flooding, which we know will inevitably
come.</hs_Para>

Sarah Wollaston</B> (Totnes) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to follow
my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins),
with whose comments about the need for co-ordination and communication

constituency—south Devon has taken a terrible battering but it

address three points, including the underlying causes and the need to
build resilience in our coastal defences—I wish today to
concentrate on coastal flooding. First, however, I ask the Minister to
listen to the desperate plight of fishermen in my constituency, 21 of
whom have written to me in the past fortnight. The situation for them,
particularly the crab fishermen, is desperate. A crabbing pot costs
£60 to replace and a shrimping pot costs £40—that
is before the extra costs of materials such as rope are added on. Most
of the 21 fishermen who have written to me—there are many more
fishermen in this position—have lost about 100 pots, but some
have lost 300 pots. They are looking at having to pay between
£6,000 and £18,000. We also need to take into account the
desperate conditions they have faced over the past few months. Some
have been able to get out on only two or three occasions, and even then
they have been having to try to retrieve gear.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000076">That
desperate situation is faced by many fishermen, and I would love to
read out each and every one of their letters. However, what I shall do
instead is ask the Minister to meet me—I have written to the
Department—to see whether we could consider having the same
scheme for them as has been put in place for farmers. I welcome the
farming recovery fund that the Department has set up jointly with an EU
funding mechanism, because several funding mechanisms are now in place
for farmers: support with business rates, and the many capital
replacement grants for those who have been flooded. However, they apply
only to people who have been flooded and fishermen, who of course work
in a flooded environment all the time, are dealing with a different
issue—the damage from the storms—although one very much
related to the issue we are debating. Farmers can access a fund of
between £500 and £5,000. Will the Minister reassure
fishermen that a similar fund will be set up for them? That would be
enormously reassuring. As the lead Minister for co-ordinating on this
matter, will he talk to the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills and his colleagues in the Department for 
<?notus-xml column=671?>Communities and Local Government about rolling out some of the grants
that have been made available to farmers and make similar schemes
available to fishermen? Many of the fishermen who have written to me
face bankruptcy and will lose their businesses for ever, so there is an
urgent need for action in the next month, not in three months’
time. I hope the Minister will address that in his response.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000077">As the
Minister will know, the other pressing issue for coastal constituencies
in the south-west is the resilience of the rail line at Dawlish. As I
have said, we are open for business; I would not want anyone to think
that because the rail line is cut off, people cannot visit Devon and
Cornwall—of course they can. However, the situation is having a
huge impact on the region’s economy. I hope that he will address
a concern that is mentioned in my constituency. Nobody wants Devon and
Cornwall to be cut off every time there is heavy rainfall, and we
welcome many of the measures that are being put in place to improve
resilience north of Exeter, but resilience measures that bypass the
line and take things via Okehampton would have catastrophic results for
south Devon. That would not be building resilience; it would be
building disaster. We are seeking a super-resilient line at Dawlish;
perhaps there could be an alternative route to use in dire emergencies
but not a replacement for that route. I hope the Minister will address
that issue in his summing
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000078">I
wish to discuss another issue facing some coastal communities in my
constituencies by drawing on a couple of examples that illustrate a
wider point affecting many constituencies around the country. I have
spoken several times about the community of Beesands in my
constituency, which I visited recently. The council spent
£50,000 trying just a few weeks ago to put back the sea defences
that had been washed away there, but they were washed away again with
the first easterly and high tide. We do not want to put back what has
just been washed away, because that is just throwing good money after
bad. Beesands needs an improved sea defence. I praise the work of
individuals such as Chris Brook who have gone to enormous trouble to
source the rock armour from a quarry in Cornwall. It is all ready to
go, the designs are in place to increase the height of the rock armour
defences, but unfortunately we have hit a barrier—the need for
planning permission. There is confusion because some parts of
legislation appear to give councils the ability in an emergency
situation to go ahead and put in place these sea defences, but
elsewhere there seems to be a measure saying that planning permission
is required for sea defences over 200 cubic metres. We cannot afford to
delay, because the implications for Beesands of another high tide and a
south-easterly are grave indeed. There is no point putting back exactly
what has just been washed away, so I hope that the Minister, in his
role of co-ordinating things, will try to sweep away some of these
bureaucratic barriers, because everyone knows what needs to be put in
place and we just need to get it going.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000079">I also hope
that the Minister will work with councils, because we would like
military support for the lift-in. Anyone who has visited Beesands will
know that access to it is incredibly narrow, down a very steep hill,
and we may need at least 450 lorry loads. Military assistance, as 
<?notus-xml column=672?>was put in place for the original delivery of the rock armour, would
expedite this delivery and allow us to get the sea defences in place at
this critical time. I hope that he will examine this wider point of
urgency and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe
said, the need for agencies to work together to try to sweep away some
of the barriers and just get the work done—that is
vital.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030319000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000080">I
will not say that Beesands is fortunate, because it is in a difficult
position, but in some ways the neighbouring community in North
Hallsands is in a much worse situation. Even though it is only a short
distance down the coast, the shoreline management plan designates it
for no active intervention, which has left the local community feeling
as if they have been abandoned and people are just walking away. The
road access to this community has been cut off and they are currently
having to take a detour around a private car park. The trouble for this
community is that Devon county council will say, “We only own
the road surface.” The council has sort of walked away, and so
the villagers are left with rock armour scattered all over the place,
there is no access for the local fishing community and the place feels
as if it has been abandoned. Will the Minister examine the impact that
shoreline management plans have, because I understand that there are
some powers to have flexibility in this area and there is no way this
tiny local community could afford to rebuild its sea defences on its
own?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030319000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030319000081">This is such
a sensitive issue because the community at North Hallsands needs only
to look a very short distance down the cliff to see what
happened to the original community of Hallsands. Anyone who knows south
Devon will know that in 1897 an extraction licence was granted to Sir
John Jackson, 650,000 tonnes of shingle were then removed from off the
coast of the village, the shingle beach dropped dramatically and the
village was swept away, with only a few ruined dwellings left
behind—a population of 159 lost their homes completely. There is
great local sensitivity about this issue within the community of North
Hallsands, some of whom are descendants of those original habitants of
Hallsands. I hope that the Minister will look sympathetically at trying
to get them access along their road, or even some help so that they can
have assistance in overcoming the complications, and at reviewing the
shoreline management plan, which has left them feeling
abandoned.</hs_Para>

is that of the Slapton line. The shoreline management plan there is one
of managed retreat, which will have terrible consequences for the
economy of my constituency. It is an essential communication route
between its two halves. To negotiate the alternative route down back
lanes requires someone to be exceptionally good at reversing very long
distances at speed. It is simply completely inadequate. I call on the
Minister to review the shoreline management plan for the whole area to
give us some real hope for the future.</hs_Para>

village of Hallsands stands as a testament to what happens if we ignore
man-made impact on climate change. I hope that the Minister will
consider climate change in itself—I know he feels strongly about
it—because we ignore that at our peril. It is not just that the
jet stream has settled over southern England but the fact that it is
30% stronger. If we ignore the problem of emissions, this sort of
flooding will not be an exceptional weather event but the new
normal.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-03-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_03_PT_1/CC91651241AFE2C5313D9883AA7DD18379DC8235" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 March 2014">Monday

allocated just £2.34 billion to flood defences, compared with
£2.37 billion over the previous spending period. Those figures
are not the ones that the Prime Minister used two weeks ago at Prime
Minister’s questions, but they are the ones set out clearly by
the independent Committee on Climate Change in its policy note on 21
January, used by the House of Commons Library in its briefing on flood
defence spending and set out by the UK Statistics Authority just six
days ago. They can even be corroborated on the website of the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the correction it
had to put out after the Secretary of State and the Prime Minister both
“mis-spoke”. As the UK Statistics Authority reported last
week, the flood defence budget has seen a real-terms cut of £247
million in this spending period. The Committee was absolutely clear
about the risk from the reduction of flood defence funds. Last October,
in their official response to the report, the Government

us be clear: the Government need to do two things. They need to
construct more flood defences that will bring more homes and properties
into a lower risk of flooding, but they also need to maintain those new
and existing flood defences in proper condition so that they continue
to provide protection. Unhelpfully, the Government chose to categorise
all major maintenance or repair work to existing flood defences as
capital spend. Uniquely in the debate so far, the hon. Member for
Thirsk and Malton alluded to that point.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030335000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000019">I want to
make two points in that connection. First, it is not sensible to
increase the new build flood defences without a corresponding increase
in the budget for major repairs. In the interests of
transparency, the Government need to disaggregate the element of their
capital spend budget that is for new defences and the part that is for
the major repair and maintenance of assets. Secondly, as the Government
have used the capital spend as a proxy for spending on flood defences,
they might confuse people who think that they are building more
defences when, in fact, because of climate change and storm damage,
they are simply spending more on major repairs to existing defences. In
other words, there may be no increase in the number of defences or,
indeed, the number of properties and homes defended, just an
ever-increasing capital repair bill to maintain them. The hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) made that point
earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000020">It
is therefore important that we examine the fine detail of the
EA’s budget in this respect. In a policy note of 21 January, the
adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change did
precisely that. All its figures are based on real terms,
according to 2010 prices. The capital is lower in every year
of this Government than when they started with £360 million in
2010-11. The figure falls to £261 million in 2011-12 and to
£269 million in 2012-13, before rising slightly to
£294 million in 2013-14, and finally, at £344
million, falling £16 million short of where it
started in 2014-15. As my hon. Friend the Member for Garston and
Halewood (Maria Eagle) noted in her speech to the House last week,
those spreadsheet figures translate into real projects. The loss of
£274 million has resulted in 290 shovel-ready projects being
cancelled and 996 being
delayed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dan Rogerson" PimsId="4840" UID="14030335000171" xid="825" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000171">Dan

at Prime Minister’s questions that the EA is planning to make

and was unable to explain how he considered that the EA could give
people the sort of assistance that we have seen over the past two
months and to which many hon. Members have paid tribute this afternoon,
and I join them in doing so. How will the EA do that with 550 fewer
staff? Today, I ask him to tell the House what roles the people in
those posts currently perform. Are some of them the people who
actually manage the flows of water in the waterways, by
monitoring and operating the sluice gates, the weirs, the locks and the
pumps? Do they include the people who survey and assess the
condition of flood defences. Do they include the people who prepare the
maintenance schedules for those defences? Do they include any of the
people who have been helped with the clear-up operations?
What is of enormous concern is that those skills and expertise might be
lost with these redundancies, with the corresponding loss of service

the Government have set out their forward projects for
capital, by saying that they will spend £370 million a
year in 2015-16 and every year through to 2021. The Minister needs to
be open with the House today about what percentage of that money in
each year will be used for new build flood defences and what will be
used for major capital repairs and maintenance. The Committee on
Climate Change has been astute in analysing the figure of 165,000
properties that the Secretary of State told our Select Committee were
“better protected” in the current spending period when he
gave evidence to us last year. It warns that flood risk will actually
reduce only for a proportion of the 165,000 properties. Many capital
schemes are simply replacing or refurbishing existing defences on a
like-for-like basis and to the same crest height. With climate change,
many of those homes will be less well protected than when the defences
were originally built. The defence may have been repaired, but the risk
that it will be overtopped as a result of climate change has increased.
Far too many homes and properties are still at risk because the
defences that we have are less effective than they once were because of
the increased frequency and severity of extreme
weather.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000027">As

within the Government on climate change. But doubt and confusion are
what we have from the two Secretaries of State in charge of protecting
our homes, infrastructure and industry. The Environment

too often, we reach for concrete and steel solutions to the problem of
flooding instead of looking at soft, green infrastructural approaches.
There are notable exceptions, and Wessex Water, for example, operates a
catchment management system that pays landowners to manage the uplands
in a benign way that retains water and purifies it, instead of allowing
contaminated water in need of treatment to run swiftly down the
catchment. Land management plays a vital role. The retention of 
<?notus-xml column=678?>flood water upstream through woodland and ground cover in the uplands is
every bit as important as dredging in the lower levels of the
catchment. Landowners always seek to dredge the river as it passes
through their land. That is the quickest way to try to ensure that
their own land is not flooded and the problem is passed downstream.
This approach was contained in the Pitt review under recommendation 27.

delays from the Department, particularly in implementing sustainable
drainage systems—that is not necessarily its fault—and
the review of partnership funding has not yet reported. Will the
Department look favourably at allowing more transfer from capital
expenditure to revenue and maintenance expenditure, as the hon. Member
for Brent North suggested? In the long term, there are opportunities
for water companies and others such as insurance companies to
contribute to both funding streams.</hs_Para>

Rogerson:</Member></B> The figures that I am setting
out into the future are for capital spending, and we expect revenue
amounts to be settled as budgets are introduced for each year. However,
the points that the Chair of the Select Committee makes about seeking
contributions from all those involved in water management are entirely
valid. In her speech she spoke about water company investment in water
management that goes beyond the “hardware” side of things
and looks more at the softer side of managing water through land
management solutions. Ofwat is considering what it does with
totex—total expenditure. It is looking at expenditure across the
piece, rather than just at capital—the sort of things that
appear on balance sheets that, in the past, would have been the focus.
I accept that many people want to change that, so the fact that Ofwat
has allowed water companies to do more of that will be
beneficial.</hs_Para>

earlier, and a number of other Members referred to the planning
process. The good news is that the advice that the Environment Agency
gives is taken into account in the vast majority of circumstances.
However, there may be examples where we could look at that. My right
hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, who has discussed the response and recovery aspects of
these flooding events at the Dispatch Box on a number of occasions,
will have heard that cry, and the national planning policy framework,
which the Government have set out, makes it clear that we should not
build on floodplains. There are locations, such as those, as we have
heard, in the Humber area and so on, where that means no development at
all, and the guidance makes it clear that we should see more resistance
and resilience built into existing properties. The hon. Member for

doubt take a view on that. We would need to look at what taxes and
levies are being raised from an area in total, because we know that
some of them are hard-pressed and we do not want to increase burdens.
If that could be done within what is raised by local authorities, using
the relationships they have with internal drainage boards, individual
proposals could be considered. There are places in the country where
the possibility of setting up new internal drainage boards is being
examined. If we can overcome the barriers, I think that would be very

which was mentioned in her Committee’s report. Some 95%
of arable land in England is either outside areas at risk of flooding
or benefits from at least a one-in-75-year standard of flood defence.
In fact, the partnership approach that the Government have taken means
that some schemes that would not otherwise have been funded are now
coming forward, because local funding means that the grant in aid now
makes a sufficient difference to take a project forward. With regard to
the areas that have been protected, my hon. Friend the Member for
Newbury (Richard Benyon), my predecessor as Minister, was right to give
the figure of 1.3 million properties. Great areas of agricultural land
have also been protected by many of those defences, so it is not a case
of setting one benefit against another; obviously we seek schemes that
will do both.</hs_Para>

some of the most extreme impacts of the recent flooding have been felt.
Those pilots will run for a year. We need to allow them to run their

affordable flood insurance and give them confidence for the future. He
referred to community action and the great strength and resilience of
local communities where people have helped each other, and he is
absolutely right. When I visited Somerset last week I met the Flooding

very important. In my local area, the Cornwall flood forum is making a
significant contribution to resilience and readiness in the community.
It discusses not only what has happened, but what might happen and how
communities can be ready for it. The National Flood Forum brings
together that expertise and provides tools on its website about the
property-level protection we have heard about today. The Government,
through grant in aid, provide those who might struggle to afford some
of those products in their home with the opportunity to have support in
bringing them in, which I think is welcome. For those who have the

been impressed by how the industry has ensured that their loss
adjusters are out there. If hon. Members want to raise any local
concerns with me, I will of course pass them on to the Association of
British Insurers. He welcomed the help for those who have been flooded.
As I have mentioned, we have offered a package of measures to help
those affected. Like many other Members, the hon. Gentleman put on the
record his support for those in the Environment Agency, who have worked
incredibly hard during this period. It has been relentless for those

building. Many others have experienced flooding in their gardens, on
their streets or in local businesses, and many communities, such as

reached many more properties, but the number that have actually been

Tim Yeo</B> (South Suffolk) (Con):</Member> I am delighted that the
House is debating this important subject. Its importance can be gauged
by the fact that by 2020 the amount of possible spending under the levy
control framework will be £7.6 billion a year, more than double
the total budget of the Department of Energy and Climate Change. The
fact that the money comes from consumers rather than taxpayers is, as
far as parliamentary scrutiny is concerned, rather beside the point.
The two categories largely overlap, and as the sums are so large it is
essential that Parliament should scrutinise effectively and carefully
how they are spent. I shall come back to that point.</hs_Para>

drawing attention to my entry in the Register of Members’
Financial Interests. In doing so, I emphasise again that my views on
climate change and the need to cut greenhouse gas emissions were formed
more than 20 years ago, when I had ministerial responsibility at the
old Department of the Environment in John Major’s Government. I
studied the science as it then was and concluded—as, I hope, an
open-minded layman—that the increased concentration of
greenhouse gases in the atmosphere was likely to be a significant and
possibly the main cause of the observed changes in the climate that the
world was and still is
experiencing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000074">My
views have not changed in the intervening 21 years. I have
expressed them regularly in private and public as a member of the
Government and of the shadow Cabinet, including as shadow Secretary of
State for the Environment and for Trade and Industry, and as a Back
Bencher. The financial interests recorded in the register have all been
acquired since I left the Front Bench in 2005. Suggestions that my
views have in some way been influenced by those interests are not
supported by the
facts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000075">I
hope and believe that we are now seeing the last gasps of the
flat-earthers in the debates on climate change. The Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change fifth assessment report has reinforced the
overwhelming scientific consensus that the conditions of climate
stability that the world has enjoyed in the past few hundred years and
which have made possible the unprecedented and phenomenal success of
one of the earth’s most recently arrived species—human
beings—are now threatened by the activity of that same
species.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000076">I
warmly welcome the public statements made in various parts of the world
in the past few days by my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the
Chancellor 
<?notus-xml column=686?>of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Education, all of whom
have endorsed those scientific conclusions. That mainstream acceptance
of the science, which is shared on a bipartisan basis by the
Opposition, is very helpful because it allows us to concentrate on what
the real debate should be about: how should we in Britain tackle the
challenge of cutting our own greenhouse gas emissions? How can we play
our part in helping the whole world move towards a low-carbon
economy?</hs_Para>

understand the fears of some about the short-term additional cost of
low-carbon investment and the burden that that might
place—particularly on poorer households, for whom energy bills
are a significant anxiety. I also understand fears about the wider
impact that that cost could have on Britain’s competitive
position. Those are all legitimate concerns, and they should be
assessed in the context of the knowledge that action in Britain alone
will not solve the problem.</hs_Para>

need to be aware that other countries are now moving
quickly—surprisingly quickly in the case of China, perhaps. Even
in the United States a substantial change in what is happening on the
ground has occurred in the past few years. Those extra costs will
disappear entirely if the price of carbon rises, as seems probable if
international concern about climate change intensifies in the next few
years. I am confident that those countries—I hope that Britain
will be among them—that lead the way towards a low-carbon
economy will in the medium term not just have done the right thing
environmentally but reap an economic benefit, in the form of lower
costs and improved competitiveness, as the price of carbon rises,
whether due to the widespread introduction of carbon taxes, to a carbon
price driven by emissions trading or, as seems most likely, to a
combination of the
two.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000079">All
that is directly relevant to this debate. I warmly welcome the
establishment of the levy control framework and the pathway to 2020
helpfully set out by the coalition at the end of 2012. That was
reassuring for investors and gave great encouragement to those of us
such as me who are extremely concerned about climate change. It
encouraged us to see that a realistic amount of support will be
available to promote and support low-carbon electricity generation,
including a significant element of renewable
energy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0002.htm#14030335000080">I
want to look first at the scope of the levy control
framework—what it covers and what it does not. We already know
that a range of low-carbon electricity generating technologies will be
covered; they have already been identified and strike prices for
contracts for difference have been announced. It would be helpful if
the Minister confirmed this evening that the list is not exhaustive and
that proper consideration will be given in future to extending it. None
of us knows today what technologies may be available in a few
years’ time; some may offer better value for money than those
available
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000081">I
would also like the Minister to clarify how the capacity mechanism will
fit into this. There is an urgent need for clarity on this subject. He
will be well aware of the narrow margin of surplus generating capacity
that will exist a year or two hence. Part of that problem is caused by
the reluctance of investors to commit to new investment in gas-fired
power stations, despite the glittering prospect of large quantities of
domestic gas reserves if the reluctance of local communities to exploit
them by using fracking can be overcome. I welcome the 
<?notus-xml column=687?>Government’s incentives, but I am not sure that they are yet
sufficient to persuade some of the residents of beautiful parts of our
crowded countryside. We are even seeing a reluctance among investors to
bring existing gas plants out of mothballs. That reluctance is unlikely
to be overcome until more details have been revealed of how the
capacity mechanism will work in
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000082">Of
course, levy control framework money will not be confined to supporting
electricity generation. Any light the Minister can shed on how it can
be used to support demand-side measures would be welcome. It would also
be useful to explore how the cost of supporting carbon capture and
storage—on which I welcome the recent progress that has been
announced—will fit into the other priorities for the levy
control
framework.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000083">On
to the key issue of expenditure control, levy control framework
spending will, by its nature, be very hard to predict: the lower the
price of gas, the greater the cost of the contracts for difference that
has to be met from the LCF. Given that the Department for Energy and
Climate Change forecasts that, by 2020, as much as a third of all LCF
spending will be accounted for by CfDs, it would be helpful to know
what assumptions my right hon. Friend has made about gas prices in the
pathway through and up to 2020 in arriving at the estimate of about
£2.5 billion of LCF spending that is to be allocated to meet the
cost of
CfDs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000084">Will
the Minister also say a bit about what will happen if gas prices turn
out to be much lower? That would, of course, be a happy scenario for
consumers, because it would mean that their energy bills were lower,
but it might result in a substantial shortfall in the LCF. How will
that cost be met? Will consumers be expected to bear the burden of the
overrun? That might not be such an unreasonable prospect, given that in
such circumstances the part of consumer bills accounted for by the
wholesale gas price, which is substantial, would be lower than
expected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000085">By
the same token, the opposite scenario is also interesting. What will
happen if gas prices are much higher than expected? In theory, at
least, the cost of the CfDs could be zero. Does that mean that lots
more contracts would be offered to allow a much greater level of
guaranteed support for low-carbon electricity generation, or would the
Government simply rely on the market to incentivise new low-carbon
investment in view of the rising cost of fossil
fuels?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000086">In
view of all those uncertainties and the inherent difficulty of making
long-term future projections about energy prices, will the Government
publish annually an update on the assumptions about gas price they will
use in reaching their judgment about the cost of CfDs within the
LCF?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000087">On
the subject of controlling costs, I would be very interested to hear
the Minister’s comments about the value for money offered by
different technologies. The main aim of the renewables obligation,
feed-in tariffs and CfDs is to help Britain meet its greenhouse gas
emission reduction targets by encouraging low-carbon electricity
generation, but affordability is also a very important aim of energy
policy. I note with interest that the Government believe that offshore
wind may make the biggest contribution of all the technologies
currently included for support by the LCF.</hs_Para>

says on this and some other subjects. It is perfectly true that,
arithmetically, nuclear is very expensive. I think that the decision,
which I support, can be justified on only two grounds. The first is
that I am uncertain that, even with all the other support, we will be
able to generate enough electricity from low-carbon renewables to meet
the targets we have set for 2020 and beyond, from 2030 through to 2050.
It would need some pretty heroic assumptions about the roll-out of some
of the technologies to think that we could replace the whole of the
electricity currently generated by nuclear with electricity from other
low-carbon
sources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030335000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030335000090">Secondly,
I think there is a real prospect—though I do not suppose I will
carry the hon. Lady on this point—of the cost of nuclear coming
down substantially if we see a big expansion of the industry. Nuclear
power stations in China, for example, are going to become almost a
commodity given the number that will be rolled out. In the 2020s, we
might find that we will be able to buy them off the peg at a much lower
price than the admittedly high price currently expected for Hinkley

heroic, particularly if we add community energy and energy efficiency,

We know that we could make huge inroads on the amount of energy we use
if we were serious about that. If we combine that with renewables,
there is plenty of evidence from the Centre for Alternative Technology

first new nuclear power station, but it is worth looking at and
updating our assumptions. Nuclear is not exactly going to be in

want to discuss a possible scenario. Of all the technologies being
supported at the moment, the biggest expectation is for offshore wind.
In 2017, offshore wind will qualify for a strike price of £140
and onshore wind for a strike price of £95, and let us suppose
that the price of gas-fired electricity will be about £50 at
that time. In effect, we are saying that offshore wind requires a
subsidy that is double that for onshore wind and 40% higher than that

supporting different low-carbon technologies. A system of renewable

it is going to become clear that certain technologies are very much
cheaper than others. I wonder if, with a generous system of incentives,
some of the cost advantages available to onshore wind—I know
that it is probably the most controversial form of energy—were
shared with the communities hosting onshore wind farms, some
constituents might find the possibility of having a couple of wind
turbines on the other side of the village green, given the
offer of a freeze in their electricity price for as long as they were

might have to stop offering any new contracts for difference, because
it was clear that all the available money would be used up by the
contracts already awarded? In that context, will the Minister explain
why the Government think it is sensible to plan for as much as a third
of all the electricity generation supported through the levy control

budget that covers the period up to 2028—even the third carbon
budget goes beyond the period for which we know the levy control

Wilde, who could resist everything except temptation, but perhaps he
will resist it on this matter. I understand why the floor price policy
was introduced, but it does not cut greenhouse gas emissions by a
single kilogram, and it raises the costs of British business. If the
Treasury’s priority is to help Britain to become more
competitive, it is slightly bizarre for it to insist on that policy.

Friend and remain within the scope of this debate, but I simply say
that it is in everyone’s interest to make the European Union
emissions trading system work more effectively. If it did, there might
be no need for the floor price for carbon anyway. An EU-wide carbon
price driven by a trading mechanism would at least be even-handed in
its impact across the 28 countries of the EU, and it would not place a
special burden on Britain in the way that the floor price for carbon
currently does. I therefore urge the Minister to throw Britain’s
full weight behind efforts being made to make the EU emissions trading
system work more

conclusion, I draw attention to my Committee’s recommendations
about how the Department should report to Parliament on the cost of all
schemes funded by the levy control framework. I hope the Minister
agrees that accepting the recommendations would boost confidence in the
Government’s readiness to seek value for money from levy control
framework funds and to be transparent about decisions. As I have
mentioned, the present system of renewable obligation certificates is
pretty hard for most consumers to understand; feed-in tariffs,
contracts for difference and the whole levy control framework should be
easier for the public to comprehend. The establishment of the levy
control framework was a positive and helpful development, but I am sure
that my right hon. Friend recognises that exercising effective
parliamentary scrutiny on how those very substantial

to the cuts. Even after the cut to green levies, energy bills rose by
an average of more than £60 this winter. It is fortunate that
the winter has been so mild; otherwise we might be talking not just
about prices, but about the number of people who have died of

Energy company greed should be looked at extensively. The people at
Ofgem are not bad, but they do not have the teeth to do the job they
want to do. My hon. Friend the Member for Rutherglen and Hamilton West

start to see more from it, perhaps he is right and we should get rid of
it and put in its place something that really does the job of looking

There is too much money in this country for the energy

halt, look at what is happening, sit down and talk about what we want
to change and why, and put together an energy system so that people can
make money and provide energy, and customers can be assured that they
are receiving value for money for taxpayers. An 18-month freeze on
prices will allow the Government—I hope that they will be a new
Labour Government—to sit down and work out what they want to do
with their energy policy without worrying about whether they have to
fight someone over an energy price rise. At the end of the 18 months,
people will know exactly what is going to happen. That policy would be
popular and right.</hs_Para>

schoolboy error. Estimates day is rather like “Fight

have an issue, and I must preface what I say by disclaiming the
expertise that has been shown in the Chamber. I am no expert in the
matter. My background in it is limited, but I want to air some big
concerns, or at least one big concern—the Government’s
ECO scheme, which is paid for from levies and monitored by Ofgem. As I
understand it—I repeat that I do not perfectly understand
it—it is multi-dimensional and it subsidises insulation,
community schemes, and boilers and their replacement. It has two
distinct targets: fuel poverty, which needs addressing, and carbon
saving, which is a general global
imperative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000004">It
has been acknowledged that the ECO scheme has slowed down since the
autumn when the debate on energy prices took off, but even prior to
that I had concerns about the operation of the scheme as it stands. It
depends on an industry superstructure to enable boilers to be replaced
and consumers to be provided with what they need. That industry
superstructure and the industry in general are in a parlous state. I
have been reliably informed by people who ought to know that there has
been a collapse in the market and that boilers are not being fitted
with the same frequency as previously. There has been a boom and a
bust. Not so long ago, there was a huge boom; now there is a
substantial bust, as there is with solar panels. There are
lay-offs in the trade and providers do not want to engage further. 
<?notus-xml column=696?>We may be looking at a slower but similar car crash to that in solar.
The reasons seems to be relatively straightforward.</hs_Para>

remuneration that the providers hope to get from the energy companies
is either plummeting or is extraordinarily fickle and unpredictable so
that they cannot make their business work. For a £1 saving in
carbon over a lifetime they used to receive 25p, but they now get 8p or
less, and sometimes they do not know what they will get. The
alternatives are not wholesome. They can fit low-class boilers,
probably with inadequate maintenance arrangements, or they can
concentrate on houses where carbon savings are greatest: hard-to-heat
mansions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000006">Apparently,
hard-to-heat mansions are becoming increasingly attractive. Not so long
ago, the <I>Daily Mirror </I>printed a report about a premier
footballer who benefited under the ECO scheme, and there have been
reports of people in serious fuel poverty who cannot currently benefit.
There is evidence that the big providers do not want to deal too much
with the fuel poor. I have seen a letter from British Gas to Sefton
council asking it not to send any more referrals because it does not
want to deal with fuel poverty at the moment.</hs_Para>

constituency has many Victorian terraces of single occupancy,
hard-to-heat accommodation with old, inefficient boilers, and it seems
almost impossible to make a commercial case to any provider unless the
applicant can make a contribution. However, if they are in fuel
poverty, they simply do not have the resources to do so. Fuel
poverty seems to be fighting the other target: carbon saving. A genuine
case can be made for dealing with hard-to-heat mansions, particularly
if they are occupied by pensioners who may be able to qualify under
some
criteria.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000008">I
have had discussions with Ministers at various levels and they are more
sanguine than I and the providers are. Will the Minister explain why
British Gas writes to Sefton council and why energy companies
make representations saying they do not want to engage with fuel
poverty now? Will the Government publish up-to-date statistics so that
we can see what progress is being made to alleviate fuel poverty? Will
they give figures for the number of boilers fitted in fuel poverty
homes, and say how close they are to the £540 million target for
alleviating fuel poverty? Above all, given that I am not the expert, I
would like them to speak to the companies and providers. I know that
this is not the Minister’s immediate responsibility, but will he
arrange a meeting with providers and assessors to look at the evidence
and, if the ministerial team believes that things are going right,
explain why, and why the providers think they have a
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000009">At
the moment, there seems to be some slight evidence of a bunker

betting terminals in betting shops. That is a complete turnabout from
the Government’s initial position, when they resisted all our
amendments. The letter also refers to the Government announcing their
position over the weekend. I do not recollect the House sitting over
the weekend. I think the most appropriate place for the Government to

curiosity is that the levies are not in the estimates: according to
accounting conventions, they cannot be. One of the central things to
which the Energy and Climate Change Committee drew attention was the
fact that because the current accounting regulations mean that levies

Department, some fairly urgent action is needed to bring those issues
back under the parliamentary gaze and make them accountable to and

from the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr Yeo), the Chair of the
Committee of which I am proud to be a member, much work to decarbonise
the UK’s energy economy is underpinned by levies on energy
bills. The chosen instrument that the Government have introduced to
control those levies is the levy control framework, which is itself a
very curious beast that was introduced by sudden fiat in the Budget of
2011. It was announced in the additional document to that Budget called
“The Plan for Growth” but without, as far as I know, any
debate, pre-scrutiny or other examination of its effect as regards the
inclusion or exclusion of various levies. Subsequently, without that
examination, it has controlled, pretty selectively, DECC’s
spending on support for renewable and low-carbon energy.</hs_Para>

does not do anything like that. In effect, it controls selected and
nominated levy-funded underwriting for certain activities. It initially
controlled the renewables obligation and the feed-in tariff for smaller
renewables, 
<?notus-xml column=698?>and it has controlled the warm homes discount, although that has
recently disappeared into general taxation. In future, it will control
the renewables obligation’s successor, contracts for difference,
with continued payments from the renewables obligation after the system
switches in March 2017. The RO will not go away; it will continue for a
long time after the change has taken place and will continue to control
feed-in tariffs for solar and small-scale renewables.</hs_Para>

controlled expenditure will be some £7.6 billion, in
2011-12 prices, in 2020-21, rising from just over £3
billion in 2013-14. That sounds not just like a lot of money but like a
huge increase in money, but we must remember that it is the total that
has to underwrite the target of 30% of renewable electricity generation
by 2020. In some scenarios published by DECC, it may just about achieve
that, but in other unpublished scenarios it may not. The reason it may
not is that the expenditure total has to include not only the cost of
new entrants each year, as those new entrants come to produce renewable
and low-carbon power that contribute towards the target, but the
cumulative overhangs of what has already been agreed previously under
the renewables obligation or, after 2017, contracts for difference
payments, which will run on for 15 years after they have been agreed.
In most instances, RO payments will continue for 10 years after they
have ceased being issued in 2017. Over the whole period up to 2020,
certainly, and even after that, all the payments that have been agreed
for any new projects will continue throughout the whole period and will
accumulate within the levy-controlled total expenditure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030343000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000018">We do not
know how the figure of £7.6 billion for 2020 was arrived
at—it was simply announced. Only more recently have estimated
figures on the annual margin that will be available for new entrants
every year been published. It turns out that those figures will
be slightly less per year than is currently available for new entrants
each year in terms of new renewables obligations and, subsequently,
contracts for difference. I personally feel that given DECC’s
figures on how it will achieve a doubling of the deployment of mainly
offshore wind by 2020, the aspiration is probably a little
heroic.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000019">Another
curious aspect of the levy control framework is that it controls the
sums involved but not what is actually deployed. In the case of the
renewables obligation, it is reasonably possible to forecast what
expenditure might be against deployment. Indeed, according to the
National Audit Office, DECC has produced pretty accurate figures for
this over the several years of the levy control framework so far.
However, when contracts for difference are introduced in March 2017, it
will be much less easy to do that. That is because the amount of
underwriting, and hence levy, that arises from a contract for
difference is inherently variable and only predictable in ballpark
terms. What a generator gets as a payment is the difference between the
agreed amount for the strike price and the reference price, which is
the prevailing price of wholesale electricity in any one month. If the
price dips, the amount paid increases; if the price rises, the amount
paid decreases.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030343000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000020">It is
certainly conceivable, as the Chairman of the Committee suggested, that
in circumstances of a high wholesale electricity price, generators
could start paying back money that they have obtained because the
reference 
<?notus-xml column=699?>price is higher than the strike price. It would be interesting to see
whether any consideration has been given to how that money coming back
might be deployed and whether it would be put towards more renewables
investment or disappear into the Treasury; I suspect I know the answer.
It is at least a possibility that that could happen over the next
period. The point is that the generator gets a known return but the
levy payments themselves could vary enormously. If,
for example, the Chancellor caps the carbon floor price in 2016, that
would probably reduce the price of electricity, albeit by encouraging
high-carbon generation. It would, however, increase the payment that
generators get from the CfD, possibly quite substantially. Owing to the
fact that the amount is capped each year against a small amount of
additional headroom for the Department, which then needs to be adjusted
over the next year in the Department’s subsequent estimates,
room for new entrants could be dramatically squeezed through the
payments of larger sums each year. Therefore, as a tool to cap
expenditure on levies, the LCF may function, but it cannot underpin a
clear level of deployment over time. It deals with one side of the
equation but not the
other.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-03-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_03_PT_1/9BBD4225DF6D5C80C176B539A338DEB850A918BE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 March 2014">Monday

curiosity of the levy control framework is that it does not really
control levies overall. As we saw recently, the only levies that were
removed or altered in the so-called green levy review were ones that
did not have a control over them at all, or that will be out of the LCF
by 2020. As we have heard, the energy companies’ levy-based
obligation is exactly in line with the levy control framework. What was
not within it was eviscerated, with calamitous consequences for local
authority and housing association solid wall and hard-to-treat home
schemes. The warm home discount has gone into being funded by general
taxation.</hs_Para>

control framework is supposed to control levies that are defined by the
Office for National Statistics as tax and spend—that was in the
original Treasury document that set out the LCF. In fact, it is defined
by the ONS as putative tax and spend. Although no money goes into the
Exchequer, the effect on the consumer is as if a tax had been levied,
but with no control over it. As I have underlined, that was the stated
intention of the LCF in the document that introduced it.</hs_Para>

levies preceding the levy control framework were introduced precisely
because they were off the books and would not count against spending
totals. However, the LCF effectively makes them count again, dependent
on the ONS definition. One might say that a policy that levies charges
on consumers because it does not count, but is then controlled through
a mechanism that makes it count, is rather a circular policy. In the
long run, it might better be replaced by a policy that levies a tax on
companies and people’s wealth, and then allocates that to
underwrite the desired deployment to plant—perhaps that points
out something that must not be
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000025">The
levies counted in the levy control framework will be, as the original
document states, based on ONS independent definitions. However, the ONS
barely got round to classifying previous levies—the community
energy savings programme and the carbon emissions reduction
target—before the LCF came in. Indeed, it classified those as
putative tax and spend, but only after 
<?notus-xml column=700?>they had come to an end. The Treasury then had to

could say that the choice of what was in or out when the levy control
framework came about has essentially been a political and not a
statistical decision, underlined perhaps by the curious fact of two
enormous levies. One of those is the energy company obligation, which
could perhaps now come to £2.6 billion over four years. Most
significantly, coming down the road, we ought to know the capacity
market payment system, which is potentially £1 billion a year on
average until 2020. Those are levies on customers’ bills to
persuade energy companies to build gas-fired power stations and make
them available for the provision of power, not to pay them for
providing power. If they then provide power, having made themselves
available and got a levy as a subsidy, they will be paid again. That is
definitely coming down the road—a huge levy increase outside the
LCF. Those are clearly levies and will turn up on customers’
bills. Probably, if included, they could double the control
total.</hs_Para>

not yet got round to considering whether ECO should be counted in, and
as far as I am aware—probably for quite prudent
reasons—it has not gone anywhere near capacity payments. In any
event, DECC is still figuring out how to manage and control such
matters, as well as how to manage and control the energy demand
reduction side of capacity market payments should they be included in
the energy auctions that, as I have mentioned, will be coming
down the road.</hs_Para>

have, of course, already gone down the taxation route. The renewable
heat initiative was to have been a levy but it is now funded from
general taxation. The warm home discount has recently gone from being a
levy to being funded by general taxation, and—still to
come—the money to support carbon capture and storage has shrunk
to £1 billion and is also funded from general taxation, with no
clarification as to whether subsequent CCS gets a CfD, and will
eventually be in the LCF. Perhaps it will get capacity payments that
are levied but not in the LCF, or perhaps it will just get support from
tax. There is, therefore, no consistency about what is controlled and
what is not, and apparently no clarity on the
horizon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000029">We
then come to the next curiosity of the system. Apparently, including
estimates and outcomes of levy controlled expenditure—it never
really arises as solid tax in and solid expenditure out—cannot,
as I have emphasised, safely be put in departmental estimates or
end-of-year accounts. Since 2012, no levy expenditure in accounts or
estimates has been put forward by the Department. That brings us back
to where we started. The LCF was sprung into being without debate or
scrutiny from this House. We do not know what goes into the figures in
the framework or whether the expenditure undertaken is value for money,
because none of the workings are in the accounts and estimates. We do
not even know what relationship there is between the policy objectives
of each levy and their likely realisation. It seems that the agreed
policy outcome of the deployment of renewables has possibly been
seriously compromised by the introduction of the LCF, but we do not
know because nothing is there to assist with finding out.</hs_Para>

ultimately, is better all round, but which I know causes problems with
our odd British method of accounting for public expenditure that is at
odds with how most other European countries do it—namely, by
raising taxes openly and allocating support openly on the basis of what
has been raised—then at least levies across the board should be
treated in the same way. After all, they all end up in the same
place—on the customer’s bill—and the overall
positive effect of the levies, which in the longer term are certainly
likely to be beneficial to those bills, can be properly appraised and

Friend the Member for Southport (John Pugh), who is no longer in his
place, made some very good points on the impact of the changes to ECO
announced in the autumn statement. The reduction of people’s
energy bills by about £30 to £35, as a result of those
changes, has been welcomed by households across my constituency and, I
am sure, across all hon. Members’ constituencies. However, some
of the measures—particularly the reduction in the carbon
emissions target for hard-to-treat homes by a third and the extension
of 
<?notus-xml column=703?>measures to include cheaper options such as loft and cavity wall
insulation—have had an impact on off-grid customers living in
fuel poverty in my constituency, and have made the introduction of
soluble insulation to low-income households virtually
impossible.</hs_Para>

important? The changes are having a disproportionate effect on
constituencies such as mine in rural areas, where 35% of homes have
solid walls compared with 22% nationally, and 48% of households are
living off the gas grid compared with just under 15% across the
country. As we all know—we have debated it many times in this
House—people living off the gas grid pay much higher energy
bills than those who are on the grid. Under the Hills definition of
fuel poverty, that affects about 10% of households in my constituency,
and that figure will be replicated across other rural areas. The
Minister has taken great care to listen to MPs representing areas such
as mine, and has taken real steps to try to tackle fuel poverty in
off-grid households. Will he consider taking two further steps that
could have an important impact?</hs_Para>

created the off-grid ministerial round table, which is already proving
to be a very valuable body that has made improvements for the group of
people concerned. At the next meeting in May, I would very much like
him to consider evidence from members of that round table, such as
Community Energy Plus in my constituency, on the impact of the ECO
changes on its ability to tackle fuel poverty in off-grid households.
There might be some very simple tweaks, without extra cost, that could
be made to the programme to enable us to help people who are
particularly hard-hit by the changes.</hs_Para>

will the Minister consider inviting the head of Public Health England
to join the round table? Public Health England has rightly identified
the reduction of fuel poverty as an essential health outcome. As we all
know, living in cold homes exacerbates existing health conditions. It
can often lead to unplanned emergency admissions to hospital and lead
to a delay in people going back to their homes, because of the
detrimental impact of allowing them to move back home. We live with the
blight of excess winter deaths. The national health service has
ring-fenced budgets, as do public health bodies and local authorities,
and I think that they have an important role to play in driving down
fuel poverty. Community Energy Plus in my constituency has been working
with health officials and with me to develop an evidence base and a
toolkit that will enable public health commissioners to fund insulation
and other measures that would allow people to live in warmer homes. It
would be excellent if work of that kind could be shared at the round
table, and if Public Health England took up the challenge to provide an
evidence base that would enable people working on the energy company
obligation and on improving the energy efficiency of homes to work
alongside health officials around the country in driving down fuel
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000048">I

still people in the House of Commons, in the other place and outside

that it is a direct result of climate change, but we can see the
pattern that is developing, and acknowledge that our climate is
changing. Most of us agree on those points, but if we are to challenge

must be brutally honest: if we leave the matter purely to the market,
it is highly unlikely that there will be investment in a green economy
and carbon-free energy. In the current market conditions, the cheapest
form of energy is probably coal. Indeed, more coal is being burned for
energy than has been the case for quite some time. However, we also
face increasing energy demands, and the combination of the two could
spell disaster for our climate. We need only think of the massive smog
cloud that engulfed Beijing last week, when even indoors the pollution
levels were above World Health Organisation safety levels. To be fair,
the Chinese are now coming round to investing in greener energy in
order to tackle their problems, but that remains a warning of what we
could face if we do not act to tackle our problems. We have done it
before: city smogs here became a thing of the past because of

markets will not take us where we need to go, so the Government must
continue their efforts to ensure that there is real action on tackling
climate change and the greening of our energy system. An enormous
amount of money is needed for that project, but it should not be seen
purely as costs; it should also be seen as investment. As I said
earlier to the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr Yeo), I was rather
concerned about his description of offshore wind farms and the
contracts for difference that were needed for them. Having sat through
the debates on the Energy Bill and heard what was said about CfDs, I
understood that they were variable so that an extra boost could be
given to new, untried technologies that needed a lift in order to take
off, and so that the subsidy given to established technologies could be
reduced. That struck me as perfectly reasonable, because the huge cost
of offshore energy will undoubtedly require that extra boost. I would 
<?notus-xml column=705?>caution against considering alternatives to it just
because it is expensive; it has reduced the need for onshore

the industry, an increase of 5% over the last year, and the industry is
confident that it will continue to expand and employ more people. The
latest figures from the Department of Energy and Climate Change show

nuclear, it must be said, and my friend the hon. Member for Glasgow
North West (John Robertson) and I have debated that on many occasions.
The cost of Hinkley Point is of interest to me, and interests in the
European Union seem to be looking slightly askance at that. It is worth
noting that the cost of the subsidy to Hinkley Point alone is over four
times the total cost of the renewables obligation across the whole of
the UK during its first 10 years in operation. That puts into
perspective the amount of money that is involved. It is also worth
noting that I saw a story earlier this week 
<?notus-xml column=706?>that a plan for a similar design in Finland which is
already vastly over-budget and way behind schedule has now been put

ask whether energy bills are now too high, however. Unfortunately, I
think that is true, but it cannot be laid at the door of the so-called
green levies. Let us look at the breakdown of costs in our energy bills
as set out in the Commons Library note “Components of an energy
bill”. It sets out that environmental and social levies amount
to between 8% and 10% of the typical domestic dual-fuel energy bill.
That is the proportion before the changes announced by the Chancellor

of the warm home discount from energy bills and should have reduced the

produced by the Department of Energy and Climate Change break things
down further, and that leads to an estimate that only 2% of the average

that for hard-pressed families even such a sum is significant. However,
it is not the main driver for increasing energy prices. That is the
wholesale energy costs, which according to DECC’s own figures
account for between 46% and 48% of the bill. These costs are

if we have a set cost under CfDs for that gas, it should prevent the

the House of Commons Library note on this subject, which sets out

Obviously, energy companies will make a profit, and part of the
taxation on energy bills is 5% VAT. The point about the 8% and the 2%
is that only 2% of the bill is directly relatable to the renewables
obligation. The differences between the two are the social
obligations—the insulation costs and the other costs for

interesting to see how these changes feed into energy costs. If, as is

immediate effect—I am referring to the current rise in prices
because of what is happening in the Crimea. But those who buy the bulk

major element in bills is the network costs charged to energy
suppliers, which, according to the note, make up 20% to 23% of the
costs. I have spoken on that issue many times in this House, as well as
on the unfairness of the costs, which discriminate against generators,
particularly renewable energy generators in the north of Scotland
compared with major generators in the south. The regulator, Ofgem, has
been looking into this matter, in a seemingly endless investigation,
Project TransmiT, which I understand has been put back yet again to a
possible introduction in April of next year. There must be more action
and a fairer system of transmission reduces the costs faced by
renewable energy. That would have a positive impact on bills by
reducing the cost to the consumer.</hs_Para>

receive a mass of paper through their doors from the energy companies.
There must be a much more proactive effort to put people on to the
lowest tariff. It also seems that, under this scheme, it is only the
lowest tariff operated within the type of contract the person already
has. As I have said before, that is fine if someone is on a direct

consideration and criterion. That is what we believe has changed. If
that was not the case, why were positive messages given to Eggborough
throughout the process? It would have been clear at the beginning that
Drax and Eggborough could not both have been funded, given the scale
and size of the Drax conversion and the budget. Later, the range of
technologies seems to have become the overriding criterion, which is
why other local Members of Parliament and I have sought to
clarify what happened and are concerned for our constituents who work
in this important power station.</hs_Para>

impact of the change, Members of the other place and I have recently
tabled parliamentary questions to demonstrate that the Government have

(Mr Yeo), my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal
(Dr Coffey) shouted at me that it was all about how
cost-effective this was. Well, we do not know the cost of losing this
generating capacity. Eggborough has announced that it will be forced to
close unit 2, which provides about 1% of generating capacity, in
September this year. According to the most recent information
available, the management at Eggborough believe that the plant will no
longer supply energy to the grid at all beyond 2015.</hs_Para>

crunch coming in 2015, perhaps as low as 2% of capacity, and here we
are, about to take off 2% to 4% of generating capacity. The appropriate
notices have been issued to National Grid, Ofgem and DECC. The
Government may not have made an assessment of the impact on bills, but
others have. The loss of that capacity could result in a £38
rise in consumer electricity prices, with £25 due to capacity
crunch forcing up the wholesale price, and an estimated £13 of
additional cost to decarbonise using technologies that are more costly
than biomass conversion.</hs_Para>

the meeting with the Minister and one of his officials, we
potentially face a situation in which 800 people who are currently
gainfully employed will be sitting at home, having been fired, paying
increased bills for a form of generation that is 50% more expensive

well that the process was changed—recalibrated
perhaps—over a range of technologies, which seems to have become
the overriding factor. There are technologies, largely offshore wind,
that have come out ahead of Eggborough, even though they have no
finance behind them and do not have planning permission in place,
compared with a shovel-ready project that was ready to go.</hs_Para>

£38 for the addition to bills might be disputed, but we have
received no answers to our parliamentary questions that show what the
impact would be. Perhaps it is worth delving into that in more detail.
The £38 is based on the fact that annual wholesale consumption
in the UK energy market is 360 TWh. If wholesale prices rise by 10% due
to the supply crunch, that would add £5 per megawatt to the
wholesale market, which equates to about £1.8 billion per annum.
About a third of the market is for domestic households, so that is
£600 million between 24 million domestic customers, which works
out at £25 on domestic bills. Filling the 4% capacity
gap, or maybe the 2%—the figures are disputed—with the
more costly renewable technology will result in an additional
£13, based on a total cost of £3.4 billion over the life
of the project.</hs_Para>

unfortunate that we find ourselves in this position. I implore the
Minister and the Government to listen to our pleas on the matter.
Eggborough is a major employer. The conversion project would secure 800
jobs, and potentially thousands more. The money is there, it is
shovel-ready and the investment is in place. The fact that the project
is losing out to others that do not even have finance or planning
permission in place simply cannot be right. In fairness to the
Department, I understand the desire to have a range of technologies,
but we argue 
<?notus-xml column=712?>that that is what the contracts for difference
regime is for. The projects that would replace Eggborough would not be
on stream until 2019-20. There is another regime for them, but there is
not for Eggborough. The FID enabling regime is it for Eggborough: it is
the end. We really need action on this, perhaps through the Secretary
of State using his reserve powers. If the regime is not right, as the
Minister has consistently told us, let us look at the Secretary of
State’s reserve powers, particularly those relating to the
impact on generating capacity.</hs_Para>

project does not go ahead, we have to be clear that we will be
replacing it with a much more expensive form of technology. I support
the development of our offshore wind sector through a different regime,
and locally we have all been united—the Opposition Whip, the
hon. Member for Scunthorpe, is nodding in agreement—in wanting
to see the Humber develop as an offshore wind centre. We believe that
we can do both. We should aim to do both, not only because of the
number of jobs at stake, but because of the implications for consumers
and how much they would be hit in the pocket. I hope that the Minister
will listen again to our pleas on this subject. It is important not
only locally, but from a national
perspective.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-03-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_03_PT_1/4C0D4E77F5136C70BF246BE4BF8D8A409607181E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 March 2014">Monday

Greenwood</B> (Nottingham South) (Lab):</Member> Over the past three
months, I have repeatedly raised my concerns about the impact that the
Government’s panicked changes to the energy company obligation
are having in my constituency, and I make no apology for doing so again
today. As we have already heard, the energy company obligation is not
covered by the levy control framework, even though the
framework’s stated purpose is to cap the cost of levy-funded
schemes and ensure that the Department of Energy and Climate Change
achieves its fuel poverty, energy and climate change goals in a way
consistent with economic recovery and minimising the impact on consumer
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000097">The
Government claim to be making changes to the ECO precisely
because they are concerned about the impact on energy bills. My
worry is that they seem to be ignoring the devastating effect of the
changes to the literally thousands of my constituents who live in cold,
solid-wall homes, which are expensive to heat. The hon. Members for
Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton), for Brigg and Goole (Andrew
Percy) and for Angus (Mr Weir) spoke about the impact on their
constituents in off-grid and rural locations. I want to talk about
solid-wall properties in urban settings.</hs_Para>

Greener HousiNG scheme is a partnership between our social landlord
Nottingham City Homes, experienced insulation contractor VolkerLaser,
local energy efficiency charity Nottingham Energy Partnership, and
local people. The scheme offered up to 4,500 households in Clifton in
my constituency the opportunity to save hundreds of pounds a year on
their energy bills, enjoy warmer homes and contribute to national
targets for cutting carbon
emissions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000099">The
scheme offered external wall insulation at an affordable, fixed price,
with residents paying a contribution of between £1,000 and
£1,300. The remainder of the cost was provided by funding from
British Gas under its energy company obligation. Our ECO-funded scheme
was to be delivered in two phases, commencing in September last year
and finishing in March 2015. It was 
<?notus-xml column=713?>planned that the insulation works would be rolled out street by street
across the Clifton housing estate to council properties and privately
owned homes alike.</hs_Para>

phase 1 of the scheme in the north of Clifton in early September was
received with real enthusiasm, and within weeks hundreds of residents
had signed up. Clifton is a close-knit community. Built on green fields
by the council in the early 1950s to address post-war
Nottingham’s need for homes, the estate is a popular place to
live and raise a family. Three quarters of the homes are now privately
owned, as long-term residents have exercised their right to buy. Many
of the original residents still live there, and often their children
and grandchildren are nearby, so word about the scheme soon got
round.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000101">When
residents saw how good the insulation looked and heard about the
difference it made to both bills and comfort, they started to get in
touch from across the whole of the estate even though the publicity had
only gone out in the phase 1 area. In total, there were about 330
council homes and a potential 1,100 private homes in phase 1 and a
further 900 council homes and about 2,500 private homes in phase 2. By
the end of November, more than 90% of council tenants had agreed to
have the work done and there was 65% take-up among the private sector
properties, with 729 private residents or landlords having signed up
and paid their contribution towards getting the work done. A further
352 private owners had signed up and paid from the phase 2 area of
Clifton South. Dozens of the owner-occupiers had also spent thousands
of pounds installing new double-glazed windows or other preparatory
work to maximise the benefits to their homes once the insulation was
applied. In many cases, people had spent their savings or borrowed
money to fund that work.</hs_Para>

December, I was in Clifton chatting to residents on Farnborough road
and Sturgeon avenue, some of the first streets where work had begun as
part of the scheme. The feedback was incredible: people told me that
their homes were warm for the first time ever. They were saving money.
Many people on the estate are on low incomes so use pre-payment cards
to manage their gas and electricity bills. They immediately saw a
difference in their household budgets and were really proud
of the improved appearance of their homes and the
neighbourhood. People waiting for the work told me how much they were
looking forward to it starting. Some even told me what colour they had

was all going so well, but the very next day the Energy Secretary came
to the House and announced a panicked change to the energy company
obligation—a levy that was introduced by his Government and
which underpinned Clifton’s Greener HousiNG scheme. He was under
pressure: the big energy companies, in turn, were announcing price
rises of up to 10%. He had no policy to counter Labour’s popular
promise to freeze prices until 2017 and reform the energy sector.
However, rather than take on the big six and tackle their overcharging,
he gave in to them, did exactly what they wanted and announced that he
was going to cut the ECO—a Government levy that makes up about
3.5% of the typical annual energy
bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000104">It

Greatrex</B> (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I
thank the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr Yeo) and his Committee for
their report on parliamentary oversight of the levy control framework.
It has been an important underpinning to this debate, and many of the
issues it raises have been mentioned by Committee members and other
hon. Members who have spoken. I hope that the Minister, if I give him
enough time, can respond to those points before we conclude the debate.
I am sure that he has paid attention to and will want to respond to the
concerns raised by those who have spoken, and to the reflections of
wider concerns expressed in recent months by several bodies and
individuals, notably the National Audit Office. We have heard a refrain
from some Members about the costs of so-called green levies. However,
this has been a constructive debate and the more misleading aspects
have not taken up much of our
discussion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000122">A
number of Members, including my hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow
North West (John Robertson) at the start of the debate, spoke about the
scale of the levies as a proportion of consumers’ energy bills.
He said that more than half the cost of the levies goes to support
pensioners and people on low incomes who need help to pay their energy
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000123">My
hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) has just
described powerfully the immediate impact that the changes to the ECO
scheme have had. She rightly said that we are yet to see an impact

enlighten us on when we will see the impact assessment of those
changes, which were announced three months
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000124">It
is important to reiterate that that help focuses on improving energy
efficiency, which can help to reduce consumption and minimise increases
in bills. I would expect most hon. Members, whether they are here this
evening or not, to sign up to that as a common-sense proposition. The
housing stock in the UK is among the most energy inefficient. Much of
the stock in the private rented sector, which has many of the poorest
tenants, is the most inefficient of all. Improving efficiency is a 
<?notus-xml column=717?>sensible step, to help keep people warm and to ensure that we are not
just heating the streets outside the windows and the air above the
roofs. It also has the positive economic benefits of creating jobs and
controlling the amount of generating capacity we need to invest in,
which I hope will be well
recognised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000125">Members
will be aware that levies have been applied to bills for various
schemes. When the Government introduced the ECO scheme, the
enthusiastic Minister of State at the Department of Energy and Climate
Change, the right hon. Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker)
proclaimed it to be “transformational”. So
transformational has it been that it has led to schemes, such as the
one in Nottingham that we have just heard about, being abandoned. He
has presented the cutting and spreading over time of ECO as though it
is extending the scheme. That feat of verbal dexterity has not been
surpassed in this debate so
far.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000126">The

this evening has demonstrated the level of interest in and concern
about these issues. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow North West,
who has a strong, consistent and unrivalled record of standing up for
the fuel-poor in his constituency, in Scotland and across the UK, set
out powerfully the way in which some people have used the debate over
levies as a diversionary tactic to distract attention away from the
need for reform in the retail and wholesale energy markets. I think
that I heard him say that he is now convinced by the case for reform
that is being set out from the Opposition Front Bench. I take that as a

significant contributor in the 2020s. I hope she gets to the
event that my hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Test reminded her

I did not speak to any Assembly Members last week because I was there
on Thursday when, as the hon. Gentleman will be aware, there were
significant issues of immediate and pressing concern to Assembly
Members and many others. Some Assembly Members who were due to be at
the conference were unable to attend, for understandable reasons.
However, I had the opportunity to talk to some players in the Northern
Irish and Irish markets about the role of the regulators there, and I

estimates during estimates day debates. We had a master-class in that
from the hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir), who made a wide-ranging
contribution on a range of energy policy issues, many of which were
common ground to many of us, and we were able to agree with much of
what he said. He touched on the impact on jobs and growth in his
constituency from the renewables sector. As a fellow Scottish Member, I
share his interest. Some engineering companies in my constituency are
part of that supply chain, and I hope and anticipate that it will
continue. The tone of this debate has been positive and thoughtful. The
opportunity for my constituency and his to benefit most from
opportunities in the renewables sector is underpinned by being part of
the UK and the single energy market which we currently enjoy as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000136">The

issues, but most extensively those affecting Eggborough power station
and his constituents. He may recall that I raised this issue at
business questions just prior to Christmas, when I asked 
<?notus-xml column=719?>about the rumours that were circulating at that point. I think that the
announcement in which the decision was confirmed was made on the day
after the House went into recess. There are significant concerns about
the way in which the FID-enabling process has progressed to date. I
anticipate that further questions will be asked of the Government in
relation not only to Eggborough but to other projects that slipped off

they
got.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000137">We

that is accounted for by levies within and outside the levy control
framework: it is about 9% of the average bill, with the total amount
added to bills being less than a third of the increase in bills since
May 2010. It therefore does not stack up to attribute the majority of
the increase in bills to levies, or green levies specifically. As the
Minister is now well aware, 60% of the levies on bills have been
introduced by the current Government since May 2010. I suspect that
when he described the carbon price floor as an “absurd”
waste of money and “assisted suicide”, he was not
necessarily aware that it was a tax that had been introduced by his own
Government. I am not sure whether those comments reflect his current

number of the arrangements relating to the levy control

mechanism, and the demand-side options that will be considered as part
of it, fall within the scope of the LCF in future? The Select Committee
recommended that there should be a single annual report covering all
DECC-funded schemes—those within and outside the levy control

these moneys do not come from the consolidated fund. Have the

its report on the operation of the LCF published in late November, the
National Audit Office highlighted the failure of the joint Treasury and

deliberations. What assurance can the Minister provide that that will
be rectified? The NAO also drew attention to schemes not covered by the
framework and recommended that the Department should not only explain
how it will control aggregate costs of consumer-funded schemes but
elucidate on whether, together, those schemes are delivering what they
are intended to deliver. What action do the Government intend to take

that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000141">The

recommended that the Department and the Treasury should supplement
published reporting on individual framework schemes by reporting
routinely on levy-funded schemes. Has the Minister given that any
consideration? The LCF is important, but it is also important that
there is sufficient published information and accountability and that
it should be taken with the same degree of seriousness with which this
House views public spending from the consolidated fund. As the Chair of
the Committee said, taxpayers and consumers are mostly the same people,
and the impact falls on the same shoulders. The balance between the
impact of the levies on consumers and the point of those levies has to
be very carefully struck. The discussion about that balance can be
better informed by a much stronger level of analysis being provided to
this House for scrutiny.</hs_Para>

control framework and whether the list of technologies was exhaustive.
We have set out all the technologies that we consider should be
supported at the moment up to 2018-19, although of course we cannot
bind our successor—if there is one—and I do not rule out
extending that support. He will see that we have put a support price

Friend asked about the position of carbon capture and storage in the

storage—the £1 billion that the Government are
committing to the two projects for which we have signed initial
feed contracts—are not in the levy control framework because
they are, of course, taxpayer funded. However, the operating costs will
be covered through the framework. Finally, he asked me to speculate on
the future movement of gas prices. There, I am afraid I cannot help him
with any particular update or assumptions, and neither do I

important points about our continuing work to improve the position of

taxpayer support, so it would not have been possible for taxpayers to
support all 16 projects. We are taking nine projects forward on
the basis—I have to correct him slightly—that all are
ready to sign this month: all have finance in place this month. I am
delighted to confirm that two are biomass conversions—Drax,

the specifics of the debate, as the NAO has acknowledged, the levy

supply. However, I recognise that proper oversight of the framework is
important. Those who pay the bills, our constituents, need to know that

first at why we need the levy control framework. We need to secure an
energy future at a cost that we can afford, and that is a huge task.
One fifth of our power stations will go off line in the next six
or so years. By 2030, if nothing else changes, we shall be
importing 70% of our gas. Eight of the nine existing nuclear stations
are scheduled to have closed by the time Hinkley Point C opens.
However, in the same framework, energy demand may have doubled by 2050.
The generation mix will have to tip significantly towards low carbon if

£40 billion had already been invested in the electricity sector

GW of new capacity has been brought on to the system, including five
new gas plants, and a sixth is under construction. Two huge offshore
wind farms opened last year, and we are seeing a very healthy pipeline
in key technologies, including four more large offshore wind projects

Monday I co-chaired the Offshore Wind Industry Council, which consists

of low-cost, low-carbon energy, improved energy security and the
tackling of fuel poverty are all outcomes that the levy control

impact on bills to be scrutinised closely and carefully as we pursue
those goals. My Department is acutely aware of the pressure that
consumers are facing, which is why we took action to reduce bills by an
average of £50. The Opposition have a different approach, and we
may disagree on the merits of that approach, but I think that Members
on both sides of the House can agree that the cost of energy matters
deeply to our constituents. It is therefore important for us to have an

transparency. In March last year my Department published the prices and
bills report, which showed the impact that our policies have had on
bills in a clear and transparent way. The annual energy statement sets
out our priorities, and an assessment of our progress in meeting our
ambitious targets. In addition, Ofgem reports regularly on the costs
and impact of each of our existing
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000162">During
this evening’s debate, we have heard much about the coverage of
the levy control framework. I do not want the purpose of the framework
to be misinterpreted. It is a formal part of the public expenditure
control framework. We have controls for departmental expenditure and
annual managed expenditure budgets, and we also need controls for
levies. However, the public expenditure control framework does just
that: it exists to control public expenditure. Policies such as the
energy company obligation are regulations, not public expenditure, so
not all policies are considered public expenditure. The ECO is
regulatory in nature and so lies outside the existing departmental
expenditure limits and annually managed expenditure budget frameworks,
but the fact that some consumer-funded policies sit outside the levy
control framework does not diminish the oversight they should, and do,
receive. Parliament has debated and passed primary and secondary
legislation for all our major policies. Impact assessments that support
those debates set out the full economic rationale for the action we
propose to take.</hs_Para>

steps to monitor the costs of these policies and put that information
into the public domain. On the ECO, for example, we published an
assessment of the costs of compliance. Our bills and prices report
takes account of the costs and benefits of all significant
consumer-funded policy, including transmission costs, the ECO and smart
meters.</hs_Para>

are not able to include three of our levies—the renewables
obligation, the feed-in tariffs and the warm home discount—in
our annual accounts. To those who have asked why not, the answer is
that the Comptroller and Auditor General rightly requires Departments
to meet international financial reporting standards. For the renewables
obligation, feed-in tariffs and the warm home discount, revenue does
not flow through the Exchequer. Instead, industry collects the money
directly from consumers and industry controls how those funds are used
to meet the regulatory requirements. It follows therefore that the
associated expenditure also cannot be included in my
Department’s accounts, and if it was the head of the National
Audit Office would be forced to quality it. The Government do not gain
additional funds through these levies to spend at their
discretion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000165">That

information on consumer-funded policies that covers actual expenditure
and forecast expenditure, and that captures the progress we are making
towards our policy ambitions. I agree that that information would
benefit from a proportionate independent audit and from being formally
presented to the House. It is my intention to publish this information
annually. The Chief Secretary 
<?notus-xml column=725?>wrote to the Chairs of the relevant Committees on 5 November,
suggesting that this information should be published no later than
Ofgem’s report on the renewables obligation. That report is due
in March next year, but we need to do better than that, which is why my
officials will work with their counterparts in Her Majesty’s

Danczuk</B> (Rochdale) (Lab):</Member> I am extremely grateful finally
to have this debate. As some may be aware, the Kashmiri ethnic
representation question was first raised in 2007 by Baroness Nicholson
in the other place. Seven years later, it is finally being debated in
this Chamber. Various Kashmiri organisations have estimated that about
one in four British Muslims are of Kashmiri origin—that is one
quarter of the British Muslim population who live in our communities,
pay taxes and contribute to our economy. But the true accuracy of that
statistic can never be known, as there is no official documentation of
their ethnicity on the census.</hs_Para>

Kashmiris play a major role in the social, political,
cultural, economic and religious life of the United Kingdom. The
Kashmiri people are proud, hard workers who have brought a taste of
Kashmir to our cities and towns. We have three Members of the Commons
of Kashmiri origin: the hon. Member for Gillingham and Rainham (Rehman
Chishti); and my hon. Friends the Members for
Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood) and for Birmingham, Perry Barr
(Mr Mahmood). In addition, Kashmiris hold hundreds of positions as
local councillors across the country and heavily influence more than 30
constituencies at election time. This is why it is distressing that as
a result of not having a Kashmiri ethnicity category, a community that
totals well over half a million people is left vulnerable—I
would go as far as to say that this is an
injustice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000177">I
wish to focus on two consequences of ignoring Kashmiri ethnicity in the
census: under-representation and deprivation. I am of the belief that
British Kashmiris run the risk of being under-represented in a
population that does not specify their ethnicity. In my constituency,
the vast majority of people of Kashmiri origin live in the most
deprived wards. They are therefore most likely to be under-represented
in terms of higher educational attainment and most likely to be
over-represented in terms of poor, overcrowded housing. I have heard
from people in my constituency that unemployment in Kashmiri
communities is extremely high, perhaps 60% to 70% in some areas. It is
also the case that people in these communities are disproportionately
likely to rely on state benefits and most likely to be extremely
economically deprived. Evidence from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation
supports those conclusions. Please note my emphasis on the phrase
“most likely” because speculation is all that we can do
at this point. Minister, there is a community of people in our
constituencies who are suffering because their needs are disregarded
and their identities are
lost.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000178">Let
me take this opportunity to put it on the record that an incredible

differences of the many, to help to strip away the identities of the
few? Should we not be celebrating the diverse cultures and identities

frustrating to hear, but, at the very least, preparations can be made

census to convert population statistics into efficient, beneficial
services?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000183">The
British Kashmiri community, the population of which is
estimated to be more than four times that of Gypsies and Irish
Travellers, will not receive special benefits catered to their needs
and, as a result, will continue on the path of deprivation. Perhaps the
most pressing issue surrounding these services is the language barrier.
People of Kashmiri origin are disproportionately likely to rely on
various state and local authority services. We therefore need to make
sure that an appropriate number of staff are able to speak Parahi. It
is my belief that inclusion on the census will help to ensure that we
can take such steps and therefore better co-ordinate our
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000184">The
Kashmiri population in my constituency makes up a significant portion
of the night-time economy work force as taxi-drivers, take-away
operators and by working in other jobs with unsocial hours. Again,
knowing this information in a more statistical way would allow better
community engagement strategies to be developed. Improved community
engagement from my own local authority and many like it could create
vital links to economic and social opportunities, so that Kashmiris can
achieve their fullest potential. We could also look at introducing
education and integration programmes among Kashmiri communities, who
are historically very tight-knit and sometimes hesitant to take outside
assistance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000185">As
well as looking at our own communities, we should also be aware of the
development of Kashmir itself. The Department for International
Development 
<?notus-xml column=728?>is very active in Kashmir and a large amount of UK
aid money is spent there. I recently met people from the RSA—the
Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and
Commerce—to discuss its Pakistan Calling project, aimed at
engaging the British Pakistani diaspora with development issues in
Pakistan. The efforts of such fantastic projects would be greatly
assisted if we had proper information about the number of people of
Kashmiri origin in our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000186">Now,
obviously, it is almost impossible to discuss Kashmir
without mentioning the current disputed state of that region. I
understand that neither the Indian nor Pakistani Governments might be
overjoyed by the United Kingdom Government recognising the Kashmiri
identity as valid, but I would just like to make this point: I am
strongly of the view that we should not let our own domestic
arrangements be dictated to us by a desire to keep other countries
happy. I hope that the Minister shares this
view.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000187">To
conclude, I would like to ask the Minister a number of questions.
First, will he update the House on the preparations for the next census
and whether the Government intend to hold one? Will he clarify whether
they will consider adding new ethnicity categories and will Kashmiri be
one of those considered? Finally, does he share my concerns about the
challenges that face the Kashmiri community in this country, and does
he agree that we need proper information if we are to meet these
challenges?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0003.htm#14030343000188">If
we continue to ignore the issues that people in this community face
then it is not just they who will suffer but all British society. This
seems a rather dramatic argument for what, at the end of the day, is
simply a very small box on a very big form, but I really do feel that
it would have important symbolic and practical value; practical,
because it would allow us to gather more information on this important
group and therefore target resources more effectively to meet their
needs; and symbolic, because it would say to British Kashmiris that we
accept them for who they are. It says to them that just because they
are British does not mean they are not also
Kashmiri.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-03-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_03_PT_1/E267D49395C010C1D409B0E03A8E381CDE691B76" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="3 March 2014">Monday

speech, powerful as it was, educated me about some of the challenges
that that community faces, as I would not know that from my

Hurd:</Member></B> As in the previous census, the 2011 census included
a question on ethnic groups that allowed people to record themselves as
Kashmiri by using the write-in facility in each of the main ethnic
groupings on the census questionnaire. The question was not intended to
establish the ethnic composition of the population as it might be
understood by, for example, sociologists, but to capture in a
common-sense or pragmatic way information on the categories of persons
who are likely to be the victims of racial inequality or
discrimination.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030343000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000194">There is, as
the hon. Gentleman knows, a wide range of uses for ethnicity data
collected in the census, including the opportunity to enable
organisations to meet their statutory obligations on race relations and
equal opportunities legislation. There is an element in the formulae
for grant allocation by central and local government to inform policy
development and monitoring, and to provide public bodies with a better
understanding of the communities they serve and hence to inform public
service provision.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030343000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000195">The list of
categories used to collect the ethnicity data was designed to enable
the majority of the population to identify themselves in a manageable
way. However, there is a practical limit to the number of separate tick
box categories that can be included in any single ethnicity question.
The question was already the longest on the questionnaire in the 2001
census, and consultation with users and communities during the planning
of the 2011 census revealed a demand for yet more specific response
categories to be included. In all, there were requests for about 20 new
categories including Cornish, Gypsy/Irish Traveller, Arab, Sikh and, in
particular, Kashmiri. The Office for National Statistics began
consulting users in March 2005 on their requirements for the content of
the census, with further consultations in 2006 and 2007 specifically on
the topics of ethnicity, national identity, language and
religion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000196">Four
submissions of the 2,000 or more received during the 2005 consultation
were from the Kashmiri community. Some 78 respondents of the 530 to the
subsequent consultation in 2007 sought better information on the
Kashmiri population. Of these, 20 were from local government service
providers while the rest were from special interest groups and private
individuals. The need for better information on Kashmiris was also
raised by three attendees at ONS’s census open meetings in March
2007. The case for a Kashmiri tick box to be included in the 2011
census ethnic group question was considered carefully alongside the
requests for all the other new categories—many more than could
possibly be included on the census
questionnaire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000197">With
space for only two new tick boxes, ONS developed a set of principles by
which requirements for the new categories could be assessed and
prioritised. They covered the strength of need for the information; the
lack of alternative sources of information; the clarity and quality of
the information collected and acceptability to respondents; and
comparability with the 2001 census data. The reasons most often cited
for identifying Kashmiris as distinct from Pakistanis, for whom a tick
box category 
<?notus-xml column=730?>was already provided, included, first, identity. Although, as the hon.
Gentleman knows better than I do, Kashmiris may self-identify as
Pakistani, that may not be their strongest or preferred choice; this is
linked to the desire by some Kashmiris for a separate Kashmiri
state.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030343000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000198">The second
reason was resource allocation and service delivery. Local authorities
and other organisations may not distribute resources effectively among
different parts of the self-reported Pakistani population.
Organisations may make assumptions about the need for language
translation provision for this population—for example, that Urdu
is the only language required for those with low English language
proficiency. Thirdly, monitoring inequalities was a consideration.
There is a suggestion that Kashmiris may be more disadvantaged than
other Pakistanis as a result of their rural background. Their
experiences may be masked by those of other Pakistanis when they are
combined in the same ethnic grouping. That is the core reason often
cited for identifying Kashmiris as distinct from Pakistanis.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14030343000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000199">The case for
a Kashmiri tick box scored well in the ONS prioritisation exercise, but
not as well as the two new ethnic group categories that were eventually
included: Gypsy/Irish Traveller and Arab. Moreover, there were other
ethnic groups of the Indian subcontinent—Sikh, in
particular—that respondents would have expected to see if a
Kashmiri category had been included. Introducing further tick boxes on
the census questionnaire would have meant removing something else or
making unacceptable compromises with questionnaire layout and the
consequent quality of the information
collected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000200">Following
representations and meetings—in particular a meeting at the ONS
on 1 May 2009 between senior ONS officials and Kashmiri
representatives, including the co-ordinator of the Kashmir national
identity campaign, who I understand is one of the hon.
Gentleman’s constituents—a Kashmiri research project was
undertaken in 2009. A subsequent report was published, with which the
hon. Gentleman is no doubt familiar, given his role as treasurer of the
all-party group on Kashmir. It is available on the ONS website, the
details of which I can provide to him later, should he so
wish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000201">The
conclusions of the research project were that the addition of a
Kashmiri tick box increased the likelihood of multiple ticking, because
people could consider themselves to be Kashmiri and Pakistani, Indian,
or some other ethnic group; and the overall rate of multiple response
in a postal test had been low, but focus groups and interviews had
revealed that the addition of a Kashmiri tick box might cause confusion
among respondents over which box to
tick.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000202">Many
of the arguments for information on Kashmiris are related to the need
to ensure that services are provided in the appropriate languages, a
point the hon. Gentleman made. Kashmiris speak more than one language
from the Kashmir region, and a key concern was that service delivery
organisations assume that the only language needed for Pakistanis is
Urdu. However, the ONS argued that that information would be better
collected from the question on main language that it proposed including
in the 2011 census for the first time. That would identify those people
whose main language is Pahari or Mirpuri. Service providers would then
have the information required to identify the services needed to
support the Kashmiri people who would otherwise be disadvantaged
because of language difficulties.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=731?><hs_Para UID="14030343000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000203">Taken as a
whole, the programme of consultation with the Kashmiri community,
whether through formal advisory groups, public and invited meetings, or
the ONS’s innovative community liaison programme,
successfully contributed in the end to a high level of support for, and
participation in, the census. Although some representatives of the
community actively opposed the census, even in the latter stages of the
consultation, the community eventually ran its own self-funded
publicity campaign to urge Kashmiris to “be counted and get
recognised” by using the write-in option on the
questionnaire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000204">The
lack of a specific Kashmiri tick box has not prevented information
about the Kashmiri community being available from the 2011 census
results. Write-in responses to the ethnic group question were coded
according to the main ethnic grouping under which they were recorded,
as was done following the 2001 census, and the results have been
published. As the hon. Gentleman is no doubt aware, some 25,265
individuals identified themselves as Kashmiri in that way. Almost all
wrote in their response under the main “Asian/Asian
British” ethnic group, but a small minority identified
themselves among some of the other main groups— 125
under the “Mixed/multiple ethnic” group, 105 under the
“White” group, and 352 under the “Other”
group. The total figure compares with the 23,191 who reported
themselves as Kashmiri in the 2001
census.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000205">The
hon. Gentleman asked how information on Kashmiris will be collected in
any future census. I have to advise him that it is too early to know
whether there will be another census in England and Wales in the form
that we have previously known, or what questions might be asked, but he
can be reassured that any proposals for a question on ethnicity in any
future census will be based on a comprehensive programme of
consultation and testing to ensure that it will meet users’
requirements and be acceptable and understandable to respondents. He
will already be aware of that from the ONS’s answer to his
recent parliamentary
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030343000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/debtext/140303-0004.htm#14030343000206">The

relative merits of a number of alternative approaches. Over the last
three years the programme has undertaken extensive research to
determine the best way of providing population statistics in future.
The results of that work show that there are two potentially viable
approaches to census taking in future: once a decade, like that
conducted in 2011, but primarily online; and using existing
administrative data and compulsory annual surveys. The issues and
implications associated with the findings, including descriptions of
each approach and its strengths, weaknesses, risks and opportunities,
as well as information on the statistics that each method provides,
formed the basis for a major public consultation in the latter part of
2013. One response has been received from a private individual that
referred to the recognition of people with a Kashmiri heritage, but it
did not specifically call for a Kashmiri tick box in the ethnic group
question in the next

results of the consultation are being analysed and a full report will

the arrangements for conducting any future census in England and Wales
on the basis of that recommendation.</hs_Para>

stress to the hon. Gentleman that at this point no decisions have been
made on the topics or questions that could be considered for any future

to start consultations on its content until next year at the earliest.

The Government intend that these powers will be devolved to the
Assembly and the Welsh Government well before the next Assembly
elections in May 2016, subject to the successful parliamentary passage
of the

to confirm the funding and to support a new Northern Ireland project.

December 2013, estimates that between 149,000 and 214,000 individuals
are identified as problem gamblers. This is equivalent to approximately
0.5% of the adult population in England. Assessment of problem gambling
levels by local authority area is not available. Support to those
suffering from gambling addiction is provided through a system of
voluntary contributions by the gambling industry, overseen by the
Responsible Gambling Trust. The Government is confident that robust
mechanisms are in place to ensure the integrity of the Responsible
Gambling Trust's research programme. All aspects of the research
programme will be rigorously peer reviewed and transparent to the
Responsible Gambling Strategy Board, the Gambling Commission and

(TTIP) could add as much as £10 billion annually to the UK
economy in the long-term. Over half of the projected benefits from TTIP
will come from more closely aligning the regulations of the EU and US.
This could be through mutual recognition, convergence between
legislation, use of international standards, and alignment of future
regulations. This should be of particular benefit to small and
medium-sized enterprises who find existing barriers most difficult to

February 2014 the High Court ruled on the legal challenge bought by
local councils broadly representing the Liverpool and Sheffield city
regions to the Government's methodology in allocating European Regional
Development Fund and European Social Fund in the UK. The Court
dismissed the claim in relation to all substantive grounds, which
include the challenge to the Government's methodology for the
allocation of the funds. Nevertheless, the Government's decisions on
these allocations have

particular sectors, as well as horizontal disciplines to apply to all

of the best places in Europe to start, finance and grow a business. The
Government has taken a number of steps to achieve this objective:
cutting the main rate of corporation tax from 28% in 2010 to 20% by
2015—the lowest in the G20; extending the doubling of small
business rates relief (SBRR) for a further year from 1 April 2014,
reducing the cost by an average of £800 per annum for over
500,000 businesses; and introducing a new £2,000 employment
allowance for small business and charities, from April 2013, to reduce
their employer national insurance
bills.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030345000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/text/140303w0001.htm#14030345000253">The
UK now has the second highest rate of early stage entrepreneurial
activity in the G7. The Government wants to ensure that this success is

Criminal Damage Act 1971 which makes it an offence under section 1(1)
for a person intentionally or recklessly to destroy or damage property
belonging to another without lawful excuse. Under section 1(2) there is
an aggravated version of the offence, where the damage is intended to
endanger the life of another person or the defendant is reckless as to
whether the life of another would be endangered. Where the property is
destroyed or damaged by fire, these offences are charged as arson

Hughes:</Member></B> More than 100,000 public authorities are subject
to the Freedom of Information Act. Whether a particular company is
within the scope of the Act depends on its ownership which can change
over time. To keep track of the ownership of all companies owned by
public authorities in a single list would be disproportionately
expensive. This information is already publicly available: members of
the public can find out whether a company is wholly owned by public
authorities covered by the Act by asking the company or the relevant
public authorities directly, or by checking the ownership of the
company with Companies House. We therefore have no current plans to
compile and maintain a list of companies wholly owned by public
authorities and who are thereby covered by section 6 of the Freedom of

places were available at Askham Grange prison nursery. This facility
was closed to the children of prison staff in March 2012. MOJ
recognises that employees need flexible pre-school and out-of-school
child care of a type and in a location most convenient to them. MOJ
operates a salary sacrifice scheme for child care vouchers which
enables employees to choose their own child care provider (subject to
meeting eligibility requirements) and have their child care costs
reduced by taking part of their salary in the form of childcare
vouchers (called salary sacrifice) up to prescribed limits. Child care
vouchers are free from tax and national insurance contributions (NICs)
so employees who use the scheme will make a saving on their child care
costs. In addition MOJ at present offers a limited number of subsidised
holiday play scheme places in Westminster holiday play

serves 28 days before being automatically re-released, were introduced
in 2008 and apply only to those offenders on licence who are not
assessed as presenting a high risk of harm to the public. Offenders who
are assessed as presenting a high risk of harm will be given a standard
recall, under which they can remain in custody, potentially, until the
end of their sentence. They will only be released before the end of
their sentence if the Parole Board or Secretary of State is satisfied
they no longer need to be detained to protect the

Government introduced the Criminal Justice and Courts Bill on 5
February which introduces new provisions, whereby offenders who are
considered highly likely to commit further breaches, including
reoffending, will be deemed unsuitable for a fixed term recall. They

are recalled to prison – as well as those who present a risk of
harm – can be held for the remainder of their sentence where
necessary. Fixed term recalls will continue to be used in low-risk

the breach and the offender can then safely be re-released to continue

Lamb:</Member></B> It has been well known for many years that there is
a small risk of blood clots associated with the combined contraceptive
pill. A comprehensive review in Europe of the latest evidence on the
association between combined hormonal contraceptives (CHCs) and blood
clots was finalised in November 2013. The Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) led this review which concluded that:
the risk of blood clots with CHCs remains small; products that contain
levonorgestrel, norethisterone, or norgestimate have the lowest risk;
the benefits of any CHC far outweigh the risk of serious side
effects.</hs_Para>

2014 the MHRA sent a letter to prescribers in the United Kingdom
informing them of the outcome of the review. This communication
included a range of supporting materials for prescribers and women to
increase awareness of the small risk of blood clots associated with
CHCs, the relevant risk factors and the symptoms; and to help

the NCTL was established in April 2012, it has received 29 referrals of
alleged incidents in independent schools which meet the definition of
child abuse as set out in the guidance document ‘Working
Together to Safeguard Children March 2013’. The definition
covers a range of alleged behaviour from a teacher using excessive
force on a pupil through to sexual misconduct. 14 of these 29 referrals
have occurred in the last 12 months. In each case, the NCTL
assesses the information received and, where required, launches an
investigation into whether the individual concerned should be
prohibited from teaching on the grounds of unacceptable professional
conduct, conduct that might bring the profession into disrepute and/or
conviction of a relevant
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1403046001741" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/text/140303w0003.htm#1403046001741">Under
arrangements established by the previous Government, teacher regulation
was the responsibility of the General Teaching Council for England

However, there was no requirement for teachers in independent schools
to be registered, so many teachers in independent schools fell outside
professional regulation. We have strengthened regulations so that the
NCTL  
<?notus-xml column=677?>now has the power to regulate all teachers in independent schools. As a

to the NCTL process for regulating teachers, the Department's
Independent Education and Boarding Team (IEBT) administers the wider

instance, the Department will ensure that the actual allegations are
being investigated by relevant authorities—the local authority

ensure that the school in question is meeting the Independent School
Standards. This will normally be done by commissioning an inspection
and, where a school is found not to be meeting the standards, taking
action to ensure it does so as soon as possible or, if necessary, is
closed. In all 22 cases referred to above, an inspection was

Laws:</Member></B> Section 29 of the Education Act 2002 requires the
governing body of all maintained schools and nursery schools in England
to have in place a procedure to deal with complaints relating to a
school. The day-to-day running of a maintained school is the
responsibility of the head teacher, the governing body and the local
authority. It is recommended parents put their concerns in writing to
the head teacher and, if this fails to resolve the issue, concerns
should then be raised with the chair of governors. Some local
authorities may also have a complaints procedure available. A complaint
may be made to the Secretary of State for Education if a parent
believes a governing body or local authority is acting unreasonably or
is failing to carry out its statutory duties properly.</hs_Para>

The Education (Independent School Standards) Regulations 2010. Parents
should raise complaints initially with the head teacher or the academy

Streeter:</Member></B> The Electoral Commission informs me that it has
not received any recent representations on the use of foreign language
translators in polling stations for elections in the London borough of
Tower Hamlets. The Commission is in regular contact with the returning
officer for Tower Hamlets who does employ some presiding officers or
poll clerks who speak community languages, but these staff may only
provide electors with general assistance on the process of voting. The
Commission's guidance makes clear that staff in polling stations are
not permitted to advise electors on which candidate or party to vote
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1403046002223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/text/140303w0004.htm#1403046002223">The

counterparts regularly on a number of issues relating to EU energy
policy, including renewable energy trading. The United Kingdom and
Ireland signed a 
<?notus-xml column=706?>memorandum of understanding (MOU) on cooperation in the energy sector in
January 2013. Since then, British and Irish officials have been working
closely together to understand how Irish renewable energy resources
might be developed to the mutual benefit of both countries. This is the
first time that projects of this kind—bringing forward
cross-border EU trade in renewable energy—are being considered.
They are both innovative and complex, bringing risks and benefits that
need to be weighed. Working with project developers and delivery
partners, the energy Departments of both countries have undertaken a
comprehensive cost-benefit analysis and assessed regulatory, licensing
and planning implications for both countries. Good progress has been
made and, as stated in the MOU, we continue to work towards an
Inter-Governmental
Agreement.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-03-03?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_03_03_PT_1/CB235165B65C2D2DC87B7093AE504298F52F64C1" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="3 March 2014">Monday

Soubry:</Member></B> The Ministry of Defence uses a variety of
financial incentives (FIs) to assist with recruitment and retention of
armed forces personnel. FIs are targeted, temporary measures to address
current or projected manning shortfalls, particularly in essential
specialisations such as operational pinch point trades, specific to the
requirements of each

criteria used to determine whether an individual has to repay a FRI
differs for each scheme. They will generally be linked to circumstances
in which the claimant has not met the conditions originally agreed when
the payment is claimed. Such criteria are clearly stated within scheme
documentation, a copy of which is signed by all claimants as part the
application process, prior to any payment being authorised. In most
cases the requirement to repay a FRI in full arises from a failure to
serve out the whole return of service (ROS) agreed. The ROS is a
minimum period of service, within the related specialism, offered by
the individual in return for the monies paid. There may also be
occasions where payments have been claimed in error and in those cases
affected personnel are normally asked to repay the FRI once the error
has been
identified.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14030410000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140303/text/140303w0005.htm#14030410000044">In
exceptional circumstances (e.g. failure on medical or welfare grounds)
repayment may be waived. In such cases individuals are invited to
submit details to the Service Personnel and Veterans Agency where they
