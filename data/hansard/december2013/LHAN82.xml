Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl

to research into the causes of this dreadful disease and into potential
treatments. The usual practice of the main public funders of health
research is not to ring-fence funds for expenditure on particular
diseases, and funding is available for high-quality research proposals.
With its partners, the Department of Health is actively pursuing a
package of measures that we believe will stimulate an increase in the
level of research on

Alton of Liverpool (CB):</Member></B> While thanking the noble Earl for
his reply, does he recall the assurance he gave to the House, when an
all-party amendment—which would have created a small, statutory
levy to support mesothelioma funding—was defeated by 199 votes
to 192, that insurance companies would voluntarily step up to the
plate? Given that there have been 2,400 deaths from mesothelioma this
year, with 60,000 anticipated over the next 25 years, and with the
imminent ending of even the existing insurance industry funding, would
it not be shameful to leave unfunded research that could save lives and
prevent vast expenditure on compensation? The Mesothelioma Bill is now
before another place, with an amendment supported by both Conservative
and Labour Members of the House of Commons. Surely Ministers should be
looking again at this practical way of finding a cure for this deadly
disease<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:08:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I understand that the British Lung
Foundation has had discussions with representatives of the insurance
industry about extending the funding for research, but that no
commitment has been made by the industry so far as to future funding.
As I made clear during the debate, the issue holding back progress is
not the lack of available funding—there is plenty of
that—but the lack of sufficient high-quality research
applications. The money previously donated by insurers is supporting
valuable research, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has said. At the
moment, a greater volume of mesothelioma research is supported by the
Government, and we believe that the package of measures that I
mentioned will stimulate an increase in that
volume<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:09:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I refer to my interest in the

Offenders Act 2012 requires the Government to review the application to
mesothelioma claims of the provisions banning conditional fees. The
Government have announced that, in the light of a consultation as yet
unpublished, they will not treat those cases differently from other
claims. They seek to conflate this issue with entirely different

insurance companies have stepped up to the plate with funding of
£3 million, which admittedly is nearing its end, but I do not
think that we can belittle that contribution. My noble friend may be
interested to know that the MRC and the NIHR together spent more than
£2.2 million on mesothelioma research in 2012-13, which is a
larger sum than for many other disease areas. I say again that the
issue is not the lack of funding because the research funding in both
the MRC and the NIHR has been protected. What is lacking are suitable

I certainly do, that following the scandalous mistreatment of
mesothelioma sufferers by employer’s liability insurers over
decades, there has been no commitment from those four employer’s
liability insurers or from the rest of the industry to continue funding
beyond next year? Whatever arrangements are made to secure the
continuation of research in this vital field, can the Minister be more

the first of which will be to set up a partnership to bring together
patients, carers and clinicians to identify what the priorities in
research are. Secondly, the NIHR will highlight to the research
community 
<?notus-xml column=345?>that it wants to encourage research applications in this area. The NIHR
Research Design Service will be able to help prospective applicants
develop competitive research proposals, and we will convene a meeting

that the £3 million has run out and that there is a danger that
the talented clinicians who have been working on mesothelioma as a
result of that fund will move on to other subjects? However, the
Association of British Insurers has told me that it would be prepared

Walton of Detchant (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, what makes mesothelioma
such a fatal disease is the length of the incubation period, in that
individuals who have been exposed to asbestos may not develop the
disease until many years later; indeed, 2,000 new cases have been
reported this year. The developments to which the Minister has referred
are helpful and encouraging, but have the Government been able to

between the British Lung Foundation and the insurance industry have not
so far resulted in a pledge for further funding, but as my noble friend
Lord Avebury has indicated, that door may be open. However, we should
bear in mind that asking insurance companies to fund research is an
unusual mechanism in itself. I suggest that we should not push the

effective press regulation at the moment and, because of the

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> The noble Baroness made a number of
points. To start with the last one, the royal charter was felt in the
end to be the appropriate route by all the parties, and by others more
widely, precisely so that there was not seen to be any intrusion into
the very valuable tenet that we should have a free press and freedom of
expression. The architecture of Lord Justice Leveson was designed to
have a new, independent, self-regulatory body and a recognition panel
to oversee that body and to make sure that it adheres. It is for the
self-regulatory body to apply or not—it will be voluntary.
However, I do not think there is an impasse because there is an
understanding that what we had before must never

reported—a year. However, during that time, many things have
happened. The royal charter, which has now been agreed, is about to be 
<?notus-xml column=351?>sealed, which will enable the Commissioner for Public Appointments to
start the process of finding a chair and members for the recognition
panel, which is clearly important. It will then be for the press to set

Morgan of Huyton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to have the
opportunity to introduce this debate on the important contribution of
high-quality education to the economy. I am grateful to noble Lords who
are taking part today, and I am humbly aware of the breadth and depth
of experience and knowledge around the Chamber. I am particularly
pleased to see that two noble Lords are making their maiden speeches
today. I draw attention to my entry in the Register of Lords’
Interests, including my role as chair of Ofsted.</hs_para>

week to be holding this debate. On Tuesday the OECD published its PISA
league table of global education. The UK stayed pretty static in the
rankings, stubbornly hovering in the lower section of the top half. The
focus on education in a number of Asian economies is well documented.
Rather less discussed is the remarkable improvement in standards in
other countries, including Poland and Estonia.</hs_para>

we must also not be pessimistic. There are reasons to believe that our
schools and colleges will continue to improve. Indeed, there are
lessons to be learnt very close to home. We do not have to go to
Helsinki or Shanghai to understand how children—especially
disadvantaged children—can get a better education and a better
start in life. However, it would be equally foolish to minimise the
scale of the challenges we face. According to the OECD, a quarter of
all adults in the UK between the ages of 25 and 64 have
minimal levels of numeracy and literacy, compared to 14% in Sweden, 12%
in Canada and 11% in the United States.</hs_para>

dynamic economy can afford to neglect the quality of its education, and
no country that is serious about its education can afford to neglect
the full range of its educational provision: from nursery through
school to college, university and beyond. Weaknesses in one will affect
the quality of the next, and the earlier they occur, the greater the
negative impact and the harder they will be to rectify. The economic
opportunities for the poorly educated are few, and getting
scarcer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000071">Three
things in particular hold this country back: the gap in attainment
between well-off and poor children; the alarming regional variations in
the quality of our schools, especially with regard to teaching and
leadership; and the weakness and irrelevance of much vocational
education.</hs_para>

problems start early in life and have a lot to do with the way we
tackle—or, more precisely, fail to tackle—disadvantage.
At the age of five, children from low-income backgrounds are already 19
months behind their better-off peers. By the age of 
<?notus-xml column=354?>six, low-ability children from well-off homes outperform brighter
children from poor families. So it continues through primary and
secondary school. Just over a third of pupils on free school meals get
five good GCSEs—27% behind the rest of the
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000073">The
problem is now particularly acute among poor white children. For
example, Bangladeshi children on free school meals used to lag behind
their peers; now 59% of them achieve five good GCSEs, the national
average for all pupils, whether or not they are on free school meals.
Barely 30% of white children from low-income families manage the same.
This matters because a quarter of all children without five good GCSEs
end up being NEET—not in education, employment or
training—within two years. Those with no qualifications have a
greater than 50% chance of becoming NEET. It affects the economic
prospects of the whole
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000074">This
“tail” of underachievement is longer and bigger in the UK
than in many of our international competitors. Canada, for instance,
which has comparable demographics and income inequality, has half the
proportion of children in its “tail” that we do. If the
Canadians can do more for their disadvantaged children, surely so can
we.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000075">London
stands out, although other areas are improving as well. Bluntly put, 20
years ago London’s schooling system was a basket case. Inner
London’s GCSE results were a third of the national average.
Schools were chaotic, with poor behaviour and inadequate teaching. Now
the results are above the national average, even though the city still
has some of the worst deprivation in the country. London has well
qualified and committed teachers and great head teachers. Among
disadvantaged children, the bottom 1% in London now match the average
score of their peers in the rest of the country at
GCSE.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000076">If
London were analysed in the PISA rankings separately, as Shanghai is,
it would undoubtedly be much higher up the table than the UK. What
happened in London was a combination of political focus and
professional determination. London Challenge backed those head teachers
who focused on achievement regardless of background, who never accepted
excuses and who never gave up. It did not support those willing to let
things drift.</hs_para>

team also encouraged heads to share good practice and the intelligent
use of data and, crucially, to challenge each other. It benefited from
other far-sighted initiatives of the time, such as many of the first
sponsored academies and the first cohorts of Teach First and Future
Leaders. Through a combination of practical steps, persistence and
strategic imagination, it succeeded—and when the challenge
formally ended, the system continued to improve and work in the same
new
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000078">Interestingly,
Andreas Schleicher, director of the PISA programme, would highlight
many of the features I have just described in London as the core
features of successful countries in the PISA study. He speaks of the
core elements: capacity at point of delivery, with great teachers and
leaders; zero tolerance of failure; well targeted resources; a
commitment to raising attainment; and confidence for all. He also
highlights the importance of time devoted to learning. One extra 
<?notus-xml column=355?>hour of maths a week leads to three-quarters of a year’s extra
progress at GCSE, and underlines that autonomy with accountability is a
must—we cannot have one without the
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000079">If
London succeeded against the odds, other regions can succeed, too. As
things stand, the variability in performance of many schools outside
London is frankly alarming. In the north-east, for instance, less than
a third of teaching was judged good or better last year by Oftsed; in
London, it was over
three-quarters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:44:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:44:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000080">Last
month I visited schools in Hull and Grimsby. I met great new heads
turning around schools, but their biggest challenge was not the
children, or indeed the teachers any more, but raising the aspirations
of parents and the community, and convincing them that education
matters. That is tough when the jobs that used to be there have gone
and have not been replaced.</hs_para>

however, to think that only economically challenged areas have problems
with their education. The south-east, for instance, had the highest
attainment gap in the country between children receiving free school
meals and children not receiving free school meals—33 percentage
points. In 30 schools in West Berkshire, not one free school meal pupil
managed to get five good GCSEs. Relatively affluent areas may be
educating some of their children well, but they are not educating all
their children
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:45:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000082">The
quality of much of our vocational education, too, lags far behind that
of many of our international competitors. We must develop the skills
base we need for this century rather than the last. Some of the
Government’s recent initiatives are welcome. The move to require
youngsters to study maths and English to 18, if they fail at 16,
recommended by the Wolf report, was overdue. The introduction of graded
apprenticeships in partnership with top employers will bolster the
credentials of a vital training option. The move to fund
apprenticeships through employers rather than providers should end some
of the perverse incentives in the current
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000083">I
welcome, too, the increase in the number of apprenticeships announced
by the Government last month, which builds on the work done in this
field by the previous Government. However, we would be foolish and
premature to indulge in too much mutual backslapping. Are we
collectively bold enough and comprehensive enough in this area? We do
not yet have a vocational system that rivals our international
competitors. Vorsprung durch Technik is not a phrase that was minted in
Thurrock, Woking or Hull. Until we have an English equivalent, perhaps
we should put the champagne on
ice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000084">Too many
training courses and apprenticeships still fail to deliver employable
skills, too many are of short duration and too many cater to adults
over the age of 25 rather than youngsters. Many of these are still, in
effect, on-the-job training programmes for existing employees rather
than genuine
apprenticeships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000085">Although
the numbers have declined slightly over the past year, we still have
more than 1 million NEETs in this country. Indeed, it is unnerving to
note that the proportion of 16 to 18 year-olds who are NEET has been
roughly static for almost 20 years—at around 9% to
10%. That figure is an appalling indictment of 
<?notus-xml column=356?>successive Governments, a dreadful waste of the country’s talent
and a personal tragedy for millions of young people. I will put those
bare statistics in some kind of human context. In a recent survey, 40%
of NEETs said they did not feel part of society, 36% felt that they
would never get a job; and 37% said they rarely went out of the
house.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000086">Reforms
of vocational education have to address not only the nuts and bolts of
the issue—what apprentices should learn, who should provide it
and whether it is relevant to employers and the local
economy—but must also have legitimacy with those they seek to
help. Crucially, will they get youngsters out of the cycle of little
hope of a job or even of a place in
society?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000087">I
have another concern about vocational courses. Until we make vocational
training an alternative, sought-after and prestigious route into higher
education and employment, we will never succeed in rebalancing our
economy or harnessing the full potential of the next generation. Our
country must become as proud of its vocational education as the Swiss
and the Germans are of
theirs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000088">If we
are to do that, we must grapple with an uncomfortable truth. Vocational
training is too often seen as the consolation prize: the route we urge
young people to take if they have failed to shine academically. That
must change. Vocational and technical training and education must be
judged on its own merits, and not dismissed like some ill favoured
child, always doomed to
disappoint.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000089">Apprenticeships
and vocational training will always suit some children of all abilities
and backgrounds, because that is where their natural potential lies.
Unfortunately, in this country that technical potential usually is
identified only in children from low-income families. Remarkably, it
seems to be entirely absent in the children of the middle and upper
classes. Has it been bred out of them or are we refusing to see what
our prejudices will not let us see—that some children learn best
by learning
practically?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000090">I
have to say that I think the situation has worsened since the turning
of polytechnics into universities. Institutions offering high-quality
technical and vocational courses are something of a gaping hole in our
academic landscape. The challenge for our country is not only to equip
those disadvantaged youngsters with the key skills they lack—and
that employers want—but to break the automatic assumption that
decrees that a vocational education is a second-rate education for the
poor and disadvantaged. When we see Cabinet Ministers or even, dare I
say, your Lordships, boasting that their son or daughter has bagged an
engineering apprenticeship at
BAE<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T11:51:06"></hs_TimeCode> rather than

lesson from Shanghai this week is this. That city region is engaged in
a systematic, long-term project as a way to transform its economy. As
Andreas Schleicher says, you can see, from the Minister down to the
classroom teacher, that this is their future. They believe that
education is the great equaliser. That is why they make it prestigious

We go back 40 years, when I was the most junior Minister in Ted

reason why this debate is important is that there is total dysfunction
between the needs of British industry and commerce and the educational
system of our country at all levels. At university level, with the
skills gap by 2020, British industry and commerce will need 850,000
STEM graduates, including in computing. It will be 300,000 short;
45,000 short each year for the next seven years. When it comes to
levels 3 and 4, the advanced and foundation degrees, it will need more
than half a million. The FE college system cannot possibly meet that
need in that time. The reason why it cannot meet it is that if a
student starts at FE college at 16, it takes him two years to get to
GCSE in engineering, computing or the built industry. At 18,
with that qualification, he goes off for a job. If you start at 14, by
16 you will have a BTEC or a good GCSE in a technical subject. You then
go on to level 3 and level 4, but the conversion rate of FE colleges to

we come to the school system. We have nearly 1 million unemployed

science teaching. Good luck to him; I wish him well but actually, we
have all failed and I must bear some responsibility for that. There are

Warwick of Undercliffe (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this debate is
timely. This morning, the Chancellor of the Exchequer is making his
autumn Statement. He is widely expected to announce yet more cuts to
funding for higher education and research, and it is for that reason
that I want to focus my remarks on the implications of his statements
for higher
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:00:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000108">I
have spoken many times on the contribution made by higher education to
economic growth and I was delighted to see the pithy and convincing
briefing sent to us by Universities UK, my former employer. Other noble
Lords across the House will, I know, reinforce many of these comments,
as have my noble friend Lady Morgan and the noble Lord, Lord
Baker<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:00:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000109">However,
fine words or arguments can have no effect if resources do not shore up
policy. While we do not know the detail of these cuts or how they will
be allocated, reports have suggested that that the Department 
<?notus-xml column=360?>for Business, Innovation and Skills has to find more than £1
billion in additional savings. There have been fears, reported in the
<I>Guardian</I>, that this would mean that the Government would breach
the principle of a science ring-fence, making cuts of as much as
£200 million. I hope that that will not be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:01:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000110">It
also appears likely that the Higher Education Funding Council will have
to find additional savings from within an already tightly constrained
budget. These cuts would be in addition to those announced in this
summer’s spending review. At that time, the Government said that
cuts to HEFCE funding would be at least £45 million and that
there would be no inflationary uplift for the science budget. This is
serious. I have said previously that the Government should be
congratulated on their relative protection of investment in higher
education, and particularly in research, despite the pressure to cut
expenditure. However, public funding for teaching has been dramatically
reduced and it now looks like it will be reduced still further. It is
not widely understood that research budgets lost 13% of their value
during the last spending round as a result of the fact that they were
maintained in cash terms rather than in real terms. Projections suggest
that, because the science budget has again been held in cash terms
rather than in real terms, the budget will lose a further 10% of its
value during this spending period. Will the Minister confirm that this
is indeed the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:02:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000111">Any
new cuts would exacerbate that position. We know that the UK already
spends less on research than many of our competitors. We have made
relatively little progress towards the Lisbon goal of spending
3% of GDP on research and development. We spend 1.8%, below
the average of both the EU and the OECD. We are holding our own in
international terms because we have a highly efficient research system.
In fact, it is the most efficient in the world when measured by
citations per pound spent. Meanwhile, HEFCE now has very little funding
available to support teaching. Support is restricted to high-cost and
vulnerable subjects, which are likely to continue to be protected.
There is some limited support for specialist institutions and taught
postgraduate courses, and funding to support widening
participation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:03:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000112">This
last strand, of widening participation, looks increasingly vulnerable,
which is a shame because the student opportunity funding underpins the
kind of long-term and collaborative work which universities do to
encourage children from primary school upwards to think about higher
education generally, not just applying to their own institution. It
acts as a lever for additional investment by universities and
philanthropists. It is hard to see how the funding council can shoulder
cuts without doing some damage to long-term national priorities.
Clearly, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills has to
balance its budget, but overspending on student support and loan
subsidies, including to support the rapid growth of private providers,
is starting to squeeze out long-term investments, which should be high
priorities for a Government committed to fostering strong economic
growth. While national investment in research is critical to our future
economic competitiveness, as today’s debate has again made
clear, it should not be achieved at the expense of investment in
education. After all, the most important 
<?notus-xml column=361?>form of knowledge transfer from universities is in the heads of the
graduates that they educate.</hs_para>

evidence of the link between education and the economy and I will not
repeat the arguments already made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan,
and the noble Lord, Lord Baker. It is worth emphasising, however, that
around 20% of GDP growth in the UK from 1982 to 2005 can be attributed
to graduate skills accumulation, according to government figures. The
same study estimated that a 1% increase in the share of the workforce
with a university education raises the level of productivity by up to
0.5% in the long run. Many of our fastest growing sectors depend on
high concentrations of graduates, including the creative sector, which
needs graduates from a range of disciplines including the arts and
humanities as well as the sciences.</hs_para>

increasingly supports innovation in businesses from the very large to
the very small. Collaboration between university and business is a
considerable success story in the UK. So if the Government want
long-term economic growth and an economy that will remain competitive
with fast-growing economies with rapidly growing skills levels, we
cannot afford to stand still, let alone go
backwards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000115">Instead
of driving forward, we seem to be constraining growth. Capital
investment has been limited. Universities face strict limits on the
numbers that they can recruit and perhaps numbers may be restricted
again next year. There is no plan for growth and there is unlikely to
be one until the system of loan funding is sorted out. It is simply too
expensive to allow for growth in student numbers.</hs_para>

to be in encouraging the development of diverse modes of study,
including more online and flexible study. We have seen the number of
part-time enrolments drop by a staggering 40% since 2010. Studies by
the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, Universities UK and others
have pointed to the need to address this decline to meet the rapidly
changing skills needs of employers. We should also be concerned about
the decline of taught postgraduate enrolments by UK-based students. The
noble Lord, Lord Leitch, in his seminal report published in 2006,
described postgraduate skills as one of the most powerful levers for
improving productivity but a number of factors are combining to pose a
real challenge to postgraduate education, which has received
insufficient attention from government. We cannot afford to be
complacent. As President Obama put it:</hs_para>

risen to her feet. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, said to me afterwards
that he could see that I was starting out as I intended to continue:
causing havoc. In the coming years, I trust that I will not create a
great deal of havoc, but will perhaps make a modest contribution to the

am glad to make my maiden speech in this debate on the contribution of
high-quality education to economic growth. I live next to one of the
oldest schools in the country. This is St Albans School, founded before
the Norman Conquest by Abbot Ulsinus in the year 948. Over the years,
it has produced many notable alumni, including the only British-born
pope, Nicholas Breakspear, otherwise known as Adrian IV, Professor
Stephen Hawking and several Members of this House. The diocese that I
have the privilege to lead covers the counties of Hertfordshire and
Bedfordshire, Luton and parts of Barnet. As well as many independent
schools with a Christian foundation, we have 135 church
schools serving their local communities. None of the church schools in
my diocese is deemed “unsatisfactory”; 18% are graded
“satisfactory” and the remaining 82% are either
“good” or “outstanding”. I want to pay
tribute to the work of head teachers, governors, teachers, parents and
school staff who work so hard to produce schools of such
excellence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000133">Detractors
of church schools sometimes claim that our excellent academic results
are because we have creamed off the best pupils. The facts do not
support that assertion. Our schools are spread across a wide range of
neighbourhoods, and we are proud to have schools in some of the most
difficult and challenging communities. The national data produced in
the Department for Education’s 2013 school census
show that 15% of pupils at Church of England secondary
schools are eligible for free school meals, which is the same as the
average for non-Church of England schools. The same census reveals that
we serve almost exactly the same proportion of black and minority
ethnic pupils as non-Church of England secondary schools
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000134">I will
share one story, which I hope will illustrate our concern and our
commitment well, and which takes us to the very heart of today’s
debate on education and the economy. Northfields Upper School in
Dunstable, later Northfields Technology College, went into special
measures in 2006 and there was a change of leadership to give it a
fresh start. Sadly, it was decided that the school should close, but on
1 September 2009 it reopened 
<?notus-xml column=365?>as All Saints Academy, sponsored by the diocese of St Albans
in partnership with the University of Bedfordshire. Today it
specialises in science and business and is housed in brand new

academic standards was not immediate, but has been steady and
impressive since 2009. Over the past four years, attendance has
increased from 87% to 93% this year. The percentage of pupils achieving
five A* to C grades, including English and maths, has risen from 23% in
2009 to 40% this year. Our partnership with the University of
Bedfordshire has generated a tangible rise in the aspirations of its
pupils, with increasing numbers of students considering the possibility
of going on to higher education. I am glad to acknowledge publicly the
huge contribution made by the head, Tom Waterworth, and his team to
achieve such a change in four years. That is a success story of which
we are rightly

is too early, however, to know exactly what difference that dramatic
improvement in exam results will make to economic growth in Dunstable.
Certainly, everyone loses out if we cannot translate academic success
into productive outcomes. Andreas Schleicher, already quoted by several
noble Lords in this debate, makes the depressing assertion in his
comments on that international survey that young English adults aged
between 16 and 24 are some of the lowest-ranking in literacy and
numeracy in the industrialised world. He concludes that deficiencies in
our school system over a lifetime will lead to an unbelievable
£4.5 trillion loss in economic output. In bald economic terms,

said all that, I will pause and ask what we mean by the phrase
“high-quality education”. Not one of us can dissent from
that, but what does it mean in practice? What is its personal,
social—and, dare I ask, spiritual—content as opposed to
its crude cash value? I ask that because although we need to ensure
that our pupils achieve academic success, education must surely be much
more than that. In classical Greek culture the concept of paideia
constituted a holistic understanding of education for body, mind and
soul. That vision was picked up and developed by Cardinal Newman in his
seminal work <I>The Idea of a University</I>, published in 1852. In
today’s world, where so much stress is placed on individuality
and the need for every person to realise their inner self, education
plays a vital role in developing a sense of social responsibility and
the need to contribute to civil society and the common good. If
education is to be truly “high-quality”, surely it will
also produce people with a rich emotional hinterland, whose souls have
been expanded as they have explored the arts, music and
literature.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000138">I

Dr Warman was able to help foster carers reflect on their own struggles

to my conclusion, and bringing us back to the economy and bridging the
skills gap, five years ago I visited an event organised by the National
Institute of Adult Continuing Education. The venue was the City of
London’s Guildhall. Visitors were seated at round tables with
parents and their children. In the course of the morning we had the
beautiful experience of hearing how parents who had failed at school
had been drawn into education as their child began at nursery or
primary school. Educators might stand at the primary school gates and
get hold of parents as 
<?notus-xml column=368?>they came in so as to encourage them to get into literacy and numeracy.
We heard parents who had been addicts speak about their growing
confidence as they gained qualifications in numeracy and literacy. We
heard from a mum about the pleasure she now took in doing her homework
while her son studied and being able to help him with his studies. We
heard from young people how powerful an encouragement it was for them
to see their parents setting an example for them and being able to take
an informed interest in their studies. Parents spoke about their new
confidence, which enabled them to gain other qualifications such as a
driving licence. Just two months ago I returned to visit NIACE. My
noble friend Lady Howarth of Breckland had chaired an inquiry for the
association, and the occasion was the launch of its report, entitled

Cohen of Pimlico (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, many noble Lords have
spoken about education in schools, which clearly, with a long tail of
almost 1 million NEETs, is absolutely vital to our children and
grandchildren. However, like my noble friend Lady Warwick of
Undercliffe, I want to talk about the importance of education at
university level, but from rather a different angle. I declare an
interest as chancellor of BPP University. BPP are the initials of the
founder of a fine training company, but now stand for the Business and
Professional University. My noble friend Lady Morgan of Huyton
emphasised in her speech the importance of technical education for
economic growth. We at BPP, and I as the chairman of BPP Holdings Ltd
long before we acquired degree-awarding powers—which we did in
2007, acquiring full university status this year—always thought

job and the life that will please them and give them a decent standard
of living<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:34:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Coming from a training background, as we do, we have always believed
that. Yes, of course there are cultural purposes to university
education, but for us the outstanding purpose has always been to enable
our graduates to get into good, well paid jobs, because all else can
stem from
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:34:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the university a little in order to make my point. We have 9,000
students on seven campuses around the UK, with two in London and five
in the regions. Some 3,000 of the students are undergraduates, which is
a new departure for us. We 
<?notus-xml column=369?>teach very successfully the core business subjects, mostly accountancy
and law. Some 65% of our students are female, and 96% have a job or are
in further training within six months of leaving us. Our graduates make
a major contribution to economic growth both directly and indirectly.
They do so directly because we have a great many students at the
graduate level from overseas, which helps to level up the balance of
payments as well as spreading the reputation of the UK overseas. The
indirect but vital contribution to growth is that the reputation of the
UK as a good place to do business depends on having a corps of well
trained, professional lawyers, accountants, actuaries and other
business specialists. The City of London could not be the force that it
is, contributing 20% of GDP, without its highly skilled lawyers and
specialist accountants. Businesses all over the UK depend for their
stability, and thus their ability to grow, on the efforts of their
finance directors and the support of properly trained commercial
lawyers.</hs_para>

can be rightly proud of our contribution not least because, as I should
make clear, we are the only private, for-profit university in the
country. But we are not the only people in the business. We believe
that we are the most successful at placing our graduates in employment.
A lot of universities teach law on a more theoretical basis, but we
believe that students need to be taught by people who have worked in
the profession. Some 80% of our tutors come from that background. The
UK could do with more courses like this. I personally am particularly
interested in the undergraduate-level courses that enable people of any
age to move quickly into a position where they are useful and
employable. There are definitely not enough of such courses,
particularly for the capable young person who does not quite know what
they want to do, but knows they want a decent job in a good
business.</hs_para>

have only 3,000 undergraduates so far but, private and profit-making
business or not, we are able to charge fees of £5,500 a year for
the three-year course, which is substantially less than for most law
and business courses. The reason we can keep the fees down is that we
do not have a conventional university structure. We sweat our assets
and our buildings are hardly ever empty. Also, we have extremely
flexible staff. We attract the services of excellent people by offering
them what is essentially very well paid shift work on a part-time
basis. That is a far cry from the leisurely programmes that I enjoyed
as an undergraduate but it is very effective, and I believe that our
universities could do much more to make their students more employable
by teaching them for longer and better without risking the loss of the
enjoyable university

is that we believe that it is possible to deliver degrees that will get
our students into good jobs on the basis of two years’ study.
This is a work in progress but last week I was able to award degrees to
some of the first graduates under the scheme. Those students are paying
fees of £6,000 a year because the course is that bit more
difficult to teach. On the other hand, however, they are getting a very
economical degree because they pay only two years’ living fees,

has not yet been mentioned in the debate, which is the passing of the
polytechnics, or rather their translation into universities. The
polytechnics used to provide excellent technical training, which became
diluted and a bit overly academic as they turned into
universities. We are more on the model of a polytechnic than much of
what is now being offered. I believe, I am afraid, that turning
polytechnics into universities was a retrograde step for the
country.</hs_para>

higher education and make it more varied and interesting, and we have
been authenticated and given full degree-awarding powers following our

start, if I may, by thanking everyone in this House for making me feel
so welcome. Your Lordships from all parts of the House, the officials,
the attendants and the police—everybody has been immensely
helpful. I also want to thank my noble friends Lady Seccombe and Lady
Jenkin of Kennington, who have helped me navigate my way around this
place, both procedurally but also geographically, which is important
for someone with a really bad sense of direction. I want to reassure my

chose as part of my title Didsbury in the City of Manchester because
that is where I was born, brought up and educated. I chose it also for
a second, somewhat paradoxical reason—paradoxical because I have
spent most of my working life in London. But I am conscious of the
metropolitan bubble that so many of the commentariat seem to inhabit.
For me that is best summed up by John Humphrys, introducing the weather
forecast on the radio, saying, “It’s raining over
Broadcasting House. What’s it doing in the rest of the

now turn to the subject of the debate, and I want to focus on one
specific area—the need for our schools to turn out more students
who can speak and understand a foreign language. My noble friend Lady
Sharp has great expertise in this area. Why does this subject matter?
The UK trades with more than 200 countries, and most of them are
non-English speaking. Three-quarters of the world’s population
do not speak
English<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:44:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
people have English as a second language, but what arrogance to think
that other people should learn our language rather than our learning
other people’s languages. Arrogance, real or perceived, is not
helpful in a competitive
marketplace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:44:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

obvious practical benefit of knowing a foreign language is that you can
communicate in the language of the people with whom you are doing
business. But there is another important point: speaking the language
of another country also opens the door to an understanding of that
country—an understanding of the culture and of the mindset. That
must surely give you a competitive edge when you are trying to clinch
that deal or sign that
contract<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:45:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000164">A
few months ago the British Chambers of Commerce conducted a survey. Two
out of three businesses that were thinking of exporting saw language as
a barrier, and the vast majority of businesses did not speak a foreign
language well enough to conduct business in the buyer’s tongue.
This is not altogether surprising. For years now, language learning in
our schools has been in decline. For example, this year the number of
students who took French at A-level was 50% lower than the number 10
years ago. Of all the A-levels passed by state-funded students, those
in modern languages—all modern languages
combined—represented less than 3%.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:46:27"></hs_TimeCode> was, I am
afraid, a mistake in 2004 to remove compulsory language learning at key
stage 4, for 14 to 16 year-olds. I welcome the various steps being
taken to try to reverse this trend.</hs_para>

next year it will be compulsory for children in primary schools to be
taught a foreign language. We know that it is much easier to absorb the
sounds of new languages when you are young, and more difficult when you
are older. I speak from experience: I am learning Italian, and have
been doing so for many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:47:04"></hs_TimeCode>. I want to
draw attention to one practical point here. I am thinking of children
leaving a primary school where they have been taught, say,
Mandarin or Spanish, and then finding themselves in a secondary school
that teaches French and German. It is very important for there to be
co-ordination between primary and secondary
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:47:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
introduction of the English baccalaureate 
<?notus-xml column=372?>is another important advance, and EBacc is already having an impact on
the numbers taking a modern foreign language at GCSE. Let us hope that
continues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000166">I
have two<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:47:37"></hs_TimeCode> final
points to make. Of course pupils need an understanding of grammar, and
need to be able to translate the written word. But as we all know, oral
skills are vital, so that they can speak the language with some
confidence. Secondly, as our trade with non-European countries expands,
the learning of non-European languages becomes ever more
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T12:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>. This

this is a long-term process, not least in ensuring that we have enough

Lord Sherbourne of Didsbury, on his maiden speech. He was, as he said,
head of office for Edward Heath, political secretary to Lady Thatcher,

Howard of Lympne. This not only reveals a wealth of political
experience but suggests excellent diplomatic skills. Perhaps the
Government should send him to Geneva, too. The noble Lord’s

education is a significant employer in the UK, with equivalent to 1.2%

employers, bringing an important boost to the local and regional

to the prosperity of an area. Looking at it another way, a town such as
Rhyl in North Wales, where I spent last weekend, has severe
unemployment and deprivation. Even Marks &amp; Spencer has moved out.
Rhyl would benefit enormously from one of the UCTs suggested by the

important driver. I looked it up in the dictionary and a summary would

what extra investment is being put into continuing professional
development, particularly on leadership skills? Parental support is
important but how do we support those children who will never have
adequate parental support? While autonomy for schools may seem to be
the ideal, we should acknowledge the downside. I wonder how much time

resisting attempts by some parent governors with no home to go to from

economic growth. One of the great strengths of this House is that it

that thought in mind, I thought it helpful to share with noble Lords
two practical projects that I am working on in east London that are
seeking to make the link between high quality education and economic
growth. The first is the St Paul’s Way Transformation Project.
Here, I must declare an interest as director. Seven years ago the CEO
of Tower Hamlets Council, the health service and the social housing
company asked me to intervene in St Paul’s Way. There had been a
murder and considerable violence in a housing estate 800 yards to the
north of Canary
Wharf.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000179">Arriving
at St Paul’s Way for the first time, I was not surprised to find
that the school was failing and in special measures, with only 35
families applying per year. Police cars, angry black youths with dogs
and a frightened head teacher hiding behind a large fence greeted me.
The school was defined by a silo culture. It had no relationship with
the two warring housing estates around its perimeter, nor with the
health centre next door and its 11,000 patients. Some school staff, 
<?notus-xml column=375?>among them Oxbridge graduates, actively fostered an agenda of
isolationism, convinced that the school stood separate from the world
of business. Few pupils had walked 800 yards down the road to visit
Canary Wharf.</hs_para>

I have worked with partners to create an entrepreneurial narrative for
this street. The lead directors in each key public body, their middle
managers and the leaders on the street have all embraced it. The
results speak for themselves. A new £40 million school now sits
on the demolished 1960s school site, complete with the first Faraday
science centre in the country. This year, over 1,000 families applied
for a place at the school. Exam results continue to rise year on year;
the 2013 Ofsted inspection rated the school outstanding in every
category; 60% of the sixth form this year gained a place at a Russell
Group university; and a bridge programme provides pathways for the most
talented students into

rising exam results are not enough to secure a future for these
students. Reading Latin at an Oxbridge college will not guarantee these
students a job at the end of an expensive degree; reading engineering
will. Professor Brian Cox, a patron at the school, reminds us that we
are short of 1 million engineers in the United Kingdom. With that in
mind, I have worked over the past two years with Brian to run an annual
science summer school at St Paul’s Way. This year, 250 students
attended the school for two days in their summer holidays to listen to
presentations by leading scientists, engineers and medics from across
the world. Speakers included those working on the Higgs boson at CERN,
the commercial director from Virgin Galactic, the engineer designing
the next Mars Rover and the vice president of the Royal College of
Physicians, Professor John Wass, who is also a patron of the school.

becomes the best place to do science and engineering in the world. The
answer lies in St Paul’s Way and places like it. A new campus is
growing there that connects education, science, enterprise, business
and research through practical activity. An example of this is the
Wellcome Trust sponsored licence, recently won by the school, which
will engage its science students in undertaking real DNA research into
diabetes, focused on the 11,000 local patients. The only fly in the
ointment is that those same patients are currently being prevented from
moving into a new £16 million health centre that currently
stands empty across the road from the school because of an NHS
bureaucratic
impasse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000183">Without
doubt, high quality education has changed the lives of the students of
St Paul’s Way Trust School and it is essential for our economic
growth to further this country’s reputation for academic
excellence. Education, however, must not stand alone from business and

translating theory into practical activity.</hs_para>

of working with the education sector for the past 30 years, I have a
few observations. First, education must step outside text books and the

<?notus-xml column=376?>classroom into the street and engage with the real world. Secondly, high
exam results do not automatically equip students with relevant life
skills. Like the noble Lord, Lord Sugar, and many other members of this
House, I left school at 16 and developed successful businesses and
organisations. School children desperately need to learn life skills,
and often these cannot be taught in a
classroom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000185">Thirdly,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:03:45"></hs_TimeCode> often
unconscious bias against business in the classroom needs to be
addressed. Teachers are uncomfortable with their students trading and
earning money in school. They are uneasy when you speak to them about
profit margins and exploiting market opportunities. Unless this is
addressed, the contribution of education to economic growth will be
muted. Fourthly, an over-academic approach can be antithetical to the
risk-taking involved in business and entrepreneurship. Too often,
especially in government, we risk paralysis by analysis. Fifthly,
practical experience and a track record of achievement should
complement academic qualifications both in school and in the

new science and technology businesses follow Tech City, BT, iCITY and

are moving into the park is a major piece of this jigsaw, and we thank
the Government for supporting it. In the Royal Docks I am, with
partners, starting to build a new secondary free school. This school,
through a massive regeneration project, will explicitly link an
isolated local community with the employment and enterprise
opportunities present in ExCeL, the forthcoming Chinese ABP
development, the new India Centre, City Airport and the Silvertown

growth is fundamental to raising living standards and to social
improvement. High-quality education is critical to that growth, right
throughout the education years. It is crucial that those involved in
each stage of education, from school to vocational training—an
area in which I recognise the substantial work of the noble Lord, Lord
Baker of Dorking, who has achieved far more outside Government, some
may 
<?notus-xml column=377?>consider, than he achieved in it—and through to universities not
only talk to but work with each other in the best interests of our
young people. I shall touch on those stages of

productivity improvement and growth. This is especially true for an
economy such as that of the UK, where we cannot rely on moving
resources from low-productivity activities such as agriculture into
higher productivity activity. Universities are critical in driving
innovation. They do so in at least three ways. The first is through
talent development, not only through undergraduate and postgraduate
education, but in executive education and CPD. Many of our successful
business leaders across all sectors demonstrate that. However, too many
of our citizens are missing that opportunity, either of vocational
training or of academic training in
universities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000191">The
second way that universities drive innovation is through fundamental
and translational research. This helps create new products, new
services and new ways of doing things. At Nottingham for instance, Sir
Peter Mansfield began fundamental research on MRI, which was then
licensed to transform imaging and diagnosis worldwide. Nottingham has
also contributed to 3D printing, food security, satellite
tracking and carbon capture, all of them important to the UK’s
economy both today and in the future. We need highly educated members
of our community to carry through that kind of
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000192">The
third way I have chosen to mention—there are others—is
the spinning out of new companies. Again, these are developed from the
cutting edge of research, not just at Nottingham but at many of our
best universities. This has been a hugely successful contribution to
the UK economy. This third aspect involves academia working with a wide
range of companies, many of which are household names such as
AstraZeneca, BAE Systems, E.ON, the Highways Agency, GSK, Rolls-Royce,
Romax, Unilever and Boots, with its home in Nottingham and its close
links to the founding of the university. They help bring the best of
business and academia

universities play in the growth of our economy was clearly demonstrated
this week, with the Prime Minister’s welcome trade mission to
China including a number of vice-chancellors, including Professor David
Greenaway of Nottingham. They have gone to a part of the world that has
already been covered in this debate and where there is a driving thirst
for, and a commitment to, education in a way that we have perhaps not
seen. However, that brings with it a downside. There is a question
about the roundedness of the individual children coming through that
system—their ability to solve problems and their cognitive
skills. Nevertheless, that ambition is feeding through to the numbers
coming through university. We see it in the China campus that
Nottingham has at Ningbo and, indeed, in Malaysia. Those students are a
great challenge to us and to our economy because of that thirst for
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000194">The
economic role that universities play in their regions and in driving
new technologies has been highlighted recently by the report
commissioned by 
<?notus-xml column=378?>the Government and produced by Sir Andrew Witty, a leading businessman
in this country, who is a former student and now chancellor of
Nottingham University. The report makes recommendations to the
Government on the need to leverage that role that universities play in
the regions, in order to be more effective. In his reply, can the
Minister tell us where the Government are in their thinking on
responding to that report?</hs_para>

economic role, universities play a crucial part in building the social
capital in the communities where they are embedded, through their
contributions to school improvement, healthcare and community
engagement and through their involvement in local hospitals. This
includes working directly with schools at primary level—it has
to start at a very young age—and involves not only academics but
students themselves going into those schools as role models to say to
young people, “You can do it; I have done it”.</hs_para>

in January 2011, Nottingham Potential is working to address the
mismatch between relatively low local achievement, which we have in
Nottingham, and progression to level 3 study. All the projects are
rooted in the national curriculum, with very strong messages about
aspiration and self-esteem. It starts with activities with seven
year-olds and continues right through their education. In
partnership with IntoUniversity, its activities take students into
schools as role models. It holds events on the university campus and
aims to make youngsters think that university can be for them and that
getting there is achievable. It aims to lift their confidence and
horizons and, as has been mentioned, the horizons of their families. So
much of this goes back to the home. The local link between the wider
community and universities is important to both parties and to our
future as well. It is important in breaking down the social barriers
which still substantially exist in young people thinking of going to
university.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000197">A
debate about the role of universities and economic growth would not be
complete if we did not recognise the importance of our higher education
sector as an exporter and as a contributor to soft power. It is one of
the most successful parts of the UK economy in terms of overseas trade,
bringing in students and fees from around the world—something
like £7.9 billion in 2009. In addition, there is this soft
power: the impact of having so many international students learning for
their degrees and then going back to their countries. Quite a number of
them end up as leaders in their own countries and still carry affection
for their alma mater, which benefits the UK in the long

view that we, as a country, are the poorer because we do not put more

am an economist, not a language specialist, and first came to be
interested in the relationship between education and growth when I
worked in the National Economic Development Office at the end of the
1970s. I came across the work that an economist called Sig Prais, whose
name some noble Lords may remember, was doing at the National Institute
of Economic and Social Research. I remember in particular a study that
he did of two engineering companies involved in machining, comparing a
German and a British company. As it happened, they both used exactly
the same type of German machinery, which had been installed at the same
time—there was no difference in the capital equipment used by
the two companies. Nevertheless, productivity in Germany was twice that
of the British firm. He wanted to know why productivity was so much
higher in the German firm so he began unpeeling, if you like, the skins
of the onion.</hs_para>

main reason why productivity in Britain was so low was that the
machinery was down for a lot of the time and not being used. Why was it
down? Because the build-up of iron filings in the machinery grew to
such an extent that the machines just gave up the ghost.
Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:19:37"></hs_TimeCode> did this not
happen in Germany? Because every Friday afternoon, the apprentices in
Germany stripped down the machines, cleaned them all up and cleaned
away all the iron filings. The machines therefore worked practically
all the time and were never
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Why did
this not happen in Britain? It was because there were no apprentices to
do the work. They used to have to call the engineer, just as you do
when the Xerox machine breaks down; and, just as when the Xerox machine
breaks down, the engineer could not always come the next day. The
machine might well be down for two days while they waited for the
engineer to come along and fix it.</hs_para>

whole, the operatives who ran the machines were sufficiently trained to
be able to repair the machines on the spot if and when they broke down.
Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:19:37"></hs_TimeCode> could we not
train British apprentices or operatives in the same way? It was
discovered that they had tried to train them but the training programme
involved an element of mathematical training. On the whole, the British
operatives had not got the basic maths to be able to cope with the
fairly elementary training programme that was required. The result was
that the British organisation, so to speak, meant that we were the
poorer for it.</hs_para>

led me to have a very considerable interest in this link between
education, productivity and economic growth. Quite clearly, these
things were very important. That was 30 to 40 years ago and since that
time we have taken on board and understood the message mentioned by the
noble Lord, Lord Baker. We have seen a series of educational
initiatives of one sort or another since then that have tried to
address that particular problem, including all the initiatives on
apprenticeships of one sort or another, which perhaps are beginning to
pay off. However, there is a very real 
<?notus-xml column=380?>question as to why, 30 to 40 years later, and knowing the importance of
it, we are still lagging in these PISA studies.</hs_para>

course, others have been moving faster than we have. Another answer is
that we should not neglect what we have achieved over that period. The
noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, spoke about the number of young people
achieving five As to Cs at GCSE; but it is not just that. We have
quadrupled the number of young people in universities; we are turning
out many more graduates than we were at that time. Something like 12%
of the age cohort went through to university; it is now 40%. There are
many achievements that we can think about.</hs_para>

realise that it takes time. Within the Sure Start initiatives we have
put a lot of emphasis, particularly in terms of trying to cope with the
issue of the gap between the advantaged and disadvantaged, on early
start and early years education. Your Lordships should remember that
those who were in Sure Start when we had the expansion of that in the
early 2000s are only just 15 now. We need to be watching the
achievement of our 15 year-olds. Back in the 1970s, the Americans had a
programme called Head Start that did precisely the same. They wrote it
off after 10 years but discovered, 25 years later, that it
had had a major influence on the young people who had benefited from
it. It takes time for these programmes to work their way
through.</hs_para>

recognise that it takes two to tango. In my preparation for this debate
I was interested to see the work from the UK Commission for Employment
and Skills. It pointed out that there is a demand as well as a supply
side. It is not just the Government funding apprenticeships and so
forth; we have to look at what industry is doing and see that there is
a demand. I am conscious of the fact that, in two respects, the UK lags
behind here. One is that industry fails fairly considerably in its
spending on research and development. The second is that, similarly,
although it spends £49 billion a year on what it claims to be
education and training, much of that goes to high flyers and a lot of
it is concerned with the wages of those concerned.</hs_para>

all, we need consistency. The noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, mentioned
that in London the message is one of success, in some senses; we have
managed to turn it round. However, if I look only at vocational
education, I see the failure of the number of initiatives we have had
over this course of time—TVEI, TOPS, WOPs, academic or
vocational GCSEs, vocational A-levels, diplomas—and a failure to
pick up, for example, on the Tomlinson report. I congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Baker, on UTCs, which are a very good answer to this. At
long last, we have achieved something there. Nevertheless, there has
been total inconsistency. On teacher training, the noble Baroness, Lady
Donaghy, mentioned how important the quality of teaching is. Yet what
have we done? We have turned the whole thing upside down, just when we
were beginning to achieve something.</hs_para>

made by my noble friend Lord Storey that there should be consistency.
As the noble Lord, Lord Nash, mentioned on Tuesday, we 
<?notus-xml column=381?>should stop throwing stones at each other. There is political consensus
on what we want to achieve. We ought also to try to create political
consensus on how we achieve this and commit ourselves to pursuing a

to make from my experience. The best thing would be to start at the
day, 75 years ago, when I ran from my school, Todds Nook in Newcastle,
with a piece of paper in my hand. I said to mum and dad,
“Mam—I have passed the exam”. I was in an
elementary school and this was an exam to get into a secondary school.
Dad laughed and mam cried. In those days, dad was on the dole from 1930
to 1939, when the war broke out; they knew that it was impossible for
me not to leave school at 14.</hs_para>

to go to a technical school—Atkinson Road Technical—and I
passed that; but there was no way of going. When
I left school at 14, as most people did, I took any job that I could
and made my way in life. One of the things that has always niggled me
is that many people earn the right by their own abilities to make
progress but are denied being able to make that
progress as a result of their economic circumstances. Does the Minister
have any statistics that would help me to understand the difference
between 1934-35 and 2013? The question really is whether there is any

Hanworth (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by expressing my dismay
at the obtuseness of many of the analyses that attempt to quantify the
economic benefits of increased expenditure on our education. Such
studies are well represented in the literature, emanating from the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. They are typically cast
in the form of economic cost/benefit analyses. The costs are
expenditures, both public and private, that are entailed in seeing an
individual through the ultimate stages of their education. The benefits
are in the form of a discounted flow of cash representing the present
value of the individual’s enhanced lifetime earnings. The
balance is termed a net lifetime benefit, and the sum of individual
benefits, aggregated over the set of people in question, is deemed to
be the net economic benefit. There is an implicit suggestion here that
the per capita net benefit thus derived is a meaningful measure of the
returns to be expected from a marginal increase in the expenditure on a
particular form of education. It is suggested that this should provide
the appropriate guidance for governmental educational
policies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:41:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000231">We
should, of course, expect much more from education than the individual
financial rewards that it might generate. The economic benefits of an
educated working population surely extend far beyond the realm of
personal finances. This is notwithstanding the fact that, in economic
accountancy, it is deemed to be appropriate to measure all benefits in
terms of the eventual increases in the incomes of
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000232"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>We
also have to contend with what economists describe as the problem of
externalities; economic benefits and the other effects of the education
of individuals accrue not only to themselves but also to others. The
problem of externalities is commonly known as the fallacy of
composition. The fallacy arises when the whole of something cannot be
identified with the sum of its
parts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000233">There
is another more fundamental methodological criticism that I should like
to aim at the studies that I have mentioned. The studies that purport
to account 
<?notus-xml column=385?>for the levels of personal or national income commonly employ regression
analyses. These attribute the value of a dependent variable, which is
income in these cases, to a linear combination of various measurable
factors, which are weighted by numerical coefficients. There is an
unspoken assumption that these factors are amenable to independent
variation, achieved perhaps by the intercession of some governmental
policy. Thus, for example, it is asserted in one of the documents of
the Department of Business Innovation and Skills,
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13120564000625" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000625">“a

is an instance of what is described in philosophical jargon as a
counterfactual conditional. It is a statement that asserts that if
realities were other than what they actually are, then such-and-such a
consequence would ensue. The difficulty here is in the need to invent a
plausible alternative reality. The alternative reality would comprise
not only the 16% increase in the numbers of graduates; there would be
many other accompanying circumstances. There could plausibly be an
increase in the unemployment of the graduates, which might lead them to
commit crimes. If this speculation sounds silly, it is no sillier than
the original
proposition.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120564000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000234">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>
are many other instances that could be cited of spurious quantification
expressed in quasi-mathematical language. They are certain to bamboozle
many readers who lack the confidence to gainsay them. An example of
dubious quantification that is dominating the current debate on
educational policy is the list of the so-called PISA rankings on
national educational achievements that has been published by the OECD
in recent days. The Education Secretary, Michael Gove, has been using
these rankings to berate his predecessors and his critics. On closer
examination, the PISA methodology appears to be seriously flawed.
However, a cursory glance at the rankings indicates that they are, to a
significant extent, inversely correlated with the degrees of inequality
in the countries
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000235">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:44:31"></hs_TimeCode>
this is not the way to guide and to evaluate our educational policies,
then what other methods should we pursue? I propose that we should take
a narrative approach, which should be informed by a detailed knowledge
of past and present circumstances. This would dwell on past successes
and failures. We should allow ourselves some modest
self-congratulation, but the principal aim should be that of avoiding
the pitfalls already encountered and of overcoming the enduring
failures. This is far too big a task to attempt in a brief speech, but
I can at least talk briefly of some of my own
perceptions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000236">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>
believe that we must go back at least to the Butler Education Act of
1944 in order to explain the current status of education in Britain.
The Butler Act proposed three different types of secondary school:
grammar schools, secondary technical schools and secondary modern
schools. The technical schools were intended to foster the scientific
and technical education that would sustain our industries, thereby
enhancing our economic growth. However, they never materialised. This
was partly on account of a lack of resources and a lack of teachers who
had skills in the relevant areas. 
<?notus-xml column=386?>The technical schools were also opposed by some trade unionists who felt
that they would encroach on the apprentice
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000237">Within<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:45:56"></hs_TimeCode>
this tripartite system, there was an order of merit. Grammar schools,
which were to have an academic orientation, would take the brightest of
the students; secondary technical schools were to take those of
middling ability; and secondary modern schools were to take those who
by and large were destined for menial industrial labour. As it
transpired, there was no provision in the middle ground for training
that was both academic and technical. The legacy of that deficiency has
endured to this day. In particular, we have no meaningful system of
technical apprenticeships. We seem nowadays to be intent on
using a revived system of apprenticeships mainly to obtain placements
for young people who might otherwise be unemployed. The reaction of the
Labour Party to the socially divisive system of grammar and secondary
modern schools was to create comprehensive schools to cater to all
students together. However, the comprehensive schools have never
satisfied the need for a technical
education,</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000238" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000238">The
philosophy of outsourcing that has been adopted by many British
companies has led them to regard technical skills as commodities that
can be purchased on the open market. They have failed to train and
nurture people with the skills that they depend upon, and consequently
in many cases the firms have rendered themselves technically
incompetent. The problem was well illustrated in a speech of the noble

this juncture, I remark that British culture has fostered some
decidedly anti-intellectual sentiments. In certain quarters there has
been contempt for teachers. There are echoes of such contempt in the
pronouncements of the current Secretary of State for Education. Michael
Gove has threatened a more rigorous system of school inspections that
will weed out incompetent and underperforming teachers. He has also
proposed to give head teachers and school governors arbitrary and
unbridled powers to determine the remuneration of their staff. It seems
that the visitations of the Ofsted inspection regime are to be
redoubled at a time when teachers are liable to be afflicted by a
plethora of governmental educational initiatives. It is such
interference by successive Governments and the derogation of the
teachers’ skills that has been responsible for many of the
problems in the educational
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000240">People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:48:16"></hs_TimeCode>

others have mentioned, it is particularly important that we get parents
involved. We have to break the cycle of parents who have themselves not
got a lot out of education being unable to engage in the system and
therefore their children being significantly disadvantaged. Everyone
who has been involved in education, at whatever level, knows that when
you have parental involvement, you have better behaviour and
achievement and everyone finds life an awful lot easier. Incidentally,
that is one reason why I have favoured home-school contracts for many
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000246">It is
important to get parents involved in another respect. In education
debates we hear a lot about providing opportunity, which is right, but
we face one difficulty that no Government have been able to overcome:
motivating the non-aspirational. We sometimes talk as if it is a clear
choice that individuals sit down to make: “I will be
aspirational” or, “I will not bother taking that
opportunity”. We need to understand the fears that can inhibit
people’s aspirations: the fear of entering an unknown world, the
fear of moving away from the security of their family and friends. I
think back to some of those films made in the 1960s, where young
students from the north were going down to universities in the south
and being dislocated from their families. That fear and feeling of,
“It’s not for us”, is still very much there in
many areas, and we must find new ways to tackle
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:53:23"></hs_TimeCode>. What my

article in the <I>Telegraph</I> today shows that some towns and cities
have nine out of 10 residents with high qualifications but some towns
have only four out of 10 with the same qualifications. I cannot believe
that that reflects an innate ability in one place but not 
<?notus-xml column=388?>in another; I think that it is to do with aspirations, motivations and
confidence. Until we find out how we can crack that one, we will have
real difficulties because we are dealing with people whose expectations

echoing what has been said so far, we must value teachers and head
teachers and provide them with the training, support and mentoring that
they need. Mention has been made of Finland. I am not sure that that is
the complete answer, but we should value and respect teachers not just
by words; we need action as well. By action, I mean inaction
on occasion, because the Government should not overprescribe
what teachers should be doing. I think that nearly everyone agrees that
we need a national curriculum, but that means different things to
different people. I recall, as I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Baker,
does, discussion about what a Secretary of State should recommend as
the 10 books that all children should read. I was shadow Secretary of
State at the time, and it was very tempting to name your 10
books, but Secretaries of State should resist that temptation—it
is not their job to do more than have a prescriptive

I want to mention examinations. We have to ask the basic question: what
is the purpose of the testing? Is it to assess and assist the
child’s progress; is it to look at the added value that that
school is providing; or are we creating hurdles and just using tests
for league tables? I draw the Minister’s attention to what the
Chief Scientific Officer said yesterday: that the risk in education is
always that exams are the tail that wags the whole education

briefly, I am surprised that no one other than the OU graduate, my
noble friend Lord Graham, has mentioned the Open University. It teaches
us many things. It shows that many people who did not succeed on the
conventional path can succeed later. The majority of its students do
not have qualifications for conventional universities. It can also
teach us different teaching methods. I am pleased that the
vice-chancellor is with the Prime Minister in China, because there is a
lot of scope there. The Open University is showing how, through its
FutureLearn programme, new techniques can be used to teach people but
also to draw them into education by giving them taster courses, not
least those based on the BBC programme, “The Frozen
Planet”, which encourage them to take up a theme, do courses and
get into education. We must look at new ways to get people into

is a great pleasure to speak in this debate introduced by my noble

I fear, seems a bygone era. It has also been a very good debate. It is
a 
<?notus-xml column=389?>great privilege to hear the noble Lord, Lord Baker, speak. In Cumbria,
we are very excited by the creation of one of his university technical
colleges. It was also a great privilege to listen to the maiden
speeches by the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans, and
particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Sherbourne of Didsbury. Although
we have been on opposite sides of the political fence, he has made a
distinguished contribution to public service in his lifetime. I share

also heard an excellent veteran speech by my noble friend Lord Graham

want to make four propositions in this debate. First, education has
contributed to economic growth, is contributing and has the potential
to contribute much more. Having heard a little of what my noble friend
Lord Hanworth said, I hesitate to talk statistics, but I looked to the
excellent authority of David Willetts, who has written a very good
pamphlet called <I>Robb</I><I>i</I><I>ns Revisited</I>. He argues in
that that 20% of UK economic growth in the past quarter-century has
resulted from the increase in graduate-level skills, and that a third
of the increase in UK labour productivity in the decade before the
financial crisis was due to the growing number with university degrees.
Economic growth is not the only benefit that better education brings.
He cites research that says that people who are well educated are more
likely to be members of a voluntary organisation; likely to be more
tolerant; less likely to suffer depression; less likely to drink a
lot—I am not sure about that; less likely to smoke; less
susceptible to criminal activity; and more likely to live longer. Those
are all good
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:00:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000255">He
also cites evidence that education leads to less cost in public
spending. Indeed, the net lifetime benefit to the Exchequer of getting
someone through university successfully is, according to David
Willetts, £260,000 to the Exchequer for a man and
£315,000 for a woman. Perhaps the Minister can explain why, in
the light of this compelling logic, today the Chancellor has announced
cuts in public spending that affect the Department for Education and
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, and prevent those
economic potential gains being
realised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:01:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0001.htm#13120564000256">The
second argument I will make is that we have in Britain a huge problem
of two nations in education, which we have to overcome. That is what
the recent PISA studies show. We have, on the one hand, a combination
of great academic standards, wonderful universities and world-leading
research, and, on the other, average standards that are too low and
regional divides between success in London and failure in northern
cities. We have huge deficits in vocational qualifications and skills
that Governments have failed to tackle over decades. We have a
deplorable position of leadership in Europe on the question of
NEETs—young people not in education, work or training of any
kind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:02:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

should play politics about this. This is a huge national problem. I do
say, however, that, in response to the PISA studies this week, I
thought the Secretary of State for Education—for whom I have
respect because he is a man with genuine commitment to equal
opportunity—demeaned himself by trying to turn the PISA results
into an attack on Labour’s record in office in those years.
Labour inherited an education system that was in crisis in 1997. Yes,
we got some things wrong. We had perhaps too many targets and perhaps
the wrong targets. Perhaps getting rid of languages as a requirement in
2004 was a mistake. All Governments get things wrong. What we got
right, however, was a 74% increase in spending per student below
university level in those Labour years and an increase in higher
education spending per student of 38%. Let us not play politics with
education. Let us recognise that we have these underlying
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:04:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000258">My
fear about the present coalition’s policy is that, although
there are aspects of it that are very attractive, the problem of the
two nations may be made worse. I will give a few examples.
One of the good ideas in the coalition policy is the pupil
premium. When you look, however, at what is happening in teaching,
autonomy in schools should not become an excuse
for hiring loads of unqualified teachers. That will not
improve the quality of teaching; nor should the proposals to
reform the system of teacher education be rushed. The Government are
right to want a lot more apprentices. Yes, there is a need for more
apprenticeships, and the previous Government, I think, got things wrong
on Train to Gain. I am quite willing to admit that. However, I looked
at a recent report from the Boston Consulting Group—this is not
a Labour think tank, this is the Boston Consulting Group—said
that, of the 240,000 new apprenticeships created in the past two years,
58% were low-level and 75% went to people over the age of 25
who were already in work. It looks to me as though this is not a
dramatic breakthrough in skills education but another form of employer
wage subsidy. We have progress to make on
apprenticeships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:06:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000259">That
is also the case in higher education. My noble friend Lady Warwick
talked about the decline in part-time students and mature students,
which is a great shame. The noble Lord, Lord Paul, mentioned how
migration policies threaten the future of our universities. I think the
Government may have the wrong priorities. For instance, I am sure that,
in the other place today, there will be a lot of applause for the
married couple’s allowance and the universal free school meals.
Would it not, if you were seriously interested in educational
opportunity and that was your principal
objective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:07:09"></hs_TimeCode>, have
been better to spend that money on children’s centres and early

education policy needs a rethink, on a cross-party basis, to try to
establish consensus. We need to make institutional changes to our
education system that will withstand changes of Government.
We need to make systemic change to raise quality, not just fiddle
around at the edges. We need to raise the status, as Labour attempted,
of the teaching profession. We need a new system of post-16 funding. I
think the Labour Government experimented with an individual 
<?notus-xml column=391?>learning account and it went wrong, but we need something like that. We

Young people with university degrees have double the earning capacity

Lady Morgan, spoke about the underachievement “tail” of
particularly poor children. We all know that many of our children are
brought up in chaotic home lives with no systems, no structures and a
background of generational worklessness. As I think noble Lords know,
and I think there is consensus on this across the House, the only way
in which we can break this cycle is through education. The tail is why
we are changing the basic accounting measure for schools from a rather
simplistic five A* to C grades, including English and maths, to a
progress measure across eight subjects so that all pupils, whether they
come to school performing poorly or highly, are measured on the

referred to the success of our university system. Looking across
developed economies, a study by the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research shows that countries that increased their share of
graduates in the workforce saw labour productivity grow faster, as the
noble Lord, Lord Liddle, referred to. In the UK, we estimate that
roughly one-third of the increase in labour productivity between 1994
and 2005 was attributable to the accumulation of graduate skills in the
labour force. In other words, a substantial share of the UK’s

all the deliverability and realism of a letter to Santa Claus. Such is
its credibility that if it were put forward on “Dragons’

such a Government try to engineer a losing confidence vote to stop the

especially if the bulk of the Scottish electorate favoured staying in
the EU in 2017, would say that the September 2014 deal is off. They
voted then to remain part of a country with full EU membership and
unfettered access to its single market. Could a UK Government deny
Scotland another Edinburgh agreement and another referendum in, say,
2020? Alongside the upheaval and uncertainty of hauling ourselves out

whatever it is. The current mood in Scotland thrives on the emphasis of
discordance. This is very unfortunate. Breaking is always easier than
building, but the Scottish Government paper’s 18
months to achieve a settlement, as most other Peers have mentioned,
looks a particularly unrealistic proposal. However, it is only one of

aim as set out is to achieve by March 2016 a seamless transition into
membership. The SNP says that the treaty base appropriate to the
exercise is Article 48 of the treaty. That is not the view of the EU
institutions or that of any of the member states that have so far
spoken. I doubt if it is the view of HMG, although I will be interested
to hear what the Minister has to say. Most people seem to believe that
Article 49 would be the treaty base for the negotiation. They are
clearly “all out of step but oor Wullie”. However,
wishing it so cannot make it so. There will be a genuine negotiation to
be had under Article 49. That cannot formally start until Scotland is
an independent sovereign state. It could possibly be pre-negotiated;
that would be possible if all member states were to agree that there
could be pre-negotiation both of the substance of the deal and of
transitional arrangements, which would follow during the inevitable
hiatus after Scotland, as a sovereign state, could sign the
treaty—some date after March 2016—and during the process,
which might be many months, possibly more than a year, of ratification
by all the other member states, because it is their treaty, too. It is
possible that you could pre-negotiate both the substance and the
transition. However, that would not be easy, and would require every
member state to agree that they were prepared to do it. Judging by some
statements that have been made, some member states might not want
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000343">The
negotiations on substance would be serious. The text says that Scotland
does not wish to apply to join Schengen. However, the treaty says that
all applicants must undertake that they will join Schengen. It is
perfectly possible to envisage a derogation for Scotland; no one would
want a real physical frontier on the Tweed. However, that derogation
would have to be negotiated. You cannot just assert that “We
will not apply, therefore it will not apply to us”. The same
applies to the euro. I do not believe that if Scotland had
opted—and the remainder of the United Kingdom had
agreed—to continue to use sterling, Scotland would be obliged to
join the euro. In any case, Scotland would not be eligible, such would
be its inherited debt and deficit. However, the treaty says that you
take a commitment to join when you are eligible, and getting a
derogation on that would have to be negotiated.</hs_para>

delightfully of all, the big book says that the budget rebate would
continue. It also says that Scotland would be one of the richest
countries in the world. The continuation of the rebate would play
extremely well in Lesmahagow or in Linlithgow, but not necessarily as
well in less rich Latvia or Lithuania, and it would be up to
the Latvians and the Lithuanians to decide. I am not clear
about a lot of things in the big book but it seems certain
that if and when an independent Scotland achieved membership of the
European Union—and I believe that it would—all Scots
would be paying more into the EU budget per capita than would all
English, Welsh or Northern Irish. It also seems absolutely clear that
you cannot achieve, by March 2016, the seamless transition which is so

of the kind to which the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, was
referring. It prospered for 150 years. Scots have frequently lived,
worked and produced their offspring far from home. Today, a great many

independence. That could result in a change of government at
Westminster, less than a year after the start of a five-year

Scotland. One scenario is being outlined with the trappings of a new
state, and one argument is being presented by those who want an
independent state for Scotland. It is for those who believe in that
course of action to defend it, and it is quite right that those
proposals are scrutinised forensically and robustly. I would rather
wish to debate a positive future for Scotland and its role with the
United Kingdom. With long-term sustainable, equitable funding for
Scottish services, we can deliver educational attainment that is the
best not only in these islands but in Europe. We could see child
poverty abolished in that girl’s lifetime, and we could see her
contribution match, perhaps, some of the historic contributions that
Scots have made in the past. It means that the United Kingdom has to be
fit for that purpose, and so far the United Kingdom is not fit for that

not have revenue powers that are commensurate with its legislative

United Kingdom is much more than the sum of its individual parts, and

debate; indeed, I think most other contributors to the debate said the
same. I have noted that request, and will ensure that it is conveyed

noble friend chose a debate specifically on the date, because I think
he had to put his application into a ballot before the White Paper had
been published. It may be worth reflecting on the fact that the date
may be about the only thing in the White Paper that had not previously
been in the public domain—and even that was leaked about two
days before publication. We had already been told that the date would
be in March 2016, so I suspect the only new information was the
specific date of 24<Sup> </Sup>March, which I think is the anniversary
of the death of Queen Elizabeth I, and therefore of the union of the
Crowns. Indeed, as my noble friend the Duke of Montrose reminded us
when he talked about the Earl of Seafield and the end of the auld sang,
it is also the date on which the previous Scottish Parliament last sat.
However, I rather suspect that that was an ex post facto justification
that some people gave for that date, rather than stating the reason
that, as my noble friend pointed out, it will be the start of the 2016
Scottish election campaign.</hs_para>

even if Scotland were—heaven forbid—to vote yes, actually

paved the way to the referendum on devolution. However, there is a
world of difference between a White Paper produced by a Government,
which reflected a constitutional convention that had met in public over
many years and had achieved a consensus, and a White Paper that is the
product of a single party behind closed doors, and is
dependent not just on the Government of the rest of the United Kingdom,
but on other member states of the European Union, members of
NATO and numerous other countries. It is important to make the point
that this White Paper has no guarantee of delivery. It is, as the noble

so strong on

analysis paper, which the Government produced in February, examined the
constitutional position. We did so on the basis of advice from
Professor James Crawford of Cambridge University and Professor Boyle of
Edinburgh University—two outstanding experts in the field. Their
analysis—one which represents the view of the United Kingdom
Government—is that the rest of the United Kingdom would be a
continuing state, with all the rights and responsibilities such as
permanent membership of the Security Council of the United Nations and
membership of the European Union on the terms that have been
negotiated, and Scotland would be a new

sometimes seems rather odd to me that a party that aspires to
independence finds it awkward to admit that it wants to be a new state.
I thought that was the whole purpose. Scotland would be a new state,
and it would have to enter into a whole series of different
negotiations, including seeking membership of NATO and the European
Union. If I may pick up another point, it was certainly rather a novel
approach—perhaps this is one of the other things in the White
Paper that we had not quite anticipated—to refer to Article 48
of the TFEU. The view of the United Kingdom
Government—again, this was set out in the first paper of the
Scotland analysis series—is that Article 49 would represent the
appropriate way forward. We can have a debate as to whether Scotland
would have to come out to go back in, or whether there would be a
possibility, following a yes vote, of negotiations taking place during
that period. However, the important point, which was reflected in the
speeches by my noble friend Lord Forsyth and the noble Lord, Lord Kerr,
is that there would have to be negotiations—and we cannot
predict with any certainty what would be in those negotiations. The
only thing that is certain is the

made about Schengen, about membership of the euro and about the rebate.
Approaching this from the perspective of Croatia or Bulgaria, we would
be talking about giving a rebate to a country that the First Minister
has said would be the eighth wealthiest in the world. I also
think that there is a misunderstanding on the part of the Scottish
Government as to the nature of the rebate. They have said, “As
the budget has been set for the European Union for 2014-20, we will
decide between Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom how the
rebate is split up”. I know that there are people in this House
who are much more knowledgeable about this matter than me but my
understanding is that it is not a constant, annual lump sum that can be
divvied up or shared; it is a function of the United Kingdom’s
respective shares in the EU economy and receipts. Any change in the
size of the United Kingdom, for example as a result of independence,
would automatically be reflected in the rebate calculation. Therefore,
there would not be a Scottish share of the UK rebate to be handed over.
There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of the
Scottish Government in their White Paper as to what they are talking
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000376" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000376">As
regards currency, my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the

Brown. I think it also has been said by the Shadow Chancellor.

which few states of similar size to Scotland can match. In addition,
there is the important defence industry in Scotland. On the idea of
joint procurement, as far as I am aware, since the Second World War, no

that we look to the future. We should do so and record the strengths of
our United Kingdom; namely, those of family and kinship, which were
mentioned by my noble friends Lord Cormack and Lord Crickhowell. We
should also look at what has been achieved over many years.</hs_para>

ago, I set out our long-term economic plan in the emergency Budget.
That plan restored stability in a fiscal crisis, but it was also
designed to address the deep-seated problems of unsustainable spending,
uncompetitive taxes and unreformed public services for which there are
no quick fixes. Over the last three years we have stuck to our guns and
worked through the plan. We have done so in the face of a sovereign
debt crisis abroad, and at home in the face of opposition from those
who got Britain into this mess in the first place and have resisted
every cut, every reform and every effort to get us out of that mess. We
have held our nerve while those who predicted there would be no growth

comprehensively
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000388" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000388">Thanks
to the sacrifice and endeavour of the British people, I can today
report the hard evidence that shows our economic plan is working, but I
also report the hard truth that the job is not yet done. Yes, the
deficit is down, but it is still far too high, and today we take more
difficult decisions. Yes, the forecasts show that growth is up, but the
same forecasts show growth in productivity is still too low, and today
we set out further economic reforms. Yes, jobs are up and unemployment
is down, but too many of our young people lack the skills to fill those
jobs and the opportunities to acquire them, so now we take bold steps
to remove that cap on aspiration. Yes, businesses are expanding, but
business taxes are still too high and exports are too low and we must
address that. And yes, real household disposable income is rising, but
the effects of the financial crash on family budgets and the cost of
living are still being felt. So where we can afford to help
hard-working families, we will continue to do so. The hard work of the
British people is paying off, and we will not squander their efforts.
We will secure the economy for the long term, and this Statement sets
out how.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000389" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000389">Let
me turn to the report from the Office for Budget Responsibility. Again,
I thank Robert Chote and his team for their rigorous and independent
work. The OBR report notes that the Office for National Statistics has
reassessed the depth of the great recession. The fall in GDP from peak
to trough between 2008 and 2009 was not 6.3% as previously thought, but
was instead an even more staggering 7.2%; £112 billion was wiped
off our economy—about £3,000 for every household in this
country—in one of the sharpest falls in the national income of
any economy in the world. That is a reminder of the economic calamity
that befell Britain and of the simple fact that our country remains
poorer as a result of it. A lot of work still remains to be done to put
that right. The data revisions also showed something else: there was no
double-dip
recession.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000390" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000390">Let
me turn to the future. At the time of the Budget in March, the OBR
forecast that growth this year would be 0.6%. Today, it more than
doubles that forecast and the estimate for growth will be 1.4%. Next
year, instead of growth of 1.8%, it is now forecasting 2.4%. Faster
growth now means that it has revised the following four years to 2.2%,
2.6%, 2.7% and 2.7%, so growth over the forecast period is
significantly up. It is still not as strong as we would like it to be,
but this is 
<?notus-xml column=415?>the largest improvement to current year economic forecasts at any Budget
or autumn Statement for 14 years. I can report that Britain
is currently growing faster than any other major advanced economy:
faster than France, which is contracting; faster than Germany; and
faster even than America. That contrast itself points to the
risks that remain for the UK from abroad, and the weakness of many of
our main trading
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000391" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000391">The
first risk the OBR identified to our economic recovery is a recurrence
of the damaging instability in the eurozone. Even with the relative
calm of recent months, the OBR still forecasts that the euro area as a
whole will shrink by 0.4% this year. Its growth forecasts for the US
and emerging markets have also been revised down, and world trade has
been weaker than it expected in March. While our exports are growing,
they are not growing as fast as we would like. That is because we are
too dependent on markets in Europe and North America. The Prime
Minister’s visit to China this week is the latest step in the
Government’s determined plan to increase British exports to the
faster growing emerging markets, something our country should have done
many years ago. Today, I am doubling to £50 billion the export
finance capacity available to support British businesses, expanding the
help available to firms in these emerging markets and ensuring that our
excellent new Trade Minister, Lord Livingston, has all the firepower he
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000392" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000392">Let me
turn to the forecast for employment. Today in Britain, employment is at
an all-time high and the OBR has revised up its forecast for the
future. It was expecting jobs to stay flat over the year, but it now
expects the total number of jobs to rise by 400,000 this year. This is
being felt right across the country. Since 2010, the number of jobs in
Carlisle and on the Wirral, and from Selby to south Tyneside, have all
grown faster than in London. Meanwhile, the number of people claiming
unemployment benefit has fallen by more than 200,000 in the past six
months—the largest such fall for 16 years. Unemployment is also
lower than in 2010, and is forecast to fall further from 7.6% this year
to 7% in 2015, before falling even further to 5.6% by 2018. We have the
lowest proportion of workless households for 17
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000393" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000393">There
were those who said it was a ‘fantasy’ to believe that
businesses could create jobs more quickly than the public sector would
have to lose them. What they should have said was that it would be
fantastic if it happened. So I have good news for them. Businesses have
already created three jobs for every one lost in the public sector, and
the OBR report today forecasts that this will continue, with 3.1
million more jobs being created by businesses by 2019, which, in its
words, ‘more than offsets’ the million or so reduction in
the public sector headcount. Far from the mass unemployment predicted,
we have a record number of people in work, hundreds of thousands fewer
on welfare, and unemployment lower than when we came to office, and we
will have 2 million more jobs than in 2010—an economic plan that
is working and a Government who are seeking a job-rich recovery for
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000394" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000394">Let me
turn now to the forecasts for government borrowing and debt. When this
Government came into office, the deficit was 11% of GDP. That was the 
<?notus-xml column=416?>highest level in our peacetime history. One pound in every four was
being borrowed, and a former Chancellor and a former Prime Minister
have now joined the consensus that spending was too high. The borrowing
posed a huge risk to the economic stability and credibility of the
United Kingdom, and we have taken many difficult decisions to bring
that deficit down—every one contested and
opposed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000395" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000395">I can
report today, however, that the effort is paying off. The OBR uses a
measure of what it calls ‘underlying public sector net
borrowing’, which excludes the impact of the Royal Mail pension
scheme and asset purchase facility transfers. I can tell the House that
this underlying measure of the deficit, like the other deficit measure,
has been revised down substantially since March. From the 11% back in
2010, the underlying deficit now falls to 6.8% this year, instead of
the 7.5% the OBR forecast back in March. It then falls to 5.6% next
year, then 4.4%, 2.7% and, in 2017-18, 1.2%. By 2018-19, on this
measure, the OBR does not expect a deficit at all. Instead, it expects
Britain to run a small surplus. These numbers mean that the Government
will meet their fiscal mandate to bring the structural current budget
into balance and meet it one year
early.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000396" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000396">Let me
turn to the forecasts for cash borrowing on this same underlying basis.
At the autumn Statement last year, there were repeated predictions that
borrowing would go up. Instead, borrowing is down—and down
significantly more than was forecast. In their last year in office, the
previous Government borrowed £158 billion. This year,
we will borrow £111 billion, which is £9
billion less than was feared in March. That falls next year to
£96 billion, then down to £79 billion in 2015-16,
£51 billion the year after and £23 billion the
year after that. So we are set to borrow £73 billion less over
the period than was forecast in March. That means that we are borrowing
the equivalent of £2,500 less for every household in this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000397" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000397">In
2018-19, on this cash measure too, the OBR forecasts that the
Government will not have to borrow anything at all. Instead, we will
run a small cash surplus. Of course, this will only happen if we go on
working through our long-term plan, delivering the reductions in the
deficit we plan this year, next year and in the three years after. If
we gave up on the plan now, we would be saddled with a deficit still
among the highest in Europe, and the government side of the House is
not prepared to take that
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000398" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000398">While
the deficit remains, it adds to our national debt every year. The OBR
today expects debt this year to come in at 75.5% of GDP, which is
£18 billion lower than was forecast in March. It rises to 78.3%
next year, before peaking at 80% the next year—5% lower than
forecast at the Budget. In 2016-17, it then falls, albeit slightly, to
79.9%; then falls again to 78.4% and then to 75.9%. By 2017-18, debt is
over £80 billion lower than forecast in March. The supplementary
debt target is for debt to be falling in 2015-16. At the Budget, the
OBR forecast debt to be falling in 2017-18. It is now forecast to fall
in 2016-17, which is one year
earlier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000399" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000399">But
let me enter this note of caution. The OBR is clear that this is a
cyclical improvement. The forecast for the continuing fall in the
structural deficit has not improved. The structural deficit is the
borrowing that 
<?notus-xml column=417?>stays behind even when the economy improves. Thanks to our actions, it
has fallen from the 8.7% we inherited to 4.4% today—more than in
any other major advanced economy. It goes on falling, but no faster
than was previously expected because, as we have always argued, the
central task of reforming government and controlling spending does not
simply dissolve when growth returns. It supports the case we have made
all along that economic growth alone was never going to be enough to
repair Britain’s broken public finances. An improving economy
does not let us off the hook for taking the difficult decisions to make
sure that the Government live within their
means.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000400" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000400">The
single most important economic judgment I make today is this: we will
not let up in dealing with our country’s debts; we will not
spend the money from lower borrowing; we will not squander the
hard-earned gains of the British people. The stability and low mortgage
rates, the lower deficit and falling borrowing have been hard won by
this country, but let us be clear that they could easily be lost. That
is why we must work through our plan to secure the British economy for
the long
term.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000401" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000401">So this
autumn Statement is fiscally neutral across the period. Indeed, I can
announce today that we will take three new steps to entrench
Britain’s commitment to sound public finances. First, we will
bring forward next year an updated charter for budget responsibility
and ask Parliament to support it. I can say today that both parties of
the coalition have agreed that we must ensure that debt continues to
fall as a percentage of GDP, including using surpluses in good years,
for this purpose. In other words, this time we will fix the roof when
the sun is
shining.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000402" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000402">We
will look to see whether the five-year time horizon of the fiscal
mandate could be shorter and even more binding now that the public
finances are closer to balance, and we will see how fiscal credibility
could be further enhanced by a stronger parliamentary commitment to the
path of consolidation already agreed for 2016-17 and 2017-18. The
answers will be written into an updated charter for budget
responsibility, which will be presented to Parliament a year from now
and voted upon.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120564000403" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000403">The second step we take
today to entrench Britain’s commitment to sound public finances
is this: we will cap overall welfare spending. Welfare budgets were
completely out of control when we came to office and the number of
households where no one had ever worked nearly doubled. We have taken
very difficult decisions to bring benefit bills down; we have saved
£19 billion a year for the taxpayer. We need to maintain that
discipline. The percentage of spending in the UK subject to fixed
spending controls is very low by international standards—at just
50%. So from next year, we will introduce a new cap on total welfare
spending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000404" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000404">I
have had representations that the basic state pension should be
included within that cap, but that would mean cutting pensions for
those who have worked hard all their lives because the costs on, say,
housing benefit for young people had got out of control. That is not
fair, so we will not include the state pension, which is better
controlled over a longer period. We will 
<?notus-xml column=418?>also exclude from the cap the most cyclical of benefits for jobseekers.
All other benefits—from tax credits to income support to the
vast majority of housing benefit—will be included in the
cap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000405">At the
beginning of each Parliament, the Chancellor of the day will set the
welfare cap for the coming years, and will ask the House of Commons for
its support. If the cap is breached, the Chancellor will have to
explain why, and hold a vote in the House. The principle is clear: the
Government have a responsibility to taxpayers to control their spending
on welfare, and Parliament has a responsibility to the country to hold
the Government to account for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000406">That
brings me to our third step. Ultimately, the test of fiscal credibility
is whether you are prepared actually to make the difficult decisions
that will keep spending under control. Tight discipline means that most
departments are now living well within their set budgets. This year
they are expected to underspend by £7 billion, which is
testimony to good financial management. We can therefore be confident
in reducing the contingency reserve by £1 billion this year, and
reducing departmental budgets by a similar amount in the next two
years. That will save a further £3 billion in total. The
protections for the NHS and schools will apply, and the security and
intelligence agencies and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will
be exempt. The Barnett formula means that over the next two years, the
budgets for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales will see a net
increase. We will not apply those additional savings to local
authorities, because we expect them to freeze council tax next
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000407" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000407">This
year, Britain becomes the first G8 country to meet our promise to the
poorest in the world to spend 0.7% of our national income on
development, but we do not have to increase the budget of the
Department for International Development further in order to do that.
The effectiveness of the British Government’s aid effort in the
Philippines, matched by the generosity of the British public, is a
reminder of what marks us out as a nation, and we in this country can
be very proud of
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000408" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000408">We are
also immeasurably proud of the work of Britain’s Armed Forces.
As they wind down their operations in Afghanistan, the budget that we
spend there is also falling fast, so we can reduce the military special
reserve by a further £900 million this year while still funding
all operational costs. To reflect our society’s debt of
gratitude to our service men and women and their families, I want to
make a further £100 million of LIBOR fines available to our
brilliant military charities, and to extend that support to those who
care for the work of our police, fire and ambulance services. I think
the whole House will agree that the terrible events in Glasgow this
weekend, and the work that those services are doing right now to cope
with the adverse weather conditions, remind us how much we owe to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000409" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000409">Discipline
with the public finances means more than just words. It means making
difficult decisions, and being prepared to stick to them. It means
using surpluses in good years to keep debt falling, so that we fix that
roof when the sun is shining. It means capping welfare to keep it under
control, and, when we do 
<?notus-xml column=419?>want to spend more money, it means finding extra ways in which to pay
for it. One of the biggest single items of Government spending is the
basic state pension. I am proud to be in a Government who have
introduced a triple lock that ensures a fair and generous increase in
the state pension every year for those who have worked hard all their
lives. I can confirm that next April the state pension will rise by a
further £2.95 a week. That increase, and the other increases
that have been made under this Government, mean that pensioners will be
more than £800 better off every year. I can announce that we are
also going to offer current pensioners an opportunity to make voluntary
national insurance contributions to boost their income in retirement,
and that we will extend that opportunity to those who reach pension age
before the introduction of the single-tier pension. That will help
those who have not built up much entitlement to the additional state
pension, especially women and the
self-employed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000410" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000410">However,
we must also guarantee that the basic state pension is affordable in
the future, even as people live longer and our society grows older, and
the only way in which to do that is to ensure that the pension age
keeps pace with life expectancy. The Pensions Bill, which is currently
going through Parliament, puts in place reviews of the pension age
every five years. We have set the principle that will underpin those
reviews. We think that a fair principle is that, as now, people should
expect to spend up to a third of their adult lives in retirement. Based
on the latest life expectancy figures, applying that principle would
mean an increase in the state pension age to 68 in the mid-2030s and to
69 in the late 2040s. The exact dates will be set by the future
statutory reviews and in line with the most up-to-date demographic
data, of which the next update is published next week. This is one of
those difficult decisions that Governments have to take if they are
serious about controlling the public finances. Future taxpayers will be
saved around £500 billion. Young people will know that our
country can afford to give them a proper pension when they retire. That
is this generation fulfilling its obligations for fiscal responsibility
to the next generation, not saddling them with the debts and the
decisions we were not prepared to deal with ourselves.</hs_para>

finances also means making sure that we collect the taxes that are due.
Most wealthy people pay their taxes and make a huge contribution to
funding our public services; the latest figures show that 30% of all
income tax is paid by just 1% of taxpayers. We have given incentives to
enterprise and cut punitive tax rates, and this year the rich pay a
greater share of the nation’s income taxes than was the case in
any year under the last Labour Government. But alongside those paying
the most tax are those who try to avoid paying their fair share of tax.

tax avoidance, tax evasion, fraud and error so far this Parliament.

<?notus-xml column=420?>the abuse of dual contracts, offshore oil and gas contracting,
derivatives linked to profits and share buy-backs. And we will ensure
the tax advantages of partnerships are not abused either. We are
introducing a new, limited power that requires people to pay up front
their taxes where the scheme they used has already been struck down by

one personal tax change we make today which is not about avoidance, but
is about fairness. Britain is an open country that welcomes investment

Davies of Oldham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to
address the issues raised in the Autumn Statement in our usual
atmosphere of calmness and courtesy—a rather sharp contrast with
the wall of noise that greeted my counterpart, the shadow Chancellor,
in the other place. This is an occasion for asking questions so I am
sure that I am not going to be able to generate such excitement on the

Chancellor did not mention the concept of productivity, made no
acknowledgment of the weakness of our balance of payments position in
recent years despite the significant devaluation of the currency that
we have experienced, and showed no real appreciation of the fact that
real wages are still falling, among those who are employed. It is
therefore proper to ask the Minister whether he is assured that the
much vaunted growth figures quoted in the Statement are not based upon
a somewhat insubstantial platform. Do these figures also not reflect a
bounce back from a very low base indeed? The House will appreciate that
even if growth reaches the figures that the Chancellor quoted, with his
customary optimism, after three years of this economy flatlining,
growth by 2015 will be only half the growth that in 2010 the Chancellor
indicated to the nation that he hoped to achieve by the time that this

Minister who will respond to this Statement speaks and acts
significantly on the issues of infrastructure in the economy. Will he
comment on the fact that infrastructure output has fallen by 15% since
2010, and that so much which is promised remains unfulfilled? In 2010
the Chancellor also said that he was setting out to balance the books
by 2015. It is clear that in 2015 we shall still have a deficit of
£80 billion. That reflects the amount of borrowing that he had
to do in the lean, flatlining years when no growth occurred. Will the
Government persist in seeking to deny that we are in the middle of an
acute cost of living

moderate the level of energy prices during this winter does not cost
the cartel anything at all. It is the taxpayer who is going to meet the
deficit that will occur due to the companies charging quite so much,
and prices will still rise, going up by £70 in this period. For
an awful lot of people in the country, £70 is a very significant
sum for fuel. After all, we pay £100 to pensioners in the winter

crucial thing I want the Minister to address is the constant failure of

that the Minister is not that familiar with those people who find

people—his friends certainly have many associates among the
banks—in the banking fraternity, at the highest levels, who are
of course not feeling the pinch at all. Hedge funds, too, are not
noticeably short of returns. That is to say nothing of the growth of
high salaries right throughout British commerce and industry, while
wage levels stay stagnant. It is only accidental that some of those
groups have a profound interest in sustaining and supporting the
Conservative Party both between elections and at election time. We are

is quite clear that the Government are committed to a position. The
Chancellor waxed with some strength over the fact that there will be a
cap on welfare and very severe constraints on public expenditure, and
gave the briefest outline of what that would mean. We all know what it
means: five more long and hard years. We also know who is going to bear
the costs of those five long and hard years—those who have done

other obvious question is: if the Government are so wedded to free

the free market. I notice some excitement on the government Bench,
because they have worked out that in 2007-08 Labour was in power. That
is certainly so, but we were not in power when the Big Bang freed up
the City to create the successive market mechanism, and whenever there
were suggestions of anything to do with regulation we know on which

a bit of reality and context to the discussion about the economy.
Clearly, there was lots of good news to report and we as a nation,
across the parties, should welcome the recovery of the economy that we
have seen in recent months. Growth is up: the OBR has just restated
that the growth forecast for 2013 is up from 0.6% to 1.4%. For 2014 the
forecast has been increased from 1.8% to 2.4%. The deficit is down. As
a percentage of GDP in 2010 it was 11%; it will be 6.8% this year and
will be at a small surplus in 2018-19.</hs_para>

much of the fact that some of the original projections in 2010
envisaged those targets being reached earlier. Of course, the two
principal reasons that they were not were, first, that the depth of the
crisis in 2008-10 proved to be much, much greater, with over 7% taken
out of GDP, as we have just discovered. Secondly, the external
circumstances surrounding the economy in the past three years, in
particular the fact that the euro region was on the verge of having its
currency broken up, put a damper on the economy. To find ourselves in
this economic situation today, despite those prevailing winds, is a
testimony to the strength of this Government’s economic
strategy.</hs_para>

there was no mention of employment, which sits at record levels, with
the lowest proportion of workless households for the past 17
years and the creation of 1.4 million new private sector jobs. There
were some interesting announcements in the Autumn Statement today,
particularly around trying to help young people into those job
opportunities: namely, the scrapping of national insurance
contributions for under-21s and specific measures for Jobcentre Plus to
deal with 16 and 17 year-olds, which are addressing something
absolutely critical for the nation.</hs_para>

talk a little about real wages. Of course, the reason that people are
feeling the squeeze is the result of the significant collapse in the
economy in 2008-10, from which we are trying to recover. That is the
problem; that is why real wages fell sharply. Above-target inflation
occurred through 2011-12 because of external influences, principally
commodity prices and the oil price.</hs_para>

inflation is now slowing down. It was at 2.2% in the previous quarter.
The OBR says that we will hit our 2% target by 2016. So we see
inflation coming down and earnings recovering. 
<?notus-xml column=429?>But earnings do not tell the whole story. Total, real household
disposable incomes have increased by 3.9% since the crisis, and that
has been supported by government policy—for example, the
increase in the personal allowance to £10,000, which will be
coming through next year—as well as those strong employment
levels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000465" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000465">Of
course, the critical thing in this argument is that the only way to
improve living standards is to grow the economy. There cannot be a
cost-of-living strategy without an economic strategy. We have heard
nothing from the Opposition about an economic strategy, which is not
surprising because the one they were professing has been demonstrated
to be a complete failure. The numbers I have just gone through show
very clearly that you can have both a reduction in the deficit and a
recovery in economic growth. It was the axiom of the opposition
strategy that that just was not possible. The facts have demonstrated
that it is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000466">I
absolutely accept that there is still a lot to do. We are not at all
complacent about the situation. It was a very deep recession. We are
recovering from it effectively but still relatively slowly. Although on
an international basis we are one of the strongest performing economies
at the moment, there is still an enormous amount to do. Our deficit
level is still far too high. Of course, the level of debt created by
the accumulation of borrowing in order to finance the deficit leaves us
in an exposed and unsustainable position unless we continue to bring it
down. That is why the overall message in this Autumn Statement is the
commitment to fiscal neutrality, even though the temptation to indulge
in giveaways could, at the political level, be strong.</hs_para>

Chancellor’s discipline. Taking a grip of the long-term risks
around pension costs is absolutely the right thing to do, to match
pensions to longevity. Putting a constraint on the absolute size of the
welfare bill—the part of our spending that was most out of
control, among the many out-of-control elements of the previous
regime—so that the Chancellor will have to come back to
Parliament to be scrutinised if that significant part of our spending
gets out of whack, is a very disciplined part of the equation. We will
also continue to see a reduction in government spending at the
margin—continuing to capture the underspends that we will see
this year, which are a function of prudent financial management, but
ensuring that year after year we continue with that efficiency drive to
ensure that the state delivers its services in a reformed and efficient
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000468" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000468">The noble
Lord said that the Chancellor mentioned neither productivity nor
exports. With respect, that is not correct. He did refer to
productivity and said that it is expected to increase in 2014-15 and
2015-16 as the economy recovers, which is in the OBR independent
report, and that this will drive the cost-of-living recovery. He also
talked about exports. If one looks at the balance of the recovery, it
is consumer-led. Everybody accepts that. It is not surprising that it
is consumer-led. Consumption is by far the biggest part of the economy.
The OBR’s estimate is that business investment will recover
strongly next year and the year after. Of course, everything that the
Government are doing on the supply side of the economy is focused on
supporting that.</hs_para>

absolutely said that exports were disappointing. The reason they are
disappointing is that the markets into which we export, predominantly
the European Union and the US, have been relatively weak through the
period, which is why our efforts have been so focused on developing

Prime Minister’s recent trip to China, for example. We are

good news, certainly, as my noble friend has just said, is that the

why this has happened. There are, I think, two particular aspects.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:54:25"></hs_TimeCode> first is
that the deficit has not been cut as fast as we hoped and that
consequently, the economy has picked up a little more, because of the
effect on aggregate demand. None the less, I welcome the fact that the
Chancellor has now set out a very firm timetable for getting down not
only the underlying cyclical deficit but also the structural deficit.
This is 
<?notus-xml column=431?>something to be welcomed. Up to now, we have rejoiced in the fact that
we have cut the deficit by a third, but we are still continuing to
borrow at two-thirds of the appalling rate that we inherited from the

second reason, which gives more cause for concern, is the substantial
reduction in saving—apparently the biggest fall in saving for 40
years. People have been using their savings, which has accelerated the
growth of the economy, which may lead to concern. Given his particular
responsibility for infrastructure, does my noble friend agree that it
is absolutely crucial that we get savings up? The finance has to be
provided for the infrastructure that the Government

that context, I will ask one particular point. We seem to have got away
from financing infrastructure in the usual way: that is, by
allowing capital to be provided by whoever is launching the operation
and then working it up in the usual way. Instead of that, we have been
allowing monopolistic enterprises in particular to increase the prices
on existing consumers. That has been the way in which we have been
financing, for example, the railways and energy. Will he look
particularly at whether this is the right way to
proceed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T15:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>—because

Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for those incisive
observations. He is absolutely right to say that the deficit was
reduced in a measured fashion, which is part of the reason why the
economy has been able to recover so quickly. He is also absolutely
right that there is still a structural deficit, so we cannot simply
allow for the natural recovery through the economic cycle to take care
of our borrowing problem; we must continue to drive savings through the
system. On the fall in consumer savings, again, my noble friend is
absolutely right that it is a sign of a healthy economy to have a
strong savings rate. On consumer behaviour, it is not surprising that,
after a few years of belt-tightening, there has been a desire to begin
spending
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000479" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0002.htm#13120564000479">On the

noble friend is correct. Essentially, there are two ways to finance it:
directly from taxpayers or indirectly through the private sector and

that coalitions mean trade-offs. One of them is the married tax
allowance. It is obviously above the Minister’s pay grade to say
whether it is time to change it, but if the object is to save

on economics I must emphasise that we preface it with St Paul’s
statement: “I speak as a fool”. 
<?notus-xml column=433?>I fundamentally support the Government’s strategy of getting the
deficit down. My question is about the cap and how that is going to
operate. Somewhere in the Statement it says that 30% of tax is now
collected from 1% of taxpayers. That is a signal of how disparities of
wealth have grown in our society. It really behoves us to protect the
weakest. My worry is that I see a sort of American scenario of a cap
being introduced and benefits not being paid because the cap is there.
How will this work, when social security benefits can rise and fall
with events which nobody can control? It worries me that introducing
another cap of an absolute sort without reference to other realities
could end up almost undergirding the underclass, which I am afraid is a
developing feature of our society. Can the Minister say a bit more on

ensure that a very large part of our budget, which in the past has had
no controls around it—and no opportunity to explain what is
going on—is properly scrutinised. In the circumstances where
there is justification for changing the cap, that will be done under
the scrutiny of Parliament. The Chancellor has not introduced what the
level of the cap should be but merely an operational measure to make
sure that it is properly controlled, just as other parts of the budget
are, and indeed so that all the questions and issues around the
appropriate level of support for vulnerable members of society can be

more about the £25 billion that is supposed to be coming in for
infrastructure from the insurance companies? I do not think this has
been referred to at all in the exchange that has taken place so far on
infrastructure. How far does he think it can help in speeding up the
infrastructure work? That seems to me, as the years go by, to take
longer and longer, partly because the projects are very big. What we
really need is not just a large amount of infrastructure work propped
with finance but that it takes effect quickly rather than
slowly.</hs_para>

challenges for our infrastructure ambitions is accelerating the
delivery of the projects which we know are important but which take
time to define, to get through planning, to be organised and generally
to deliver. In a nutshell, what the Government are trying to do within
the national infrastructure plan is to work away at the constraints on
delivering this plan more effectively. Financing is one of those, which
is why we welcome the announcement from those six insurance companies.
It is an interesting example of joined-up government working, because
the Treasury negotiated successfully with the European Union on the
solvency question. That enabled the insurance companies to be
comfortable in committing to this kind of asset, because the capital

also to tax avoidance. The introduction of capital gains tax on
disposals of residential property by non-residents is to be welcomed,

from a personal point of view that the individual whom we have brought
in to manage that programme, Howard Shiplee, worked on the Olympic
Games and delivering the Olympic park, so we have got the right people
focused on getting the delivery of universal credit absolutely right.
Our current planning assumption is that universal credit will be
available in each part of Great Britain during 2016, with new claims to
the benefits that it replaces having been closed down and the majority
of the remaining caseload moving to universal credit in 2017. I do not
have the particular numbers on how much it has cost, but I will work
with DWP and provide the noble Lord with a response to that question.
On capital gains tax for non-residents, we are introducing it in the

cyclical recovery and that in order to turn that into a sustainable,
long-term recovery, we need investment—we have had a number of
discussions on that—and an improvement in productivity. The
Statement references a report, presumably prepared by the Treasury,
showing that the policy pursued by this Government and their
predecessor to reduce corporation tax has increased investment and
raised productivity. In the 
<?notus-xml column=435?>light of this, is it not strange that the Government have so
comprehensively rejected the recommendation of a report prepared by the
Economic Affairs Committee of this House and enthusiastically endorsed
by all sides in a recent debate that we take measures to ensure that
all companies pay corporation tax, particularly those international
companies which currently do not, and that UK companies using complex
and—frankly—dodgy procedures not to pay tax here should
all be required to pay tax? As a result of that, the tax rate to both
large and small companies could be substantially reduced, to the
benefit of productivity, and the Treasury would be no worse
off.</hs_para>

review that the noble Lord referred to that the Treasury did on

understanding the long-term effects of the tax cuts and demonstrating
that the increase in income that flows afterwards pays for the majority
of them. The way that we are dealing with making sure that overseas
companies pay their fair share is through the OECD and taking
leadership internationally. I think that is the only way that you can
do it. You have to be able to deal with these international companies
on a global basis, otherwise it is impossible to close them down, so
that is probably the right way to approach it. The general trend of

trust in the police is under threat. Indeed, the integrity of the
police service has been seriously shaken by high-profile scandals and
organisational failures. Some of those are historic but others are not.

police community support officers. Indeed, we pioneered the
introduction of PCSOs as a visible presence in local communities,
building confidence. That neighbourhood policing is now disappearing:
300 neighbourhood sergeants have been removed in the past two years
alone. Safer neighbourhood teams are being replaced by a more reactive,
fast-response approach. No doubt that is a more efficient use of
reduced police resources if the sole criterion of success is a speedy

very point of neighbourhood policing was to build local trust and

reassurance. That, in turn, led to public approval and reinforced
police legitimacy. That is very different from the police as an
occupying force, swooping in reactively and creating resentment through
failure to understand the communities involved. Reassurance stemming
from proactive neighbourhood policing produces an orderly community,
where people can voluntarily comply with the law. It reinforces that
that compliance is the right thing to do. Prioritising a reactive
response, as this Government do, is not sufficient. It misses out on
that essential community engagement. If that reactive response has been
the objective of government policy, it has failed. Her Majesty’s
inspectorate has reported that within the past two years the proportion
of emergency calls responded to within the target time has fallen in 20
of the forces surveyed. The Stevens commission’s survey found

the diagnosis and the potential solutions are all contained in the

that the report was published, he gave an interview on the

why the commission does not believe that police and crime commissioners

that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13120564000635" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000635">“the

course, the difficulty is that the report gives no categorical

commission’s whole approach to police and crime commissioners,
notwithstanding some of the individual problems that the noble Lord

Minister, who is now the police and crime commissioner for Greater
Manchester. He believes that the report is premature in what it says
about police and crime commissioners. I would hope that those who sat
on this commission would have recognised that it is still early days.
Looking around the Chamber, I see some of the usual suspects who voted
against police and crime commissioners when the House considered the
matter only a short time ago, so I am somewhat suspicious that it is

concerned, as are many other people in this country, at the way in
which the public generally voice their reservations about many aspects

we need to address quickly. When it was expressed to me, as a Member of
Parliament, by members of the public, I sometimes feared that that is
what precipitates the public to feel that they need to take the law
into their own hands. I am not talking about people who you might think
of as being on the other side of the law. These were people who had
kept the law all their lives and respected the police but had somehow

achieve things. In getting rid of a lot of these targets, the Home

with the noble Lord and perhaps the commission in their interpretation

has addressed both in the policies that she has bravely implemented
since she took office. What I think will be shared by the commission is
her recognition that police officers, rather like doctors, should be
professionals. She has introduced a consultation which is going on at
the moment through the College of Policing to ensure that there is a
code of ethics that police officers will abide by, while raising the
professionalism of the police force in general.</hs_para>

evidence-based report. It is heavily based on evidence, and I was
pleased to be a small part of that evidence-gathering process when I
co-chaired with the noble Baroness, Lady Harris of Richmond, seven
regional meetings held in the north-east, the north-west, Yorkshire and
Wales. I heard at first hand what local people had to say about what
works and what does not work well in relation to their local policing

is no doubt that the most contentious part of the report thus far has
been the conclusion that the governance model of police and crime
commissioners is systemically flawed as a means of democratic
accountability and should be discontinued. Predictably this has caused
dissention, particularly among the police and crime commissioners
themselves, but I have to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Browning,
that if one looks at the evidence rather than following ideology or
party dogma, the logic based on the evidence that was collected is
compelling. That point was demonstrated by my noble friend Lord Harris
of Haringey in his remarks.</hs_para>

the report for themselves so I am not going to go into the detail any
further, but the point I want to make is that it is not at force level
that ordinary people engage with policing. The focus of the public so
far as the police are concerned is on their own local area, which is
why, following the evidence, the Stevens report suggests a local model
of police accountability. So it is not true that nothing has been
suggested: the commission’s recommendation is for a local model
of police accountability, emphasising the importance of neighbourhood
policing as an essential building block in establishing public
confidence and support.</hs_para>

report suggests legislation to give local government a say in
appointing divisional police commanders, and to enable lower-tier local
authorities to retain some of the police precept of council tax, which
they could then use to commission local policing for their force. It is
also at the local, divisional level that policing priorities for the
neighbourhood need to be set by local people with councillors and the
police, and that policing plans should be drawn up. To me, that was one
of the big flaws in the police and crime commissioner model; it was a
force-level model, and I would argue with anyone for any length of time
that having one person representing a force that looks after millions
of people is not my idea of democratic accountability, but I am not
going to go there now.</hs_para>

issue of how to maintain and increase trust and confidence in the
police because I agree that that is one of the major issues. As the
report makes clear, we all need to agree on what we think the police
should be spending their time doing. I accept that there is high
policing, covering issues that must be dealt with at the national
level, and there is low policing.</hs_para>

Harris of Haringey, has emphasised, the police are not simply crime
fighters. They have a core role in improving safety and well-being
within communities, and in promoting measures to prevent harm, disorder
and crime. At national level they co-ordinate policies to protect the
public as much as possible from a range and variety of
threats.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120564000534" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000534">What
is it that makes people have confidence in the police at local level?
We need to know. Again, the evidence suggests that confidence stems
from people’s concerns about disorder, from their sense of
community cohesion and from their sense and their belief that the
police are in control of their streets. It does not stem from levels of
crime per se. Public confidence is also strengthened when the police
treat people fairly, respectfully and honestly, when they take note of
what people say and when they engage in local problem-solving alongside
local
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000535" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000535">The
report recommends a local policing commitment to provide a guaranteed
minimum level of neighbourhood policing and a police response within a
given time. It also calls for explanations if reported crime is not
investigated, regular updating for victims and fair and respectful
treatment of everyone who comes into contact with the police, be they
victims, witnesses, offenders or complainants. It is recommended that
this local policing commitment be guaranteed across the country. It
cannot be right that, as at present, in some areas policing is
delivered in partnership with local people very much along these lines,
but in another neighbouring force the public may have little or no role
or
input.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000536" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000536">There
may be 43 police forces but there is only one policing service, and I
have always believed that people are entitled to a minimum standard of
policing and of police response. That is emphasised in the report and I
heartily support it. The concept of there being only one police service
also has serious implications for police procurement. I want to say
something about this because the present procurement situation is
totally unsatisfactory: only 2% of police procurement is carried out at
national level. Why does every force need its own distinctive uniform,
its own distinctive IT system and its own models of car? This is an
area that I believe calls for decisive action at government level to
bring as much police procurement as possible under the national
procurement hub. We know that the savings could be substantial: the
report says up to £50 million. Surely this is
something we can all agree on—that where money is tight, we
squeeze margins as much as possible and spend money on officers, rather
than on having separate force uniforms and particular brands of force
cars and
equipment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000537" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000537">In
this and in other crucial areas, the role of the College of Policing
will be very influential and important. I support the creation of the
college, and I hope it will become an established and strong feature of
the policing landscape. It has a vital role to play in a number of 
<?notus-xml column=444?>areas; in particular, it has a guiding role in helping individual
officers to develop their skills, professional knowledge and expertise.
I know that the idea of the chartered police officer has caused some
disquiet in the ranks of the Police Federation but the reality is that
a police constable, by virtue of his or her role and powers, has a
unique and fundamental capacity to affect, for better or worse, the
lives of ordinary citizens. Each officer therefore owes it to us, the
public, to develop their skills and their expertise to the best of
their
abilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000538" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000538">Having
sat in a magistrates’ court for 20 years, I have seen how a
variety of administrative and behavioural errors committed by
individual police officers have resulted in the complete collapse of
cases, some potentially quite serious. It was my experience on the
bench that led me to the conclusion that the gap between the best
police officers and the worst was too wide. That is why I believe that
the College of Policing has a really significant role in the continuing
professional development of individual officers—which, again,
will boost public confidence in the police. I share with the noble
Baroness, Lady Browning, the belief that it is confidence that lies at
the heart of that strong partnership between the police and the public
which characterises British policing, and on which we need to build for
the
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/6840CE24C8FBA198B6B26B204254EFF2AE7E96F2" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

science in policing goes back many years. It was originally run by the
Home Office from regional laboratories. It then merged into a sort of
business arm of government in 2005 in order to make efficiencies and to
cut costs. However, police forces were increasingly in-sourcing
forensic services. So, by 2010, the Government decided to close the
Forensic Science Service and transfer its responsibilities to the NPIA,
the former National Policing Improvement Agency, which had been
responsible for the forensic procurement to forces until that point.
Then the NPIA was disbanded and its responsibilities were transferred
to the College of Policing, which is where it now sits within the Home
Office and where much of the work of training for in-force forensic
specialists is
undertaken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000542" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000542">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:45:55"></hs_TimeCode>
the mean time, excellent work was going on in the private sector. The
national forensic framework agreement was introduced, which categorised
services into 14 work packages open for tender to forces. This then
became the National Forensic Framework Next Generation and is intended
to run until 2016. Regional competitions are run to enable forces to
select their preferred forensic science provider, from the 13 within
the framework, following the tendering process. There 
<?notus-xml column=445?>are between two and six providers for each work package. However, the
contracts that the commercial providers will bid for are quite short
term, which I believe could cause instability, especially when forces
are trying to plan long-term. It also may mean that staff could end up
moving between suppliers and contractors. There are just so many
trained forensic scientists to go around. Indeed, a significant number
of forensic science staff have already left the service. What proposals
do the Government have to replace this loss of experience and
talent?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120564000543" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120564000543">Therefore,
we now have a service to police forces which comprises different
forensic science models. Some work is undertaken by the forces
themselves. Scientific support managers oversee the use of forensic
science in their force. They help to produce strategies for individual
cases and with the collection and securing of evidence by scenes of
crime officers et cetera. They also help with submissions to the
forensic science provider laboratories. Clearly, a huge amount of work
needs to be undertaken by forensic scientists but most of that now is
provided by the private sector, which has a responsibility to its
shareholders rather than to its customers. That is a subtle but vital
point to make when considering who the end-user of the service should

can be widely dispersed, being kept by both forces and forensic science
providers—commercial organisations. DNA databases are back in
the Home Office. The Biometrics Commissioner has responsibility for the
National DNA Database and the IDENT 1 fingerprint database. The
forensic regulator has published his codes of practice and ethics,
which provide the standards that will apply to all remaining commercial
forensic science suppliers. There is a European initiative to harmonise
forensic science across Europe, which is based on the ISO accreditation
and will include the police internal forensic services.</hs_para>

exclusively to provide a bespoke service to Home Office police forces.

of aspects of the service. There was lack of an obvious national
forensic science strategy. It was concerned that the market was not
robust enough to absorb the forensic science work being outsourced to
it. There were threats to research and development, the maintenance of
forensic archives, continuity of evidence, impartiality of forensic
interpretation and the quality and independence of that evidence. In
its most recent report, it stated that some police forensic science
laboratories had failed to achieve accreditation to the agreed ISO

expenditure on their in-house forensic science, making it very
difficult to see whether any savings had been made. Its conclusion as

short, there is instability in the market, contracts being too large

accreditation is required by the CPS in the Code for Crown Prosecutors

century does not accord and resonate with the history and strengths of
policing, and more importantly, with public expectation. That is the

a large article about the new neighbourhood bobby policing Maidstone
town centre. I featured in a small article on about page 8—a
one-inch column. It was a valuable lesson for me. Members of the public
might have a passing interest in who their chief constable is—or
nowadays who is their elected police and crime commissioner—but

political structures, and between 
<?notus-xml column=448?>police and local business. It is a truism that whichever party were in

to the end of October 2013, reported crime was up nearly 10%. Burglary,
the crime which worries people the most—having their home or
business premises broken into—was up over 25% in one year, which
is unprecedented. These rises coincide with budget cuts of £50
million, a reduction of 500 police officers and a reactive form of
policing being put in place. Anecdotally, I understand that more than
half our police services are now beginning to experience rises in crime
coming through in a similar way. You can get away with budget cuts; you
can get away with huge cuts in policing; and you can get away with
reactive policing for a while—but not for long. It is beginning

done, and what does the Independent Police Commission contribute to the
debate? First, all parties should accept that the role of policing is
broader than detecting crime: it embraces community safety and order.
Secondly, neighbourhood policing should be protected and preserved at
the heart of policing. Thirdly, one of the most vital
partnerships—as others have said—is between local
policing and local politics. Whatever organisational or accountability
structures are put in place for policing, they must not inhibit police
and local politicians sharing information, ideas, policies and the way
forward on preventing crime and promoting community safety. Fourthly,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, has said, economies of scale,
smarter procurement and innovation must start to mitigate the worst
excesses of the budget cuts.</hs_para>

for the current elected police and crime commissioners to deliver those

certainly not encouraging. My own view is that Northern Ireland and
Scotland probably provide better examples of local policing enshrined
within a national framework and I think a gradual evolution within
“Police England” and “Police Wales” will
probably be the way forward. Economies of scale, smarter procurement,
career planning and development of leaders from within and outside the
service would all be more effectively achieved within a national model
that enshrines local policing—as would dealing with organised
crime, terrorism and international policing.</hs_para>

the party politics of this; that is probably too big a move to make. At
the very least, police and crime commissioners must be relocated in a
more collegiate, more productive structure that ensures they work more
closely with the real aspects of local politics, local communities and
local business to deliver safer communities. The Independent Police
Commission is a valuable contribution to the debate.

Policing has at its heart the principle of policing by consent and,
most importantly, the independent office of constable. Officers are
held to account as individuals, answerable to the law. Any fundamental
changes to policing must ensure that this independence is maintained
and that the public understands that British policing is so much better
than fighting crime in isolation. The report suggests that the social
purpose of the police should be clearly defined. This is to be
welcomed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000025">Closely
linked to this social purpose is the concept of neighbourhood policing,
which we have heard from many noble Lords. Neighbourhood policing is
about social cohesion, prevention and public confidence. It is a
resource-intensive model that, if managed correctly in the long term,
brings with it real benefits and cost savings. Prevention is so much
better than cure, whether 
<?notus-xml column=452?>it be cases of anti-social behaviour, domestic violence or burglary.
Motorways and airfields should of course be considered as local

to the noble Lord, Lord Harris, for introducing the debate. The report
is incredibly useful. Although it is in a sense an academic exercise,
it is also a valuable contribution to our discussion of policing today.
It also contains some solutions. I pick out, for example, the concept
of chartered police 
<?notus-xml column=453?>officers. That is a very good idea. I fear that the Government’s
idea of a code of conduct does not go far enough. A code of ethics will
not do as much as a system to charter officers to ensure that if they

issue of databases is also interesting. There is a technological view
of it, but there are much bigger problems with databases. For example,

often failing to hold the police to account, and then we have panels

couple of years and see what it can achieve. It has recently been given
more funding, which means that it can employ more inspectors. It also
perhaps ought to employ fewer ex-police officers. If it were funded

out saying that the police are being brutal. This is happening here on

about the report itself. I was curious about this commission, which
said it was independent but had no statutory or parliamentary basis;
nor was it conducted under the auspices of the All-Party Policing
Group, which the noble Lord so ably chairs. I tried to read the results
with an open mind. As I read, I thought my main concern would be the
lack of female involvement in the report. Perhaps 11 women out of 39
commissioners is considered enough, but I thought it was disappointing.
As only four out of the 26 witnesses who gave evidence to this inquiry
were women, I wondered if it was truly representative. Liberty, I note,
was helpful, as it brought 50% of the women who gave evidence to the

holes this report below the plumb line, in my view, is that it fails to
live up to the basic tenet that the police are the public, and the
public are the police. I looked carefully at the appendices to see who
had inputted, and most of the written submissions were from the police
themselves. There is much academic input, as the noble Lords have
noted. Surveys of police personnel totalled more than 20,000 responses.
Along with all these inquiries, the best evidence is always live
witnesses. None were members of the public, victims or representatives
of victims’ groups. Again, they were police, politicians or
NGOs. The main vehicle used by the commission to obtain evidence from
the public was a telephone survey by YouGov of only 2,000
people—less than 10% of the number of the police in their
survey<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:24:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000042">This
mistake is easily made. On the Joint Committee on Human Rights, on

migrant children. I recognise fully the academic expertise in this
report, but, with so much evidence from the police and a few NGOs and
so little from the public, this imbalance causes me to treat any
conclusions with a considerable degree of
caution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000043">The

into focus an issue not covered by the commission: what is this
“meaningful unit” of policing for Generation Y, who live
socially networked lives and are not primarily geographically
connected, and where crimes committed via their phone or through
Facebook are perhaps more likely than crimes in their
neighbourhood? The report contains no serious engagement with
technology as a means to report crime, which is what younger
generations are going to require. Reporting a crime via an app to
British Transport Police is much safer than calling if an incident is
taking place in the train carriage in which you are
sitting.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120588000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000044">More
helpfully, the report considers the lack of ethnic diversity in the
police service. As this is such a key issue, I would have welcomed much
more comment and analysis on it, and more input from black and minority
ethnic officers, who responded in very low numbers to the survey. If
the recommendation for further involvement of the Equality and Human
Rights Commission would help matters, it should of course be taken up.
Reflecting the people whom you police should be specifically included
in any new Peelian principles, as it is essential nowadays to policing
by consent. There is urgency to this issue, as I wonder for how much
longer all-white surveillance teams, which I have seen, will not stick
out like a sore thumb. The commission does not deal with the lack of
ethnic diversity on the board of the College of Policing, which
contains no black person, or the lack of independent members. This is a
serious concern if, as the commission suggests, the college is to take
on some form of registration or regulatory

sufficient time to judge whether the new model works. The proposed

magistrates were involved in governance. That did not work and
independent members were added to authorities. Leaders of local

the models; namely, an elected chair and the indirectly elected

PCCs is that the size of constituency is a problem. That argument is
not substantiated in the report. As the introduction by the previous
Government of the London mayoral office has shown, such an office can
cut through the local government boroughs that can hamper a vision for

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000047">Finally,

foot chases, and if you are buying two pieces of technology to bolt

go?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000054">Recently,
the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, whose members pay
about £4.2 million into ACPO Ltd and have been asked to stump up
more, commissioned General Sir Nick Parker to advise on value for money
for that sum. He was not asked to look at the wider issues or allied
commercial operations of ACPO Ltd, which in 2009 generated over
£9 million from the sale of data alone. Neither does this ICP
report look into that. But there are many question marks. For instance,
ACPO Ltd Criminal Records Office merchandises data on individuals
derived from police national computer records. Its website curiously
stipulates that payments for search services go through the Hampshire
police and crime commissioner’s bank account. I am not clear
whether parallel arrangements affect other areas of activity or how
they affect PCC independence but I am
curious.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000055">The
application of the harassment Act seems to be another area where,
despite ACPO guidance, forces give an impression that they do as they
please, and there are similar queries in many other areas of ACPO and
police activity. The legality of some ACPO guidance has been queried by
the courts. It is not therefore just a question of individual
professionalism; I believe it is one of corporate integrity that we
need to concentrate on. In all this there are huge potential conflicts
of interest—commercially, professionally and in operational
self-governance at the most senior level. I do not believe that the
measures suggested in this report will overcome these. Furthermore, I
believe that trustworthy and diligent officers are afraid to speak out
because there is an utterly inadequate whistleblower facility. Such a
situation clearly cannot continue. Political courage and resolve are
needed. I therefore have several questions for the Minister, starting
with some on transparency.</hs_para>

how can we ensure that senior officers are seen to be and remain free

commercial activity, especially in the areas of procurement,
accreditation and selling data? Thirdly, is there a case for a
mandatory register of officer interests via an independent registrar
with a power to insist on divestment in appropriate circumstances?

the principles for the gathering, storage, use and merchandising of

on the other point that I have raised, can the Minister tell us whether
a fully independent ombudsman or whistleblower commissioner cannot be
set up so as to be a safe, confidential and effective conduit for
concerns? In the round, does the Minister not agree that it is high
time for a thorough, fully independent and rapid investigation into
these matters, perhaps by a senior criminal judge unconstrained by the
terms of reference? If so, it seems to me that before we go much
further with the recommendations of this report, there is some more
fundamental work to be done so as to restore confidence in a vital

differing enthusiasm for the commission’s
recommendations. The report contains 37 recommendations. Some of them
propose further work, some include options. We have already said that
we will consult widely on the recommendations made before we set out

its report, the commission referred to the dramatic changes there have
been in British society since the Royal Commission on the Police
reported just over 50 years ago in 1962, and the inevitable impact that
such major economic, social and political changes have on policing. The
commission also set out the challenges facing policing. The social
transformations, new forms of criminal activity and changing patterns
of crime, anti-social behaviour, damaged public confidence in 
<?notus-xml column=459?>the integrity of the police as a result of individual high-profile cases

commission also draws attention to some of the government reforms that
have directly affected the police. It regarded some, such as changes to
police officers’ pay and conditions, and the creation of the
College of Policing, as important and necessary. It was less
enthusiastic about others, such as elected police and crime
commissioners. The commission concluded, however, that the Government
have created a stand-off with the police service that has left officer
morale at rock
bottom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000064">On
structures, the commission concluded that few believed that 43 separate
forces were either cost-effective or adequately equipped to meet
today’s challenges, while recognising that there was no
consensus on a better alternative. Among the commission’s other
fundamental concerns was the risk of outsourcing to the private sector
key aspects of policing in an ad hoc and unprincipled manner, and the
danger of the police service retreating to a discredited model of
reactive policing, with neighbourhood policing responsive to the
concerns of local communities being
threatened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000065">The
commission concluded that the Government had made the wrong calls in
areas where they have acted over police purpose and governance, while
not addressing key issues, such as police standards, misconduct and
structures, where reform was required. The commission has set out its
vision of how to deliver fair and effective policing, taking into
account the fact that there is unlikely to be more money to spend on
the police service. This is a vision of a police service with a social
purpose that combines catching offenders with work to prevent crime,
and the promotion and maintaining of order with the local policing area
as the core unit and building block of fair and effective

safe and decent society, our police are of crucial importance. Having
seen some of the realities of police work at first hand, I certainly
have great respect for police officers, including those who have to
deal with situations that very few of us would wish to have to

modern society. It was out of touch with the public it served and was
out of shape. The tough fiscal climate demanded better ways of working.
My noble friend Lord Wasserman touched on several problems with BME and
female representation, as did my noble friend Lady Berridge. To put
that right we scrapped targets, restoring officers’
ability to use their professional judgment on how to fight
crime. We gave people a real say over policing by
introducing directly elected police and crime commissioners.
We empowered local communities to hold policing
to account through crime maps via the police.uk website. A more
independent Inspectorate of Constabulary shines a stronger light on
police performance. We are improving policing skills and
professionalism through the College of Policing and we are reforming
pay and conditions. We have established the National Crime Agency,
which builds on and improves on SOCA, which the party opposite created
to lead the fight against serious and organised crime. The noble Lord,

introduce a national register of officers struck off from the police;
it is consulting on a draft code of ethics that will be issued in the

police make a wider positive social impact—not the other way
around. Neighbourhood policing is not under threat, as was suggested by
the noble Lord, Lord Harris. The Government have no policy against
neighbourhood policing; that is a matter for the PCC and the chief
constable. The proportion of officers in front-line functions has
increased under this Government, from 88.9% in March 2010 to 90.6% in

local authorities and a new force-level policing board, each with
overlapping responsibilities. This takes power away from the people and
puts it back in the hands of committees. Furthermore, as you take

Kent’s crime statistics. HMIC’s findings led to a review

or two comments in response to the debate. From time to time, there was

Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, I have to say that anyone who thinks that

that your Lordships do not feel that you are being preached at today,

good.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000123">The
first question is the most essential: what is our vision for banking?
We—not only the commission but legislators, regulators, bankers
and society at large—have been tasked to find a
once-in-a-generation leap of imagination that does not simply attempt
to repair what was destroyed in 2008 but to replace it with 
<?notus-xml column=470?>something that is of substantial and lasting value. A vision for banking
that is sustainable and of value needs to offer the possibility of a
flourishing society at every level of the economy, through investment,
lending and understanding the communities in which the banks
work—a vision that enables all banks to respond better to their
customers and to the well-being of society.
Without<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T18:14:58"></hs_TimeCode> good
banking, savings stagnate in fetid pools of hoarding, and good ideas
and entrepreneurial vigour wither without the water of capital and
liquidity. Such is the state into which we have been growing for many
years, which is one—although only one—contributory factor
to inequality, social immobility and areas of the country being
condemned to generations of poverty and deprivation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120588000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000124">However, secondly, when
we asked witnesses, “What is the social purpose of
banking?”, worryingly, it seemed to be a question that often
stumped them and which they had never asked themselves. Activity
without social purpose is ultimately anarchy. The work of the
commission, in my view, fundamentally has been about enabling the
financial services industry to retrieve its basic purpose of supporting
the common good and social solidarity. Banking is ultimately a utility
function. It is of course one that is especially important to our
economy, but there is a danger in treating the industry entirely
differently from other utilities. It is necessary that a culture of
service and social purpose is renewed in our banking industry. Banks
must assert their roles in both national and local economies for
without their investment in and service to local communities
everywhere, there will be no durable and universal recovery.</hs_para>

what ultimately will drive cultural change? Taken together, the
commission’s recommendations are an effort to encourage positive
cultural change. Proprietary trading, in the opinion of many of
us—and it is subject to review—should be banned.
Remuneration should be reasonable and proportionate. Regulation should
be effective and accountable. The implementation of the ring-fence is a
clear and welcome effort to ensure that distinctive and possibly
irreconcilable cultures are kept separate. The ring-fence will, we
hope, make the development of good culture more possible—and
with the right safeguards, we hope also that it will be more durable
than the walls of Jericho, so that not even the trumpets of
Joshua’s army could find a way through.</hs_para>

that law and regulation cannot cause people to be good: making people
good by law has been—to put it mildly—tricky since the
days of Moses. Read the Epistle to the Romans to see why. Culture is
set by leadership, training and implementation. In a recent report, the
City of London emphasised remuneration and shareholder activism. Such
recommendations illustrate the problem. Good culture is good through
virtue, not out of hope of reward alone, although of course that must
play a part. Shareholder activism also has had little or no impact
historically, with the average share traded five times a
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000127">For a
culture to become dominant, it was clear to us that it must be
internalised by employees at all levels. A set of values governed by a
deeply-held belief in what is right and wrong is foundational to
long-lasting 
<?notus-xml column=471?>cultural change. Such beliefs are caught and also taught. If
no one inside a bank believes that some of the practices we have heard
about, some as recently as last week, are wrong, or if they believe it
has no adequate way of expressing their concerns—the commission,
by the way, has recommended improvements to facilitate
whistleblowing—then cultural change will never take place, and
poor standards will continue to
fester.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000128">Introducing
informal mechanisms to catch poor standards early on was one of the
commission’s recommendations—it can be found in paragraph
786 of our final report—but in situations like this, once the
principle of the recommendation has been accepted, the responsibility
for bringing it about must be on banks themselves. That is why the
commission recommended that, as well as the essential reforms to
regulation and law, the industry must professionalise the sector in a
similar way to the medical and legal professions. This recommendation
has been much overlooked, but provides a convincing long-term
answer—complementary, not an alternative, to the other things in
the report—as to how culture can be shaped and styled, and
virtue measured, understood and valued.</hs_para>

on this work and it is especially clear that the chief executives of
the major British banks are working very hard in this area. The
struggle to change the culture has begun. It will be a long one. In our
view, we are talking of years—decades, a generation
perhaps—to embed a completely different culture to replace the

all these reasons, Parliament must hold regulators and market

Brooke of Sutton Mandeville (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a
privilege to be the first participant in this important debate to

having secured it, and for the manner in which he introduced it. His
qualifications for it are enviable. Having read his mini-biography in
wonderment at where he found the time to achieve so much, I hope he
will forgive my language if I say that I think he is playing a blinder.

this debate is for three reasons. The oldest of these is that when,
long ago, I spent two years at Harvard Business School acquiring 
<?notus-xml column=472?>an MBA, my highest marks were in a course titled “Business
Responsibilities in American Society”, which I supposed played
some part in determining my subsequent career. My second reason is that
for 24 years I was the third longest serving Member of
Parliament for the City of London since 1283. Those years included the
paradigm shift of Big Bang, from personal contact to largely screen and
telephone business. Although the dramatis personae of that era are not
an interest to declare, Sir Nicholas Goodison, the chairman of the
Stock Exchange who negotiated and navigated Big Bang so well, was and
is my oldest friend. My third reason is the debate on banking standards
during Report stage of the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill on
26 November 2013, not least the most reverend Primate’s
comments.</hs_para>

longstanding friendship with the honourable gentleman the Member for
Chichester in the other place, who chaired the Parliamentary Commission
on Banking Standards—henceforth referred to as the
PCBS—and who has been a mentor to me on this, as he was earlier
on the development of the euro. I say “mentor” because
during the four years that I was a Treasury Minister under my noble
friend Lord Lawson of Blaby, I was the only one of eight Ministers in
the department in that period who had never worked in the City of
London. Thus my responsibilities were concentrated on what Sir Douglas
Wass once defined to me as the housekeeping end of the
Treasury—a more fascinating portfolio than it sounds.</hs_para>

When the issues of this debate were discussed on Report for the banking

today, informed talk of standards, ethics and culture—not, I
have to say, unknown at the Harvard Business School. One institution
that spans this arena is the City Values corporate forum, a
collaborative project supported by the Lord Mayor and the City
Corporation. It draws on learning from the professions, academia and,
happily on this particular occasion, clergy-based as well as secular
sources. A report recently published by the forum provides a guide to
help chairmen and boards to calibrate their approach to the oversight
of values. Its goal is the achievement of ethical behaviour in the
financial and business services
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T18:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000136">We
learnt from the PCBS that some banks tried to encapsulate values in
their businesses by creating human resources handbooks running to in
excess of 1,000 pages. I share the PCBS’s scepticism about
mechanistic expressions of values. If we had consulted the Delphic
oracle, I suspect that it would have found a discreet way of conveying
a conclusion based on the criticism faced by the Financial Services
Authority for just such a modus
operandi.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000137">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T18:34:38"></hs_TimeCode>

cumulatively would help institutions to build and maintain values. As
an example, one building block would seek to cause a board to develop
ways of measuring values, behaviour and culture and to deploy internal
audit to renew and enforce them. The board would receive regular
misdemeanour reports. This process would lead in due course to the
board agreeing its 
<?notus-xml column=473?>values with its customers and employees as well. Finally, there would be

this will need to go further than discussion in your Lordships’
House but I hope that the process that I have described, and other
initiatives like it, will stimulate the debate. Existing mechanisms can
also be deployed more prominently. For example, the
rights and duties of shareholders also have an
important part to play in influencing board behaviour. As
other noble Lords have pointed out in numerous debates on governance in
this House, they are frequently underused controls. The All-Party
Parliamentary Corporate Governance Group, of which I am a

this area literally under its breakfast belt. The rights and duties of

the quality of the commission’s analysis and conclusions is
convincing. For all those reasons, gratitude, yes, but let us look at
the process that produced its conclusion. First, there is the
parliamentary power given to it to send for persons, papers and

Secondly, there is the quality of inquiry of those who came to
Parliament to explain. Fortunately, it was thought unnecessary to take
evidence on oath, but the very threat that you might have to is an
extremely good instigator of honesty by witnesses before the
commission. Lastly, there was the use of specialist advisers; I
understand that there were about 20 of them. That provides an
administrative and process base of high quality. Most important is the
fact that this was an evidence-based inquiry, it was in public, society
knew what was going on and the conclusions have been regularly

the various reports from the most reverend Primate have indicated, it
is clear that 2008 was the culmination of a series of problems within
the banking industry. The 2008 crisis exposed problems not just with
the regulatory regime but also, as he said, with the culture of the
industry. Banks had become unable to manage risk properly, had lost
sight of their responsibilities to customers and were seriously
over-leveraged. In addition, they had not guarded against other
long-term problems in the economy, particularly the housing
bubble.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000153">The

Government have addressed these issues in a number of ways. The first
is through the banking

away from the high-risk trading that they may also conduct and to which
the most reverend Primate referred—he would go further and ban
that entirely, but that is not what the legislation says. In addition,
in response to a recommendation by the commission, the Government have
amended the Bill to allow regulators completely to separate the retail
aspects of a particular bank from the rest of the business where that
bank seeks to breach or get around the ring-fence. This is known in the
jargon as electrification of the ring-fence.</hs_para>

the regulatory system, the Government have sought to learn the lessons
of the financial crisis. They have listened to the banking commission
in setting up a new regulatory system via the Financial Services
Act 2012. I shall not bore noble Lords with the detail of
this, but there are three separate bodies aimed at fixing the
regulatory problems: the Financial Policy Committee, the Prudential
Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority. The Act also
creates clear channels of communication and decision-making in the
event of another financial crisis. This is because—and I think
that we are all agreed on it—in 2008 there was concern that the
powers available to regulators, the Bank of England and the Treasury
were not clearly defined, making it hard for any one body to react
quickly to events.

of the most dismal features of the banking industry to emerge from our
evidence was the striking limitation on the sense of personal
responsibility and accountability of the leaders within the industry
for the widespread failings and abuses over which they presided.
Ignorance was offered as the main excuse. It was not always accidental.
Those who should have been exercising supervisory or leadership roles
benefited from an accountability firewall between themselves and
individual misconduct, and demonstrated poor, perhaps deliberately
poor, understanding of the front line. Senior executives were aware
that they would not be punished for what they could not see and
promptly donned the blindfolds. Where they could not claim ignorance,
they fell back on the claim that everyone was party to a decision, so
that no individual could be held squarely to blame—the Murder on

why. We understand the trajectory that has brought us where we are. We

many problems and provides many remedies. I want to look at only
two.</hs_para>

first is the role that regulation played in the banking crisis. The
regulators did not, of course, cause the banking crisis but neither did
they prevent it. I am a regulated person and have some first-hand
experience of the excellence, as well as the limitations, of the old
FSA. Part of the problem is that they took the understandable approach
of developing a detailed rule book, which led to what my honourable
friend Andrew Tyrie, the Member of Parliament for Chichester, has
referred to as the box-ticking
culture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000167">The
problem with a rule book is that, if an action is not specifically
forbidden by the rules, it is assumed to be allowed. Banks employ very
clever people, often recruited from the regulator itself, who did and
do ensure that the banks’ unacceptable risk-taking rarely breaks
the rules. So I am delighted that the new regulator, the PRA, is taking
the view that it has rules but that it also has opinions and
will rely on what it calls a “judgement-based,
forward-looking supervision”—which I think and hope means
that if, in the opinion of the PRA, something a bank is doing is
unacceptable, even though it is not forbidden, it must stop. This is
the way the old Bank of England banking supervision regime used to work
when I first started my career in the City. It may be the only way to
regulate banks, which are ever changing and innovating. Unless a
regulator can say, “What you are doing may not be illegal, but I
will not allow you to do it”, another banking disaster will
sooner or later occur.</hs_para>

second issue I want to comment on is the culture of the banks. The
culture of payment by results and of large bonuses dependent on doing
deals leads to all sorts of unintended consequences such as 
<?notus-xml column=479?>short-termism and disguised risk-taking. Other than for staff who took
short-term risks, such as money market and foreign exchange traders, it
was only in the late 1980s that bonuses in banks became substantial
multiples of base salary. I accept that deferring bonuses is a way of
curbing these disasters in waiting, but in reality the motivation of
employees to take unacceptable risks will be removed only if the
long-term risk-takers are paid through salary rather than
bonus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000169">This is
an excellent report, but we are on a long path to resolve the issues in
banking. Ultimately, it will require international agreement, which
will be hard to achieve. My last thought is that, whatever we do here
in the UK, we must ensure that London—and the UK
generally—retains its place as one of the three global banking
centres. Our country’s tax receipts and hundreds of thousands of
jobs depend upon it, so whatever changes we propose in the future must
make London the centre most trusted in the financial sector and not
give less scrupulous financial centres an opportunity to take away jobs

who was at a conference the other day of all the risk managers for the
global company, said that his bank will combine a culture of
performance with a culture of responsibility. This is a great ambition
for a commercial operation, and one that the chief executive says will
do good for the

responsibility is being taken at corporate level, and much of the

individual level. For example, regionally in the Royal Bank of
Scotland, local directors are responding to their chief

business and retail clients, is good for business, but also that it is
the right thing to do in exercising power and success. Greater
accountability is part of our debate, and we have heard about the
regulations and regulators. The Ecumenical Council for Corporate
Responsibility’s report, <I>The Banks and Society</I>, which was
published and ignored in March 2011, is now on the agenda of regional
and perhaps national bank leaders, along with its main

efficiently. In fact, almost all of those assumptions proved to be
wrong. Financial markets were riddled with serious flaws, such as major

to the financial crisis was largely a structural one. The first phase
was to restructure the regulators. A twin-peak structure was put in
place in the first Financial Services Act 2012. In my view this is not
necessarily the only, or perhaps not even the best, model, but it has
been done and we should get on with it and make it work, rather than
continuing to debate the

other part of the structural response was through the Independent
Commission on Banking led by Sir John Vickers, set up in June 2010,
which reported its conclusions in September 2011. The ICB set itself
four objectives. The first was to make banks more resilient and better
able to absorb losses, through higher capital and lower leverage. The
second was to make it easier and less costly to sort out banks that get
into trouble by dividing them into ring-fenced entities carrying out
the core functions of taking deposits, supplying overdrafts and
operating the payments system, with other, riskier investment banking
activities being kept in a different entity, though still within a

third objective was to curtail incentives for excessive risk-taking. In
particular, the ICB wanted to cut back the implicit guarantee that
arises if banks, and those investing in them, come to believe
that banks are too big to fail or too complex to be allowed
to fail. Finally, it wanted to strengthen competition and consumer
choice by creating a more diverse, less concentrated banking market and
by making switching
easier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0003.htm#13120588000200">By
mid-2012 the debate was still dominated by these structural issues.
Some people argued that if incentives and structures were improved, if
the implicit guarantee was curtailed and if the banks were properly
capitalised, behaviours would improve. If that view was ever true,
though, it was blown away by a series of revelations about conduct in
the summer of 2012. The straw that broke the camel’s back was
LIBOR fixing. At this point the patience of politicians snapped and we
moved on to a different agenda, one concerned not just with structure
but with behaviour, standards and culture. The PCBS was created to
investigate this.</hs_para>

return to some of the questions I posed at the start. Is this unfair
targeting of banks and bankers? I would argue that it is not. Even now,
banks accept that their conduct was not acceptable and that they have
forfeited the trust of their customers. Banks are also exceptional in a
number of other ways. They provide a public service through the
payments system, which cannot be allowed to be interrupted. They are
highly interconnected: a failure of one bank can damage other banks
either directly or by undermining the trust on which the whole system
is based. They can fail with astonishing speed. Even after the
structural changes have been made, they will still enjoy some degree of
implicit
guarantee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T19:27:00"></hs_TimeCode>. In
addition, their funding structure is different. Compared with most

higher capital requirements to contract or divest themselves of certain

size so that it concentrates on serving UK firms and households is to
be welcomed. It is essential that leverage is brought down. The UK is a
middle-sized economy with a global-sized banking sector. In 1990 the
combined balance sheet of UK clearing banks was 75% of GDP. In 2010

Eatwell (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Parliamentary Commission on
Banking Standards’s reports form a landmark, dissecting the
structure of banking in this country and hence exposing the serious
systemic 
<?notus-xml column=488?>weaknesses both within the banking industry itself and in government
policies toward banking. The reports display a constructive blend of
financial and institutional analysis. They also display a healthy
disdain for the common fallacies which have been propagated by the
banking industry in an attempt to limit change, such as the fallacy
that higher capital requirements will reduce lending, as if greater
capital were simply hidden away in the cellar rather than lent out for
profitable return. The Government’s response has been generally
welcoming, though a little
timid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0004.htm#13120588000216">The
commission was established following the revelations of LIBOR
manipulation. Its primary goal was to examine the culture of the
banking industry, but its work soon broadened to included systemic
risk. This was not simply because banking culture is itself a source of
systemic risk to the UK, but also because the work of the Independent
Commission on Banking, bold when published, was revealed by longer-term
examination to be less powerful than originally thought—hence
the PCBS proposals to electrify the ring-fence, and the
commission’s numerous dark hints that ring-fencing is not going

Banking Standards, I argued that it would not have the time or the
resources to do the job needed—namely, a wide-ranging inquiry
into UK financial services and their role, or lack of it, in
rebalancing the real economy. I was right. While the commission has
exceeded expectations, there is an enormous amount still to do if we
are to have a financial system that does not just provide stable

needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0004.htm#13120588000218">My
agenda of future work for a reincarnated commission covers three areas:
the size and composition of the financial services industry, the
changing nature of systemic risk, and the development of high-quality
finance to support innovative, competitive industry. I shall discuss
size and composition first. In a speech in mid-October, the Governor of
the Bank of England, Mark Carney, suggested that UK banking assets
would rise from about four times UK GDP today to nine times UK GDP by
2050. In other words, he predicted Britain would become Iceland circa
2007. In defence of his relaxed anticipation of this ominous prospect
he argued

governor is calling for greater international financial integration,
and it is easy to understand why. The City of London is absolutely
brilliant at taking funds from around the world, repackaging them into
new risk-return structures and selling them back to the rest of the
world. It is the world’s finest offshore financial centre. But
is a financial sector nine times bigger than GDP such a good idea, even
with all the measures of the recent Financial Services Act and the new
banking Bill in place? Is the ring-fence sufficient to limit national
risk exposure to those inside the 
<?notus-xml column=489?>ring-fence, while all the risks outside fall on private sector
shoulders? We should remember that Lehman Brothers would have been
outside the
ring-fence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T19:35:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Perhaps it is in the wrong place and should be between, on the one

operations, thus at least in part insulating the British economy from
international financial

second item on the agenda of the new commission should be the changing
nature of systemic risk. The key warning of this came last May, when
Ben Bernanke hinted at a tapering of US quantitative easing. The result
was a massive slump—even chaos—in international bond
markets around the world, particularly in emerging markets, and severe
difficulties in some foreign exchange markets. In the press, this was
attributed to the reversal of flows of what was called a “wall
of money” that had originally migrated to emerging markets in
the search for yield, given the near-zero interest rates in advanced
countries. That portrayal of the problem was wrong, because flows of
funds to emerging markets have fallen year on year since
2008—there is no wall of money. What is important is that their
form has changed. The capital flow from global banks to emerging
markets has slowed to a trickle. In its place, emerging market banks
have increased their issuance of bonds. Even more dramatically,
non-bank investment in emerging market bonds has soared. Today, in
emerging market funding, the global banks have given way to asset
managers and other buy-side investors who have global reach. Most of
this new bond issuance has been in US dollars, so that emerging market
corporates have become much more sensitive to US interest rates and to
fluctuations in exchange rates vis-à-vis the US dollar. This
increased sensitivity in the changed structure of the market is clear
in emerging
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0004.htm#13120588000221">Exactly
the same transformation of funding flows is taking place here at home.
Industrial and commercial firms starved of funding by the banks are
turning to the bond market. Asset management firms and insurance
companies are responding by increasing their flow of funds into
corporate bond markets—which are far more sensitive to
prospective interest rate changes than traditional bank lending. A new
vicious cycle is being created in which the prospect of interest rate
rises leads to falling bond prices, which leads to a flow of managed
funds out of the corporate bond market, which leads to declining
investment and growth, which in turn undermines future bond yields so
that asset managers cut back the flow of funds. That is the vicious
cycle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T19:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120588000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-0004.htm#13120588000222">These
distress dynamics have some unfamiliar elements. We normally invoke
either leverage or maturity mismatch when explaining crises, and the
usual protagonists in the crisis narrative are banks or other financial
intermediaries. By contrast, in the newly emerging scenario, asset
managers are at the heart. Those are usually the people we characterise
as benign, long-term investors, routinely excluded from the list of
“systemic” market participants. However, the distinction
between leveraged institutions and long-only investors matters less if
they share the same tendency to procyclicality. 
<?notus-xml column=490?>Today, asset managers increasingly base their trading on the same
measures of risk used by the banks, so the behaviour of asset
management firms will tend to exhibit the same type of procyclical
risk-taking that the banks are known for. None of those issues is dealt
with in current legislation; they must be dealt with by the new
commission.</hs_para>

extensive agenda for the reincarnated commission is how the financial
services industry serves the need to rebalance the real economy. For
the harsh truth is that despite the fact that banking balance sheets
around the world are today 15 times greater, relative to GDP, than they
were 30 years ago, trend world growth in the real economy is certainly
no faster than it was then; and in the West it is significantly slower.

notably, private sector investment in research and development is
slowing down. Indeed, if there were not substantial public sector
R&amp;D spending, investment in crucial drivers of future growth would

agenda. In 2012 alone, state development banks financed $109
billion-worth of investment in renewable energy, energy efficiency, and
electrical transmission and distribution, while private sector
investment was less than a third of that. In the US, it is government
funding in high-growth areas such as the life sciences that is
absolutely essential. Where would British life sciences be without the

private sector problem is lack of the right sort of funding. Even
venture capital, designed in theory to provide high-risk finance for

of the most reverend Primate about what banks are for and what
contribution they make 
<?notus-xml column=493?>to local and national economies. The thing that made me want to go into
banking was the opportunity to work with so many different businesses;
to work with so many other different kind of financial institutions; to
work with different countries around the world; and to use finance to
make things happen, to build things and to see development. For me, it

never lost the sense of magic that the position you get at the centre
of things gives you. My career divided into two halves. In the first
half, my responsibility was to manage and build a group of clients and,
frankly, to maximise the market share for my firm from those clients by
winning as much business from them as we possibly could. I learnt one
very simple thing: the most important rule for success was to put the
customer’s interests first. There was nothing worse than an
unhappy client. My most profitable long-term client relationships were
with those people whom I had initially advised not to do transactions.
We have heard a lot of discussion about taking care of the customer and
putting the customer first. My own experience tells me not only is this
the right thing to do, it is also in the bank’s long-term
financial interest to behave in precisely that way too. The essence of

a couple of comments. I shall be brief, because we are at the end of

Lord, Lord Sharkey, about size were also strong reminders of the
difficulties that we face. One of the most memorable comments in
evidence for me was from a former head of UBS, clearly deeply affected
personally by the pain of what he had gone through. He was one of those
bankers who came who had borne the whole weight of it on his shoulders
and suffered greatly as a result. There was no lack of responsibility
from him. When asked if, in the depths of the night, he looked back and
thought that he might have done differently, he said that you can have
a big simple bank or a small complicated bank; you cannot have a big
complicated bank. He said that if he had his time again, he would have

not the only goose laying golden eggs in our economy. We cannot be a

go through all the other points raised, but I heard with gratitude the
comments about education. Competition is obviously essential, but, as

the answer is complex. War lords or militant groups committed to
achieving ideological 
<?notus-xml column=38?>or political goals by armed insurrection are connected to large-scale
poaching. Experts believe that ivory,  like the blood diamonds
of other African conflicts,  is funding many rebel groups and
militias in Africa. Poachers have direct access to military weapons and
arms markets linked to organised criminal and terrorist groups.
Elephant poachers in many parts of Africa use weapons that can be
acquired only from military sources. These weapons have range, accuracy
and fire power which enables poaching gangs to kill not only a large
number of animals but also the rangers tasked with protecting
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000008">The

Somalia, controlled for the most part by al-Shabaab, a militant
Islamist group that pledged allegiance to al-Qaeda, is thought to be

that at some stage during the current mission to China someone in the
Prime Minister’s very large delegation has found time to draw

large shipments of illegal ivory are destined for China, the United

A widespread and many-faceted response is required. This includes
tackling terrorists; training and supporting rangers; and providing
quasi- military support for the rangers in particularly hard-hit areas.
From this year, DNA testing is mandatory for large-scale ivory
seizures. Other new technologies are being developed, including alarm
systems, as well as an intelligence-led approach. This all requires an
integrated enforcement strategy involving all relevant agencies and the

to buy products. The American organisation WildAid is already

Jones of Cheltenham (LD):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I
congratulate my noble friend on securing this timely debate. It is
timely because the <I>Independent</I> newspaper group, along with the
<I>Evening Standard</I>, have launched 
<?notus-xml column=40?>a campaign on the subject, and made Space for Giants their Christmas
appeal. It is also timely because last week the International Fund for
Animal Welfare, IFAW, launched its briefing, <I>Criminal Nature</I>, to
which my noble friend has already referred. It is timely, too, because
this week an international conference has been held in Botswana on the
subject.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000020">Ivory—its
acquisition, transportation and sale—is a complex, brutal and
horrifying process. My noble friend has tried to answer the question of
how the world can protect rhinos and elephants from the ivory trade.
There are only two ways: stop poaching or eliminate the market.
Elephants, rhinos and many other species need protection. Elephants are
invariably killed for their ivory, and, as I do not believe any are on
licence right now, they are invariably poached. This is a situation of
which the locals may or may not approve, but it is hard to show
disapproval of a gang of poachers with AK47s at the
ready.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000021">So how
do you crack down and eliminate the poachers? First, you have to put up
a tangible reward for information on poachers and their whereabouts.
Incentives need to be scaled and relevant to those on the receiving
end. If you seek information on poachers, sooner or later you will get
some. Then there has to be an immediate and appropriate reaction,
otherwise the information flow will become tainted or tail off due to
lack of interest. This means that park rangers, game wardens and other
law enforcement agencies need to be trained and equipped for the task.
This costs money and a long-term commitment, although the finances are
marginal in global terms—you could save all the elephants in
Africa for a small portion of the feed-in tariffs generously paid to
the renewables
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000022">Secondly,
penalties for those guilty of poaching must be severe. Some recent
small fines are frankly laughable. Two Irish smugglers who were found
with eight rhino horns were find €500 each, whereas the street
value is €500,000. It is good to see that Zimbabwe has
introduced heavy fines for poaching—$120,000 for a rhino,
$20,000 for an elephant—and if you do not or cannot pay you go
to a Zimbabwean
jail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000023">I am not
in favour of the death penalty. However, poachers do not think twice
about killing wildlife rangers if they get in the way, so it is likely
that you are going to have to kill a few poachers before the message
sinks in that poachers are effectively on licence all day, every day,
of every year, from now on. This worked for a while in Kenya, but
poaching has been overtaken by terrorism on the security
agencies' priority list, although—as we have heard—in
Kenya, as in Tanzania, the two crimes are probably closely
linked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000024">The

follows, therefore, that declaring war on terrorists and terrorism by
removing sources of income extends to eliminating the poachers, and
this could most usefully be tasked and funded from anti-terrorism
budgets. The conference held in Gaborone in Botswana this week has
agreed more tough measures to cut wildlife smuggling. It is to be
classified as a serious crime, and gangs risk having their assets
seized.</hs_parafo>

poachers with machine guns use helicopters in their murky exploits.
They shoot elephants and rhinos from the air, land, take the ivory or
horns and take off again. This is not random poaching: this is
organised crime, highly financed. There is now hard evidence that these
helicopter missions, in particular, are linked to terrorism, drug
money-laundering and arms smuggling. They kill for ivory to fund
terrorist activity or gun-running or drug activity elsewhere in the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000027">I
favour the bazooka option for the helicopter raids. It only needs a few
of these aircraft to be blasted out of the sky to ram home the message
that the poachers are not going to win. Next year the United Kingdom
will withdraw its Armed Forces from Afghanistan. Perhaps we could offer
to help train wildlife rangers to combat poaching. I know two members
of our Armed Forces who would jump at the chance to
help.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000028">Finally,
the market needs reform, preferably by elimination. A recent poll
showed that seven out of 10 Chinese did not know that ivory
comes from dead elephants. They seemed to think that it was some kind
of mined mineral. Education is the key, not the elephants-are-lovely
“Blue Peter” stuff but more along the lines of,
“You are ridiculous idiots who need to get a life”. Now,
as a realist, I suspect that the Prime Minister is unlikely to have had
that sort of discussion on his visit to China this week, but it is
encouraging that, according to this month’s <I>National
Geographic</I> magazine, the Philippines has become the first
non-African country to destroy its ivory stock. The Department of
Environment and Natural Resources Secretary, Ramon JP Paje,
said:</hs_para>

is also needed as to the efficacy, or otherwise, of ingesting the
powdered teeth or horn of elephants, rhinos and the like. Frankly,
those who indulge in this practice need to be told that they would get
as much benefit from consuming their own toenails, and they are free of
charge. China and its inhabitants are both changing at a rapid pace,
arguably for the better. As a state, it is buying up much of Africa and
therefore should have a cultural interest in preserving what might, one
day, become its playground. Education, in the final analysis, is the
only solution to the demands of the market. Remove the market, and you
stop
poaching.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000030">It
is not all bad news; there is hope out there. Elephant and rhino
populations have plummeted in recent decades, but they still exist.
They have not yet become extinct and gone the way of the dodo and
numerous other species. In some countries, populations are growing. A
shining example is Botswana, and I draw attention to my declared
interest in that country. At the end of 2012, Botswana’s
elephant population was 207,545, which is more than one-third of all
African elephants. The number has almost quadrupled in 20 years and is
currently growing at 5% each year. This time next year, there will be
more than 10,000 extra elephants in Botswana. The reason is
not hard to find. Botswana’s rulers pay attention to and love
their wildlife. The country’s first president, Sir Seretse
Khama, and successive presidents since, knew and know the value 
<?notus-xml column=42?>of wildlife, not for its ivory and skins, but to attract visitors from
around the world to see these magnificent creatures. Botswana has
banned so-called trophy hunting. I recommend that noble Lords visit
Botswana to see for themselves the most incredible wildlife on our
planet in its natural habitat. If noble Lords wish to have elephants on
their estates, I understand that the Government of Botswana will let
you have as many as you like free of charge. You just need to arrange
the
transport.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000031">I
shall end with this personal experience. A few years ago I was on a
boat on the River Chobe near Kasane in northern Botswana. In the
distance I could see a large dark object in the river—it was a
very large elephant. As we got closer I asked the guide why the
elephant was there. “Oh, she’s dying”, he said.
“She’s in the water to keep cool”. He added,
“She’s the matriarch”. All around there were
hundreds and hundreds, maybe thousands, of elephants of all shapes and
sizes. A few weeks later I went back and asked what had happened to the
elephant. I was told that she died. The wildlife wardens had dragged
her onto the river bank and removed the tusks. That is what they do in
Botswana with dead elephants; the Government take control of the ivory.
Then, for hour upon hour, elephants had filed past her in an orderly
fashion, touching her body with their trunks. They were her family
paying their last respects. Elephants are amazingly intelligent
creatures with feelings just like humans. In my view they are far more
intelligent than poachers, the organisers of poaching, those involved
in the ivory trade and the end consumers. Bad humans have caused the
current crisis. It is now up to good humans to ensure that the species
survive by eradicating once and for all the trade in ivory which has
led to the horrible and indefensible crime of
poaching.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120556000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000097"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:20:07"></hs_TimeCode></I>1.20

is very alarming that, according to reports published recently,

home to almost 80% of Africa’s rhinos and just over 70% of the
global population of rhinos, the poaching of this endangered animal has
been rampant. In fact, statistics show that almost two rhinos are being

the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, mentioned, most of the seizures of illegal
ivory and rhino horn have been destined for the Far East, predominantly
China 
<?notus-xml column=43?>and Vietnam, although one should not forget that they have also been
going to America and to other parts of the European Union. The illegal
cargo, particularly from Africa, has been shipped from ports such as
Mombasa, Dar es Salaam and Mozambique, hidden in shipping containers
full of foodstuffs. There have been recent reports that the ivory and
rhino horn have been smuggled out of Africa on planes in suitcases by
many Chinese who are working on the continent. As the noble Lord, Lord
Faulks, mentioned, the trade in tusks, horns and other animal parts is
one of the world’s biggest criminal enterprises, after arms,
drugs, counterfeiting and human trafficking. The trade has helped
murderous organisations such as Somalia's al-Shabaab, Darfur's

governance is at its weakest, the elephant population has been hit the
hardest by continued rampant poaching. Tanzania has also been

work out and agree emergency measures—and there have been some

has one of the largest populations of elephants in Africa. In the most
encouraging move since 1977, the Kenyan Government have recently
introduced the Wildlife Conservation and Management Bill, which will
become law next year. They are also, at long last, giving a lot more
support to front-line anti-poaching teams. In South Africa,
conservationists have experimented with poisoning the horns of rhinos,
which causes no harm to the rhino, but which would render the rhino
horn worthless. Over 1,000 rhinos in South Africa have been treated in
this manner. It is hoped that, when consumers of rhino horn realise
that they could potentially be poisonous, this will drive down
demand  
<?notus-xml column=44?>for rhino horn.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:26:32"></hs_TimeCode> is well known

conclusion, there are a number of measures that need to be taken to
address this major problem. There needs to be greater investment in
more rangers and community policing initiatives to counter poachers, as
well as improved law enforcement across all range states and consumer
nations. It is well known that the crime syndicates have been bribing
police and magistrates in several African countries to prevent
prosecution, as well as corrupting border guards, customs officers,

entirely agree with the noble Lord, Lord Jones, that there ought to be
far greater penalties against those found guilty of poaching and
dealing illegally in ivory and rhino horn. To date, the penalties have
been derisory. Furthermore, cross-border investigations and

is apparent is that there is huge ignorance among consumers. There have
been strong calls for China to shut down official factories and shops
dealing in ivory and rhino horn. Unfortunately, the release and sale of
the African stockpile of ivory in 2008 gave the impression to many
consumers that buying ivory was acceptable, which enabled traders to

conclusion, I am encouraged that at long last there are the first signs
of global awareness of the illegal ivory and rhino horn trade, as well
as the lion trade. Up to 30% of all the lions in South Africa are kept
in captivity. It is not just about the impact on the trade; it is also
about the sustainability of tourism. It is vitally important that this
subject is not ignored and is put higher on the international political
agenda. It is through debates such as this one, backed by the power of
social media, that we will, I hope, substantially reduce this
disastrous

Knight of Weymouth (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, pay tribute to
the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, for securing this debate and for the way
in which he introduced it. Certainly his points about the relationship
to other crime, which were reinforced by the speech of the noble Lord,
Lord St John, were very well made and I do not need to add to them. As
the noble Lord, Lord Jones, said, this is a very timely debate, not
just because of the work that the <I>Independent</I> has launched this
week but also because of the meetings in Botswana and Paris this
week—which is perhaps why the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, is not
with us. I pay tribute to the work that he is doing on this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:30:13"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, there is also the relationship with poverty. It is striking
that the world’s most magnificent and, tragically, valuable
animals are surrounded by the world’s poorest people and by some
of the worst conflict in the world. That makes it particularly
difficult to tackle this issue.</hs_para>

have heard about the plight of elephants and rhinos. The
<I>Independent</I> report suggests that as many as 52,000 elephants a
year might now be lost due to poaching and that the population is 15%
of what it was 20 years ago. I see from the National Wildlife Crime
Unit that 234 items of ivory were seized in the UK last year alone. I
also note from Defra’s strategic assessment of the National
Wildlife Crime Unit from February 2011 that 12 rhinos a month were

to see forest elephants in their natural environment in 2005 in the
Virunga National Park in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and I met
with the rangers there. I was the first western visitor to the park for
10 years. I believe that every one of the rangers I met has
subsequently died as a result of the activity of the Lord’s
Resistance Army and from other conflict in that area. I went on from
Virunga to Bukavu, principally to see how Darwin money from the UK
Government was being spent to protect gorillas in the forests of the
DRC. The rangers there made it clear to me that the forest elephants in
that part of the world are hugely important to the eco-system because
they effectively create the pathways through which the rest of the
wildlife is able to move. The tragic fate of the forest elephants,
which was highlighted by the noble Lord, Lord St John, is having a
serious impact on the rest of the eco-system. This is something that we
should value beyond just the charismatic value of these extraordinary
animals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Jones, explained the choices well. Do you stop the poaching and/or can
you stop the market? Both clearly are really hard. We have seen from
Tanzania the efforts being made by the president there in launching
Operation Tokomeza, with its orders to shoot to kill elephant poachers.
Clearly he is doing what he can and reflects the comments from the
noble Lord, Lord Jones, about being able to stop poaching. However,
when this activity is sitting alongside such intense and difficult
conflict and such intense poverty, stopping poaching is extremely
difficult, certainly in those countries with porous borders. It is
difficult to be
optimistic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

demand, I would be interested to know whether the Prime Minister in his
visit to China was able, in among all the many important discussions he
would have had there, to raise this issue with the Chinese. Clearly,
that is a critical part of the market. Indeed, the irony when I was in
the DRC all those years ago was that the Chinese were the people
building the roads through the forest for the people and the elephants
were making the roads for the animals. The demand from the Chinese
appears to be removing that capacity.</hs_para>

congratulate the Government on the London conference, and Prince
William and the Prince of Wales on their leadership on this issue. The
noble Lord, Lord St John, mentioned the decision made in 2008 by the
previous Government, of whom I was a member. That decision was
debatable at best. It was made with good intentions in wanting to
depress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:35:02"></hs_TimeCode> the
price to reduce incentives to poachers and create revenue with the
one-off sale for monitoring and enforcement 
<?notus-xml column=46?>against poachers. But I wonder whether the Government have learnt any
lessons from that decision to allow one-off trade. Personally I regret
the decision and it would be good now to see an unequivocal
international ban on all forms of ivory trade, although I will be

that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:35:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000048">Beyond
the work that is being done internationally, where the Government have
a pretty good record in terms of international wildlife conservation,
there are also measures that need to be taken internally to make sure
that we have our own house in order as we try to assert our authority

progress is being made in terms of updating COTES, which implements
CITES in this country? I pay tribute to the World Society for the
Protection of Animals for its contribution of £100,000 per year
to the work of the National Wildlife Crime Unit. I understand that the
Government contributed £136,000 for 2013-14, but there is no
commitment to fund the unit beyond that. Can the Minister update us on
whether the Government will commit funds beyond that, at least at the
current level, particularly now that we have the Autumn Statement?
Perhaps there is some news buried away in the lengthy documentation
that not all of us have had a chance to absorb from today's
announcement. Many of us in this debate would like to see funding
extended beyond the current level, because there is some evidence that
London is the centre for some of this trade. We need to ensure that we

part in this debate with such passion and knowledge. My noble friend is
quite right: this is not a marginal issue, it is extremely important.
It is a challenge that has increased with great severity and rapidity,

that elephant and rhinoceros populations are facing a considerable
threat from poaching, which has been sweeping much of the African
continent. Elephants are being lost at the rate of tens of thousands a
year, and at the current rate of increase in poaching, rhino numbers
could fall into decline as early as 2015. If left unchecked, as noble
Lords have 
<?notus-xml column=47?>said, some country populations will undoubtedly disappear and the very
existence of these species could be threatened. That cannot be allowed
to happen. I want to make it clear that the Government take the issue
of the illegal trade in wildlife very seriously. In reply to the noble
Lord, Lord Knight, I confirm our commitment to the ban on the trade of
ivory. As I heard the winds threaten to blow the roof off this Room, it
sounded as if the gods agree with us.</hs_para>

wildlife poaching has been considered an environmental problem—a
threat to the conservation of the species but no more. It is
increasingly recognised as a problem affecting other sectors as well.
Noble Lords made that case strongly. The illegal trade in wildlife is a
multibillion pound industry, and as my noble friend Lord Faulks made
clear, there is evidence of involvement by organised criminality and,
in some cases, heavily armed militias and those linked to extremist
activity. As my noble friend Lord Faulks and others have said, this
illegal activity undermines the rule of law, can destabilise fragile
Governments and impede development goals. My noble friend Lord Faulks
made very clear the interlinking between this trade and crime, and the
impact on the most fragile of states. The noble Lord, Lord St John,
reinforced this very cogent case. To describe ivory as he did, as the
“white gold of jihad” aptly recognises its
significance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T13:41:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

years taken an active role in the conservation of species
internationally, most usually through our engagement with multilateral
environmental agreements such as the Convention on Biological Diversity
and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. We
have supplemented this work with specific engagement on projects
involving many of the iconic species that have been mentioned
here—tigers, elephants and rhino—and one species that is
very popular among the British public but that has not been mentioned
here—apes. Support is not always financial; it is also
practical. My noble friend Lord Faulks will be pleased to hear that
last month, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Defra
announced that British paratroopers in Kenya would provide patrol and
field training for Kenyan conservation rangers to help in their fight
against poaching. My noble friend Lord Faulks pointed out not only the
risk to the animals, but also to the rangers themselves. This was again

played a major role in achieving strong outcomes to provide greater
protection for elephants and rhinos at the CITES conference of parties

however, much more needs to be done. As my noble friend Lord Jones and
others have mentioned, a summit on the plight of the African elephants,
hosted by the Government of Botswana, has just finished. We helped fund
this meeting and it was attended by my noble friend Lord De Mauley, the
Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Defra. He would otherwise

clearly no country can solve this problem alone. That is why my right
honourable friend the Foreign Secretary announced at the UN General
Assembly that the UK will host an international conference in London on
13 February 2014 to galvanise international action. That is a meeting
to which a number of noble Lords have referred. We are working very
closely across government with a wide range of foreign Governments,

improving law enforcement and the role of the criminal justice system
throughout the chain of illegal trafficking. This includes the
countries in which the animals are poached, the countries through which
they transit, and the countries in which they end up. The second is
reducing demand for the wildlife products that drive this trafficking
through public awareness and behaviour-change campaigns. This area was
strongly highlighted by noble Lords. The third is supporting the
development of sustainable livelihoods for communities affected by the
illegal wildlife trade in order to reduce the incentive to become

the sustainability of tourism. The longer-term economic, as well as
environmental, effect of this trade is clearly key. The conference will

looking at illegal trade taking place on the internet, and this is a

noble Lords who have decided to take part in this debate, although I
know that they have been given only one minute in which to
speak. Many noble Lords may be very opposed to what
I am going to say but I thank them anyway for taking
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000003">I
have long believed that we should all have some choice in the manner of
our deaths. There is no point in fearing death itself, because there is
nothing that we can do about it, but we do have
reason to fear the manner of our death, particularly our physical state
in the closing days of our lives. Assuming that we are terminally ill
but still in our right minds, probably suffering from physical or
psychological pain, why should so many people object to us having the
right to decide how we die?</hs_para>

problem is, of course, that if you wish to die painlessly, peacefully
and with dignity, you are almost certainly going to need assistance
from others, particularly a doctor or medical practitioner. It is not
easy to kill yourself cleanly on your own when you are old and infirm
but, as the law stands today, anyone assisting you to die is committing
a criminal offence and risks anything up to 14 years’
imprisonment.</hs_para>

significant minority of cases, assisting someone to die is necessary,
sensible and humane. Therefore, I, and millions like me, want the law
changed so that terminally ill patients who are in their right mind can
choose how, when and where they die. In most cases, I suspect that it
will be in their own home with their family and loved ones around them.
They certainly would not choose to travel to an impersonal clinic in
Switzerland to die prematurely and at considerable expense to their
family, yet that is what our present law is forcing about one British
citizen a week to do.</hs_para>

course, if the law is to be changed, there must be safeguards. We
cannot allow a cruel or selfish family to pressurise their troublesome
old granny into taking her own life. We cannot even allow granny to be
put in a position in which she feels she has become such a burden on
the family she loves that she believes she has a “duty to
die”. Of course there must be very robust and foolproof
safeguards, and that is exactly what is to be found in the Bill of the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, on assisted dying, which will be
coming to this House some time early next year.</hs_para>

spite of all the assurances on safeguards, we know that there is still
going to be strong opposition to that
Bill—not, I am pleased to say, as strong as it was
when the noble Lord, Lord Joffe, introduced a similar Bill to this
House some seven years ago, but it will still be
formidable. To me, the legalisation of assisted dying in specific and
clearly identifiable circumstances seems so sensible and humane that I
am finding it more and more difficult to understand why some groups and
individuals are so adamantly opposed to it.</hs_para>

anyway, many people never really understood what those of us who
support assisted dying are really all about. They do not understand our
purpose and the strict limitations of what we are proposing. The
measure applies only to adults who are certified as being in their
right minds and not suffering from medical depressions or any other
mental illness which might affect their ability to decide. It applies
only to patients who have been diagnosed as being terminally ill and
certain to die within six months. It applies only to people who have
consistently declared a wish to die before their natural end. The will
to live, and to continue living, is very strong in most of us, so we
are talking about only a small minority of people. However, they are a
significant minority whose plight cannot be ignored any
longer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000073">I do
not think that our case has been helped by linking us—sometimes
done deliberately by opponents—with words such as
“voluntary euthanasia”. “Euthanasia”
implies putting other people to death—presumably, not
oneself—for compassionate reasons. This issue has nothing to do
with euthanasia. It is sometimes referred to as “assisted
suicide”. “Assisted suicide”? I would not vote for
anything called “assisted suicide”, and I am sure that
most noble Lords would
not.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000074">I do not
much like the term “assisted death”, as our cause is
presently labelled. It implies that the assisters are taking part
willingly in something that will almost certainly be very traumatic and
painful for them too. Even the word “assisted” implies
that you are party to some criminal act, which, as the law now stands,
is exactly what you would be guilty
of.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000075">Therefore,
we must redefine what this debate is about. “Assisted”
anything is only a necessary and vital adjunct to the real issue. It is
really about choice: personal, individual choice. “Choice at the
end of life” is my preference—omitting even the emotive
word “death”. The law must allow terminally ill patients
in their right mind to choose how, when and where they wish to die. If
they wish to continue to live right up to their last natural breath,
that is their choice. If they wish to avail themselves of palliative
care, that is their choice. If they believe that their god wants them
to suffer to the bitter end, that, too, is their choice. However, if
they prefer to die when they feel ready, and wish to avoid the
inevitable suffering and indignity which are likely to face them in
their final months, then the law must make this possible
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120556000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120556000076">The
forthcoming Bill tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer,
is all about choice, freely taken. It has nothing to do with euthanasia
and is in no way linked to the problems of those many elderly people
who are no longer capable of making decisions for themselves. I am
saddened that so many disabled people feel threatened by this Bill. It
is intended to  
<?notus-xml column=52?>give each of them a crucial say in their own destiny—they
themselves, not the doctors or their relatives. Surely it should be a
comfort to them, not a cause for

the Bill tabled by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, comes
before this House next year, I hope that, by then, the Government will
have come off the fence on this issue, and will be prepared to support
it. Are the Government not ashamed that so many British citizens feel
compelled to travel to Switzerland because their own country refuses
them a dignified death? I like to think that they do feel a little
shame because they turn a blind eye to a public prosecutor who is not
prepared to prosecute those family members assisting their ill
relations to get to Dignitas, and thus blatantly flouting the law. The
law badly needs to be changed to allow choice at the end of life and
immunity to those who assist in this regard. It is surely time that the

see ourselves as autonomous individuals. The noble Earl just talked

fact. The relationship between a doctor and a patient is not simply a
commercial relationship such as that which exists between a customer
and a supplier. It is a relationship of trust, involving a duty of care
and protection. To suggest that a doctor should knowingly and
deliberately aid and abet a patient’s suicide—I will use
that word—takes clinical practice into a place where it has no
business to be, and could signify the breakdown of that
trust.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/C0153238A052E33BEB4CA19DE6D6C24F8A7E535E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

Lords, the noble Earl has given us the “good intentions”
speech. The slippery slope he outlined was paved with comforting
phrases, but were they justified by facts? One of his phrases was
“death clearly inevitable”; another was “certain
to die within six months”. However, in a survey taken last
October of 156 patients whose prognosis was death within 14
days, 12% lived longer. These patients had advanced, incurable cancer
and were referred for palliative care services. Further research
following that showed that 10% of MDs made inaccurate prognoses for
two-week survival, and in a survey of 1,018 patients with advanced
cancer, only 56.3% were able to be accurate with medical predictions. I
think that the base of the case is not

Earl, Lord Glasgow, and the introduction of a very limited Bill to
enable those with terminal illness to have help to die at a time of
their choosing. For me, it is a moral issue and a 
<?notus-xml column=55?>matter of simple humanity that we should respect the diversity of
patients’ wishes in the last months of life, just as we are
beholden by law to respect their wishes at other times. It seems to me
that we can talk endlessly about safeguards; next week, in another,
similar debate, we will be able to explore mental capacity, mental
illness, the prediction of six months’ duration and undue
pressures. I will be happy to talk about all those things in the
future. We should base our decisions on research evidence of outcomes
from other jurisdictions that have already bitten this bullet and have
16 years’ worth of good information about what happens when you
take a chance. All those predictions of cataclysm and slippery slope
have proved to be completely false. I hope very much that we will

to make our departure from this world as painless and as planned as our

in hospital but when he was told he had a week to live, he cried, not
because it was so short but because it was so long. He did not want
that last week of sickness, inability to sleep and pain. Why inflict
such cruelty at that point on a man who is competent to choose? Surely

compelling evidence that that law works. The then chief executive of
the Oregon Hospice Association told the committee that the Act had not
adversely affected the hospice movement. It has improved in Oregon
since the passing of the Act. Ninety-seven per cent of those who had an
assisted death in Oregon in 2012 had been enrolled in hospice care.
Assisted dying is complementary to excellent hospice and palliative
care. They are not mutually exclusive. We also know that the main
reasons for seeking assistance to die centre on loss of autonomy and
dignity as opposed to inadequate pain relief. We know that the Oregon
system works well—so well in fact that, as has already been

Wheeler (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for
securing this debate. This important issue deserves time and
deliberation by us. I hope that  
<?notus-xml column=59?>this will lead to further attention being given in this House to the
importance of continuing discussion and dialogue on the current
situation, the legal uncertainties, ambiguities and suffering of people
in the appalling situation endured by Tony Nicklinson and others. We

have spoken more fully about the end of life care discussions under the
Care Bill and stressed the importance of recognising the overall
progress that has been made. Today’s focus on the legal right
for terminally ill patients to decide when and how they should die is
outside the scope of that Bill but we should acknowledge the
substantial changes in care and support at the end of life made since
the End of Life Care Strategy’s 2008 launch. We should also
acknowledge the changes in attitudes and approach to the cared-for,
carers and staff, resulting from end of life care plans, better
communication and openness and understanding with patients and their
families. There is cross-party support both for people to have the
right to record their preferred place of death—the
“where” part of today’s question—and to
work towards free end of life social care for the terminally ill. Both
are very important developments.</hs_para>

terminally ill patients to choose when and how they should die. We have
always made it clear that this is a matter for Parliament to decide. It
is an individual matter of conscience and would be the subject of a
free vote. Today’s debate shows the strong and opposing views on
the issue. People’s views are strongly and sincerely held.
However, we must all acknowledge that high-profile court cases and the
impact of key interventions, such as the Director of Public
Prosecutions’ guidance, mean that public awareness, concern and
confusion is increasing. I am sorry that I have no more time. I look

would be disingenuous not to mention, as other noble Lords have done,
the Assisted Dying Bill. I note that the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Falconer of Thoroton, is in listening mode this afternoon. It was
introduced in May this year and seeks to legalise, in England and
Wales, assisted suicide for terminally ill, mentally competent adults
who are reasonably expected to die within six months. The Government
will take a collective view on the noble and learned Lord’s Bill
in order to respond to the debate on specific provisions, but not
before Second Reading. As things stand, however, no date has been set
for Second Reading, and today’s debate is not about specific
proposals. Rather, the question before us today is one of
principle—whether there are any circumstances in which it should
be legal to assist another person to
die<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:36:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000037">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:36:33"></hs_TimeCode>
is worth taking a moment to consider what we mean by “assisted
dying”. As several noble Lords have said, it is not a term that
exists in law per se. Rather, at times, it is a catch-all term and,
wherever you stand on the matter, it is sometimes used for either
assisted suicide or euthanasia or both. Both these areas of law raise
very difficult moral issues and they often form part of the same
debate. But there is an important distinction. Euthanasia, killing
someone for compassionate reasons and possibly on the request of that
person, constitutes murder in common law and carries a mandatory
sentence of life imprisonment. Helping another person to take his or
her own life is contrary to the statutory offence of encouraging or
assisting suicide and carries a maximum penalty of 14 years’
imprisonment. There is no offence, or defence, of mercy killing, nor is
there any exception to the offence under Section 2(1) of the Suicide
Act 1961<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:37:30"></hs_TimeCode>. As
noble Lords will know,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:37:34"></hs_TimeCode> Suicide Act
was amended by Section 59 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, but the
purpose was to clarify rather than change the law. By doing so,
Parliament confirmed that it should remain an offence to encourage or
assist
suicide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000038">The
Government’s view is that any change to the law in this area,
whether in relation to euthanasia or assisted suicide, is a matter of
individual conscience. It is, rightly, a matter for Parliament to
decide rather than for government policy. However one interprets 
<?notus-xml column=61?>the term, assisted dying is a highly emotive issue which polarises
opinion among the public, in the media and across the political
spectrum. It raises the most profound ethical, moral, social and
religious issues. As I am sure all noble Lords will agree, there are no
easy answers. I am, of course, acutely aware of opinion polls
suggesting that there is strong public support for a change in the law.
But even if one accepts that the law should change, there is no
consensus, in Parliament or elsewhere, on where a line should be drawn,
what safeguards should be put in place and for
whom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:38:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
We should not underestimate the magnitude of any change that says that
we can help people to kill themselves rather than helping them to
withstand their suffering. Even the most limited step in this respect
would represent a fundamental shift in the line that we have held to so
far on the ethics of helping people to
die<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:39:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000039">As
noble Lords have mentioned, much of the debate in recent months has
centred on individual, high-profile cases, such as those of Nicklinson
and Lamb v Ministry of Justice and AM v Director of Public
Prosecutions, in which the Court of Appeal gave judgment on
31 July. It would be a hard person indeed who is not deeply
moved by the terrible plight of those such as the late Tony Nicklinson,
who sought to challenge the legal ban on voluntary euthanasia, and Paul
Lamb, who took up that
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:39:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T14:39:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
They were, and are, faced with the sort of difficult choices that none
of us would ever want to make. As an appeal to the Supreme Court is
currently pending, noble Lords will understand that it would not be
appropriate for me to comment on that case or the related one of AM,
where the challenge is to prosecution policy.</hs_para>

some noble Lords have mentioned, we cannot lightly dismiss the fears of
some of the most vulnerable members of our society—sick and
disabled people who fear that a right to die could become almost a duty
to die. Whatever the arguments for and against change, I am sure all
noble Lords agree that sick and disabled people are entitled to the
same protection in law as everyone else. It is important that the

way to feel less

noble friend contends, as do others, that the law should be changed to
reflect what is regarded as prosecution practice. Other people believe
that the deterrent effect of the present law, combined with the
compassionate exercise of prosecutorial discretion, offers the best of
both worlds. The guidelines published in February 2010 by the former
DPP set out the factors that prosecutors in England and Wales will
consider when deciding whether it is in the public interest to
prosecute in cases of encouraging or assisting suicide.</hs_para>

the litigation currently before the courts, it is not appropriate for
me to comment on the merits or otherwise of prosecution policy. What I
can say, unequivocally, is that the DPP’s policy has not changed
the law. Only Parliament can do that. Nor does the policy mean that
cases of encouraging or assisting a suicide will not be prosecuted in
England and Wales. Assisted suicide remains a criminal offence. As with
all criminal offences, allegations of encouraging or assisting suicide
will be reviewed individually on the basis of their particular facts
and circumstances and against the criteria of the offence-specific
policy and of the general Code for Crown Prosecutors, with its two-part
test of sufficient evidence and public interest.</hs_para>

Buscombe (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased that we have
convened this short debate regarding copyright exceptions. This is an
important opportunity to focus upon a few key issues that remain of
real concern to the creative industries, notwithstanding many meetings
between the IPO, Ministers and stakeholders—I understand in the
region of 250 all together—together with impact assessments and
the sharing of early drafts of the statutory
instruments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000047">The
Government’s aim must be right—to increase the value of
copyright while supporting our creators and our freedom of speech. This
package of reforms is intended to enable non-commercial, pioneering
research, private study and teaching in schools and define the
parameters within which we, as consumers, can use 
<?notus-xml column=63?>what we have paid for. It is not directly concerned with
business-to-business licensing; it is, however, about making it easier
for businesses to provide new technologies without being held liable
for how consumers might use their products. While these reforms do not
expressly concern business-to-business licensing, the whole business
community is potentially
affected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000048">My
focus is on testing whether the legislation will do what is intended,
as opposed to allowing unintended consequences to flow from imprecise
drafting or a failure to future-proof innovation that could harm rights
holders. That is quite a challenge in itself. While there has been
extensive debate around exceptions, there remain areas where rights
holders continue to question whether applying an exception is the most
expedient way
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000049">I
begin with concerns regarding text and data mining. Given the speed of
technological advancement and innovation, some have suggested that the
exception route is rendered unsuited to protect rights holders and
suggest that, instead, digital market-based solutions to some of the
emerging issues around text and data mining would be better addressed
through improvements to licensing and technological standards. The
Government recognise that copyright needs to meet current and future
technological challenges. Is this achievable with the use of
exceptions? For example, while an exception may remove a
publisher’s exclusive right to prevent copying for the purposes
of text and data mining, a researcher’s ability to engage in the
activity across different publisher platforms is dependent upon there
being an alignment of technological and contractual standards and
practices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000050">Another
area of concern is provisions for contract override. I would welcome
reassurance from my noble friend the Minister on this point: while the
override on one level makes absolute sense, I can see a real conflict
where a contract runs the risk of including two contradictory
statements of what is and is not acceptable. For example, while the
purpose of the contract override is to ensure that contracts would be
rendered unenforceable if they restricted or prevented a relevant
exception, it is also the Government’s stated policy that
publishers should be able to maintain the ability to impose conditions
of access prior to the mining of works. In practice, surely this means
that the publisher can restrict the scope of an exception, in which
case, with the addition of a contract override, the whole contract
becomes unenforceable. Clarity and reassurance on this point would be
extremely helpful. Perhaps my noble friend the Minister could explain
why the proposed contract override provisions have not hitherto been
subject to their own separate consultation, discussion or economic
impact
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000051">A
further complication here relates to European law. I refer in
particular to the enforceability of technical protection measures as
set out in Article 6 of the copyright directive and Section 296ZA of
the Copyright Act. Copyright holders are permitted to restrict or
prevent certain acts through the use of technical protection measures
if certain criteria are met, in which case how does this work with
contract override?</hs_para>

clarity. For example, can my noble friend explain what is the
difference between “for the purposes of instruction”,
“non-commercial use” and “non-commercial
research”? In addition, the term “lawful access”
could be interpreted according to how the user might wish to access the
content. What is genuinely “non-commercial”? In other
words, the exception must not be used as an excuse to avoid obtaining a
licence. Will those in academia interpret this in the same way as
rights holders who need to earn their living?</hs_para>

further highlight the difficulty of definitions. Private exceptions
should be narrowly defined so that third-party aggregators cannot

a legal standpoint, I can see that there is a world of difference

if it is not made clear, a commercial production company could, for
example, use copyright footage for free, purely with the aim of
reducing production overheads of TV programmes and with no recompense
for the original creator. In essence, parody must be carefully defined
so that it cannot be used as an excuse to avoid licensing.</hs_para>

awareness is key. Consumer and rights holder confusion has to be
minimised to ensure that this legislation works in practice. Education
is of paramount importance, and I note that the Government are focusing
on this now through the IP awareness 
<?notus-xml column=65?>campaign, launched on 23 October, with multiple activities in the
pipeline over the next six months to promote awareness and the
importance of respecting copyright. I hope and assume that these
activities will not only explain the importance of copyright
protections but focus on how they are applied. Therefore, can the
Minister expand on plans to develop awareness, including from an
international perspective? Consumers, academics and commercial
enterprises, be the latter a sole trader or a large established user of
content for commercial gain, must know what they can and, more
importantly, cannot do with works that they have already paid

addition, IPO enforcement activity, including important reform of the
Intellectual Property Enterprise Court to bring about more expedient

responsibility. Clearly, the Government have a strong focus on this,

by third parties is the aim here; litigation as a result of these

finalising the drafting. All those potentially affected by this

conclusion, the Government agreed with Hargreaves that the copyright
system had not kept pace with the digital revolution and, in
particular, that the current framework means that a great many
intuitively acceptable activities are illegal or uncertain because they
involve an element of copying. The process of copying is at the heart
of many technologies being used by consumers, teachers, academics and
researchers in pursuit of entirely legitimate aims. These exceptions
must therefore ensure that, in seeking to legitimise private use,
imprecise drafting does not inadvertently or vicariously enable third
parties—or indeed the consumers themselves—to
commercially exploit and undermine the copyright system. I go back to
my first point: this package of reforms is about creating value from
copyright works. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to
achieve this laudable
aim.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/3FE170F5CFDFD285D6A836A85B22E3E1FEA442AA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

Warwick of Undercliffe (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, when we consider
our copyright regime, it is important that we do not do so in
isolation. We should also consider the reasons why we have a system of
copyright in the first place. If a system no longer serves those
purposes, it ought to be reformed. So what are the purposes of
copyright? I believe there is a general consensus that its aim should
be to create a fair balance between those who create material and those
who use it in order to allow this material to be used and to
incentivise the creation of new material, to the benefit of society as
a whole. A system with too little protection can result in a lack of
incentives to create 
<?notus-xml column=66?>and invest in new material. However, there can also be too much
protection—or perhaps, more accurately, inappropriate
protection—that places barriers in the way of those who want to
make reasonable use of copyrighted material and the information it
contains.</hs_para>

place restrictions on the use of material for the purposes of education
and research, upon which the creation of valuable new material in the
future relies, we need to be doubly sure that these restrictions are
proportionate and fair. Of course, nobody here today needs persuading
of the vital role played by education and research in economic growth,
although those wanting a refresh could read the transcript of
today’s debate that just finished half an hour ago in the main
Chamber. Having said that, I will focus my comments on examples where
the scope of current copyright exceptions is placing restrictions on
education and research, and where I believe that modernisation will
both stimulate the creation of valuable future material and benefit the
economy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120572000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000065">The
copyright exceptions that are currently on the statute books were
largely written in the 1980s. Since then, there has been a revolution
in the way in which we work, learn, study, research and communicate. In
particular, the exceptions relating to education are out of step with
how students learn in today’s universities, colleges and
schools. For example, there is a helpful-looking exception that means
copying works for the purposes of instruction does not infringe
copyright. Unfortunately, it also specifies that this cannot be done
through any reprographic process—that is, by photocopier or any
digital reproduction such as a PowerPoint presentation or an electronic
whiteboard. It is a law written for the age of blackboards, still
operating in the age of the iPad. It was never the aim or purpose of
this part of copyright legislation to prevent the use of modern
technology in our schools and universities, but that has been the
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000066">The
Government’s intention to reform this exception is very welcome.
They intend to do this by bringing forward a general “fair
dealing” exception. This will allow the law to catch up with
current practice. Because it is technology-neutral, it also means that
the law will be flexible enough to deal with tomorrow’s teaching
methods. However, the Government are also maintaining a far more
limited exception for reprographic copying for cases that are beyond
“fair dealing” of the work. This is fair, but I would be
grateful if the Minister could make clear that the exception for
instruction that the Government intend to bring forward will not
exclude all copying by reprographic
means.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000067">Another
area where the current copyright laws are out of date as a result of
technological advance is that of so-called “text and data
mining”. This is a process whereby large volumes of material are
automatically read in order that overarching trends can be identified
in a highly efficient manner. Assuming the researcher has the necessary
licences to access this material, the process is in theory entirely
legal. After all, it is not facts about the world that are protected by
copyright, but the way in which they are expressed. However, because
this method of research involves the automatic creation of a transitory
copy of works, specific licences are currently required. This is not
the case in other 
<?notus-xml column=67?>countries such as the USA, where text and data mining is considered fair
use of a copyrighted work; so in this country, the current lack
of an exception for text and data mining is holding
back research. Given the economic importance of the UK’s
research sector, it is also holding back economic growth. I should be
grateful if the Minister would confirm when he expects an exception for
these purposes to be in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000068">After
my brief contribution, I conclude by saying that we should never allow
the protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights to be
our only consideration in these debates. If our copyright regime is to
benefit our society and our economy, we need to make sure that it does
not place unnecessary barriers in the way of education and research.
The Government’s plans to reform copyright exceptions are
welcome steps towards removing these unnecessary
barriers.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120572000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000256">3.15

draft data analysis exception is a particular example of this. Most
recently, the International Association of Scientific, Technical and
Medical Publishers produced a commitment by
publishers  
<?notus-xml column=68?>to enable text and data mining for non-commercial scientific research.
Likewise, as regards consumers, a private copying exception should not
apply where a commercially available alternative exists. Nowhere is
that clearer than in the audiovisual sector. Products such as iTunes
and UltraViolet allow legal and secure access to that content through
the cloud among six family members for up to 12 personal devices,
thereby enabling format-shifting. At the same time, a multitude of new
digital audiovisual services has occurred under the existing legal
framework.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000073">It
could not be clearer that there is no market failure that needs
addressing here. The same is true for the quotation exception, where
publishers are already addressing the market via large-scale and
low-cost licensing technologies. Far from incentivising the market to
continue innovating in the interests of the consumer, it may well be
that the exceptions proposed will undermine the thriving market for new
and innovative digital content
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000074">As
regards business-to-business or institutions, each of the exceptions
include a provision that would render unenforceable contracts which
seek to restrict or prevent the relevant exception. Another new and
untested concept in UK copyright law, this has not received nearly
enough examination and consultation. From conversations I have had with
industry representatives, it is clear that at no point has any
substantial discussion been held. Even though the attendees of various
forums were led to believe that separate sessions would be held on this
issue, this did not transpire. Given their importance to all the
proposed SIs, why have the proposed contract override provisions not
been subject to a separate consultation and discussion? Override of
contract is not required by the copyright directive. Indeed, Article 9
states that the directive should be without prejudice to the law of
contract. It is unclear how the proposed provisions sit alongside these
or why it is felt to be necessary. There is also the question, which I
hope the Minister will answer, of why wording already in place within
Section 50 of the CDPA cannot be used to address the apparent
concern.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120572000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000075">The
IPO has failed to set out a compelling case for why the provisions are
required and exactly what problems they solve. Rather than encourage
innovation, these provisions will encourage challenge and breach of
existing licensing terms put in place for users of copyright works. The
Publishers Association makes the important point that British creators
will now be put at a significant competitive disadvantage as investors
turn away from the UK and invest in content made in other
jurisdictions. Has the Minister undertaken any analysis of the impact
of this on the UK’s competitive position? The proposed
exceptions potentially run into conflict with the ability of rights
holders to ensure the enforceability of technical protection measures.
It is unclear from the current drafting how this will interact with the
proposed provisions on contract override. The most probable outcome is
consumer, business and rights holder
confusion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000076">These
are all substantial objections. In the ordinary way these fundamental
amendments to sections of the CDPA would be dealt with by discussion in

on the broad objections to the exceptions, it seems that some
exceptions may not even comply with EU law. The private copying
exception, as currently proposed, would not provide any compensation to
rights holders for harm that private copying might inflict on them. How
confident are the Government that this will survive legal challenge?
Why have the Government chosen to ignore the ruling in the Padawan
case, which makes it clear that member states must, when introducing a
private copying exception, include a mechanism for calculating
compensation, even if the subsequent calculation is that that
compensation is zero? How does the private copying exception square

Berkeley of Knighton (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to
the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, for initiating this important and
timely debate. Personally, and speaking as a composer, I am always
touched and flattered that people want to listen to my music and even
to copy it. Sadly, though, I and my colleagues and the people who play,
publish and record our music cannot live on flattery. If we were
shopkeepers, it would be like allowing the public to come into our shop
and help themselves to items without paying. Whenever we point this
out, we are told that new methods will be adopted to recompense us.
Historically, change has inevitably led to a cut in income. The
creative industries are projected to be worth around £36 billion
to the UK economy. They have withstood our recent economic problems and
are well placed to contribute to UK growth. I regret that this
contribution could be threatened by some of the less well thought out
proposals to modernise copyright exceptions that we are considering
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000080">I would
like to focus my remarks on two of the proposed exceptions and
demonstrate how they could have a detrimental impact on our music
industry. The UK music industry is one of only three net exporters of
music content in the world. We are world leaders in the number of
licensed digital services, providing fans and consumers with many ways
to enjoy music. Intellectual property is the framework that underpins
success for the music industry and copyright is the currency of that
framework. Copyright provides businesses with an incentive to invest in
music and allows musicians and composers to derive an income from their
creativity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000081">However,
it is a fact that some 78% of the sector earn less than £20,000
a year. It is very hard for young musicians and composers to get a
foothold in the industry. Any loss of income from losing the right to 
<?notus-xml column=70?>be compensated for the copying of one’s work will be
incrementally more damaging in today’s environment for musicians
and composers and makes such careers less feasible. Research conducted
by music industry body UK Music concluded that consumers ascribe
between 32% and 53% of the value of an MP3 player to its ability to
copy music. Yet music rights holders never see any of this value, as
the exception and compensations are not in place here.</hs_para>

their intention not to provide compensation under this exception on two
grounds. First, they argue that rights holders are pricing in the
ability to private copy at the point of sale. That argument is,
however, undermined by the Intellectual Property Office’s own
research produced to support that policy. In the case of music, the
research said:</hs_para>

the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee recently concluded that
it does not share the Government’s acceptance that a facility

devices that store, play or copy
it.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13120572000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000084">The
second argument the Government put forward is that there will be no
harm as the exception is narrow. Will the Government tell us just how
narrow this exception is compared with other countries with an
exception? Prompted by a question from Kerry McCarthy MP in the other
place in October 2013, the Government provided evidence published in
2007 on different exceptions across the world. From this information it
appears that only Poland and the Czech Republic have wider exceptions
than the Government’s draft. Other countries have exceptions
that are just as narrow as the one proposed in the UK, yet they are all
accompanied by compensatory schemes. Do the Government have any
up-to-date information that they can share with the Committee? How will
we be
compensated?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000085">There
does need to be a change in the law to reflect what consumers are doing
with music that they have legitimately purchased for their own personal
use. However, to progress with this policy, the Government have to take
two steps. First, there needs to be a specific provision for a
compensatory scheme. Secondly, the exception should be redrafted in
such a way that it is narrower, applying only to the copying of a
physical copy and not interfering with the licensing of the potentially
valuable cloud services market. To proceed with the exception as
currently understood would be a grave mistake. It would undermine the
system across Europe and exclude us from being involved in the reform
of the levy system
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000086">The
second and final exception I want to discuss concerns the important
subject of education. For publishers of sheet music, “fair
dealing” is a vague term unlikely to be understood by consumers,
the vast majority of whom are self-employed music teachers and
students. This term will cause massive uncertainty. Music publishers
have neither the financial resources nor the inclination to take
individual music teachers or students to court to have this clarified.
The Government should reconsider this exception in light of the
detrimental impact it could have on this culturally significant 
<?notus-xml column=71?>business. What safeguards do the Government propose to put in place to
protect providers of specialist material who are dependent on teachers
purchasing
it?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000087">In
conclusion, we have a music industry to be proud of. It generates
significant revenues, provides jobs, invests in talent and exports
globally. When industries are as successful as this one is, it is easy
to take them for granted. However, I firmly believe that this industry
deserves to be respected and congratulated, just like all the others
that succeed. The negative impacts for the music industry that I have
outlined need to be addressed before the exceptions are introduced into
law.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/95E170232AA5A39F47DA7A8FFAC0604EFACF6090" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

Stoneham of Droxford (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my
noble friend Lady Buscombe on initiating this debate and welcome the
Government’s ongoing initiative to modernise and try to simplify
our copyright provisions. We clearly need to update the law in line
with technological developments. There is some evidence that we have
been falling behind our competitors and have not made much progress, as
we should have done, since the European copyright directive was
introduced more than 10 years ago. It is yet another area where the
European Union dimension illustrates that we can achieve little on our
own as one country. We have to develop our practice in line with other
nations to protect our businesses and to counter the power of
international companies which seek to ignore and override national
legislation and, indeed, taxation policies.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120572000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000089">It is a big
responsibility to protect our own creative sector. There is huge
potential to benefit from our very competitive creative arts sector.
The European digital music market alone has grown from €200
million in 2004 to €1.2 billion in 2012. The existing copyright
framework and efforts within the European Union to improve cross-border
access to licensed content on a pan-European basis have enabled this to
be possible and for UK music creators and companies to be a fundamental
part of this successful development. However, on 10 October 2013, Maria
Martin-Prat, head of the copyright unit in the European Commission
internal market directorate-general, warned that if we get the
copyright framework wrong, we risk undermining the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000090">There
are a number of reasons for reform. First, we have to ensure respect
for copyright, which modern copyright legislation must do, reflecting
the application of modern technology and consumer expectation. It
clearly makes sense, as the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, said, to
allow a teacher to use a quotation on an interactive whiteboard or to
allow a museum to copy a photograph or film digitally to preserve
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120572000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000091">Secondly,
we need to give consumers choice. We should value and encourage the
consumer who obtains content legally and should break down barriers to
competition, which discourage market delivery and choice. A greater
freedom of choice for consumers to use appropriate technology must be
encouraged. While clear and fair costs should be appropriate, we should
discourage excessive charging or levies.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=72?><hs_para UID="13120572000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000092">Thirdly, we need to keep
the UK competitive. Improving copyright law must fundamentally improve
the health of UK technology and creative arts businesses. Allowing
copying for personal use will make it easier for businesses to provide
new technology without being held liable for how consumers use their
products. Allowing limited use of copyright material for parody will
widen the resources for programmers and broadcasters, further enriching
our cultural output. I sense that the Government have the right formula
on parody as they seem to have the support of our principal
broadcasters, which want greater freedom to use material for parody,
while they have an interest in protecting their own content and
archives.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120572000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000093">Fourthly, we should be
pioneering research. New technologies can assist significant advances
in research. The text and data-mining exception will allow the United
Kingdom’s world-leading scientific and academic communities to
deliver new advances in medical technology and
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000094">I
will make a few remarks on the detail of the proposed draft exceptions.
I expect that there is little dispute over the disability exception or,
indeed, over the research libraries and archives exception, which needs
simplification to preserve content and improve access. The provision
for education seeks to modernise legislation, but the problem for the
future is that education is not simply a public good. It has strong
commercial potential as well. We have a highly competitive advantage in
higher education. Licensing is required to protect teaching content,
particularly as it becomes more digitally sourced and with the growth
of distance
learning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000095">On
private copying, most people accept the need for an individual to be
allowed to copy copyright work for their own further use, provided it
is not for commercial use. However, as we have heard, the music
industry in particular is concerned about revenues that it has already
lost in the digital economy and about the development of cloud
services. This exception could provide a further threat to copyright
music. It has to be made absolutely clear that making a copy for
another person or entity would infringe copyright. The scope of an
exception should be only for private and personal storage without
additional functionality. Within this clarification, the music
industry’s ability to license innovative value-added services,
such as “scan and match” services in the cloud, would be
seriously circumscribed. I hope that the Minister will confirm that he
will look further at the music industry’s concerns about the
need for further clarification and the whole impact of cloud
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000096">I
return to my home ground of news content and the exception on
quotations. Media providers are concerned about Google seeking to widen
the exception on quotations, which could increase the likelihood of
copyright infringement. It would be preferable for the quotation
exception to be cast as a list of specific permitted purpose-based
activities. Explicit exception for criticism and reviews should be
retained as an exception in its own right. However, there is great
concern that the quotation exception could include the principle of
temporary copies made for the purpose of browsing by an unlicensed
end-use, something that 
<?notus-xml column=73?>would be further complicated by cloud-based services. I hope that the
Minister will be able to reassure us on these
points in his summing
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000097">In
conclusion, change, modernisation and simplification are inevitable.
Copyright has to adapt to technology of the present and the future. We
have to adjust to allow businesses to develop, but we must protect the
competitive advantage of our creative businesses while seeking to
simplify regulation, if we can. The Government are treading a
difficult, even-handed path across a minefield. Provided that they
ensure the fine print of the exceptions and reassure our key creative
art providers, particularly in music and news content, about their
worries their reforms are to be
welcomed.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120572000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000259">3.36

O'Neill of Bengarve (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, with the leave of the
Committee, I shall speak briefly in the gap. I had my name down for the
debate but, apparently, it did not arrive. I wish to make just one
point. I declare an interest as someone who, 40 years ago, had a
royalty income, but who now has 10 times as much in print and only a
vestigial royalty income. Why has that happened? There are many reasons
for that but, above all, it illustrates the point that copyright
holders and creators are no longer the same people. We should not
fantasise that we are protecting creators when we protect copyright
holders. Publishers have been wiser and have taken wider and wider
rights over other people’s work. That means that protecting
copyright owners will not incentivise new creation because we are
pointing in the wrong
direction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000099">In
the area of academic work, where I work, publications in STEM subjects
are grant funded and they may be viewed as fully funded from the public
purse. Beyond the STEM subjects, this is rare. Research in other areas
is not grant funded. I hope that the Minister can tell us a little
about what incentive will remain for creators who survive and are faced
with the new
exceptions.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120572000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000260">3.37

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, for securing this debate and congratulate her
on her very lucid introduction to the issues. I do not think this
debate was quite what the Minister meant when he offered us a chance to
have what I think he called in essence a Second Reading debate around
the batch of exceptions that are being brought forward. None the less,
it is welcome and I thank all noble Lords for their
contributions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000101">As
happens when you talk about intellectual property, we have also had a
veritable raft of submissions from those outside. As I am sure the
Minister is aware, this area is extremely well watched out there. Those
of us who dare to put our heads above the parapet to speak about it
tend to get a deluge of papers and material which make for interesting,
but rather long, reading. However, that shows that this is a really
important
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000102">What
problem are the Government trying to solve? As the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Neill, has just said, the issue here is trying to find the
right balance—that is,  
<?notus-xml column=74?>the link— between a premium for innovation and an assurance that
there will be access to material, or, as my noble friend Lady Warwick
said, between allowing material to be used while not losing the
incentive to create. This is compounded by what many people call a
rather too prescriptive European and international legislative
framework, where the only margin of appreciation to reflect local
interests or local markets is to take action through exceptions. This
is why Professor Hargreaves called for a broader and deeper review of
this whole area in his report. Sadly, that has not yet happened, and I
think that we will have to return to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000103">Underlying
some of the concern out there in the real world is the worry about
exactly what timetable and process we have to go through. I would be
grateful if the Minister will say when the Government intend to lay the
SIs, whether the exceptions will be bundled when they are laid before
Parliament and, if not, whether they will be laid all at once or in
stages. Do the Government still expect all of them to come into force
on one date? Is that date April 2014? Will further impact
assessments—several noble Lords have mentioned this—be
prepared and be ready for the House to consider when the SIs are
laid?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000104">I take
from this debate that, while some of the exceptions that have been
proposed—some noble Lords have mentioned them—are good
and supported and will not cause difficulty when they are implemented,
some are so hampered by the quality of the current drafting or because
of their inability to deal with some of the technological issues that
have been raised that more work will still need to be done to get them
right. In particular, I think that the text and data-mining exception,
mentioned by several noble Lords and particularly by the noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, needs to be re-examined carefully. The parody
and pastiche exception seems to many people to be underdeveloped, and
it needs further work. I do not think that people are against the idea
of there being such an exception, particularly given the specifics of
British humour, but it is important that, if it is there, it is defined
properly.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120572000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000105">We
had several contributions on the education exception. It is clear that
there is a need for change here in order that the exception, or indeed
the practice, in the world of education is made internet-ready. Of
course, if we are still in the age of blackboards then we need to move
on that and make sure that we deal with all the points, including those
about reprographics.</hs_para>

remuneration, the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley of Knighton, made a very
powerful plea for further consideration of whether the remuneration
cycle has been lost in the process of bringing forward the exception.
The noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, mentioned quotations and the concerns in
that regard in regional and other presses. Again, I think that that
should be looked at.</hs_para>

think that these things are broadly in the right place, except that
there are some cross-cutting issues, including the very important point
about the contract override. I think that what the Government are
intending to do there is clear but the current drafting does not
provide the necessary assurance.</hs_para>

process is a combination of failure to listen carefully to what people
who work in the industry are saying and imprecise drafting. The noble
Baroness, Lady Buscombe, said that it should  be “tight
and right”, and I agree with her. There will  be an
awful lot of problems if we do not get this right and, of course, the
downside of even getting it right may well be that there are unintended
consequences that need to be brought through.</hs_para>

in mind is that, in focusing hard on the wording that we currently have
and thinking through where it might end up, we also have to think hard
about where the public are on this issue. There is an element of a need
for common sense on this point. The submission received from
<I>Which?</I> a few days ago was very good on this. It tried to outline
where the public are in their perception of what copyright does and
does not permit in relation to private copying. The problem which it
did not specifically raise, but which I think still exists, is that, if
the Government are unable to provide the right framework for the
legislation, there is a real danger that people will simply ignore it,
and nobody will win on that
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000110">It
seems to me that what the Minister has to do now is to offer a further
round of discussions on the current drafts. That should be possible and
there is time for such discussions. That would give us a chance to make
sure that the wording that is causing such concern at the moment is
looked at once more. Given that the Secretary of State apparently held
a meeting on these issues as recently as this week, it seems that the
door is still open, and I hope that the Minister will confirm that that
is the
case.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/329557E2ECA7D57646BAB0A806707A8EB5A8BB43" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

ever, try to respond to all the issues raised. To begin, I would like
to make a few general points. The Government know that in this area
views are divided and that not everyone will be pleased all the time.
The focus must continue to be on what we believe is good for industry,
consumers and growth. The copyright system supports growth by offering
incentives to creators and investors. This serves the public interest
by stimulating the creation of new copyright works. At the same time,
the system needs to serve the reasonable needs of the whole range of
businesses and individuals affected by it. Everyone has an interest
here, and the Government have done their best to hear everyone’s
views.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000117">The
creative industries are a vital part of the UK economy and its culture.
We have heard today about some of their concerns. The exceptions we
will ask Parliament to approve are designed not to undermine
business-to-business licensing. They will not harm the ability of
content-owners to provide additional services to consumers in new and
exciting ways. For example, the licensing of services such as
UltraViolet and Tune Match will be unaffected.</hs_para>

suggests that the copyright system has simply not kept pace with the
digital revolution. My noble friend Lady Buscombe mentioned this.
Copying is at the heart of many new technologies being used by
consumers, teachers, academics, curators and researchers. As a result,
a great many innocent, reasonable activities are illegal or
questionably legal, simply because they involve some element of
copying. The law needs to change. For example, a teacher should be able
to put a quote on an interactive whiteboard in order to illustrate a
point to the class; a museum should be able to make a copy of a film in
order to preserve it for posterity; and somebody who has bought a CD
should be able to copy it to their MP3 player in order to listen to
their music in the gym. Changes are needed if users and creative
industries alike are to make the most of technology. The Government
have proposed relatively small but important changes that will apply to
all technologies, including technology yet to be invented. We do not
want out-of-date laws to restrict people’s use of new
technologies and
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000119">We
have also listened to concerns about complex copyright law. The
proposed changes will remove up to 45 pages of unnecessary rules and
regulations from the statute book while maintaining the essential
protections that creative industries need and want. These changes 
<?notus-xml column=77?>should make copyright works more valuable to all by giving users clarity
about their rights and building respect for copyright in the process.
Creators stand to gain from these changes, particularly where they are
innovating. Users will have new de minimis rights, but if they want to
do more than those rights allow, they will need a licence.</hs_para>

shall start by answering a question asked by my noble friend Lady

next steps. Following the technical review, the next iteration of the
regulations is with parliamentary counsel, which is where we are now.
They will then be subject to approval by me and the Secretary of State
Vince Cable. The Government’s aim is to lay
regulations in time for the common commencement date in April 2014.
This means that it is likely that regulations will be laid before
Parliament in February 2014. The noble Baroness, Lady Warwick, asked
when the exception for text and data mining will be in place. On that
question of timing, as with the rest of the package, the Government

question of contract override, the Government want to see these
benefits delivered in full. This is why they believe that, where a
copyright exception has been established, restrictions should not be
reimposed by contracts. My noble friend Lady Buscombe raised this
subject, asking why the contract override provisions had not been
subject to their own separate consultation and discussion. The contract
override provisions were initially proposed in the Hargreaves review,
and were subsequently consulted on explicitly by the
Government’s copyright consultation which ran, as I mentioned
earlier, between December 2011 and March 2012. Following that process,
the contract override provisions were also discussed at each of the
open meetings held during the technical review period. Given the
attention and consideration that has been given to these
provisions—in multiple sessions and consultations—the
Government believe that this element of policy has been properly and
thoroughly discussed.</hs_para>

Clement-Jones asked why the existing wording in Section 50 of the CDPA
was not used. The existing wording in Section 50A, which must be read
together with Section 296A, allows the making of backup copies of
computer programmes. This provision declares void any contract terms
that seek to prevent this activity. Our approach to this issue in the
present context is slightly different. It does not void contract terms,
but instead renders the terms unenforceable and only does so to the
extent that they restrict a permitted act. Taking the approach from
Section 50A of rendering the term void would be a disproportionate
measure in many cases, and we believe is unnecessary here.</hs_para>

Clement-Jones also asked whether I was confident that the proposed
contract override provisions were fully consistent with the
Government’s obligations under the information society
directive. The answer to that is in the affirmative; the directive is
clear that the ability of member states to implement domestic
provisions affecting contract law is unrestricted. My noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones also asked in the same context why such a fundamental
change to the application of UK contract law was being made by
secondary legislation. This is not a new concept in British copyright
law: contract override clauses exist already in relation to a number of
exceptions and we believe that this is a sensible and proportionate
approach that has no broader impact beyond allowing the use of these
copyright exceptions by their intended audience.</hs_para>

important subject of impact assessments. The Government have worked
hard to ensure that the proposed changes were based on evidence. The

raised by a number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord,
Lord Berkeley. The noble Lord asked for clarification about the
exception for private copying for personal use. This measure will give

bought, by allowing them to make copies for their own use. We believe
it is a commonsense change which is widely supported by consumers and

Rendell of Babergh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest
as a vice-president of Shelter, the homelessness charity. On release
from prison, finding a home may be the biggest problem facing
ex-offenders. Fewer social rented homes are available to meet demand
and, with deposits for mortgages out of reach of those on low incomes,
private renting may be the only
option.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000135">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:00:25"></hs_TimeCode>
2011, the prison population in England and Wales reached a record high
of 88,000. Ex-offenders are more likely to be male, young and have
children under 18 when they enter prison compared to 38% of the general
population. They are also likely to be socially excluded, economically
disadvantaged and much more likely than the general population to have
a mental health problem. They are likely to have grown up in care or in
a disadvantaged family. Around half were found to have a history of
debt problems. Four in 10 offenders lack financial services such as
bank
accounts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000136">Before
going to prison, 11% of ex-offenders owned a home, while just over
one-third rented; 16% were homeless, either sleeping rough or in
temporary accommodation; and others were living rent free with a
friend, paying board in someone else’s home, or living with
family and in shared ownership housing. Offenders are less likely than
the general population to have a home before entering prison and it is
often not 
<?notus-xml column=80?>clear where they will go when they leave. A 2008 study by the Ministry
of Justice surveyed nearly 5,000 offenders and combined the results
with reoffending records over a number of years. The study concluded
that ex-offenders were more likely to reoffend when they had a problem
with both employment and housing. Figures also show that offenders who
are homeless upon entering prison have a much higher reconviction rate
within one year of release, more than three-quarters being reconvicted.
Ex-offenders themselves report that homelessness is a principal cause
of reoffending, and the St Giles Trust in its through-the-gate advice
service identified homelessness as often being a key factor in
reoffending. There is evidence that prisoners who have accommodation
arranged on release are four times more likely to have employment,
education or training arranged once they leave prison than those who do
not have accommodation in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000137">What
sort of housing advice do ex-offenders receive? It seems that housing
needs assessments are not conducted in a consistent way because they
are carried out by a diverse range of people, including prison
officers, probation officers and voluntary sector staff. A survey found
that just one in five initial assessments is carried out by housing
specialists. A recent Homeless Link study revealed a big variation in
support received by those in different parts of the country. A number
of organisations provide housing advice within prisons. Shelter has
developed its prison advice services with a peer mentor model, meaning
that existing prisoners are given skills and responsibilities alongside
professional housing advisers. Some housing and support providers, such
as Stonham, provide their own supported accommodation for ex-offenders.
Once offenders have left prison, they will also have access to a range
of housing advice available to the general public, through Citizens
Advice or the Shelter helpline. In the
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:00:38"></hs_TimeCode> to October
2012, Shelter services outside prison were contacted by at least 920
ex-offenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000138">Evidence
from Homeless Link suggests that housing advice is most effective when
advisers work closely with probation staff, local authority contacts
and other advisers. Evidence from the St Giles Trust shows that
ex-offenders value being met at the prison gates by service staff to
help sort out immediate accommodation issues. However, many barriers
are faced by ex-offenders in finding or retaining an existing home on
release from prison, such as shortage of housing with support needs,
not meeting the criteria for local authority support through homeless
legislation, difficulties in accessing the private rented sector, often
due to affordability, and the prejudice of landlords against
ex-offenders and benefit
claimants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

leaving prison after serving a short sentence may be able to prevent
eviction by continuing to communicate with their landlord or bank.
Failure  to do this is a major cause of ex-offenders losing
their home while in prison. Advisers can make this contact to prevent
the loss of a tenancy or to terminate a tenancy to prevent a build-up
of rent arrears.</hs_para>

Ex-offenders in general are younger and poorer than the general
population and much less likely to own a home. More than half are
reliant on welfare to support their income. They can 
<?notus-xml column=81?>lose their secure social homes when in prison if they build up rent
arrears or have been convicted of certain related offences. The
Prevention of Social Housing Fraud Act 2012 could prevent social
tenants in prison sub-letting their homes to avoid rent arrears. Secure
social tenancies are of particular value to more vulnerable people in
helping them to rebuild their lives. Some councils are already
introducing two-year contracts for young people and suggesting that
people with convictions could be excluded from social housing
altogether.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000141">Private
renting is fast becoming the only realistic option for ex-offenders,
especially in London and the south-east. Evidence collected by Shelter
and Crisis shows that some ex-offenders value the chance to move away
from their old networks as this can help them to avoid offending and
substance misuse. Evidence from Homeless Link suggests that
ex-offenders can struggle to maintain private rented tenancies due to
landlords’ attitudes, while the cost of starting a tenancy can
be well over
£1,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000142">Sweeping
changes to welfare and a reduction in the number of rented homes will
affect many people. It is vital that housing advice services for
prisoners and those commissioning them respond to the challenges.
Prison Service commissioners must make best use of the evidence on
housing and reoffending when making the decisions, particularly bearing
in mind how stable accommodation reduces reoffending. Housing for
Women’s Re-Unite project has found that 38% of women prisoners
expect to be homeless on release. Access to support for them is rarely
available, but without it the 1,700 children separated from their
mothers due to imprisonment will often remain in
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000143">Commissioners
should consider what sort of housing advice is available in each prison
and who is providing it. The outcomes and effectiveness of the initial
housing needs assessment that each prisoner is given should be
considered. Shelter services have discovered that including other
prisoners to help deliver a service can encourage greater participation
from new prisoners. This happens in Sweden, a country with a population
that is a fraction of ours, where prisoners share in the running of
prisons and help in finding post-prison accommodation as a matter of
course. In the UK, those prisoners helping in the service benefit as
well in that they develop new skills and build self-esteem. Evidence
from Homeless Link suggests an integrated approach to advice—for
instance, by addressing mental health problems along with housing
difficulties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:08:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/967C1EBD8A401CBC109DA65C86B556C6CA2AE911" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

Linklater of Butterstone (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am most
grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, for tabling this short
debate on an issue of real concern to those of us who take an interest
in the effective management and resettlement of offenders. “A
roof, a relationship and a job: the key goals in future
planning” is the old jingle I used to hear in this context when
I was a social worker and the release of prisoners was being discussed.
All three are equally important and interdependent but are difficult
and often illusive when you are at that difficult sharp end, either as
the soon-to-be 
<?notus-xml column=82?>ex-prisoner or the service provider. Turning hopes and plans into
reality on which so much depends can be an unnerving process at best
and if not realised can result in a return journey to jail.</hs_para>

focuses on accommodation as the key element in the triad of issues.
Finding a job when you have nowhere to go is a crucial and sometimes
desperate process. Where are you going to live? Without a job, how do
you pay the rent? How do you get a job without an address? You often
have to do this without a partner, or with one who does not want
you.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000146">An MoJ
study in 2012 found that 15% of prisoners were homeless before custody.
Of these, the majority stated that they would need help to find
somewhere to live, but 79% of this group were reconvicted within a year
of release compared with 47% of those with accommodation before
custody. The key fact is that prisoners who have accommodation arranged
for them on release are four times more likely to get employment,
education or training than those who do not. The NOMS annual report
last year showed that 12% of prisoners released from custody had no
settled accommodation. That is likely to be an underestimate as the
arrangements made for them have often turned out to be very fragile or
temporary. The link between homelessness and further reoffending is
clear but, with accommodation in place, the reduction in reoffending is
also clear.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120572000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000147">The trouble is that
there is no statutory provision of resettlement support or housing
advice in prisons. I have been in prisons where such support or advice
is locally organised or some voluntary organisation has a presence and
can give advice, but it falls to the individual prisons and the right
personnel, which might include prison resettlement workers and
sometimes prisoners trained to give housing advice. However, it seems
to be a case of pot luck. NOMS does not keep a central body of
information. Services may be locally and/or regionally commissioned,
but affordable suitable housing, including hostels, which are often
oversubscribed, is hard to come by, even with professional help.
Although local councils have a duty to provide information about local
housing options, what is on offer is often no more than bed and
breakfast. Social housing requires proof of a local connection, which
is often very difficult to demonstrate, and proof of need over

other crucial issue for an ex-prisoner is a job, and that is extremely
difficult without an address. Citizens Advice found that one-quarter of
employers would not consider employing a homeless person. Accessing
benefits or registering with a GP is equally hard. There are localised
beacons of hope, of course, and these were referred to by the noble
Baroness, Lady Rendell. The St Giles Trust is one such organisation. It
runs a through-the-gate programme of intensive help, with trained
caseworkers who are often ex-prisoners. They provide expert help with
impressive outcomes, cutting the reoffending rate by 40%. The London
Probation Trust offers a similar service. The roof and job aspects of

the probation service will be reduced to three specific areas, which do

knowledge, expertise and protocols in working with local authorities.
Can he tell the Committee how the new community rehabilitation
companies, which have not yet given any information on how they will
work with local authorities over their ongoing rehabilitation and
housing aims, can take over this role? How can he ensure that the
challenging accommodation and rehabilitation needs of this particular
vulnerable group of ex-prisoners will be properly and effectively met

Massey of Darwen (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend
Lady Rendell of Babergh for introducing this debate and for her

well known that most offenders have multiple problems: illiteracy,
mental health and substance misuse issues, for example. We also know
that the percentage of those reoffending after being in prison is
unacceptably high. Many factors contribute to this, and, as we have
heard, accommodation is one of them.</hs_para>

Third Sector Research Centre at the University of Southampton reminds
us that about a third of offenders are homeless before or after
imprisonment, and that housing is a key factor in reoffending rates.
The research recommends that strong relationships between housing
advice agencies and local authorities should be built. Some prisons do
now have links with third sector organisations, and some have a
dedicated housing adviser. There are problems. Sometimes local
authorities put up barriers to prisoner resettlement. They may judge
ex-offenders ineligible for housing because they are said to be
“intentionally homeless”, or they fail to inform their
landlord of a sentence or they commit an offence. They may be
considered ineligible due to unacceptable behaviour and may not be
judged a priority. Prisoners can be moved to any area in the country
but are eligible for housing only in their own area. Moving people
around can cause multiple and severe problems. For example, a substance
misuser’s record of treatment may not always follow that person
immediately; the system becomes clogged up. I know that this system has
become somewhat more efficient—and I shall say more in a minute
about integrated services—but a prisoner with special needs,
such as substance misuse, should surely be monitored as a priority, and
an intervention plan should follow him or her.</hs_para>

developments may make matters worse. Welfare reform will affect housing
benefit, and funding cuts to the criminal justice
system may reduce housing support in prisons. The Localism Act 2011
gives local authorities more permission to exclude new applicants. The
removal of ring-fencing for the Supporting People budget could limit
pathway programmes for those with multiple needs and could affect help
with services, with supported accommodation and towards independent
living. Will the Minister comment on this?</hs_para>

substance misuse, there are now a range of substance misuse residential
treatment providers who are ready, willing and able to provide
treatment and accommodation as an alternative to a custody package.
Several of these providers have been developing their expertise in this
area over the past few years and are now expert in the rehabilitation
of offenders who are also substance misusers. The staff teams of such
providers are generally made up of people who have been in prison
and/or are substance misusers themselves. As such, they can show that
recovery is possible and lives can be turned around. Accommodation such
as this is more effective than hostels, where recovery is impossible if
the residents are chaotic and still drinking or using drugs. The 2012
drug strategy set out a plan to focus on recovery for addicts and this
was reflected in the guidelines issued to prisons in 2010, which stated
that prisoners sentenced to more than six months should work towards
becoming drug free. Prisoners were asked what worked. Integrated
services in prison involving treatment, relationships, employment and
housing were given as reasons for recovery and for reducing
reoffending.</hs_para>

Lord Bishop of Derby:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the
noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, on securing this debate. I begin with a
local perspective.  I work in the city of Derby, and this time
last year I organised the Redfern Commission, which brought people
together to look at how citizens can help each other improve and
develop the quality of life as the welfare state begins to recede. One
of the sessions we had was about the police and the probation services.
Some of the local statistics develop some of the insights already
offered. Offenders, we were told, were more likely to have been in
care, be unemployed, have been a truant, have family members convicted
of crime, have writing and numeracy skills below that of an 11
year-old, be a drug user or have two or more mental disorders. That is
a very complex set of issues for any person to deal with. The key thing
for somebody like that is stability, and accommodation is at the root
of stability of place and stability of relationship.</hs_para>

locally 60% of short-term prisoners and 50% of all prisoners
reoffended, but only 35% of those who did community
service did. That again says something about stability, relationships
and putting the person in a bigger context than just being left to
their own devices. In Derby, there is an organisation I am proud to be
associated with called Derventio. It works with the homeless,
especially ex-offenders. I want to read from a letter from a young
woman who has been helped by this organisation. She

want to name four or five issues that the Minister might like to
comment on as we look at this issue in more detail. How do we get
better liaison between those giving housing advice in prison and those
who organise local government housing allocation? How do we get a
better dialogue and joined-up thinking, not least with all the
different policies that local authorities have? In my experience, and I
visit a couple of prisons locally, too many prisoners lack information
and too many people who might try to help them on the outside do not
really know the extent of prisoners’ vulnerability and the
problems they face. I echo the comments from the noble Baroness, Lady
Linklater, about how that is going to be delivered with the changes in
the probation service. How are we going to assess prisoners’
vulnerability better and how are we give them better advice when in
prison and as they come out about housing?</hs_para>

are stopped when somebody is in prison. Would it not be much better to
suspend them? In the crucial time after somebody leaves prison, having
to get re-established to claim benefits means that without support,
particularly with accommodation, they are susceptible to falling into
bad ways. There could also be much better training in prison about the
management of money and the responsibilities of being a tenant. These
are basic things that, in my experience, people are not up to speed
with. Prisoners often have no deposit to enter the private rental
sector which, as we have heard, may be one of the few places open to
them. Could there be a targeted grant scheme with a negotiation about
who would receive the grant and what they would give in return? Quite
frankly, that small investment would be much better than the colossal
expenditure if people reoffend and go back into the system.</hs_para>

offer support to some of the prisoners I meet when I visit. It reminds
me that we need to be more proactive in linking with agencies with
expertise in housing and accommodation. It seems to me that the
connection between housing and a lower reoffending rate is clear and it
would be in the interests of government, society and prisoners if we
could maximise the enabling of people leaving prison to be housed,
giving stability of place and of relationship.</hs_para>

Judd (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I also thank my noble friend Lady
Rendell for introducing this vital debate. It always seems to me that
if we were starting with a plain sheet of paper for policy we would
have a penal system that looked nothing like the one we have at the
moment. I believe that it would also be much more economic to operate.
As we have heard, many prisoners have mental health problems, come from
dysfunctional families or have been in the company of the worst
elements of society. They have lived a nightmare, after which it would
be quite difficult to imagine them ending up anywhere but in
prison.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000162">Their
release from prison, when it comes, is a very crucial and sensitive
area, as we have been hearing. Accommodation is vital, but they also
desperately need human relationships—people who will take their
hands and walk back with them into rehabilitation. This is a vital
issue. Surely, rehabilitation must be central to our penal system. It
matters not just for the individuals but economically for society. It
certainly matters for the well-being, security and living conditions of
ordinary people in their own society. We want fewer criminals around,
so we want the rehabilitation process to be
successful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000163">I

report recognised that men and women released from prison with no home

disempowering, because of stringent terms and conditions, especially
those which exclude them from employment. They said they would rather
spend their sentence  in prison. While the women in the
research sample said that they felt safe and looked after in hostel
accommodation, they were nevertheless frequently moved away from
existing family networks to be accommodated, due to the poor geographic
spread of
hostels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000165">Is it

report points out that sentenced prisoners are often released with no
accommodation and no job. The Government announced, in the
comprehensive spending review, that JSA payments would be delayed for
seven days. Prisoners rarely have previous wages to draw on. So the
discharge grant of £46 will have to last for at least a week,
often longer, if their benefits have not been arranged prior to
release. Remand prisoners, who are released direct from court, receive
no discharge grant and no resettlement help. Government plans to impose
at least one year’s supervision on short sentence prisoners will
not help prisoners on remand who are either found not guilty or given a
community sentence that does not involve supervision.</hs_para>

the age when we look for joined-up government, let us note another
finding: that the bedroom tax  will have a negative impact on
the availability of accommodation for those leaving prison. The

Increased demand for these properties caused by the underoccupancy

Ramsbotham (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, in his seminal report on the
riots in Strangeways and other prisons in 1990, my noble and learned
friend Lord Woolf opined that the three factors that were most likely
to prevent a released prisoner reoffending were a home, a job
and  a family or stable relationship—all of which
were  put at risk by imprisonment. He advocated, so far
unsuccessfully—although I have to acknowledge the intent behind
the recent recategorising of 70 prisons as resettlement
prisons—that prisons should be grouped into what he called
“community clusters”, which today would be defined as
regional clusters, so that this damage could be mitigated by holding
prisoners as close to home as possible, thereby enabling local
organisations to be involved in the rehabilitation of their own local
prisoners. He said that evidence showed that local ownership of a
problem resulted in much greater commitment to finding a
solution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0001.htm#13120572000171">I am

Dubs (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, some time ago I was talking to a
police officer in north London. He told me of an incident where a young
thug had mugged an elderly woman and left her unconscious in the
street—a deplorable crime. The young thug was caught, and the
police officer then went to the young thug’s home. There he
found, mid-morning, the young man’s mother spaced out on drugs.
The place was in an abominable condition, and there were dog faeces
everywhere. The police officer said to me, “That man will go to
Feltham prison, and when he comes out he will go back to the same
environment that he left”, so the cycle of crime will go on.
Unless one avoids sending people back to those sorts of conditions, we
will not get any further. In the case of the incident to which I just
referred, who should be responsible for seeing that it does not happen?
Who should see that the young man is not discharged from Feltham and
sent back with nothing to help or support him or stabilise his
life?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120572000179">I was

to me that in that one quote we have it all. Yes, it is a national
scandal, but the question is: what are we doing about it? It is fairly
clear that the cost for the country of dealing with people who have
offended and go to prison is enormous. I wonder whether we should not
go to more trouble to set off the cost of their imprisonment against
housing and other support, which would then lessen the chance that they
would go to prison. If we can get that right, we will be almost in a

I was in the Commons in the 1980s, we were appalled when the prison
population went above 43,000 or 44,000. We thought that the

itself. Now it is at least twice that number and is going up and up,
and we do not seem to be as bothered now as we were then. That was some

Howard League has provided some useful information, as has Shelter. We
desperately need more accurate statistics. On the point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, why is it not the norm, when prisoners are
discharged, that we do something directly about their housing in all
instances? We need some statistics to demonstrate whether that is
happening. How many people being discharged are going into
accommodation and how many are left to fend for themselves in the
circumstances that I described earlier 
<?notus-xml column=90?>in my example? My noble friend Lord Judd referred to prisoners
being discharged. The Minister said that they get
£46. Under the new system, they get no JSA for seven days. I do
not think that prisoners discharged with £46 in their pocket
will find it very easy to find somewhere to live, eat and survive for
seven days before they get any social security benefit. Perhaps that
has changed recently. I would like some assurance from the Minister
that it has
changed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120572000182">Some
statistics from the Ministry of Justice were quoted, and they are a
pretty savage indictment. There are also some interesting figures in a
useful document from the Library with regard to Vision Housing, which
deals with prisoners. It has some impressive statistics, based on a
small sample, on the benefit of a lower reoffending rate when people
are given housing on discharge from prison. The arithmetic is clear. We
could be saving money, not wasting it, if we did more with housing so
that people discharged from prison have some accommodation to go to. I
am not saying that we should put them above everybody else in the
community, but if we do not do this, all we will get are people
reoffending at enormous cost to the public and to their local
communities.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/60DEE61FC20550FA5D2DB7824A70AEE1DAEE35CC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

Ponsonby of Shulbrede (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my
noble friend for raising this issue so that we can debate it today. It
seems that there is a widely accepted consensus among the speakers
today. The first consensual belief is that ex-prisoners who have
housing will be less likely to offend. I do not think anyone would
challenge that assertion. We have also heard of the central role of
local authorities in co-ordinating services for prisoners when they
come out of prison.</hs_para>

want to make two general points. The first has been made by the right
reverend Prelate, the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, and the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. It is about the consequences of the Offender
Rehabilitation Bill, which gives 12 months’ after-custody
supervision to offenders who are sent to custody for one year or less.
In practice, that will mean that many thousands of prisoners will be
coming out and will be supervised by the community rehabilitation
companies or the National Probation Service. It will be much easier to
supervise prisoners if they have an address, whereas it is almost
impossible to supervise them if they do not. If the Government want the
benefits of the Offender Rehabilitation Bill to be seen, it is crucial
that offenders have an address so that the probation service can do its
work.</hs_para>

also common ground in this debate that housing is a central factor, but
it is not the only factor. Local authorities need to hold the court in
education, employment and training, health access, mental health access
and drug and alcohol support, which my noble friend Lady Massey talked
about. I do not think it is the role of the local authority to help
prisoners to develop stable relationships; nevertheless, that is an
important factor. It certainly will be the role of local authorities to
provide the administrative structure for the community rehabilitation
companies, the National Probation Service and all these other agencies
to  work together.</hs_para>

other issue that I want to raise has not been talked about so far
today, and that is the increasing role of computer technology in

could contribute far more to resettlement outcomes if prisoners were
enabled to apply for housing online. On a prison visit, a resettlement
officer said that they work with 35 different housing agencies and
local authorities, each with its own applications, which can run to 30
pages. He explained that being able to complete them online would save
a considerable amount of paper and time. That prison was processing
about 200 housing applications a week. Accommodation availability is
also short-term and information must be updated regularly. In addition,
the areas in which people might wish to resettle are quite local and
require the flexibility and reach of online

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I join other noble
Lords in thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, for giving the

the Committee is aware and as some noble Lords said, this Government
are determined to break the depressing merry-go-round of crime. The
cycle of reoffending has a dreadful impact on the lives of decent,
hard-working members of society and creates needless numbers of victims
in our communities. I was part of the debate that took place during the
passage of the Offender Rehabilitation Bill through this House. The
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, speaks with great experience in this
regard. I reassure him that when he contributes, the Government
listen—if not to all, at least to some of what he says. It
influences our thinking. However, the overall objective of reducing
reoffending, as the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, has just said, is shared
by all of us. This is not just about the victims;  it is also
about the offenders and the importance of ensuring that they do not go
on to reoffend. Many 
<?notus-xml column=92?>noble Lords quoted the reoffending statistics. It is vital that we take
action to help offenders to turn away from crime, and knowing what
works to support people to get their lives back on track is important
for achieving
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120572000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120572000191">At
the moment, nearly half of all offenders released from prison offend
again within a year. Changing the law to provide that virtually all
offenders released from custody will be subject to supervision and
rehabilitation services is just one important part of our overall
package of transforming rehabilitation reforms. My noble friend Lady
Linklater talked about roofs, relationships and jobs. I agree with
those sentiments. Ensuring that we put in place a system that is
sustainable but also takes into account our current financial
constraints is important. It is therefore essential that money spent on
rehabilitating offenders has the greatest possible impact.</hs_para>

that regard, as noble Lords will know, we are creating much greater
opportunities for a diverse range of organisations to play a role in
rehabilitating offenders. I am sure that all noble Lords will agree
that we want the expertise, skills and knowledge of all the different
organisations involved, including the public, private and voluntary
sectors, to come together to be used to tackle the issues that lead
offenders back to crime—whether that is homelessness, the lack

Ministry of Justice recently published an overview of key evidence
relating to reducing reoffending by adult offenders. This evidence
summary was produced to support the work of policy-makers,
practitioners and other partners involved in offender management and
related service provision. We know from the available evidence on
housing that the provision of suitable accommodation, as many noble
Lords have said, can help to reduce the likelihood of an individual
reoffending. I agree totally with the sentiment that that is only part
of the solution. Analysis of 30 offenders who had completed the
Preventing Offender Accommodation Loss project during 2009 and 2010
showed that 33% reoffended within 12 months compared with a 12-month
reoffending rate of 53% across a matched control group. The point was
made about sharing information, and that is very

is also evidence that offenders who were homeless before custody were
more likely to reoffend on release from prison than those who were not.
A research paper published by the MoJ on 28 November 
<?notus-xml column=93?>showed that prisoners from one survey who reported being homeless before
custody were nearly twice as likely to reoffend in the year after
release compared with prisoners who did not report being homeless.
Preliminary findings from an Offender Management Community Cohort Study
also showed that reoffending was higher among those who did not have
their employment, training, education and accommodation needs met.
However, the provision of suitable accommodation may not reduce levels
of reoffending by itself. Accommodation needs are often related to,
and/or complicated by, other risk factors, such as substance abuse,
employment and mental health
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T16:51:17"></hs_TimeCode>. The
noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, mentioned Shelter. I am aware of the
project that it is conducting in the prison in Leeds, where housing
advisers are talking with prisoners about helping them to secure better
accommodation. It is therefore important that those working with
offenders to reduce reoffending look at tackling the full range of
offenders’ life management issues and focus on what works for a
particular individual.</hs_para>

turn to some specific questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
raised the importance of tackling some of the issues on the mental

alcohol and mental health agenda. These include piloting drug recovery
wings; testing a new through-the-gate model for substance misuse
services that will complement the introduction of transforming
rehabilitation proposals; developing and testing liaison and diversion
services in police custody suites and at courts; and exploring options
for intensive treatment based on alternative studies. There are others

said earlier, sometimes the evidence about what works to reduce
reoffending is not clear-cut, but this should not prevent the
consideration of new approaches. In the absence of decisive evidence,
partners will want to have a sound theoretical rationale for their
approaches. Expertise, whether scientific or operational, will inform
these approaches. The noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, talked

I speak as someone who has experience of working in local government.
The Government recognise that local engagement is key to the successful
rehabilitation of offenders, and probation trusts have done some
excellent work in developing these local relationships. Contracted
providers will need to demonstrate, through competition, how they
engage effectively with key local partners. On the public sector side,
we intend to maintain a strong local delivery structure. Within trusts,
much local engagement happens not just at trust level but in the
approximately 150 local delivery units across the country. Our
intention is to preserve a delivery structure which enables the public
sector probation service to continue its work with local authorities

Rehabilitation means that we aim for the majority of offenders to be

Hanningfield (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful for
having obtained this debate, although I am a bit disappointed that we
do not have more speakers, given the importance of the Dartford
crossing. Around 50 million people cross it every year, so it is of
vital importance to the whole national economy, not just to the
south-east. So it is a bit disappointing that there are not more
speakers—but it is quality rather than quantity,
perhaps.</hs_para>

opportune day for this discussion. I have just had messages that parts
of Essex are being evacuated because of potential flooding this evening
due to the tidal system. Places that were flooded before, in
1953—the Tendring area, Jaywick, Foulness Island and parts of
Southend—are being evacuated, and people are being taken from
their homes. I hope I am going to be able to get back to Essex when we
finish this tonight. It is also an opportune time to be discussing this
because it was 50 years ago last week that the first tunnel opened. I
will speak a bit more about that later. Looking through the briefing
today, I see the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, got in quicker than me and
asked a Written Question about this a week or so ago. It got an
unsatisfactory Answer, but I will talk a bit more about that later as
well. The noble Lord, Lord Adonis, has a particular interest from his
past ministerial
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000003">I
declare an interest only as a user of the crossing, having lived in
Essex all my life. Until the tunnel was opened, of course, the only way
across other than coming through the middle of London was by the
Tilbury ferry. My father, grandfather and great-grandfather were fruit
farmers in Essex—and where do you buy fruit trees but Maidstone
in Kent? I had many enjoyable crossings as a child on the Tilbury
ferry. It was quite an adventure to go to Kent on the Tilbury ferry
when I was small. Unfortunately, it probably takes longer now to go
through the Dartford Tunnel sometimes than it did on the ferry, when it
was operative. A year or two ago, I stood in the car park of the hotel
that overlooks the crossing on the Kent side, and saw the congestion,
the fumes, and all the other problems of 
<?notus-xml column=96?>the crossing, particularly where the pay kiosks are. It showed that
there is a real environmental problem attached to this. I hope that we
get some further answers from the noble Baroness on progress and the
process of how this is going to happen.</hs_para>

member of Essex County Council and leader of it for some years. Some 50
years ago, Kent and Essex got together to build the first tunnel for
the crossing, with European funding. The two county councils then built
another tunnel, and introduced tolls. It was then sort of nationalised
by the Government to build the bridge. The two county councils offered
to build the bridge, but the Government decided to do it. I must say
that it was done very quickly. From the consultation to when the Queen
opened it—it is called the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge—took
only four years. During that time, I was chairman of policy and then,
when the bridge opened, chairman of the county council, and I was
officiating when the Queen opened the bridge. So I remember it all very
well; the bridge immediately solved the
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000005">On
some days now, traffic at the crossing is 70,000 vehicles
more than was planned for, so the congestion is acute. I know that any
time when I try to cross it—mainly for social reasons
now—I almost dread it, particularly coming back on the Kent
side. Something needs to be done. The answer to the Question from the
noble Lord, Lord Adonis, was 2025. That is a long way away, so what is
going to happen? If the economy improves, what is going to happen
during that time? It only needs one accident to cause four or five
hours’ delay. Even on a normal day, there can be a lot of delay
at peak times. What is this costing our
country?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000006">At
the moment the crossing is making a lot of profit. The bridge was all
paid for in 2002 and, since then, there has been a big surplus from the
toll money over the cost of maintaining the crossing. There are
suggestions that it might be as much as £60 million a year. I
know that it is important and it goes into the general fund, which is
supposed to be spent on local improvements, but we have not seen that
many local improvements worth £60 million a year in south Essex
or north Kent. Therefore, there is money around that could be used to
finance a new crossing, although the Chancellor might not like it. I
did not hear whether it was announced today that the Dartford crossing
was one of the areas they were going to put infrastructure money into,
but there is money around from the current crossing that could be used
to construct a new
bridge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000007">There
is obviously some enthusiasm from the Government. They came out with
the consultation paper in the summer and suggested several options. I
think the majority of consultants wanted option C, which is the one I
could support. Kent, particularly, would like a sort of option C plus,
bringing in the road from Dover, which I support, with the traffic
there. On the other hand, that could take another 20 years to achieve,
and something needs to be done about the crossing
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000008">When I
was involved in Essex County Council, I went backwards and forwards
across the Thames in a helicopter looking at potential crossing sites.
Clearly 
<?notus-xml column=97?>the only one that could be built fairly quickly and link into current
roads is the one fairly close to the existing crossing. Further down
the Thames, that area of Kent is barren marshland, and it would need a
lot of roads and a lot of money spent on it. One could achieve a
junction into the A2/M2 and the A13 in Essex on a new bridge relatively
easily, with some improvement works. It could be done without taking
too much time. I hope the Minister will comment on that in her
reply.</hs_para>

said, time is of the essence. The consultation is there and the
Government have said that they are going to announce a result by the
end of the year. We are only about three weeks away from the end of the
year, so I hope we might get some indication today of when that
announcement might be. It is something that we can all benefit
from.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000010">There
are various debates about how much this problem is costing the economy
now. Obviously with all this congestion and the hours that commercial
and private vehicles and people doing their day-to-day jobs spend in
these queues, the suggestion is that it could be around £40
million a year. I believe that it costs the economy more than that.
KPMG has done some work suggesting that we could improve the economy by
several billions of pounds by building a bridge, so there is a lot of
potential.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000011">A
new bridge, built fairly quickly, would help with three things. It
would help the environment and the economy, very considerably, and with
the problem of housing. A new bridge built along the lines of option C
would generate land that could be used for affordable and other housing
fairly quickly. We could be talking about 25,000 houses that we
desperately need in the margins of the London area. They could be built
on the land released by building a new bridge. The whole thing is of
tremendous benefit, and the sooner we can do something and actually
create a bridge for those three reasons the better. We should not wait
until
2025.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000012">I
have probably said all that I can today. I have more notes here but,
given that Essex may be being flooded and there may be no trains home,
we should get on with the debate. I thank everyone for listening to me,
and I hope that the Minister can give us some answers to the things
that I have been talking
about.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/A1AAC821924132999AB6B695743FEBB5523AA83B" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 5 December 2013">Thursday,

is quite clear that there is a traffic problem east of London because
of the growth. I met an expert in these things recently who said that
the centre of gravity of the population of London was now some five
miles east of the City. That surprised me slightly, but maybe the noble
Lord, Lord Hanningfield, and his colleagues from Essex will confirm
that. I do not know, but industry and business are moving east beyond

has to ask why. Maybe it is to do with the congestion. Why has the

tolls will be changed quite soon, which is something that we managed to
achieve in legislation about a year ago, which is very
good<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:12:51"></hs_TimeCode>. But it is

could just about believe that if the Department for Transport
forecasting team had not been producing forecasts of road traffic
growth for the past 20 years which show a spider’s web where the
curve goes up and then it levels off. That shows the actual traffic,

is something wrong with the forecasting. I have said that before. Is it
because the department likes building roads? This is not an attack on
the present Government because the department has been the same for the
past 20 years. I hope that some thought has gone into this. We should
look at the road and rail element. I believe that this crossing is
necessary but it needs a rail element as well. I declare an interest as
chairman of the Rail Freight Group, but this is a passenger and freight
issue. I would like to cover that in a little more

I think, is open to challenge. In fact, a very large and welcome
development called the Thames Gateway is being built just downstream
from where these crossings might be, which is forecast at peak to have
something like 40 freight trains a day. The London, Tilbury and
Southend line and the route across London can actually carry that
amount of traffic, because it is a good
line<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:15:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13120578000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000019">It is debatable how
much of that traffic would want to go south: it would probably want to
go north because it is coming in from the deep sea. However, within
that complex, a very large logistics centre is being built—and
the first bit is already just opened—which will be doing shorter
deliveries and may even want to use traffic from the Channel Tunnel.
Noble Lords  will know that the volume of Channel Tunnel
traffic  is pretty low at the moment. However, the industry
forecasts suggest that, with the present pretty high charges, in
2043—which is hopefully after these links 
<?notus-xml column=99?>get built, but perhaps we do not know—there will be something
like 50 trains a day through the Channel Tunnel, 25 in each direction,
compared with about seven today. If somebody achieves a better
diversion from road to rail, it would certainly help reduce the number
of trucks on the Dartford crossing. If you stand on a bridge at Ashford
and count the number of trucks, you will see that 200 trains a day
could be filled. The first reason they are not going by rail is largely
price, followed by difficulties in France. In a 20-year timescale,
however, we can probably think that that could
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:16:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:16:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000020">When
I worked for Eurotunnel 25 years ago, we forecast that there would be
40 freight trains a day in each direction when the tunnel opened and
probably up to 60 today. The forecasts were miles out for whatever
reason, but I am just saying that that is the sort of potential.
Therefore, I think there is room for rail freight on this link and
luckily there are good existing rail lines on either side which could
probably take much of that traffic if it wanted to go either to the big
logistic centres—I only mentioned one, but there are several
others down there on both sides—or further north. There needs to
be a strategic view taken, if you have lots of freight trains in the
Channel Tunnel wanting to go up to the Midlands, as to which way they
should go around London. Do they go south-about through Redhill, or do
they go north-about, possibly by crossing here on the LTS and the
Gospel Oak-Barking line, or does somebody want to build a new line from
somewhere through Hertfordshire and outer Essex, if I can call it that,
with a new crossing which could tie up with one of the mayor’s
ideas for airports, or
whatever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:17:53"></hs_TimeCode>? One
could go on having conjectures about this for
ever<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-05T17:17:53"></hs_TimeCode>. What I am
saying is that, if there were a rail link built in to this crossing, it
could connect quite easily with existing routes where there is
capacity, and it would help a great deal in getting some of the trucks

is hard to conclude that passenger flow volumes are likely to be

difficult to judge. How many people driving across the Dartford
crossing, paying their toll in their car every day, would use a
convenient rail service if there was one? It is a very difficult thing
to decide and it would probably take five or 10 years after it opened
before it was really possible to know what the right figures were and
whether everybody got it right.

these links develop into something highly popular. What this link needs
is a good road link and a good rail link, hopefully together, and, in
places, capacity for expansion. Whether we should be doing that on HS2

<?notus-xml column=100?>late now. Capacity for expansion is important, because we tend not to

afresh.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000026">When
he quoted a figure of 50 million, I thought he was going to say every
day, but he said every year. Whenever I go across the bridge, it feels
more like 10 or 20 times the number he mentioned. It is a
point of very real congestion at times. We know the pressure on the M25
and the efforts being made to widen sections of it. There has been
significant road widening not far north of the bridge, which has
helped, but the bridge and the tunnel are clearly queuing
points.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000027">I have
the greatest difficulty understanding why we have not moved with some
urgency on new toll payment technologies for the crossing—it
seems an obvious thing to do. There is something very old-fashioned
about cars and trucks slowing to throw coins into meters or show their
entitlement to cross. I do not think that implementation of the new
system—which after all has been tried and tested on congestion
charging in London—represents an enormous technological
breakthrough. I wonder that it is not done as soon as possible. I
realise the date is not so far away now, but I bemoan the fact that it
was not done some time ago, not least because the easiest way to ease
things in the short term is to improve the efficiency of the two
crossings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000028">The
noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, wants something much more ambitious than
that, and I understand that. However, even with the best will in the
world—which for me to attribute to the Government would be
stretching things—completion of construction is a considerable
period away for any such crossing, even if the  case is
established. The Government’s problem, quite straightforwardly,
is that there are more people objecting to each of the three options
than are in favour of any 
<?notus-xml column=101?>one of them. That is a genuine problem. We can see the pressures and the
work that would have to be  done
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000029">I hope
the Minister, having carried out the consultation, will ensure that
people get a clear perspective on the Government’s proposals.
They may be more limited than my noble friend Lord Berkeley likes, but
I fully support his continuous efforts to get as much freight onto rail
as possible, to the advantage of our whole road system, and he is right
to make the pitch here. However, that looks some distance away. I think
that the degree of usage merits a real investigation. We all know the
extent to which road usage for freight relates crucially to
convenience, but the M25 is not a normal road. Normal roads have some
linear quality to them. The M25 is a great circle, and therefore it is
much more difficult to identify the nature of the usage.</hs_para>

misfortune of living some, although not many, miles north of the M1 at
the 12 o’clock position and my son lives exactly the same
distance south of the M25 at the six o’clock position, so we
always have a little debate about which way round it is better to go.
Of course, that depends on how much work is being done on road widening
on the western stretch, and that is counterbalanced by what we all know
will be the likelihood of a very considerable wait at the current
Dartford crossing. Therefore, I have direct experience of this, and I
know that there is a feeling of great frustration at the present
limitations. It looks more than a little archaic when you see the
quantity of vehicles at certain times. You can even have the supreme
joy of driving at normal speeds going north, whereas when going south
there is a jam that lasts for eight to 10 miles while people try to get
across. You thank your lucky stars when you are not in that jam,
although your lucky stars are unlikely to save you on more than two
consecutive journeys before you get caught.</hs_para>

difficulties. However, I hope that the pressure that the noble Lord has
brought to bear in this debate, together with all the representations

obligation to produce a prompt response to the consultation. I also
hope that we will get an assurance this afternoon that the charging
system on the existing structures will be implemented as rapidly as

Short Debate which the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, has secured
on  the Government’s plans for a new river crossing
in  the lower Thames area. We have had very thoughtful comments
from the three noble Lords who have spoken today, often bringing up
issues which have been raised within the consultation. The noble Lord,
Lord Hanningfield, was right to say that this is an issue not just of
local consequence but with much broader implications.</hs_para>

Hanningfield, said that he had seen the bridge built in just four
years. Many of us who deal with infrastructure today think longingly of
timetables such as that. However, he may be interested 
<?notus-xml column=102?>to know that the Government are piloting ways in which to accelerate the
building of infrastructure. There are four pilots: in Surrey, on the M3
managed motorway between junctions 2 and 4a; in the West Midlands, at
M6 junctions 10a to 13, which is also managed motorway; in Derbyshire,
at the M1 junctions 28 to 31; and on the A160/A180 Immingham dualling
scheme. We will see whether there are some good lessons to learn so
that we can start to speed up the delivery of these infrastructure
projects, because, as the noble Lord pointed out, that would make
sense.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120578000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000034">I know

appreciate that there are serious issues at stake in reaching decisions
on where to locate a new crossing and whether it should be a bridge or
a tunnel. The department is carefully considering the issues reinforced
during the consultation and it intends to announce the next steps
shortly. I know that that response has been promised by the end of the

scale of the challenge and what we have done to date. The noble Lord,
Lord Hanningfield, reminded us of the history. Fifty years ago, a
tunnel was opened between Dartford and Grays. Today, the
Dartford-Thurrock crossing comprises two tunnels and one bridge which
carry about 140,000 vehicles daily across that part of the River
Thames. The noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, basically said that they
carry much more than they were designed to carry. They were designed
for 135,000 vehicles, so they are definitely over that, but there is a
little comfort in knowing that the current level is not hopelessly
over. Of course, we recognise that this is a crucial part of the
strategic road network linking London, Kent and Essex, as well as
international destinations, with the rest of the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120578000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-gc0002.htm#13120578000036">In
addition, the existing crossing is located in the area known as the
Thames Gateway, which, as the noble Lords, Lord Hanningfield and Lord
Berkeley, pointed out, has very ambitious plans for redevelopment and
growth, which we obviously want to promote. The noble Lord, Lord
Davies, gave us a very personal experience of surviving congestion at
the Dartford-Thurrock crossing. I shall think of him and his son trying
to decide which of them would be able to get through to the other more
easily because the traffic was flowing northbound or southbound but not
the other way.</hs_para>

at national and local level have commissioned studies on congestion and
possible new river crossings. The most recent report for the
department, done in 2009, identified short and medium-term measures to
improve traffic flows. It also concluded that a new crossing is needed
in the long term and shortlisted potential locations: option A, at the
existing Dartford-Thurrock crossing; option B connecting the A2 with
the A1089; option C connecting the M2 with the A13 and the M25 between
junctions 29 and 30; and a variant of option C connecting the M2 with
the A13 and the M25 and additionally widening the A229 between the M2
and the M20. From the start, this coalition Government have been
determined to act and promises made as early as the first spending

introduction of free-flow charging. That will please the noble Lord,
Lord Davies. I know he has been waiting for that. Motorists will no
longer stop at each end of the crossing to put money into a slot
machine or hand it to an attendant. Believe it or not, getting this
technology right has not been quite as easy as it sounds, and nobody
wants to install a technology, have it go wrong and create that kind of

the relative merits of each option, the department embarked on a
technical exercise to review the options. Once that review was
completed in spring 2013, the department made the findings publicly
available and consulted on the options from May to July this year.
Noble Lords will be interested to hear that in addition to online
communications, the Minister and officials met interested parties

of support and opposition for each of the options—options A, B,
C or C variant. Respondents also made detailed comments highlighting
serious issues relating to the economic, environmental and social
impacts of each of the options. As I have already emphasised, our
decision on where to locate a new crossing is of public interest. I
know noble Lords would expect the department to respect due process and
give careful consideration to the serious issues raised during the

question at the heart of today’s debate presumed that the

the review which the Department for Transport undertook established the
engineering feasibility of bridge and tunnel solutions for each
location and considered the means by which it could be funded, it is
clear that the detailed work that leads to decisions about technical

welcome Lord Levene’s recognition of the substantial progress
made since his last review in implementing both the letter and the
spirit of his recommendations. His finding of clear evidence that the
Ministry of Defence has become more businesslike and finance-focused is
very encouraging, and reflects the wide-ranging changes we have put in
place under Defence Reform, a key part of which was the balancing the
MOD budget in 2012. The elimination of the inherited imbalance in the
defence budget is described as “remarkable” and an
illustration of how a Government Department can be managed effectively

recommendations, has increased empowerment of the Service Chiefs and

first item is a progress report from the Presidency on the Proposal for
a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council concerning
measures to ensure a high level of network and information security
across the Union. (First reading – EM6342/13). It is unlikely
that any detailed discussion will take place. However, should it be
required, any UK intervention will note that whilst UK welcomes the
Commission’s overarching ambition to raise cyber capabilities
across the EU, UK wants to ensure that any legislative agreement does
not place disproportionate burdens on businesses or public
administrations; or create the wrong incentives for sharing
information.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120565000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-wms0001.htm#13120565000012">The
Second item is a progress report on the Proposal for a Regulation of
the European Parliament and of the Council on measures to reduce the
costs of deploying high-speed electronic communications networks.
(First reading - EM7999/13) If there is a debate, the UK will state
that whilst UK strongly supports the Commission’s overall
objective to support broadband rollout by reducing the cost of
deployment, we do not think that the use of a Regulation is the best
way to achieve this, reaffirming our view that a Directive would be a
more appropriate instrument in that it would give Member States more
scope to implement relevant cost-reducing measures in a proportionate,
flexible and cost-effective
manner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120565000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-wms0001.htm#13120565000013">The

relates to the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and
of the Council laying down measures concerning the European single
market for electronic communications and to achieve a Connected
Continent. (First reading - EM13562/13 and 13555/13 + ADDs 1-2). It
asks Member States to indicate what actions contained in the proposal
they regard as priorities; and whether it is appropriate to carry out
such actions at EU or Member State level. The main points of the UK
intervention will include: a view that whilst UK welcomes the
objectives of the proposal, we remain concerned that the link between
the stated aims and the constituent elements of the package remain
unclear or unproven in a number of circumstances; signal our support
for action at EU level for the pro-consumer parts of that package;
support for the eventual reduction of the EU roaming rates to zero; and
support for proposals that could accelerate the roll out of new
technologies across the EU. Finally, we will state that we do not
support the proposals laid out in the package that would give the
Commission further competency over spectrum management nor those that
would result in the introduction of regulation covering issues relating
to net neutrality.</hs_para>

second question considers the Conclusions of the October European
Council that covered several aspects of the Digital economy (e.g. Cloud
computing, Big Data and Digital platforms) that are currently either
unregulated or rely on ‘soft’ regulation. In this
question, the Presidency asks if any regulatory framework is required
in these areas and, again, whether any regulation should be at Member
State or EU level? The UK’s intervention will state that whilst
UK agrees fully with the Conclusions in that the digital economy has
the potential to drive innovation, growth and jobs across the EU, UK
does not believe that the European Council conclusions call for a new
regulatory framework nor does UK consider that one is
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120565000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205-wms0001.htm#13120565000015">There

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl

operated for nearly 50 years in England and over 50 years
internationally. In that time no evidence has arisen demonstrating that
there is harm to general health from these schemes. Furthermore there
are communities in England who have consumed fluoride in their water
supply for generations at levels close those achieved by water
fluoridation schemes. It is reasonable to judge that, after the passage
of so many years of public health surveillance, if there was any harm
to general health from water fluoridation then this would be
apparent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120558000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205w0001.htm#13120558000008">The
authors of the York review of water fluoridation have stated that they
found a benefit in the form of reduction in caries, balanced against an
increase in 
<?notus-xml column=61?>fluorosis and that no clear evidence of other potential negative effects
was found. In 2002, the Medical Research Council made recommendations
regarding surveillance and research priorities. The National Institute
for Health Research welcomes funding applications for research into any
aspect of human health, including water fluoridation. These
applications are subject to peer review and judged in open competition,
with awards being made on the basis of the scientific quality of the
proposals made. Any new evidence emerging regarding water fluoridation
will be assessed by Public Health England (PHE). PHE is currently
working towards publishing a first report on the health effects of
fluoridation by the end of March 2014, as required by legislation. This

study by McGrady et al used novel technologies and photographing teeth
in order to facilitate a highly standardised and reliable assessment of
mottling (fluorosis), reducing potential examiner bias—a key
recommendation of the York Review. Fluorosis is primarily a cosmetic
issue affecting the appearance of the teeth and therefore, when
attempting to assess whether there is a greater level of mottling in
populations which may be caused by fluorosis, it is useful to
distinguish mottling which is likely to be of aesthetic
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120558000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205w0001.htm#13120558000011">Whilst
this study by McGrady et al is a cross-sectional study, it is the
largest and most recent study to be undertaken on a domestic population
since the York Review and addresses methodological concerns raised by
that review. The study supports previous work and adds to the evidence
base, providing further assurance that water fluoridation reduces oral
health inequalities. The aforementioned report by PHE will also review
the available information on tooth decay levels in fluoridated

maxillary central incisors are usually the most visible teeth in the
mouth when smiling and speaking and will therefore contribute the most
to the aesthetic appearance of the dentition. The use of maxillary
central incisors in this study was partly to facilitate the use of a
standardised photographic methodology and partly to reflect that the
appearance of the two largest upper front teeth will be a key part of
an individual’s perception of the appearance of their dentition
as a whole. Fluoride absorption during tooth development will
potentially affect all developing teeth so examination of the maxillary
central incisors should provide a good representation of the teeth as a
whole. Furthermore, the enamel of these teeth will be fully visible at
the age of 11. Therefore this research methodology appears appropriate
for the purpose of providing an accurate estimate of clinical fluorosis
levels in a population and 
<?notus-xml column=62?>has advantages over visual examination and scoring as factors such as
differences in incident light can affect the appearance of teeth quite
markedly.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13120558000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131205w0001.htm#13120558000106">Health:

The UK Government is committed to the Patent Box, and remains confident
that the Patent Box does not breach the criteria of the EU Code of
Conduct on Business Taxation. The UK Patent Box is more tightly defined
and imposes tougher eligibility criteria than other measures that have
previously been approved or considered by the Code of Conduct Group. It
is more focused in scope than other existing royalty boxes, and there
are specific rules that require a company to be carrying on economic
activity in order for it to
benefit.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-12-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_05_PT_1/Index/64F33516068613FD4C91234BD03037C247216DCB" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="12" cday="Thursday" cmonth="December" cyear="2013" date="5" day="Thursday" issue="82" maxparts="1" month="December" part="1" price="" printing="daily" session="201314" volume="750" year="2013"><tocdate col="WS37">Thursday 5 December
