Howe of Idlicote (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted that today
we are able to proceed with the Second Reading of my Online Safety
Bill. It is just over a year since we gathered here on 9
November 2012 for the Second Reading debate on my previous
Bill on this subject. In the intervening period there have been some
significant changes. A month after our previous debate, the Department
for Education published its response to the parental internet controls
consultation that was held over the summer of 2012. Many found that
very disappointing, including, it would seem, the Prime Minister,
because he intervened a week later with an article in the <I>Daily
Mail</I>, in which he pledged himself to the introduction of an online
safety mechanism which he described as “default on”.
Things then went very quiet until 22 July this year, when the Prime
Minister gave his seminal NSPCC speech on child safety online. In this
address, among other things, Cameron gave the four big internet service
providers until the end of the year to introduce his definition of
“default on” for all new customers. Then, just last
month, he hosted a major summit in Downing Street in which TalkTalk and
Sky claimed to have already provided “default on” for all
new customers, and BT and Virgin claimed that they would do so from
January<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
clearly very encouraging.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120659000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000004">I put on the record my
thanks to the Prime Minister for all his work on this crucial subject
during the past 12 months. Having said that, there is still a long way
to go and I firmly believe that the Online Safety Bill has a very
important role to play in building on this very welcome progress. I
will, first, highlight the key challenges that remain outstanding,
explaining how these are dealt 
<?notus-xml column=498?>with in my Bill. I will then provide a more detailed clause-by-clause
analysis. However, before doing either, I wish to make clear the
Bill’s basic purpose. It is fundamentally about making provision
to help parents to parent their children in the context of online
safety challenges. It does this through two main provisions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120659000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000005">First, the Bill
introduces an opt-in system that requires those selling
access to the internet, be they internet service
providers—ISPs—or mobile phone
operators—MPOs—to provide people with an internet service
that is free of adult content, but with the option of accessing such
content, subject to age verification demonstrating that the person
concerned is, indeed, 18 or over. This provision is to help parents
make it less likely that their children will stumble across
inappropriate material, either accidentally or deliberately. Secondly,
the Bill also makes provision for parents to be empowered with
information about all online safety challenges. This will include
making them aware of how to make the most of the opt-in tool and
information about online behavioural challenges that cannot be
addressed by filters, such as cyberbullying and sexting. I believe
that, in providing these two services, the Bill would help to make the
online world safer for the children of this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:10:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:10:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000006">Having
defined the basic rationale for my Bill, I now address those areas
where, despite all the positive developments in the past year, there is
a need for significant change. The first key challenge is age
verification. Noble Lords will remember the very great concern
expressed by speaker after speaker during last year’s Second
Reading about the fact that age verification was not mentioned once in
the Government’s parental internet controls consultation. We
raised this point, drawing attention to the important fact that British
law already makes provision for online age
verification<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:12:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000007">In
the early part of the previous decade, children’s charities were
made aware of children developing gambling problems as a result of
being able to gamble online. The Government expressed their concern and
the industry expressed its concern, but nothing happened. It was only
when the Gambling Act 2005 mandated statutory age verification that
there was a change. Since the Act came into force, children’s
charities have not been made aware of any children developing an online
gambling problem. This provided, and continues to provide, a clear,
robust example of the use of statute to deliver child protection
online. The fact that it has been done in relation to online gambling
proves that legislation has an important role to play in delivering
online verification.</hs_para>

that the Department for Education’s response to that
consultation mentioned age verification. I was even more pleased by
what the Prime Minister said when presenting his preferred solution,
“default on”, in his online safety article in the
<I>Daily </I><I>Mail</I><I> </I>on 20 December 2012. He said:</hs_para>

also said that providers need to work to verify the age of the person
setting the controls—meaning that children can’t set up
the filters themselves”.</hs_quote>

similar point in his speech in July this year to the NSPCC. He
said:</hs_parafo>

those filters are installed it should not be the case that technically
literate children can just flick the filters off at the click of the
mouse without anyone knowing, and this, if you’ve 
<?notus-xml column=499?>got children, is absolutely vital. So, we’ve agreed with industry
that those filters can only be changed by the account holder, who has
to be an adult. So an adult has to be engaged in the
decisions”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13120659000385" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000385">This
was all excellent news. The difficulty is, however, that although some
parts of the internet industry have made it clear that they are willing
to introduce “default on” by the end of the year, they
are not prepared to back it up with robust age verification. Proper age
verification, as defined by us in online gambling, takes place at the
point at which a person confirms that they wish to access adult
content.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="13120659000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000010">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:14:41"></hs_TimeCode>
ISPs, however, have proposed an alternative approach that they have
dignified with the name, “the closed-loop system”. While
this name sounds reassuring, when one looks at the small print one
discovers that it is anything but. Rather than age-verifying the person
who elects to disable filters, the industry wants to age-verify the
person in whose name the account is held. This is a problem because
evidence suggests that parents often leave the set-up stage to their
more technologically literate children. The industry has said that it
will deal with this problem by sending the account holder an e-mail
informing them if ever the filters are changed. It may come as a shock
to ISPs but the truth is that customers do not read all their e-mails.
Even if they get round to reading them, it could be some days after
filters have been
lifted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:15:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I can
understand that this system will be attractive to the industry because
e-mails are cheap, but it seems very Heath Robinson to me. If it is
true, as the Prime Minister says, that few things are more important
than our children’s safety online, then they are certainly worth
more than this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:15:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
In contrast to industry self-regulation, our Bill makes provision for
there to be clear standards on how age verification should work and
stipulates that these standards should be used to ensure that the age
verification is of the person electing to disable default
filters—not simply their mother or
father<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:16:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

pertains to those customers who are not provided with access to the
internet by the big four ISPs involved in the Prime Minister’s
self-regulatory venture. The big four cover 95% of the market, but that
leaves as many as 1 million households beyond this agreement. My Bill
covers 100% of the market, including the 1 million households whose
internet service is not provided by the big four. It also covers all
the MPOs, not just those who signed up to the code of practice on
mobile content. Two weeks ago, I was approached by a lady who told me
that she had just bought a Tesco phone for her teenager and that she
had been horrified to discover that it had no default filters in place.
She was able to download anything and everything. When she went back to
Tesco, it confirmed that this was deliberate but pointed out that
customers can ask for filters to be turned on. This is entirely
contrary to what the Prime Minister told us in his NSPCC speech in
July. He said that,</hs_para>

great to report that all of the operators have now agreed to put adult
content filters onto phones automatically. And to deactivate them you
have to prove you’re over 18 and operators will continue to
refine and improve those
filters”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13120659000386" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000386">This
demonstrates so clearly why we need to adopt a legal framework rather
than one that is merely self-regulatory, so that the law can be
properly
enforced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:17:56"></hs_TimeCode>. 
<?notus-xml column=500?>Some may say that the situation I described was a one-off, but it was
not. Blackberry was found to be doing exactly the same thing, even
though it was a signatory to the self-regulatory

proposing is a statutory law. In his <I>Daily Mail </I>article, the
Prime Minister said that few things are more important this issue. If
that is correct, and I certainly agree, why do we have laws covering
everything under the sun but not child protection online? The subject,
the Prime Minister admits, is one of the most important issues. How is
it that we have laws to protect copyright, the interests of
shareholders and so on, but not age-verified, “default
on” online child
protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:18:57"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

that, in the current context of a Prime Minister with three small
children who is personally committed to online safety, we are seeing
significant political pressure placed on the industry to comply with
online safety requirements. However, David Cameron will not be Prime
Minister for ever. If we leave everything to self-regulation
agreements, we cannot know with any confidence where we will be in
five, 10 or 20 years’ time. By contrast, if we make
this a matter of law, it will rest on a very much more secure
foundation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>. If
we really believe that protecting children online is important, then
leaving it to voluntary agreements seems very
odd<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:19:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

three concerns, I shall now briefly go through the Bill clause by
clause. Clause 1 introduces an opt-in system with respect to adult
content online. Both internet service providers and mobile phone
operators are required by Clause 1 to provide an internet service that
is free from adult content but with people being able to opt in to
access such content, subject to submitting to age verification to

manufacturers of electronic devices to provide customers with a means
of filtering internet content at an age-appropriate level at the time
the device is purchased. The rationale for this clause arises from the
fact that, while it is very helpful to have an opt-in mechanism for a
household, there is a need for a greater level of sophistication. For
instance, you may be happy for a 16 year-old to download information
about the Holocaust for homework purposes but you may not want your
five year-old to have access to the same material. Manufacturers need
to provide parents with filtering options which mean that they can

Mackay of Clashfern (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Baroness on bringing this Bill forward. This is an extremely
important subject. Indeed, the fact that it is important is
demonstrated by the extent to which the Prime Minister and the
Government have become involved in seeking to bring forward effective
measures. I believe that if the Bill were enacted, it would greatly
enhance the provision of child safety
online.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000021">Ultimately,
the Bill is designed to empower parents to protect their children in a
way that is effective. It is sometimes suggested, as it was recently in
an article in the <I>Times</I>, that pornography may not be dangerous.
However, in a letter to the same newspaper on 2 December, Dr
Elly Farmer, a clinical psychologist and researcher, pointed out that
there are very authoritative studies showing the various dangers of
pornography. There are two principal components to the Bill
to help parents to rise to this challenge and both are very
important.</hs_para>

first component establishes the opt-in system based on robust,
statutory age verification, as set out in Clauses 1 and 2. I support
this fully. It has two key benefits: first, it helps parents to protect
children from accidentally stumbling upon, or deliberately searching
for, adult material while not preventing adults doing so; and,
secondly, it ensures that all internet service providers and mobile
phone operators who provide an internet service comply with the same
rules and standards as a matter of law. In other words, it will ensure
that no household and no child in Great Britain is left unaccounted
for. All children will be
protected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:26:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000023">The
Prime Minister has succeeded in getting an agreement with the internet
service providers on this matter—at least, to some extent. As I
have said, that shows how important he regards the matter as being.
However, the trouble with an agreement is that it is not absolutely
universal and certainly not a permanent legal obligation. The
illustration that the noble Baroness gave in relation to telephones
shows that. We may think that everything is covered and then suddenly
discover that it is not. Therefore, it is better to have an
all-embracing statutory provision, such as is provided for here, with
very clear workable definitions. In my view, the provisions are very
straightforward and easy to read. In contradistinction to some statutes
that we have the pleasure of looking at from time to time, this one is
extremely
straightforward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:27:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is also very important, is providing an effective method of dealing
with the content of material which is not adult material in the sense
of this Bill, and that is what the later provisions are intended to do.
Earlier this year, the Nominet Trust produced research on
the extent of cyberbullying in the United Kingdom. Its report, entitled

11-to-16-year-olds have been deliberately targeted, threatened or
humiliated by an individual or group through the use of
mobile phones or the internet. For over a quarter of these, this
experience was ongoing, meaning that the individual was continuously
targeted … by the same person or group over a sustained period

have experienced persistent and intentional cyberbullying. Given that

this matter is addressed. In that situation, the system requires some
way of coping with the content. It is a content matter.

that it has to be tackled by education. The first part of that
education is under Clause 4, which, as the noble Baroness has said,

implementing Clause 4, the importance of online safety would be made
plain to people when they subscribe to an internet or mobile phone

them to talk to their children about key online behavioural challenges,
such as cyberbullying, sexting and how to stay safe while using social
networks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000027">Clause
5 places a duty on the Secretary of State to provide a means of
educating parents of children under the age of 18 about online safety.
This is an important aspect because many parents find it hard to keep
up with the rapid development of technology in this area. I understand
that such education is made in some schools already. Therefore, a
reasonable extension of that is for the Secretary of State to have a
duty to make these provisions so that it will happen in all schools. It
is very important to realise the need for a mechanism of that
kind.</hs_para>

law. This Bill provides a simple, straightforward and intelligible

Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I too very much
welcome this Bill brought forward by the noble Baroness. I congratulate
her on her assiduous attention and determination to keep on until such
a Bill is passed. We have come a long way in a year. I believe the
Prime Minister’s sincerity in wanting to deal with this area.
His work and that of the honourable Member Claire Perry in another
place has brought this issue forward. We have an opportunity

said, it is far more difficult and complex to do than may at first
appear. Many years ago, I was chairman of a small self-regulatory body,
not a statutorily regulated body. It dealt with the premium rate
telephone industry at a time of burgeoning so-called adult services,
including voice services, and the way in which they were abused by
children having access to them. For a long time, we tried to get a code
of practice with the industry. We got a code of practice, which the
good boys followed and the bad ones did not. That still is the
situation today as regards those online services. In the end, we
regulated to provide opt-in on telephone services, which dealt with the
issue. Alongside opt-in we had sanctions, which were either to shut the
company down or to apply fines. Those were the days when
things were much easier than they are now. We now have international
services and it is difficult for a Government to regulate outside their
own national
boundaries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T10:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which will deal with this issue in a practical way. This Bill goes some
way, but not the whole way, to deal with that. Age verification is
critical and I support that proposal entirely, as I do opt-in. I gather
that a number of the service providers, including BT, TalkTalk, Virgin
Media and Sky, now have a code of practice where all new services will
provide it. That is not the issue: all services need to be covered,

Bill provides for Ofcom to be the overall regulator. Another group of
services under the Mobile Broadband Group, including
Telefonica—O2 in the UK—Three and Vodafone, have come
together again for opt-in services but they are using the British Board

organisation to judge what is offensive on film, rather than a
sound-provided service such as Ofcom. However, Ofcom has the statutory
provision to do it. On balance, the Bill is right in going for

aware of how to shut off these services. It is the bad lads in the

have some concern about Clause 5, about which the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Mackay, spoke strongly in favour. I am not sure that it is
the responsibility of the Department for Education to deal with this
issue. Surely, the law has to be decided and the services providers
should carry out the law. In Committee, we will debate giving an added
responsibility to the Department for Education to make sure that all
citizens are aware of this, irrespective of whether they use the
services. I question Clause 5 but I do not question the importance and
the need to make sure that anyone who has access to these services is
aware of the protections which can be switched on. I am fully in
support of the two principles of opt-in and age verification.</hs_para>

offensive and totally adult. Will the adult age be 18 for all services

congratulate and salute my noble friend Lady Howe on bringing forward
this Bill again. I salute her particularly on its clarity and
simplicity, which is a welcome relief after some of the legislation
that the House has faced in recent months. I am delighted that her
persistence has been matched by her refusal to be discouraged by what
was, to be quite frank, a rather lacklustre and low-key response from
the Government to the Bill of last year. That persistence has been
rewarded by the involvement of the Prime Minister, which she mentioned,
and by the initiatives that have been taken by some service providers.
I have been reading with interest those from BSkyB and Mobile Broadband
Group. However, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, has just
said, it is not enough for some of them to take this line: all must
comply if we are to get anywhere. I also thank James Tobin for his
excellent and very helpful Library Note. We are lucky in the way that
the Library produces these marvellous documents for us.</hs_para>

concentrate, as I did last year, on one aspect of this issue, which
stems from my belief that the only raw material every country has in
common is its people, and woe betide any country if it does not do
everything it can to identify, nurture and develop the talents of all
its people. If it does not, it will only have itself to blame if it
fails. I mention this in connection with my noble friend’s
comments about the importance of helping parents to parent and of
empowering them so that they are aware of the tools that are available
to help them develop the talents of their children. One aspect which
has caused me most distress in recent years is the increasing inability
of our children to communicate, either with each other or with anyone 
<?notus-xml column=505?>else. During the consideration in Grand Committee of
the Children and Families Bill, some very chilling figures were
produced showing the number of people who have speech, language and
communication needs. I mention this because there is no doubt that
the lifestyle where children are dumped in front of the TV,
or given computer games or some other electronic means of alleged
entertainment, none of which involves parental engagement, is damaging
their ability to communicate, leading to the lack of a life skill. That
is not helped by the fact that parents do not seem to understand the
damage that is being done to a child’s development by their
being exposed to all this stuff which comes to them at the
flick of a switch or a button. It
prevents them being ready for education when the time comes. As last
year, I hope that the Minister will look seriously at this issue, not
just in the terms of the Bill but of the long-term development of the
talents and welfare of our children, because that is a national
responsibility.</hs_para>

and clarity of this Bill in that all the proposals in it are designed
to prevent such damage and allow the short, medium and long-term
development of our children to take place. I am therefore delighted

Lord Bishop of Chester:</Member></B> My Lords, it will not surprise the
House to learn that I support the Bill, and I add my words of gratitude
to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, for her energy and persistence in
bringing it forward. The Bill deals with an important aspect of child
protection in relation to violent, abusive and, especially,
pornographic material. In speaking mainly about pornography, I make it
clear that I do not think that the issues around pornography in our
society relate only to children. Indeed, I have a Motion for balloted
debate which would look at the wider issues and the impact of
pornography on our society. I hope that the House will have a chance to
explore those rather difficult issues at some point before too
long.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120659000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000040">Only
yesterday, the <I>Financial Times</I> revealed that around a quarter of
all online searches are for pornography and that those who conduct such
searches are then targeted by a host of other companies and users with
related material. According to the report, more than 85% of the 5
million pornographic websites are supported by advertising. That is the
wider background to the debate today. However, for us this morning, the
scope is more limited and, I believe, more straightforward. We are
dealing with an important aspect of child protection. The precise links
between the use of pornography and child abuse are much disputed, as we
have heard, but it seems that there are links, as is regularly
suggested during prosecutions. Strengthening the legal protections for
children in our society may well have a wider and welcome impact upon
the tendency to regard pornography as in some sense just a normal and
natural part of adult life. I hope that we can look at all these
questions if and when my Motion comes up in the ballot.</hs_para>

issue raised by the Bill is the regulation of the internet, which is
not an easy one to address, for reasons of both principle and
practicality, 
<?notus-xml column=506?>as the noble Baroness mentioned just now. However, it is a question that
cannot be avoided. I liken the impact of the electronic age to previous
great social and economic revolutions such as the development of steam
power or the internal combustion engine. I suspect that the impact of
the internet is and will be even greater and will come upon
us even faster. When, in a previous incarnation, I was a chemistry
undergraduate at the University of Oxford, I remember computers in the
1970s which filled whole rooms. They needed to be fed with programs
written in now extinct languages using tickertape. Ten years later,
some homes had portable but still quite bulky and limited computers,
and still later we saw the emergence of the internet itself. The
rapidity of the development has been extraordinary and no doubt has a
long way to run
yet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000042">I have no
doubt that huge benefits have flowed and are flowing from all this, but
the danger in the information age is always that we do not see beyond
the information itself to the higher realities of knowledge and wisdom
that that abundance of information should seek to serve. How do we
bring to bear on the internet the wider wisdom of society?
In this particular regard, how should we seek to extend the protection
of children, which is now so well established offline, to the online
world? We rightly limit the retail availability of pornographic and
violent material to children, and this Bill merely seeks to extend that
protection online.</hs_para>

noticed that I have yet to use a word that occupies a prominent place
in the Bill—the word “adult”. I recognise the
legal reasons for the Bill referring to “adult” material,
but I enter a note of regret that this is the language that has to be
used. I try in my general behaviour to behave in an adult and grown-up
way, no doubt with many failures and notwithstanding the hope for a
certain childlikeness which should attend human beings of every age. I
regret the way that our society has come to associate the word
“pornographic” with the word “adult” quite
so easily; I could suggest some other title or description another day.
Be that as it may, I wholeheartedly support the aim of the Bill to
provide a legal framework for the regulation of the internet and
associated electronic media in this regard.</hs_para>

an approach based simply on self-regulation will do. All credit should
go to the Prime Minister and others who have made a good start in that
area, but the internet is just too powerful for that. The greater the
positive benefits that flow from its power, the greater the likely
dangers that emerge as well. It is simply a rule of life that things
that are of positive benefit usually have a negative use attached to
them somewhere. That is demonstrably the case in relation to the
internet. I acknowledge the efforts that are currently being made but I
do not regard voluntary self-regulation to be fully adequate, either
practically or in terms of its underlying ethos. The provisions of the
Bill would reinforce and undergird the self-regulation that we
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000045">When
one deals with major social issues, voluntary co-operation and
self-regulation are indeed greatly to be welcomed and encouraged, but
the law generally has a role as well. As we have found in so many other
sensitive areas of life—for example, in relation to 
<?notus-xml column=507?>equality and non-discrimination—changes in
the law help to change public attitudes in all sorts of ways, precisely
because the rule of law, which is the foundation of our society and
democracy, is expressed through the specific corpus of actual laws.
That does not mean that all regulatory principles should be set out in
law, but the importance and significance of providing, as far as we
can, a safe environment for our children leads me to support the Bill
wholeheartedly. It is not a matter of freedom versus censorship. It is
about championing the rule of law rather than anarchy; civil society
rather than an internet version of the wild west in which anything
goes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000046">Today’s

this, children are becoming increasingly exposed to the full realities

a positive impact on the attitudes and daily lives of children, but a

that we very properly use the law to protect children from accessing
inappropriate material in the offline world, it is quite wrong that we
have not also used the law to provide equal protection to children in

is precisely for this reason that the noble Baroness’s Bill is
so important. Clause 1 places a duty on internet service providers and
mobile phone operators to provide internet access free from adult

make about this important

I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, on broadening the scope

speakers have said, I welcome the news that progress is being made on a
self-regulatory basis but, given the importance of the issue, I do not
think this subject should be left to self-regulation. The welfare of
our children is just too important. Self-regulation may bring progress
but how secure will that progress be?</hs_para>

Lady Howe, rightly asked what will happen if we have a different Prime
Minister in 10 or 20 years. The sad thing that I must draw
to your Lordships’ attention is that, today, the Prime Minister
has been made to look rather foolish because of his own policy of
self-regulation. On 22 July, he said in his NSPCC speech that all
mobile phones without exception had default filters in place. Today, we
discover that that is not true, and it makes Prime Minister look
foolish. Indeed, his position is particularly awkward because the
Government have seen fit to have Tesco, of all people, on the board of
their UK Council for  
<?notus-xml column=509?>Child Internet Safety, but Tesco does not itself meet the standards that
are required. If default was a matter of law, Tesco would have had to
have behaved responsibly and this would never have happened. We would
have had greater security if we had placed the arrangements on a
statutory
foundation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000060">Thirdly,
Clause 1(3) makes provision for robust statutory age verification. The
truth is that one can use any number of online safety mechanisms, but
if they are not age-verified they are pretty useless. I am extremely
disturbed to hear about the industry’s proposal of a so-called
“closed loop system”. I do not know what that is except
that it does not age-verify at the point of electing to reject filters.
That will not do. This is no time to seek to take short cuts. We are
talking about child protection. If no other part of this Bill becomes
law, I hope that, at the very least, the Government will embrace
statutory age verification, especially since we already make provision
for statutory age verification in relation to online
gambling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000061">Fourthly
and finally, we have to remember that internet service providers making
up 5% of the market have not signed up to the Prime Minister’s
self-regulatory solutions. That may not sound like a huge number, but
let us think about the households that will not be covered. Five per
cent of the market is a huge 1 million households. I am reliably
informed that this will almost certainly mean that 1 million children
will be unprotected, and possibly more. If that is the case and we take
but 0.1% of that 1 million, that is 1,000 children each year who are in
danger of being conditioned and perverted permanently—just
0.1%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000062">The
statutory solution proposed by Clause 1 by the Bill of the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe, will address this problem by ensuring that all
internet service providers are treated equally. Moreover, these
proposals will put mobile phone operators on the same footing. They
will all be under a duty to provide internet access without adult
content—no ifs or buts; no exceptions—but with the option
of accessing that content subject to age verification. Tesco, which
should hang its head in shame, will not be able to ignore the law.
Implementing a statutory solution is the only robust way in which every
internet service provider and mobile phone operator can be accounted
for. Only in that way will every household and therefore every child be
protected. This is a Bill whose time has come. I hope that the
Government will respond
positively.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_06_PT_1/3914C14D351BE3B910938D7631373ECDD9F8580A" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 December 2013">Friday,

in which the privacy of our young people is taken advantage of and

suggested. Most of all, I hope that there will be no more vague and
general speeches, welcome as they are, from our political masters.
Rather, I hope that there will be total determination to tackle this
cancerous problem. I hope that that will be articulated on the Floor of
this Chamber by my noble friend when he replies. I hope that such a
measure will be given absolute priority in the next Queen’s
Speech. I know that my noble friend cannot say what will be in 
<?notus-xml column=512?>the next Queen’s Speech, but he can pass on the serious and
considered views of this House, so that the Prime Minister is aware
that his general statements have our total support but that we urge him

The noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, found in her research and interviews

friend Lady Dean. In her 2008 report, Tanya Byron suggested that as
well as reducing the availability of, and access to, harmful and
inappropriate material, we should build children’s resilience to
the material to which they may be exposed—a very important
aspect of this argument—so that they have the confidence and
skills to navigate the online world more safely, and to form real

I will take it up with the department. It is not enough to leave this

Bill’s clauses but in my remarks I shall particularly focus on
the problem of children purposefully seeking out or stumbling
accidentally upon inappropriate material on the internet.
This crucial challenge is addressed by Clauses 1 and 2, but
I shall also say a word about Clause 5 and the role of
parents.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120659000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000103">The
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester reminded us that Nelson
Mandela once said that a civilised society will always be judged on how
it treats and protects its children. Mandela also proclaimed the
African idea of umuntu ngumuntu ngabantu: a person is a person because
of other people. It is worth pondering on that in a debate that is
reflecting on virtual worlds where screens may often take the place of
personal interaction. In considering how we treat our children, surely
we must all be disturbed that a UNICEF report ranked the United Kingdom
bottom out of 21 developed countries for child welfare. It begs the
question of what sort of world we are bequeathing to our
children, a point made eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, a
few minutes
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000104">Economists
point to what they call intergenerational theft when they talk about
the debts which our children will inherit as a result of our fiscal
profligacy, but there is another kind of intergenerational theft. It is
our failure to protect the innocence of childhood itself. The landscape
of Britain is littered with the consequences. Let me give some
illustrations. The British Association of Perinatal Medicine says that
over the past decade there has been a 67% increase in the number of
children born addicted to drugs, with one in 500 babies needing
treatment for withdrawal. More than 50,000 of our children are listed
on child protection registers or are the subject of child protection
plans. Worldwide, 218 million children—that is one in
seven—are working, and 14% of all children aged five to 17 are
child labourers. Lest we think this is not an issue for us, we should
recall the BBC report of Romanian children, some as young as nine,
found working in freezing fields in Worcestershire. Today’s
Oliver Twists are living in London and all over the world. In the past
year, National Health Service hospitals treated more than 18,000 girls
and 4,000 boys aged 10 to 19 after they had deliberately
harmed themselves. The figure was up 11% on the previous year. Among 10
to 14 year-olds, admissions rose from 4,008 to 5,192, an
increase of 30%. It is estimated that 7% to 14% of adolescents will
self-harm at some point in their life. Suicide is the second most
common cause of death in people aged between 15 and 24, behind
accidental death.</hs_para>

ills most certainly cannot be laid at the door of the internet
exclusively—as we have heard, it can be a wonderful
tool—the presence of suicide sites and sites which encourage
self-harm, create 
<?notus-xml column=518?>insecurity through cyberbullying or rob a child of
innocence is not something about which we can be indifferent. The human
costs are phenomenal and sometimes even fatal. Just two weeks ago, I
distributed prizes at an excellent school in the north of England. It
should have been a day simply to celebrate the achievements of last
year’s leavers. One of the young people had composed a beautiful
song to commemorate the memory of one of her year group. He had taken
his own life after visiting suicide sites. Imagine the effect which
that has had on his family and the school community. That his death is
not an isolated example is underlined by the almost daily news reports.

is not the centrefold of <I>Playboy</I> magazine. It is a million miles
from that and, as we have heard, parents often have no idea of the

than me or most of my generation about computers and the internet, but
no parent in their right mind would knowingly allow a stranger into a
young child’s bedroom, free to teach their loved ones how to
kill themselves, how to self-harm or how to act violently against
other. We are not just talking about children viewing erotic, static
images. We are talking about children viewing images of extreme
violence and explicit pornography, often through videos portraying
various forms of
abuse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000108">I
entirely agree with what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of

out a useful first step in placing a duty on the Secretary of State to
provide means of educating parents of children under the age of 18
about online safety.</hs_para>

is not enough. I am encouraged that, following the Prime
Minister’s important speech to the NSPCC last July, which has
been referred to throughout this debate, there have been some positive
developments, and it is right to welcome his personal commitment and
what the Government have done thus far. However, as noble Lords on all
sides of the House have said, there is much more to be done. Internet
access is increasing all the time. On average, one-third of 10
year-olds spend three hours or more on computers every day. An NSPCC
report published earlier this year found that 91% of all five to 15
year-olds used the internet in 2012. When looked at by age, three in
four five to seven year-olds, nearly all eight to 11 year-olds and all
12 to 15 year-olds have used the
internet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000110">As I
have made clear, I believe that the internet is one of the most
profound inventions in human history. It has had, and continues to
have, a phenomenal impact on so many peoples’ lives
across the globe, developing awareness and understanding of the world
around us. I have seen it used in remote villages in Africa, helping
people to leapfrog educational disadvantages. I have also seen how
young people in the UK have used this knowledge to respond generously
and
selflessly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000111">However,
we are all acutely aware that is another side to the story of the
expansion of the internet, and that is what the Bill is concerned with.
The internet represents the biggest challenge ever in bringing up
children. As I have illustrated, children and young people
are being increasingly exposed to negative influences. In a country
where 800,000 children have no contact with their fathers—men
who have abandoned the mothers of their children—there are too
frequently no voices to correct, to guide, to help navigate
life’s choppy waters. That is why we have a duty as legislators,
often in loco parentis, to challenge influences which include
deplorable sexual and racial stereotyping, and the use of obscene
language—things which diminish us all, not just
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000112">The
advertisements on many sites, often targeted at young people, are
equally aggressive and awful. Many promote hedonism as a substitute for
a happy life. It is not surprising that the Children’s Society
says that 89% of parents think that these influences have made their
children more materialistic—but who created these conditions for
such nihilism and acquisitiveness in the first place? We did, and it is
time that we did something about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000113">The House
should ask itself how we intend to act on the parliamentary inquiry
which last year found that one in three children aged just 10 or under
has seen sexual images online? Are we just going to allow this to
gather dust? As the House would expect, the cross-party inquiry
concluded that children are suffering as a result. The inquiry
noted:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13120659000434" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000434">“Overuse
of pornographic material has been shown to desensitise children and
young people to violent or sexually aggressive acts, diminish sympathy
for victims of sexual assault and reduce children’s own
inhibitions, making them more vulnerable to abuse and exploitation.
Moreover, a vicious circle of behaviour can develop where exposure to
porn leads to early sexual involvement and an increased consumption of
sexual media”.</hs_quote>

maintained that the rise of internet pornography is leaving teenagers

earlier today.</hs_parafo>

John Woods, speaking recently on Radio 4, drew attention to the way in
which viewing pornography and other harmful material can have a
considerable impact on how a child views others, how they view the
world around them and indeed how they view themselves. The advertising
industry in the UK has in the past 12 months spent £14 billion.
They would not bother to do that if they did not think that
what we see and hear has an influence upon us. According to research by
Ybarra and Mitchell, children exposed to pornography are far more
likely to be depressed and are far more likely to be less bonded to
their care givers.</hs_parafo>

view these images and move on. These images can cause real trauma for
weeks, months or even years to come. For many children it is hard to
compute what they may have seen. If the internet has no boundaries, if
everything is open and accessible, many children will fail to
distinguish between what is abusive and what is not, what is legal and
what is not. If children are being fed images of abuse, many will
invariably come to think that this is the
norm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000118">Children

aftermath of the killing in Liverpool in 1993 of the two year-old James
Bulger by two 10 year-old boys who had been exposed to gratuitously
violent video material, which was referred to by the judge when the
trial took place, I tabled an amendment in the House of Commons,
supported on all sides of that Chamber, to protect children from
gratuitously violent video material. At the time, the Home Office
advisers said that we did not need such a provision because
self-regulation was enough. Parliament, I am glad to say, disagreed and
when the Bill came to your Lordships’ House my amendment was
incorporated and the law was
changed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000119">The
idea that self-regulation is an appropriate long-term tool for
upholding child protection is bizarre. In the first instance, it
presents us with a complete inconsistency. As a matter of law we do not
allow children to buy R18 films. If a 14 year-old said that they wanted
to go into a film that was full of explicit sexual and violent imagery,
would you allow them? No. We rightly decided that legislators and
parents have the responsibility of ensuring that children are not
exposed to such material. What, then, is different about the internet?
There is a flagrant inconsistency in how the law treats children
offline and online. My noble friend’s Bill provides us with the

also seems a very odd solution, given what the Prime Minister has said
on the subject. As we have heard, in his NSPCC speech he said that

am not suggesting that progress cannot be made on a self-regulatory

Parenting today is a challenge, particularly in the area of technology,
in which our children are growing up with gadgets and devices that had
not hit the high street even a few years ago. So often, children are
more tech savvy than parents. Indeed, in the latest Ofcom report on
children and media, around half of parents of children aged five to 15
said that they feel their child knows more about the internet than they
do, and 14% of parents with children aged three to four
agreed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120659000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000123">We
need to give parents all the tools we can to help them keep their child

excellent start and would allow parents to choose not to have adult

<?notus-xml column=522?>their house via their internet service provider. However, there is still
the dilemma of how to ensure each child has access to what is
appropriate to their age. It is no longer enough to turn the TV off
when certain programmes are being shown. The plethora of electronic
devices in the home today means that any content can be easily accessed

trend. The modern home is full of electronic devices, so I fully
support the need for more precise filtering than simply
relying on whether someone is 18 or not. Clause 3 would require
manufacturers of electronic devices that can connect to the internet to

referred to the Prime Minister’s speeches on this area. If you
read those speeches, part of their rationale is because he wants to put
the family at the centre of a stable society. The family is about a web
of mutual relationships—it is about mutuality, not about
exploitation. That is the issue that we have to get hold of very
clearly. We have heard from many noble Lords about how pornography is
exploitative in every way. We have heard about its harmful effects on
young people especially, about understandings of sex, how boys are led
to see that sex is about having power over women, and how girls are led
to see that sex is about performing in a certain kind of way. It causes
very damaging ideas about body image. We heard from the noble Lord,
Lord Alton, about the objectification of women and violence against
women<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:04:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about not mutuality but exploitation of one human being by another.
They damage the family and the fabric of society. Therefore, besides
the issues about technical controls, I want us just to think for a
moment about what is driving this and pushing us to try to put up the
barriers. It seems that the driver, as other noble Lords have alluded
to, is aggressive business that makes a great deal of money out of the
pornographic industry. The Bailey report about the sexualisation of
children talked about pop-ups that confront people and lead them astray
while they are using the internet. It uses the term
“pestering”. There is a direction in highly organised
business that pesters people, enticing and pushing them into the area
of exploitation.</hs_para>

night I was privileged to attend a debate on the banking industry in
this House led by the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of
Canterbury. One of the things that that debate made clear was that an
industry that is vital to us and very important had gone astray in the
sense of having the right kinds of moral compass and moral values. The
most reverend Primate talked about the need to change the culture in
that industry so that mutuality, proper standards and trust could be
regained. The same applies to what is euphemistically called the
entertainment industry. There is an enormous drive in it that shatters
our trust that we can entrust our children—or even
ourselves—to it. We have to be very careful about the language
we use. We are talking about safety, which is a very soft word. We use
the word “adult” for certain kinds of material. That kind
of material does not make anyone adult at all. Adults are people who do
mutuality, not
exploitation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:06:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000133">That
industry is about violence, cruelty and misogyny. That brings us to the
classic debate that is around today between freedom on the one hand and
censorship and control on the other. Some noble Lords may have noticed
that Theresa May talked in a speech yesterday about the importance of
freedom of speech, but said that that should not extend to giving a
platform for what she called “violent extremism”. There
have to be some limits. She talked about the danger of organisations,
in the name of freedom of speech, giving violent extremists space for a
platform. There is an analogy there that we need to think about very
carefully. The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, spoke very eloquently about
the importance of possibly legislating and not just creating a platform
of freedom for people who 
<?notus-xml column=524?>behave in that way. Can we learn anything from the
Home Secretary’s approach to violence and extremism? That is

I invite the Minister to comment, not simply on the importance of

other areas of the political landscape—to help us to create a
frame that will make it difficult both for exploitation to trump
mutuality; and for an entertainment industry, which sounds a great

further. In fact, things seem to be getting increasingly worse.
Therefore, my noble friend’s Bill is very timely. As many others
have said, including my noble friend, I wish that the Bill could have
been taken forward last year. Still, it is better late than
never<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:22:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000152">I
thank the internet service providers for their co-operation so far and
for setting aside £25 million to help children who are adversely
affected by adult content material on the internet, or who are at risk
of being so affected. I also thank them for the wonderful contribution
that they certainly make to my family. My sister lives in Australia
and, although I have not been reading them, she has been pinging
e-mails to me throughout this debate. We can keep in touch, and if
someone in the family is unwell we can keep in communication and
support that person. Therefore, I thank the ISPs for the way in which
they touch the whole of humanity in such a positive

suggest that we should look at raising the age for protecting young
people from 18 to 21, because children and young people develop at
different rates. Those who are expert in this area often talk about
“stage not age”. For example, we take extra precautions
as regards vulnerable young people leaving care—precautions
which last into their early adulthood—as we recognise their
vulnerability which stems from the trauma that 
<?notus-xml column=528?>they experienced earlier in their lives. Therefore, I think that there
is a very strong case for taking this forward from 18 to 21 on the
precautionary
principle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:24:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000154">I
am a vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Children and
Young People in Care and Leaving Care and a trustee of the child
welfare charity, the Michael Sieff Foundation. I am particularly
interested in young people at the edge of care and who are taken into
care and care leavers. Their history is very often one of profound
abuse, neglect within the family and family trauma. To give an
indication of the processes that take place in these children, many of
them feel a deep sense of guilt. My noble and learned friend Lady
Butler-Sloss, who is not in her place, recently attended an event at
which a young child talked about her parents’
break-up. She said she was sure that her parents had separated because
she did not keep her room tidy. Children take all the blame upon
themselves if they are unloved by their parents, are attacked by them
or if their parents split up. They often have an overwhelming sense of
guilt and blame. This came up in the debate about young people feeling
extremely guilty about accessing pornography on the internet and
fearing that the police would come to take them
away<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:25:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000155">Another
process is attention: children who have been neglected will often have
an overwhelming need to gain the attention of adults. Girls and young
women may access the internet to see what is available and then realise
that they can gain attention through it. They may also be led into
interaction with others on the internet and posting naked images of
themselves. This can come back on them in a very adverse way. I am
probably jumping the gun there, but because of their family
experience<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:26:36"></hs_TimeCode> there
is a real desperate need in many of these young people for attention
from anyone. Finally, the third process that comes into play is
profound difficulty in making and keeping intimate relationships,
because the people who they trusted most in their lives have
disappointed
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:26:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

pornography and access by children to pornography, this guilt that they
experience perhaps means that they feel worthless and that when they
access pornography they cannot have proper relationships with others.
Once they start accessing it, they feel guilty because they have seen
the stuff; and then they feel worse because they access more. It can be
a vicious downwards spiral. If they find it difficult to have close
relationships with other people they can find a sort of false closeness
in pornography. They may become increasingly engaged with and addicted
to it. As they become more ensconced and as they grow up it becomes
even harder for them to relate to other people, girls and women. I have
mentioned the issue of attention, and girls wishing to be filmed and
posting that on the

there that I hope will come to the consideration of the House when we
are in Committee. I am sorry that I am going on for so long, and will
conclude as soon as possible. Meg Munn MP, the chair of the All-Party
Parliamentary Group on Child Protection, is producing a report, one
aspect of which is looking at children who sexually harm other
children. The group held a meeting this week on this matter.
Dr Eileen Vizard attended that meeting; she has worked 
<?notus-xml column=529?>for many years at the NSPCC, treating young children who sexually harm
other children. She lamented the fact that the strategy that she
developed 13 years ago for treating children who had harmed other
children had not been properly implemented and was not properly funded.
I hope that we can look at this aspect as we go through the Bill.
Perhaps the Minister will be prepared to meet some of the concerned
parties and consider how we are helping children who sexually harm
other children. I am sure that access to pornography on the internet is
not only drawing more children into this behaviour, as we have heard,
but making it harder for them to move on from
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T12:29:13"></hs_TimeCode>. I also hope
that the internet service providers will think of providing more money
for services for children who sexually harm other children; this is
desperately needed because the risk is that they will become adults who
sexually harm children if they are not treated at a young

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Baroness, Lady Howe, who is doughty campaigner on this issue, on
securing leave to bring forward this Bill for a second Second Reading.
It has been an enjoyable and wide-ranging debate that has reached out
into all areas that should be covered by this topic. I also
congratulate the Government on the work they have been doing on this
issue of online child protection, continuing the work started by the
previous Administration—particularly, the Byron
report.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120659000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000160">It is
good to note that until now and, I hope, for a long time to come,
questions such as these have never split along party lines. We have all
been able to maintain broad agreement about what should be the main
thrust of policy. But first a word of caution: it seems to me that the
latest technology is always blamed for the current moral panic.
Shakespeare’s Globe is built where it is because the then powers
that be were concerned that his plays would have an adverse effect on
the lower orders. Penny dreadfuls, video nasties, pornography
generally, the internet and gaming are all blamed for the faults that
we see in society and are reflected back in whatever it is that those
we care about are doing. We have to remember, as has been said already
in this debate, that the internet is a wonderful tool—but it is
a tool, not a person. It cannot be evil in itself, as the noble Lord,
Lord Cormack suggested, because those who use it make it so—if
that is indeed what we think. We must not, therefore, get too excited
and carried away about this. We have to reflect and act with careful
consideration on the basis of evidence.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120659000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000161">There is no causal
relationship, as I understand it, between the internet and many of
today’s concerns. Indeed, when we talk about this issue in
language that reflects things such as the “dark
internet”, epidemics, floods, negative influences, or the
perversity that it encourages, you have to believe that in some senses
we have already made up our minds about what we think about this.
Indeed, it might be that, “We’re all doomed”, 
<?notus-xml column=530?>in the words of that famous phrase. The history of how we
have dealt with moral panics in the past should give us some cause for
hope, even though the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,
which were picked up by the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and others on the
impact of the internet on our young people and the technologies that it
reflects give us cause for concern.</hs_para>

Massey and others mentioned the film made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Kidron, “InRealLife”. I should declare an interest
because my then 19 year-old son had a cameo part in that film. The
noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, deals with the addictive nature of the
net, and this issue does not get enough discussion. Many aspects of
games and other internet-based materials seem to be designed around
reward technology, which in turn can make young people make bad
choices—or, arguably, unable to make choices. This is not
something that gets picked up a lot but is a key feature of her
film.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120659000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000163">The
answer to many of the problems that have been raised so far is
education—indeed, that is reflected in the Bill. We on this side
of the House believe that the right way to approach this issue is to
help parents by empowering them and by self-regulation. I note that the
Prime Minister has made it clear that were satisfactory agreements not
to be forthcoming on a voluntary, self-regulatory basis, he would not
hesitate to step in and legislate. Mind you, the intention is not
always followed by the deed, and sometimes it can have quite unexpected
consequences. I suggest that the lobbying—or gagging—Bill
is a case in point. As the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, rightly said, it
will be interesting to hear from the Minister whether the Government
are minded to support the opportunity that this Bill provides to
deliver that statutory underpinning promised by the Prime
Minister.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120659000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000164">As
has been raised in this debate, there are some reservations about the
exact way in which the Bill will deal with the issue that it seeks to
resolve. We have talked a lot about age verification. It is true that
in relation to online gambling age verification for every customer is
already mandatory under the Gambling Act 2005, a measure brought in
under the previous Administration. However, that was designed for
different purposes, and it may be robust but it may not be sufficient
for the present purpose.</hs_para>

mobile phone networks have also been using age verification since 2005
as a mechanism for allowing their existing filters to be lifted on
request. We need to be sure that a robust system of age verification is
available and that it can be effective. If this is the way we are going
to go, there should be absolutely no possibility of loopholes, such as
exist with Tesco and BlackBerry. These are clearly scandals and should
be addressed. Can the Minister explain whether any work is being done
on this by his department?</hs_para>

filters work is basically a technical one but it raises all sorts of
issues about what is caught and whether the filters will do the job
required. We have a long way to go on that and I think that it will be
very difficult to legislate until we have more and certain information
about how they work.</hs_para>

the questions of what exactly adult content is and what relationship
that adult content should have to age and age verification. As has been
said, “adult content” is a euphemism and it conceals real
difficulties in defining it. I notice that the Bill has a number of
different ways of approaching that, and of course it does not go down
the route of obscenity, for which we are glad. However, I still have
doubts about how current bodies assess the norms that are too easily
prayed in aid around matters concerning adult content or, indeed,
obscenity itself. When you look at the ways in which the existing
bodies arrive at their conclusions—counting individual uses of
swear words or staring endlessly at screens waiting for a flash of
naked skin or worse—you wonder whether we are getting sensible
decisions out of that system. Of course, different cultures have
different norms and different language surrounding the depiction of
sexual activity, which simply have to be considered when we
think about this. At the bottom of this, we have to be
suspicious of those who advocate censorship in the name of protecting
the vulnerable. History has many lessons in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000168">This
debate is specifically about children, and rightly so, but there are
concerns here about other issues. Research shows that those who are
more vulnerable in real life are also more vulnerable
online—those with disabilities, those in low socioeconomic
groups and families who have suffered trauma. It is also worth noting
that young people make more unsafe decisions and contacts late at night
when they are tired. All these things paint a picture that means we
could identify a much larger group of people who are at risk than
simply those specified in the Bill. Should we not pause and think about
how best to deal with that wider group? Perhaps the Minister would like
to pick up on that point when he comes to respond.</hs_para>

internet use. In particular, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of

experience of that, in that close friends of ours have a child who has
experienced this sort of thing. It is absolutely devastating not only
for the individual child but for her friends, her friendship group and
the school. Of course, schools deal mainly only with what happens in
the school and they find it difficult to bring a joined-up approach to
what happens outside, yet we should be looking for a holistic approach

to get through, so we need to hear from the Minister where exactly he

develop effective measures to keep children safe online, given the
phenomenal pace of change and development—change and development
that I am afraid I often simply find difficult to grapple
with—the Government are exploiting the skills and talents of
the experts developing internet technologies, who are the
very people who are going to help ensure that children and young people
are safe. We believe that this is the best way to keep pace with the
changes and evolving risks that children face. The UK Council for Child
Internet Safety brings together representatives from industry,
manufacturers, charities, academia, social media, parents’
groups and government to do just this. It is through UKCCIS and its
partnership working model that voluntary and self-regulatory measures
have been developed which will help to ensure that children are safer
online. The importance of engaging industry is that the solutions
developed can be fleet, flexible and fully responsive to the rapid rate
of technological change. Holistic technological solutions are one
aspect of a wider remedy which includes education and awareness for
parents and children, and building children’s
resilience.</hs_para>

the Prime Minister’s keynote speech to the NSPCC, referred to in
particular by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, he called on internet
industries to step up efforts to prevent children and young

called for default filtering of inappropriate content, requiring users
to opt in with internet service providers and mobile operators. The
Government share the intention behind this provision, but believe that
this can be and is being secured by a non-legislative route. The
majority of mobile customers are already covered by “default
on” filters, and the Government are working with the mobile
sector to ensure that all customers are protected in this way. Three
has committed to change to “default on” in 2014 for
contract customers. The issue with Tesco Mobile was rightly raised by
the noble Baroness, Lady Howe and the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis. I have
looked into this and, while I am unhappy about it, I am pleased that it
has come to light. I understand that Tesco is now working to address
it, with the intention that filters will be in place early next year.
The situation was not satisfactory, but the problem was identified and
is now being addressed by Tesco.</hs_para>

Minister also announced that the four largest internet service
providers, which together cover around 90% of the home broadband
market, will, from early next year, implement family-friendly
network-level parental control filters, meaning that all new customers
will be prompted to make a choice about the application of filters.
Importantly, filters will be preselected so that they will be applied
in those homes where parents do not engage. By the end of next year,
the ISPs will have contacted all of their existing customers to invite
them to set the filters too.</hs_para>

parents the choice is important. In line with the advice of experts,
the Government believe that engaging parents is the best way to ensure
that children are kept safe. Some have argued that default filters can
lead to parents disengaging, assuming that their work is done.
Importantly, such filters do not help with cyberbullying, or grooming,
which was raised by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, and my
noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern. Parents are being
provided with the tools to keep their children safe rather than being
lulled into a false sense of security. I will refer shortly to plans
for promoting greater
awareness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000186">The
noble Baroness also calls for an enhanced role for Ofcom to regulate
the standards of filtering in line with the standards Ofcom must uphold
in relation to broadcast content, and the age verification processes 
<?notus-xml column=535?>as set out in Clause 1. Ofcom has done an excellent job as the
communications regulator and the Government understand the noble
Baroness’s aims in seeking to expand its remit here. The
Government’s position is that continuing to work with industry,
working flexibly to address the needs of consumers, is the way to keep
children safe online.</hs_para>

role for Ofcom. In his speech in July, the Prime Minister asked Ofcom
to report later this month on parental awareness, take-up and
confidence in the tools available to help parents keep their children
safe. The noble Lord, Lord Browne of Belmont, highlighted the need for
parental awareness and having the tools required. Ofcom was also asked
to report again on these in a year’s time and to report in the
spring on whether the internet service providers have met their
commitments to implement family-friendly network-level
filters.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120659000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0001.htm#13120659000188">The
Bill also requires device manufacturers to provide a means of filtering
on a device at the point of purchase. Again, the Government agree with
the intention behind this provision, seeking to ensure that devices
purchased in the UK include device-level filters. The Government have
been working with the suppliers represented on the UKCCIS to drive
greater take-up of device-level filtering, with working groups led by
techUK looking at expanding device-level controls for laptops, tablets
and connected televisions.</hs_para>

that the network-level filters that will be in place for the four
largest ISPs mean that all devices in the home connected to the
internet service with filters set will be covered. Moreover, as of
September this year, around 90% of public wi-fi is now filtered where
children are likely to be, meaning that children are less likely to
access inappropriate content when away from home.</hs_para>

internet service providers and mobile operators to provide clear

Secretary of State to provide a means to educate parents of those under

absolutely share the noble Baroness’s view that greater
education is key. The internet service providers will be making
customers aware of the wealth of information they have on internet
safety at the time they are invited to set filters. The Prime Minister
has also asked the ISPs to take the lead across the industry to help
increase parental awareness. Next spring the ISPs will be launching a
large-scale, three-year campaign, with a budget of around £25
million for the first year alone, to raise parental awareness on
internet safety. The noble Earl, Lord Listowel, referred to this. I was
most grateful for the brief that TalkTalk and Sky provided, emphasising
what they propose to do. It is expected that the campaign will provide
advice to parents on how to keep children safe online, make good use of
filters and signpost to further sources of advice and support. Ofcom
will track the impact through its

children in internet safety is key, as my noble and learned friend Lord
Mackay of Clashfern and the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen,

announced changes to the curriculum which from next year will see all
five to 16 year-olds in maintained schools taught age-appropriate
internet safety. This will include teaching children, in an
age-appropriate way, how to use the internet safely

look at my own title. The first official document for the Earl of
Caithness goes back to 1334. There were Earls of Caithness before that,
but 1334 is taken as the first creation. Those noble Lords who are
aficionados of Shakespeare will know that the Earl of Caithness appears
in the play “Macbeth”—and Macbeth got killed or
died in 1057. That Earl of Caithness was Thorfinn, more of a Viking
mormær, or Earl, than a Scottish one—it was under Norse
law. The person who got the title in 1334, Maol Íosa V, also
Earl of Strathearn, was the first creation. He forfeited his titles
through treason and the title died out, so that was the end of the
earldom of Caithness.</hs_para>

the prerogative of the Crown, there was a second grant a few years
later, in 1375, to David Stewart, a younger son of Robert II of
Scotland, who left his title to his heiress, Euphemia—so the
Scots were well ahead in showing that females could inherit a
title<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T13:11:59"></hs_TimeCode>. That
creation died out, too; this is the wonderful thing about having
hereditary Peers. There is another gap and then we come to the third
creation, Sir George Crichton in 1452—but he surrendered the
title in the same year, so the Earl of Caithness came to an end yet
again. The fourth creation comes down to
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T13:12:27"></hs_TimeCode>. As one can
see, one was able to perpetuate the title but with different families,

will be all sorts of legal problems to be sorted out; in fact, the Bill

the Bill. The settlement of the Shrewsbury family had to be done by a

1 and my subsequent amendments are about the definition of hereditary

Great Britain or the United Kingdom only. In fact, this is already a
hybrid Bill because it incorporates the baronetcies of Ireland but not
the peerages of Ireland. That is the effect of Amendment 4. It is
particularly 
<?notus-xml column=541?>relevant for my noble friend Lord Clancarty. He is
the Earl of Clancarty as well Baron Kilconnel and Viscount

equally if we possibly can, but the fact is, as my noble friend said,
that these matters are of extraordinary complexity. We have already
dealt with the problems being faced by my noble friend Lord Shrewsbury.
My noble friend Lord Caithness described the problems being faced by
the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty. What are we to do about this? At the
very least, if we agree some of these amendments, we risk making the
Bill a hybrid Bill. Noble Lords smile at that, but the fact is that a
hybrid Bill is a very different animal from the one we are considering
today. It needs Select Committees, learned counsel and all sorts of
distinguished things that take a great deal of time and, no doubt, a

Deech (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, although I am no expert on the
hereditary peerage, I entered into a correspondence with the Ministry
of Justice—in fact with the Crown Office—on this matter.
The noble Lord, Lord Wallace, told the House at the end of Second
Reading that my specific point about husbands—and, indeed, the
whole Bill—is a matter for the royal prerogative. According to
the Crown Office’s letter, hereditary peerages are a matter of
property.</hs_para>

therefore seems to me to be very simple. Under the European Convention
on Human Rights, we may not discriminate on grounds of property.
Article 14 says that there shall be no discrimination on, inter alia,
grounds of status;
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T13:20:33"></hs_TimeCode> is absolutely
straightforward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T13:20:34"></hs_TimeCode>.
If hereditary titles are property, we simply cannot discriminate. Under
own Equality Acts—we have not yet got to those
amendments—we cannot attach conditions to women that we do not
attach to men, and vice versa.</hs_para>

to the other, it is against our equality law.</hs_para>

probably no surprise to the House that I support Amendment 4. Irish
peerages are an identifiable group under the current jurisdiction of

which has a certain ambiguity attached to it. My own peerage, the
Earldom of Clancarty, is Irish, though I sit in this House by virtue of

current definition of hereditary title, which comes right at the

are not titles conferred by Her Majesty the Queen. All sorts of things
could be caught up, for instance Scottish clan chiefships, which can
devolve separately and differently, and which are regulated by the
Court of the Lord Lyon. Therefore I thought it much easier to keep
those out of it. In fact, many of the amendments in the name
of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun,
also intend to do the same thing. I thought that an easier way was to
define it right at the beginning, so that the term “hereditary
title” is restricted in its definition and does not
inadvertently catch up all sorts of other honorifics, honorary titles
and other things which may be hereditary, such as the hereditary keeper
of the something or other, or the hereditary groom of the something or
other, and so on. Those can all go on doing what they do, the major

so simple. Of course the Bill will get blocked in the Commons. If any
noble Lords have nothing to do on a Friday afternoon at 2.30 pm when
the Commons is sitting, you will see the government Whip with a list of
all the Bills, and he shouts “Object” to all of them.
Last Friday he even objected to the Bill to give a pardon to Alan
Turing. I thought that that was absolutely shameful. This House totally
agreed that that Bill should go forward. That happened for reasons that
the Government do not have to explain. The procedure in the Commons is
absolutely lacking in total transparency. I will not digress too much

House when it comes to whether it wishes to accept amendments or not. I
am content with the current scope of the Bill, so far as it goes, but I
shall not stand in the way of the House if it wishes to change that. I
certainly agree with the intent of my noble friend’s Amendment
4. I think that the Bill should cover Ireland. However, as to whether
it should be restricted to peerages or baronetcies, I tend to come at
this from the point of view of gender equality, and therefore do not
particularly wish to preserve little islands of male supremacy in
whatever strange form they may exist. There was certainly a dispute
going back in my family as to whether or not they were the hereditary
sword bearers in front of the Queen. They lost that argument, but I am
aware that these offices exist. As an aside, I am also rather intrigued
by the history of the title of my noble friend Lord Caithness. If we
could make this measure retrospective, we might have a number of Lord
Caithnesses and perhaps they could duel to the death to decide who
should succeed. However, other than that, I am content with the Bill as

heredity is a different game. The Bill seeks to impose on five
different regimes one solution that fits all, the principle of which
none of us disagrees with. In Scotland, the position is very different
and there are huge complications which will end up in a number of court
cases. That is why I want the Bill to be much more specific. However, I

Earl of Erroll:</Member></B> My Lords, that set the cat among the
pigeons because I thought it would be best if we took away all these
bits of the Bill that were trying to constructively limit the scope of
the legislation—“peerage”,
“baronetcy” and great offices of state—and work
out which was the best way of doing that. In his amendments, the noble
Earl, Lord Caithness, proposed one method of doing so. After talking to
other people, I thought that there was another, neater method of doing
so. If you combined my Amendment 2 with Amendment 6, it would produce a
definition of how we want the Bill to be limited as regards hereditary
title. The rest of the Bill would then read logically and would achieve
the aim of the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, in trying to produce a
gender-neutral succession. This is not a destructive proposal but is
just a matter of definition. I had rather thought that we might
withdraw all the amendments around this subject, gone away, thought
about them and agreed on the best way of defining it, and make the Bill
consistent in such a way that anyone could pick it up and understand
what on earth we were talking about and what it meant. I would suggest,
if the Bill were ever rewritten, that this might be a slightly less
cumbersome way of achieving the objective than having to insert
“or baronetcy” and so on throughout the Bill. That is why
I favoured my amendment over the other.</hs_para>

that Amendment 1 has failed we should either withdraw Amendment 2 and
go away to discuss it, or press it because it would at least be an
improvement on the generic term, “hereditary titles”,
which can encompass all the other sorts of things that we do not want
to be caught in the Bill. After considerable debate in the Standing
Council of Scottish Chiefs, for instance, there was general consensus
that it would be better to keep that issue separate and not in the
Bill. At the moment, you can leave a chiefship to a daughter, and you
can change the destination if you need to if a person is unsuitable or
by certain applications and approvals. That should be dealt with
completely separately to the Bill. We wanted to ensure that that sort
of thing 
<?notus-xml column=548?>was not caught up in it inadvertently, which is why I tabled this other

deals with the range or inclusiveness of titles, rights and offices to
be considered as part of this Bill. We need to bear in mind the
Equality Act 2006, which created a public duty on grounds of gender.

administered on behalf of the Crown by the College of Arms in England
and Wales, for instance.</hs_para>

is that in England and Wales there are up to 100,000 holders of coats

are talking about quite a sizeable group here. The most publicised
grantee in recent years has been Michael Middleton, whose youngest
child James can pass the coat of arms down to his children—in
fact any son can do so—so they may proliferate through all the
male lines, but the two daughters, the Duchess of Cambridge and Pippa

cannot.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0002.htm#13120659000272">The

noble Earl is absolutely right in what he said, which comes back to the
point that we discussed on the first amendment. The noble Earl is the
Lord High Constable of Scotland, a title of the Crown, or state, to
which he succeeded after his mother. However, it is nothing to do with
the earldom of Erroll; it is a totally separate issue. In Scotland, we
also have the Hereditary Bearer of the National Flag of Scotland, who
is the Earl of Lauderdale, the Hereditary Royal Standard-Bearer for
Scotland, who is our noble friend Lord Dundee, and the Hereditary
Keeper of Holyrood Palace, who is the Duke of Hamilton. Those are
fairly straightforward and should be dealt with in this amendment.
Without being at all derogatory, we then get down to perhaps a slightly
lesser level. What about the Keeper of the Ancient Staff of St Moluag?
Should that be hereditary? This is the real problem with this issue and
why it needs to be so clearly defined.</hs_para>

talked about clan chiefships. This is a matter of debate: some writers
to the Signet, in some cases, have said that clan chiefship is a title
and others have said that it is a right or a privilege. We could have a
huge number of court cases trying to decide that. It is not our job in
this House to leave legislation ambiguous; we need to be absolutely
clear. The lawyers make enough money as it is and we do not want to
give them any more.</hs_para>

amendment of the noble Earl, Lord Clancarty, which is a good example of
where the Bill is being extended to include armigers. Of course, the
rules in Scotland are different from those in England, and this one
solution to fit all systems comes apart. If my daughter marries a Mr
Smith, she cannot then bear her coat of arms as a Sinclair unless she
changes her name. In Scotland, if an heiress inherits, to assume the
coat of arms she is required to change her name, otherwise she is
conventionally dead within the family and the next heir then inherits.
It is not fun to be conventionally dead, or indeed unconventionally
dead. In contrast, a peerage or baronetcy is generally not legally
connected to a name. There are lots of examples of a peerage or
baronetcy granted to Mr X where the name changes with various
inheritances. There are some Scottish peerages where there is an
obligation to bear the original name of the arms, but those are a
limited minority.</hs_para>

My wife, Isabelle Astell, is English and is armigerous. She is the heir
to the Astell place and to the Astell arms. As far as I know, she still
bears her own arms and I hope she will pass them to one of our sons. It
happens to be that way round but, given that she inherited them, they
could presumably be passed to a daughter. This issue needs looking at
and thinking about but the point is well taken. At a later stage of the

it does, I have taken out “hereditary peerage”, so that

That makes it much simpler than changing it throughout. I recommend
that we accept this amendment in order that Amendment 2 is logical. My
challenge is trying to work out all the other ones which are the same.
If you see something with my name on it saying “remove
‘hereditary peerage or’” it is in order to ensure

Trefgarne:</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid that this amendment seems
to suffer from some of the difficulties that we have been discussing;
namely, the possibility that there is a hybrid element within it. There
seem to be a number of possible areas of hybridity in this Bill, which
makes the whole Bill very difficult to proceed with. The proper way to
proceed with a Bill that might or might not be hybrid is for it to be
referred to the Examiners. I hope that if the Bill proceeds further
after today, that will happen—it will have to happen; it will
not be up to me alone, of
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000288" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0002.htm#13120659000288">Has

not think I am qualified to speak on hybridity, which I seem to
remember is the question of whether a Public Bill affects the rights of
a subset of people differently from the general class of people. I do
not think my amendment does that because I have spoken just in terms of
general classes: hereditary peerage, baronetcy and officers of the
Crown and state. Those are generic classes, with no special
definitions, unlike the House of Lords Bill, which discriminated in

Earl of Erroll:</Member></B> My Lords, I think the answer is that this
is about English. For the purposes of the Bill, one might restrict the
term “hereditary titles”; for instance, a description of
“the incumbent” does not mean to say the
incumbent of every parish or the incumbent of everything. Some of these
are generic words in English. The wording “hereditary
titles” is used merely within the Bill: a restricted class of
hereditary titles is used in the Bill and called “hereditary
titles”. That does not mean we are trying to affect the
terminology of hereditary titles for the English language as a whole
outside.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0002.htm#13120659000292">I
have to admit that I had hoped the first amendment would not have been
negatived and therefore we would have taken all these away and sat down
and got them logical as a whole in the Bill, with the help of the noble
Lord, Lord Lucas. However, that has not happened. Perhaps we can just
clean it up on Report if necessary, but certainly Amendment 6 is needed
in order to make sense of Amendment 2, so I suggest that we accept that
one and if we then miss some of the other ones later, to make it
logical we bring it back on Report and do a massive amount of
tidying-up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120659000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131206-0002.htm#13120659000293">Certainly,
Amendments 6, 28, 31—off the top of my head—35, 39 and 43
are all the same. You can work through them: they are the amendments in
my name only. I had added my name to the alternative amendment in the
names of the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, and the noble Lady, Lady
Saltoun, because I wanted to show that I also supported those and that
it was a question of which of them we should tidy up. However, now that
that has been negated, I think that we have to drive forwards with mine
for the moment and tidy it up on Report.</hs_para>

The same principle was used

Anstruthers had two baronetcies and they produced a son out of wedlock.

peerage is concerned. That is why I congratulate my noble friend Lord
Lucas on aiming to do this. As he told us a few minutes ago, I approach

number of noble Lords—indeed, my hereditary

will not mention their names. They have family trusts that have been
arranged to take account of the fact that their second child, for
example, is going to succeed to the peerage. Indeed, I do not mind

non-existent. In that case, this House, if it is going to consider this
subject, must consider very carefully what it is trying to
achieve. It is very useful that this House said in an almost
declamatory way that it favours the eldest child succeeding
to the title whether that child be male or female. I am not

may be different in England and Scotland. It is a matter of Scottish
law. All I am saying is that if it applies to a Scottish title, then
Scottish law will apply to the definition of an heir. Whatever the
definition of an heir is, that heir in future, according to this
proposal, will be either male or female depending upon which is the
eldest. That is the Scottish position. So be it. The English position
may be different. I do not see the difficulty that the noble Earl, Lord
Caithness, sees in this. The proposal talks about an
“heir”. What is an heir? It is one thing in England and
one thing in Scotland. You cannot marry the two together in a Bill; of

now; it was a constituency case when I was a Member of the other House.
I raised the case of a child born of a surrogate mother but with the
gametes of the Monarch and the Queen—if that is where the
succession passed—and I asked whether, over the succession to
the Crown issue, that child could succeed. The noble and learned Lord,

Amendment 14 seeks to allow the children of a Peer and his wife, or
rather the eldest child, to succeed to the parent’s title when
it is born of a surrogate mother, and where it can be clearly shown
that the child is the product of the gametes of that Peer and his wife.
Until recently, of course, this would have been a very dangerous
amendment to the law and would not have been sensible. It would have
been open to what I would describe as “monkey business”
and one could have trod on very dangerous ground. However, we now have
DNA testing and it can be established with virtual certainty that a
child is really the offspring of those who assert that it is.
Obviously, a situation of this sort is much more likely to crop up in
the peerage than over succession to the Crown because far more people
are involved in the peerage. I see no reason whatever why a child who
has exactly the same genetic make-up as his or her parents, albeit
having been born of a surrogate mother, should not have exactly the
same rights as a child born to the genetic mother. I believe that this
is fair. It is obviously a novel concept. I wish that we could have
introduced this in the Crown Bill, but I am afraid that I thought of it
only at the very last moment when I spoke on that Bill—I think
on Report. However, in this Bill, when we are talking about succession
to the peerage, I think it would be appropriate to introduce this
element which science has made possible within the past few years. I

Deech:</Member></B> My Lords, some while ago, I was chairman of the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Little did I think that
that post would have any bearing on today’s debate. Without
going into the detail, there is no doubt that modern law, including the
Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act of a couple of years ago, leads
us to the situation that children, however they are conceived, enjoy
the same rights as those conceived in the natural fashion. In fact, I
think that the amendment goes further than is absolutely
necessary—it may be a storm in a teacup—because if the
child has the gametes of both parents, it is their child. However, the
law says that a child born to a surrogate mother is actually the child
of the surrogate mother. The law treats the baby as the child of the
mother from whose body it emerged. This amendment would achieve
something, but if we are ever going to get a general statement of
principle from the Government or elsewhere, it will have to be along
the lines that the use of in vitro fertilisation techniques, as in
other walks of life, will make no difference to succession to
titles<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-06T14:49:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_06_PT_1/5AFEB2B78FC9B1394994B28E6C3D7F1EFC2F24CA" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 December 2013">Friday,

Jopling:</Member></B> The noble Baroness may recall that I was heavily
involved in the 1990 Act following a constituency case, which I
mentioned earlier. The law 
<?notus-xml column=563?>was changed so that in the case of a surrogacy the genetic
mother could get an order from the High Court that she be deemed to be
the full mother, not the surrogate mother. In this case, no doubt, the
same procedure would have to be followed, as in the High Court ruling.
At that stage, the genetic mother would be fully the
mother.</hs_para>

amendment. It would have been very useful to the Lord Bengwill of his
day—in 1745 he was on the wrong side, or perhaps the right side,
and his title was extinguished for a while before being reignited in
Victorian times—if he had been able to save a few frozen Stuart
embryos, which the society for the restoration of the Stuarts could pop
out into this world at regular intervals as proven children of that
line. It might cause some confusion. Perhaps things are not quite as
simple, particularly for succession to privileges and powers, as they
are in ordinary human reproduction, so we ought to take a little

specialist programmes, such as that of International Rescue Committee
(IRC) in Jordan, which are raising awareness and providing specialist
care to victims of sexual and gender-based violence. This, and similar
initiatives, are helping over 12,000 victims of sexual and gender based

among refugees and develop a strategy to prevent and mitigate the
