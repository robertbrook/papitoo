ensuring that complaints against the police are dealt with properly and
the concern that members of the public often have about the police
investigating themselves. That is precisely why we are giving extra
resources and powers to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
In future, the IPCC, rather than the police themselves, will
investigate serious and sensitive complaints against the police. I am
pleased to say that for the other complaints that will remain with the
police at local level, many police and crime commissioners are looking

since 2007, that is absolutely fine. The changes we made last week are
about ensuring that people do not come here to claim benefits. It is

then, when his party was in power and had net migration of 2.1 million

the pressures on school places and on access to GPs that the Government

lies. Historic incidents are now being reported— we have
seen a number of reports of claims of crimes in relation to

violence and child abuse, too, even though the number of reported
crimes in those areas is also increasing. The police are referring 13%
fewer domestic violence cases and 28% fewer child abuse cases to the
courts since the election, before which the figures were going up.
Those are shocking figures: there are more crimes and more serious
offenders are getting away with it. The police are being hollowed out

considerably over the past 10 years. The latest round of price rises

circumstances, it is right that people ask whether these rises are
justified and what the Government are doing to keep energy bills
affordable now and in the long term.</hs_Para>

main driver of the energy price rises has been rising wholesale energy
costs, and the need to upgrade energy infrastructure to ensure security
of supply in the long term. Wholesale and network costs make up over
two thirds of bills. Supplier costs and profits make up around a fifth.
Energy companies need to be more open about these costs so that
consumers can judge which suppliers are acting responsibly and keeping
their costs down.</hs_Para>

with Ofgem, the Government are making this possible by forcing the

down on prices and provide people with a proper choice of supplier, and

it is also right that the Government are open about their social and
environmental policies, which make up just under a 10th of the average
bill. Our policies provide for immediate help for the most vulnerable
with direct cuts to bills, as well as long-term savings on bills
through energy-efficiency programmes and support for low-carbon energy
that boosts energy security and tackles climate change. For example,
the warm home discount cuts the bills of 2 million vulnerable
households by £135. The energy company obligation provides
permanent long-term savings on bills, including to the most vulnerable,
by helping people to upgrade their homes and making them easier and
cheaper to keep warm.</hs_Para>

have been clear from the start that support for low-carbon energy
should not change, and it will not. The Government recognise that green
energy investment incentives such as the renewables obligation,
contracts for difference and feed-in tariffs are essential for
investment in future home-grown clean energy generation. Without this
low-carbon investment, energy security would be jeopardised as Britain
would become ever more dependent on imported oil and gas, and energy
bills in the future would be increasingly subject to high and volatile
fossil fuel prices. The Government will also ensure that their overall
approach will cut just as much carbon as planned. New measures, worth
more than £540 million over three years, will boost energy

be available to all people moving house, including those who do not pay
stamp duty, helping around 60,000 homes a year over three

landlords in improving the energy efficiency of their properties, which
will improve some 15,000 of the least energy-efficient rental
properties each year for three years. Together, the home buyers and

concluded. Others have announced price rises and have indicated that
they will reduce their customers’ bills as a result of these
changes. Energy companies will now make final detailed decisions about
how to apply these measures, but these cost reductions will ensure that
average energy bills are lower in 2014 than they otherwise would have
been—on average, by £50 per household. As the major

Certainly, we and, indeed, Ofgem have been looking at how we can reform

Ofgem’s suggested “secure and promote”
reforms—which the Labour party appears not to have
read—will ensure that we will have much greater competition in
the wholesale market, which means that independent generators will be
able challenge the big six and their vertically integrated model. There
are, therefore, alternative models to ensure that we get competition

are the most important and can have a significant bearing on the

I briefly met Sir Stephen House, the chief constable of Police
Scotland, who had come directly from meeting members of the families of

That is why I thought it appropriate to make reference in my statement
to the fact that the police in Glasgow are dealing not only with the
loss suffered by members of the public, but with the loss of members of
their own community and family. For that reason, their response, at a
professional and an emotional level, deserves recognition. I am sure

Gerald Kaufman</B> (Manchester, Gorton) (Lab):</Member> On a point of
order, Mr Speaker. You may recall that in October I raised a point of
order with you, Mr Speaker, relating to the failure or refusal of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:16:58"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
Immigration to reply to letters that I had sent him. You spoke very
firmly indeed about the importance of the responsiveness of Ministers
to Members of this House. I raised that point of order having advised
the office of the Minister for Immigration that I would do so. After
that point of order, on the two cases to which I referred, I got
letters the next day signed by the Minister, although the content was
unsatisfactory. Since then, all letters that have been sent to me on
notepaper with the name on top of the Minister for Immigration have
been signed by somebody called Lord Taylor of Holbeach. They have been
signed with courtesy, but if they are on the notepaper of the Minister
for Immigration, they are not authentic unless they are signed by that
Minister. There is no doubt in my mind that what has happened in this
past month or more is an act of petty spite by the Minister, because of
the fact that I raised a point of order.</hs_Para>

having sustained a fracture when dancing on a table, but it is an
insult to my constituents that they are treated in that way and, after
you spoke in the way that you did, Mr Speaker, it is an insult to you.
That being so, I ask for your ruling and comments on the way in which
the Minister for Immigration has been conducting himself so that in
future my constituents can get the service to which they have a right.
The Home Secretary has not signed a single letter to me in three and a
half years, and I can put up with that, because she obviously regards
herself as superior to me, but I do not regard the Minister as superior
to me, and that being so I want him to sign the

point of order, of which I did not have advance notice although I am,
of course, aware of the chronological sequence of events about which he
has just reminded the House. Whether any discourtesy was intended or
not—I confess that I do not know, although I have no reason to
think that a Minister would want to behave in 
<?notus-xml column=658?>a way that could be thought to be petty or spiteful—it seems to
me, frankly, to be proper form for a letter sent on the headed
notepaper of a particular Minister to be signed by that Minister.
Although not all Members will necessarily be as exacting in their
requirements as the right hon. Gentleman, if he regards it as proper
that he be addressed in such a way it would make a great deal of sense,
in terms of making the world go round and treating with courtesy
someone with 43 years’ uninterrupted service in the House, to do
things in the way that he has asked. It should not be a matter of any
controversy from now on. I hope that the Home Secretary can pass on the
message to the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>

protection from personal injury or disease arising as a result of their
work. When the principle is breached through negligence or a breach of
statutory duty, it is obviously right that that person should be

However, many sufferers of diffuse mesothelioma, the aggressive
cancer caused by exposure to asbestos, are unable to find an
employer or relevant insurer to claim compensation from. They developed
a fatal disease through the fault of their employer yet they are still
unable to seek compensation through the civil courts because the

mesothelioma is a fatal disease caused exclusively—this is
crucial to the Bill—by exposure to asbestos. It has a long
latency period, often of between 40 and 50 years, but after diagnosis
average life expectancy is, sadly, only eight to nine months, with very
few exceptions living beyond that. The long delay between exposure and
developing the disease, combined with inconsistent record keeping in
the insurance industry, means that too often people struggle to trace
an employer—the employer may no longer exist—or the
insurer who provided the employer’s public liability insurance,
against which they can make a claim for civil damages. The insurance
industry and the Government recognise that this is unjust, and that a

Bill follows a series of earlier pieces of legislation passed by
previous Labour Governments to improve the lot of victims of
asbestos-related and industrial diseases. In 1969, Labour introduced
the Employers’ Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969,
requiring employers to insure against liability for injury or disease
to their employees arising out of their employment. In 1979, Labour
introduced and secured the passage of the Pneumoconiosis etc.
(Workers’ Compensation) Act 1979, which provides lump sum
compensation payments to people suffering from certain dust-related
diseases or, if they have died, to their dependants, when a
claim for damages is not possible because the employer or
employers are no longer in business. In 2008, we introduced the
mesothelioma payment scheme, which provides lump sum payments

share with the Minister and Members from both sides of the House a wish

points or to delay the Bill unnecessarily. Everyone understands the

Green:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Over many decades,
insurance companies have taken in premiums and in every way resisted
paying out to victims. It is good to have reached the point at which
the industry is finally facing up to its collective
responsibility, but it still has a long way to
go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:47:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000064">The
Minister rightly described mesothelioma as a cruel and vicious disease
that is caused by exposure to asbestos, and as a long-tail disease that
is diagnosed years and often decades after it has been contracted. It
is invariably fatal and, once a diagnosis is made, cruelly quick:
following diagnosis, most victims have only about nine months of life
left. The effects of the illness are horrifying for sufferers, and for
the loved ones who watch them die. The true disgrace is that the link
to asbestos has been known for many
decades<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:48:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000065">One
consequence of the long period for which the disease can lie dormant is
that, following a diagnosis, it is of course more difficult to attach
liability, given that the circumstances that brought about the
condition often took place many years previously. As a result, many
sufferers have until now been forced to rely only on statutory payments
and welfare benefits. Although I am pleased that the industry will at
last take a small step towards meeting the obligations it owes to
sufferers, it is only right and proper that it should finally do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000066">I
understand that, as the Minister said, the scheme will be established
as one of last resort, which is to be relied on only if no employer or
insurer can be traced. That might be a reasonable position for the
industry, but we must ensure that it does not exacerbate the pain and
difficulty for
claimants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000067">During
the short period from diagnosis to death, sufferers become desperately
ill, yet at the same time they are expected to go to often huge lengths
to trace a former employer, perhaps from many years back; to identify
that employer’s insurer, perhaps via the Employers’
Liability Tracing Office; to obtain the necessary medical records and
wait the 40 days that agencies have to respond to such requests; and
then, ultimately, to take legal advice and access the scheme. I think
we can see how that would eat into the tragically limited time
remaining to sufferers following diagnosis, so we must do all we can to
speed up and smooth the process.</hs_Para>

recognise the progress made in speeding up the process and helping
victims to trace their employers’ insurers. Following its
introduction in 1999, many insurers signed up to a voluntary
employers’ liability code of practice, but none the less tracing
rates remained deeply disappointing, never exceeding 50%. In 2012, the
success rate was just over 34%; and even accounting for those cases now
proceeding via ELTO, the success rate in 2012 still reached only 61%.
Clearly, there is considerable scope for better support for victims to
pursue
insurers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T17:51:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000069">It
seems, however, that the industry, in its negotiations with Ministers,
has sought to do the very minimum it can get away with to make amends
to sufferers. As noted, payments will be set at just 75% of average
civil damages—admittedly, as the Minister said, an uplift on the
70% initially proposed. It is claimed that the industry cannot afford
to pay more without passing on the additional cost to current
employers’ liability customers. The notion that this
multi-billion-pound industry, which has been collecting premiums for
decades while doing all it can to avoid payouts and which is to be
gifted £17 million by the Government under this Bill and
lent a further £30 million to help with the scheme’s
introduction and the smoothing of the first year’s payments,

question. First, on present figures, what does it appear the industry
can afford? I will say something about that in a moment. Secondly, does
the industry have to pass on the cost to its customers, or could it
choose to absorb it? We are talking about roughly 10% of the total
value to the industry of the employers’ liability market. I
appreciate that that is not a small sum, but as colleagues have pointed
out, the industry has had decades to accumulate profits as a result of

payment levels to be increased, and we believe they can be, given that
the industry has accepted that a levy of 3% of gross written premiums
is affordable and given that the impact assessment has shown that
payments set at even 80% or 90% of average civil damages are affordable
within a 10-year period. The Minister said that the proportion of GWP
that the levy represented was more important than the 75% level derived
from that 3% figure. It is our reading of the figures, however, that
there is scope for the industry to be more generous, even within its
own accepted cap of 3% of GWP. I hope to explore that in more detail
with the Minister in Committee.

years to bring justice to victims, but it is not true that no efforts

Green:</Member></B> Four years certainly seems a remarkably short
period over which to cost the scheme, given the many decades over which
the industry expects it to continue. It is a concern—one that we
will discuss further in Committee—that the figures
seem to have changed since the Bill moved from the Lords to the
Commons, and changed back again, in a manner that might be said to
favour a particular outcome that suits the industry. We will want to

Bill has been proceeding, the Ministry of Justice has been consulting
on its proposals to expedite and streamline the process for taking
legal action, and to introduce fixed fees for mesothelioma cases, and
we have real concerns about the MOJ’s plans for the fate of the
scheme before us. Evidence suggests that fixed fees are likely to exert
a downward pressure on the level of civil damages, notwithstanding the
10% uplift in damages that has not yet been applied to mesothelioma
suffers under the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act
2012. Indeed, our suspicions are borne out by the view of the insurance

recognise that the Minister cannot answer for changes that the MOJ will
make to court rules, but it is of concern that there will be no
parliamentary scrutiny of those changes. I warn him that as the
Bill proceeds we will seek assurances that the MOJ’s actions
will not adversely affect the scheme in the Bill. Moreover we should
remember that these already quite meagre payouts, which are already to
be reduced by benefits recovery, will be further depleted by legal fees
and fees for medical certificates. We are anxious that the deal looks
less and less good for sufferers, and we will return to those points in
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000084">As
has been noted, hundreds of sufferers will lose out because the scheme
does not take effect until 25 July 2012, which was when the Government
published their response to the consultation set up in 2010 under
Labour. Although I recognise the time spent by Ministers in detailed
negotiations with the industry, we must recognise that between February
2010 when the consultation opened and July 2012, more than 700 people
will have died without access to justice. We therefore believe there is
a strong argument for the earlier start date of February 2010, and we
do not think it credible to suggest that an industry whose very
purpose and lifeblood is the anticipation and management of potential
risk has not been preparing for the likely introduction of a scheme
such as this since the date of the initial consultation.</hs_Para>

in the House of Lords exposed, this is not a matter of insurers
reserving policy—I accept that a more rigorous framework might
apply to provision for risk—but a simple matter of business
planning. Surely it would have been prudent for insurers to have
assumed from 2010 that there would be a payment system with which they
would be required to comply, and to have made provision for best and
worst-case scenarios. That, too, is a matter we expect to explore

washed a brother’s or husband’s overalls. It will cover
only mesothelioma and exclude all other asbestos-related illnesses. I

speak on this issue, on which I have a great deal of knowledge from
working in the insurance industry for five years before I became a

<?notus-xml column=672?>and from representing a constituency with very high
levels of
mesothelioma<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:10:32"></hs_TimeCode>.
Britain has the highest rate of mesothelioma in the world and sadly
that rate is rising. In the past five years, the south-east of England
has had the highest rates of deaths from mesothelioma compared with
anywhere else in the UK. Medway, with its heavy industry and dockyard
history, is a particular hot spot.</hs_Para>

is a horrific disease that is contracted exclusively by exposure to
asbestos. Those who are diagnosed are often dead within a year. For
many years, lawyers and insurers have taken their time to settle claims
through civil procedures, leaving great financial uncertainty for
sufferers and their families. A great deal has been done to speed up
civil claims for victims and tribute ought to be paid to the work of
Senior Master Whitaker for making that happen. However, there remains a
small yet significant group of people who contracted mesothelioma but
could not be compensated either because of poor record keeping by their
employer or their employer’s insurer, or because
neither existed any more.</hs_Para>

Bill will help to rectify that and is therefore welcome, but it still
contains shortcomings that, if Ministers, insurers and lawyers were
open-minded, could be rectified at little extra cost to them. Before
going into detail, I congratulate Lord Freud on his sterling efforts to
introduce the Bill. From my own experience of working in the insurance
industry and alongside lawyers, I know that the negotiations would have
been very difficult. He deserved the praise he received from peers on
both sides of the House as the Bill progressed through the other place,

my preliminary discussions with interested parties, there was consensus
on one point: the Bill will give sufferers something. That is true and
something might be better than nothing, but the Bill puts the something
squarely in the pockets of the insurers and lawyers, and not as much as
there should be in the hands of the victim. The victim is the one who
turned up to work and was exposed to asbestos. The victim is the one
who happened to work for a company that kept shoddy records. The victim
is the one who will die through no fault of his own. The Bill has room
for improvement, based on further
compromise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000107">Their
lordships debated the Bill on a set of assumptions that have been
revised since it has progressed to this place. The goalposts have
moved. It is a shame that what should be a simple piece of legislation
has become so mired in suspicion and confusion regarding what is and is
not included in the levy. When the Bill was discussed in the Lords,
Lord Freud made it clear that the levy could not be more than 3% gross
written premium. That was to ensure that insurers financing the scheme
would not incur additional costs that would be passed on to their
existing customers. At that point, the levy agreed with the insurance
industry was 75% and equated to, as illustrated in the Department for
Work and Pensions’ own analysis in support of the
Bill, 2.79% GWP in the first four years of the scheme and 2.27%
GWP in the first 10 years of the scheme.</hs_Para>

debate in the Lords, the assumptions relating to legal costs have
changed. Their lordships debated a fixed legal fee of
£2,000, but we are now debating a fee of
£7,000. In truth, there is
total confusion about who will pay the fee. As the Association of
British Insurers understands it, it will be paid by claimants out of
their compensation which the Government will uplift
accordingly. 
<?notus-xml column=673?>Not only is it unclear what precisely the fee is
for, but what the other 25% is paying to administer. It would be
helpful if the Government clarified who pays the legal fees. Is it the
claimants out of their compensation or the insurance companies out of
the administration fee? If it is the claimants, we need to be
absolutely clear that when they are awarded £57,000
of compensation, £7,000 of legal fees will have to be deducted
from that award.</hs_Para>

insurers and the Government are, unsurprisingly, at loggerheads on the
fixed fee, presumably because if it is acceptable for this scheme, why
could it not be applied to civil claims? Where would it fit into the
LASPO review that the Ministry of Justice is expected to complete and
report on next year? At the heart of the Bill is supposed to be the
fact that the victim is coming into the scheme at last resort. A lot of
what is required will have already been done, so lawyers in a civil
claim might not be as necessary as they would be in this scheme. Senior
Master Whitaker has helped a great deal and the Department is clear
that in some circumstances a medical report would be enough. The
underlying point, however, is that because of the revised estimates,
about which I remain sceptical, there is no room to raise the
compensation limit from 75% to 80%—a much fairer level of
financial recompense for victims of the disease. In his introduction,
the Minister said that 75% is not the important figure and that the 3%
levy is. With the greatest respect to the Minister, it is the level of
compensation that is important to the victim, not what the level of GWP
is to the insurance

Crouch:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right that our constituencies
are particularly affected and I am delighted to see him in his place to
debate this important issue. He makes an important point. The
Government have set a cap of 3% and there is no room for manoeuvre
unless they are willing to stand up to the insurance industry and say
that there is a firm view on both sides of the House that the 75% they
have currently negotiated is not good enough. They need to agree on
another figure. I believe that 80% would be appropriate as a good
compromise between the 90% being called for by the lawyers—they
cite the financial services compensation scheme as a useful
comparator—and the 70% the insurers were originally willing to
accept. Furthermore, with the previous assumptions under which
their lordships debated the Bill, 80% would have been 2.98% GWP over
the first four years and 2.42% over 10 years. Now, with the 3% cap,
under the new legal costs associated with the scheme, there is no room
for manoeuvre. I find that disappointing, unless the Minister is
willing to stand up to the insurance industry and discuss
this.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000112"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Anderson" PimsId="4738" UID="13120231000224" xid="807" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000224">Mr

as employers’ liability insurance has been compulsory since
1972, and given this disease’s latency, those unlikely to be
able to trace their insurer, making them eligible for this scheme,
would surely be older and the younger workers would be fewer. Again,

understand that the industry is worried about a cohort of younger
people who might access the scheme because of exposure in schools and

via civil procedures. For me, the current 25% running cost of the
scheme is far too high, and I genuinely think that this is a poor

one particular point, I pay tribute to the insurance industry. It
improved over the years in its financing of research into mesothelioma.
This began when I was working at Aviva—I am not talking all the
credit for it, but it did—as an attempt to stop the last
Government from following the lead of Scotland and legislating too
harshly on other asbestos diseases such as pleural plaques. As it
happens, I supported the last Government’s resistance to
following Scotland and was pleased that the top four insurers
contributed to research funding into mesothelioma instead. That said,
the funding runs out next year, and there has currently been no
voluntary commitment—not just from the top four, but from all EL
insurers—to contribute further money into research. I think that
is a dreadful shame, which will have a major impact on future

meso-diagnosis to spike. I share the views of the British Lung
Foundation—supported, I believe, by the Association of British
Insurers—about building the continuation of funding directly
into the Bill. It is sad that a £4 billion EL industry cannot
make a voluntary offering, spread equally across all insurers. If that

for Jarrow (Mr Hepburn), who has been a long-time campaigner on the
issue. As it happens, I disagreed with the idea of compensating pleural
plaques. Everybody involved with this Bill well knows that I am

me quickly turn to the issue of benefit recovery. While I agree that
this scheme should follow civil procedures and recover benefits from
those who have received payments until their compensation has been
paid, I think it incredibly unfair that a claimant who is getting the
equivalent of 75% compensation to that from a civil claim must repay
100% of his benefits. To return to the main point of the Bill, the
claimant is accessing the scheme because of poor practices by employers
and insurers after having been negligently exposed to asbestos. I feel
that the victim is the one who will lose out here, so I hope we get an
opportunity to look carefully at the recovery issue in
Committee.</hs_Para>

me briefly mention secondary exposure. I understand why
diagnosis of mesothelioma caused by secondary exposure from
asbestos is excluded from this Bill, but this is an area that I
genuinely hope the Department is looking at pursuing. The numbers are
small, but I would hazard a pretty good guess that most victims of
secondary exposure will be women, who are sufferers of this dreadful
cancer purely because they did their wifely duty and washed their
husband’s overalls. These women deserve to be compensated, too.
They receive payment under the Child Maintenance and Other Payments Act
2008, so it is an accepted cause of suffering, but a proper
compensation scheme should be considered for the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120231000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0002.htm#13120231000127">While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:27:49"></hs_TimeCode>
I worked in the industry, I campaigned hard for better, faster justice
for those who would die from mesothelioma. I may have been an irritant
in the industry, but I was passionate that, after decades of poor
behaviour, something had to change. Improvements were made and I was
proud to be a part of those small, but important developments. However,
in the middle of a constant stand-off between insurers and lawyers
remains a person who will die a most horrible death, and at present
this Bill, while welcome in principle, still puts too much in the
pockets of other interested parties. I hope that
Ministers both in this place and the other place will remain
open-minded and listen to the concerns of colleagues on both sides and
ultimately be willing to go back to the insurers and lawyers and fight
just a little harder for the victims of mesothelioma. To my mind, it is
the very least that they

Gentleman’s point about the date of knowledge, but, as he knows,
mesothelioma was originally identified in the Meriwether report of

shipowners’ confederation drawing attention to the dangers of
asbestos. For all those years the fact that it is a danger to health

am going to single out one person, not because he would have regarded
himself as an exceptional man, but because he rose to become the mayor
of our town and because he died this year from mesothelioma. Rex
Barnett worked for British Rail from 1953 to 1961. It was while he was
there that he was exposed to asbestos and went on to develop what was
for many years a latent disease. He was diagnosed with pleural plaques
back in the mid ’90s and then was one of the unfortunate people
who went on to develop mesothelioma right at the end of his mayoral
year in 2011. Rex battled on. He was an indefatigable character who in
his mayoral year raised over £60,000 for local charities, an
exceptional feat in itself. He battled on for another two years, but
finally, sadly and tragically, succumbed this year. In his

the need for a swift resolution to the claims made by victims of this
disease and their families. There is a danger that seeking to resolve
claims before death could lead to a significant under-settlement of
claims, which would deprive dependants of the victims of a substantial

think it is right to talk very briefly in this Second Reading debate
about the wider position and principles, while recognising the fact
that this Bill will deal with a relatively small cohort of people for
whom traceability of employer or insurer has not been possible. The
following important point has been raised with me by claimants’
solicitors, some of whom have years of experience in practice in
Swindon. The regime that applies to posthumous claims for damages is
still dramatically different in England and Wales from that which
applies to those made during the lifetime of the claimant. For example,
bereavement damages are not payable during the lifetime of claimants,
claimants cannot recover for future funeral expenses during their
lifetime, and living claimants cannot recover damages for services
provided to dependants after death; that is recoverable only as a
services dependency under the Fatal Accidents Act 1976. It
is clear that under that Act income dependency claims will usually be
significantly more for dependants than a lost years claim made under
common law for a living claimant. It is clear that claims that are
brought by widows after death will be about 20%—a
fifth—more valuable than equivalent claims made during life. So
the dilemma for mesothelioma sufferers going through all the pain and
struggle they have to endure is: do they resolve their claims during
their lifetime for what will be a lesser sum, or do they die with a
claim

<?notus-xml column=681?>Queen’s bench division, master Whitaker, should be singled out
for particular praise because he and his colleagues have developed
specialist lists that, in effect, create a fast-track procedure for the
efficient resolution of liability issues. The fast-track procedure
allows for summary judgment to be passed where sufficient evidence has
been demonstrated by claimants about exposure to asbestos in breach of
duty and where defendants then have to show cause—reversing the
burden, as it were—on evidence why that liability should not be
proved. With the resolution of liability, interim payments can be made
to claimants and their families to meet the claimants’ needs
during life, but that interim payment does not bring resolution or
quantum to a close. That can be achieved by a stay of the claim until
after death, to allow the full quantum—the final value—of
that claim to be properly assessed.</hs_Para>

this aggressive cancer. This particular scheme deals with last-resort

welcome changes by the Government in the other place, by conceding the
70% levy and raising it to 75%, on figures that at the time in question

some 41 years ago—the issue of traceability of insurers surely
belongs to a period before the introduction of such legislation. That
must mean that the cohort of claimants who would be eligible under this
scheme will be older, rather than younger. I fail to see any clear
basis for the assertion that we will be dealing with a younger group of
claimants. It is important that we as legislators, both here and in

them to participate in the development of this scheme; but we should
remember that they start ahead, not behind. Throughout the debate on

remember that the voice and experience of those most

make four brief points, the first of which concerns the level of
compensation, which everybody has spoken about this evening.
Seventy-five per cent. may be better than 70%, but it is not good
enough, and we simply have to do better. Here, there are technical
arguments, some of which have already been aired, but in this regard I
rely for my view on the view of Parliament. That view was clearly
demonstrated during the debate on what became the Legal Aid, Sentencing
and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, which brought about changes to
the conditional fee agreement. It was very clear in the debates in this
House and the other place that to expect mesothelioma claimants to pay
more than 25% of their compensation to lawyers was completely
unacceptable. That argument was had here and in the Lords, which passed
an amendment to prevent the new conditional fee agreements from
applying to mesothelioma claims. Members may recall that we entered a
period of ping-pong, and eventually there was a compromise and section
48 of the Act was inserted.</hs_Para>

Parliament was very clear on those occasions, and my argument is that
if it was wrong to expect mesothelioma claimants to pay 25% of their
fee to lawyers, why is it fair to expect them to pay 25% of the fee
that they should have to the insurance companies? That is the practical
effect of having a cap at 75%. My starting point is 100%. Other figures
have been mentioned—90%, 80%—but the message to the
Minister is that the figure has to be substantially higher than 75%. We
do not want political game-playing here; there has to be a sensible,
proper, grown-up discussion with 
<?notus-xml column=684?>the industry, Ministers and Members of this House to make sure that we
get the best level of compensation that is available.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T18:59:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chatham and Aylesford was right to suggest that the level of
compensation that is agreed on, whatever it might be, should be the
level at which benefits are repaid. It would be grossly unfair to set a
compensation level of less than 100% and then to expect claimants to
repay 100% of their benefits. That would be quite wrong.</hs_Para>

second point relates to the start date from which people should be paid
compensation. I make no criticism of Lord Freud. He made his statement
to the House of Lords in July 2012, in the last days before the summer

until October when the House returned, but he wanted to make the
statement in July because he does care. The start date should be set
further back, however—at least to February 2010—and the
reason for that is clear. When the Labour Government published the
consultation document, it became clear to the industry that things were
going to change and that a compensation scheme funded by the industry

third point relates to section 48 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and
Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, to which I referred earlier. Last
week, I received a copy of a letter sent by Lord McNally to Lord Alton
of Liverpool. One or two other Members who took part in the debates
during the passage of the LASPO Act also received a copy. Section 48
prevents sections 44 and 46 from coming into force in relation to
mesothelioma 
<?notus-xml column=685?>claimants. That means that the new conditional fee agreements cannot
operate in relation to mesothelioma claims.</hs_Para>

there is no relationship between the review set out in the
LASPO Act and the provisions of this Bill. As I have made clear, the
provisions in the Act cover civil claims and the arrangements for
conditional fee agreements. They will ensure that claimants
have to pay back 25% of their success fee to the lawyer who
represented them. There have been arguments about that, and the
Government clearly have their point of view, but Parliament has
expressed the view that that provision should not operate in relation
to mesothelioma claimants.</hs_Para>

Bill, on the other hand, deals with a fund of last resort for people
who cannot find their former employer or insurance company, and who
have no one against whom to make a civil claim. The two issues are
therefore completely separate, and I ask the Minister please to clarify
that when he responds to the debate. If there is to be a
decision in relation to section 48 of the Act, let us have that debate
and make that decision, but let us not confuse that issue with the
provisions of the Bill that we are debating today.</hs_Para>

final point relates to research, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:05:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chatham and Aylesford also mentioned. It is shameful that we spend
so little on researching the causes and treatment of mesothelioma. It
is a disease that will kill 2,400 people this year, and in the region
of 60,000 people over the next 30 years, and we should be devoting much
more to research. I applaud the initiative that a small number of
insurance companies took to set up the research fund that is being
managed by the British Lung Foundation. Some good, promising work has
been done as a result of that, and Lord Alton and his colleagues in the
House of Lords wanted to make that arrangement more sustainable, better
funded and more reliable in the long term so that we could get some
proper research done and some good outcomes. Indeed, Lord Alton pressed
an amendment to that effect, but it was narrowly defeated. However,
that does not remove the argument, or the need for Ministers to do much
more in regard to the funding of research.</hs_Para>

welcome the Bill. Mesothelioma is a terrible disease, and I have seen
at first hand the indignity and pain that it has inflicted on many of
my former patients. Perhaps it is because I have been there in the room
while they have suffered repeatedly having fluid drained from their

is no safe lower exposure limit for asbestos, and children are
particularly at risk. A child who is exposed to it at the age of five
is between two and a half and five times more likely to develop
mesothelioma than an adult aged 30. Since 1980, 228 teachers have died
in this country as a result of negligent exposure to asbestos.
Let us remember that every one of those teachers had 30 children in the
classroom with them. Let us also remember that 75% of our schools
contain asbestos, and evidence from the Health and Safety Executive
shows that about 13,000 out of 23,800 schools were built at the time
when asbestos use was at its peak. That asbestos is now crumbling.
Every time a drawing pin is stuck into an asbestos board and taken out
again, it releases about 6,000 asbestos fibres.</hs_Para>

is that the argument we take in this country that we should literally
cover up asbestos is not good enough. The evidence shows that slamming
doors and children kicking kick-boards around the classroom edges can
increase the level of asbestos fibres in the air by about 6,000 times.
We should go far further than we are doing; that is what happened in
the United States. In 1980, the US conducted its first major audit of
asbestos and introduced stringent regulations in 1986. As a result, the
level of mesothelioma in the US has stabilised since 1999; there are
now about 14 deaths per million per year, whereas in 2009 in the UK
there were 37.8 deaths per million—and unfortunately,
that level continues to rise. I know that the Minister has said he
expects it to peak in 2015, but we do not yet know what the future

The trouble is that the Bill is about compensating people who have been

will not have an employer; they are being negligently and knowingly

I think we should be starting with the schools with the highest risk.
Since the original decisions were made, when air sampling tests for
asbestos were technically difficult, could detail only a single
pinpoint in time and were immensely expensive, the technology has moved
on significantly. I call on the Minister to examine the new technology
that is emerging in air sampling for asbestos, which gives real-time
data on exposure and could be widely rolled out in
schools—prototypes are available. I ask the Minister to review
during the passage of the Bill whether we could bring such new
technology into the scope of the Bill.</hs_Para>

the kind of thing I am most concerned about, because it is raining down

that allows us to look in real time for any dangers, rather than
spot-check after building work. What happens when 30 children charge
round over floor tiles containing asbestos? I urge the Minister to take
an opportunity during the passage of the Bill to examine that matter.
Without acting to protect children from asbestos now, we will not see a
long-term falling off in the incidence of mesothelioma and this
terrible disease will affect those children in decades to

have a special constituency reason to be interested in the Bill,
because I represent a former slate quarrying area that has benefited
from the provisions of the 1979 Act; it provided compensation to slate
workers whose former employers had gone out of business and could not

Newall factory, which used asbestos for many years from the 1960s
onwards. Recently, I have heard dreadful tales from former employees of
workers 
<?notus-xml column=688?>in the 1960s having snowball fights with fistfuls of asbestos during tea
breaks and at lunch time. I was also told that the factory was a dust
trap from one end to the other and that it was rarely cleaned properly.
Some hon. Members will know that the factory later morphed into the
infamous Friction Dynamics concern, which provoked and then lost the
longest-running industrial dispute of recent times. The owners lost and
then evaded their responsibilities—it is a lesson to us
all—and the wrongly sacked workers still have not received a
single penny piece in compensation for wrongful dismissal. Some of
those people are also suffering from the effects of asbestos.</hs_Para>

Mesothelioma is less prevalent there, but among the particular group of

individual are, of course, as bad as anywhere else, whatever the
incidence in the general population. We know that it can take many
years for symptoms of this awful disease to be manifest, and people in
seemingly unconnected industries and occupations can be sufferers. They
include a former constituent of mine who had never worked near an

someone who had many years before been a sub-contractor removing

lost out on compensation because of the delay between 2010 and this

and the main concern that has been conveyed to me, is about the level
of compensation. Sufferers face 100% of the effects of this dreadful
disease, so how can it be right that they are offered a lesser degree
of compensation? In the other place, Lord Wigley tabled an amendment
that would have brought the level up to 80%. As other hon. Members have
noted, Lord Freud said that it was impossible to get the insurers to
agree. I made the point in an earlier intervention that the 1979 Act

spread and eventually choke the sufferer to death. There are people out

has been much criticism of the insurance companies during this debate,
and I am sure that much of it is right, but perhaps I can take
colleagues back to some years ago in Scotland. When a person died in
Scotland their claim for asbestosis or mesothelioma died with them. The
insurance companies used to invite the sufferer to court, because the
thought was that if a person was diagnosed with mesothelioma, they did
not have long to live. These people decided to cut to the chase and try
to get as much money as they could from the insurance companies before
they died, so they went to court to get a judgment.</hs_Para>

the court case, the insurance people had doctors sitting beside them,
trying to ascertain how long that person had to live. Then they would
find some technical reason to postpone the case, hoping that in the
intervening period the person would die and they would not have to pay
out. I know that the trade unions 
<?notus-xml column=690?>came in for a lot of criticism, but the Transport and General Workers
Union campaigned hard and successfully to get rid of that heinous
legislation. It is important that we understand those events. Even
today, producers export asbestos to some of the most vulnerable

one in eight sufferers cannot trace their employer or insurer to lodge
a complaint. That is completely unjust, and it is luck of the draw
whether a person’s records have been lost due to the widespread
misplacement of them by the insurance industry. Indeed, in bringing
forward the Bill, the Government have acknowledged that. It seems
strange that they accept the unfairness, to an extent, but will not
allow these people to claim the same amount as those who can trace
their employer or insurer. Those people who are suffering from
mesothelioma 
<?notus-xml column=691?>and other industrial diseases through no fault of
their own, and who cannot get access to their records, again through no
fault of their own, are being penalised by losing 25% of their damages.
Not only that, but through this decision, asbestos victims will absorb
25% of the ongoing cost because insurers lost or destroyed their policy
records. That is simply not fair: not only is that money necessary to
these people, but it is only right that they should receive
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:29:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120238000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#13120238000053">Obviously,
we would welcome higher compensation and would raise it to 90%. That is
not the full 100%, but I am convinced that the Government would be more
than happy to accept that rise as it is still affordable according to
their own figures. It still falls within the 3% levy on gross
written premiums, which not only the Government but the
industry are happy with. The figure would also work as there is a
precedent for it in the financial services compensation scheme, which
covers the liabilities of insolvent insurers in circumstances where
compulsory insurance is involved. That compensation level is legal,
established and much fairer than the one proposed by the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120238000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#13120238000054">Mesothelioma
is a dreadful disease, but it is not the only asbestos-related disease
and the Government’s choice to focus only on it is another
injustice of the Bill. Lord Freud said in the other place that other
asbestos-related diseases need to be considered and I, as well as my
colleagues, would like to hear the Minister affirm that comment and
explain the steps that will be taken to look into those diseases, too.
It is frankly offensive that the Bill has neglected all but one group
of people who have been exposed to asbestos. That limitation excludes
50% of asbestos victims and adding them would represent just 20% of the
cost. I ask the Government what are those suffering from
asbestos-related lung cancer, asbestosis and pleural thickening

yet another example of the Government favouring the industry over our
constituents, it is becoming clear that the scheme will be administered
by the insurance industry in one way or another. We have seen time and
again that industry regulation does not work and it is important that
an independent body is established to take charge. A scheme
administered and run by the industry would have a clear conflict of
interest between assessing the eligibility of applicants and keeping
the levy on insurers low. How could we be sure that a fair number of
applicants was being considered if the industry was in charge? Lord
Freud commented that the Government would explore the options for an
independent oversight committee and I would be keen to hear the same
assurances

are concerned that the scheme awards claimants only 75% of civil
compensation rates while clawing back 100% of previously awarded
benefits and lump-sum payments. It is unclear why the Government will
claw back a greater percentage than is being paid, which will mean that
the applicant will receive a net sum that is substantially less than
75% of the net sum he would have received in the courts if the insurer
could have been traced. It is somewhat immoral that the state is being
given a greater right of financial recovery than the victim and it is
grossly unjust that victims are being penalised twice. I hope that the

little was spent on research into mesothelioma in the UK. In the other
place, we were promised a joint strategy with the Department of Health

mesothelioma and it is clear that more money should be spent on finding

where costs are slightly higher because of that 75% figure. We should
not hear that, because the industry says that it will absorb the cost,
but it behoves all of us to watch to see whether the industry gives the
75% scheme as an example of something that increases
people’s premiums, even slightly, in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120238000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#13120238000070">Another
thing that struck me as the disease unfolded was that most people who
have mesothelioma are not diagnosed with it at the start, but they
pretty much know that they have it, that they have about two years, and
that it will be very bad at the end.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:39:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Totnes (Dr Wollaston), who is no longer in the Chamber, may be
aware of this issue: it occurred to me and my brother that doctors may
have known that the scheme would be given a start date at some point
in, say, the next six or nine months, and so would slightly delay the
final “You’ve got mesothelioma” gig—the
black spot. My brother was diagnosed officially in the first week of
August, a week after the scheme came into play; I do not wish to
invalidate his family’s claim. Most sufferers in the very early
stages of mesothelioma who Google their symptoms and think about what
job they had know what is going to happen to them about two years in
advance. If doctors help in modest ways in that respect,
administratively, good on
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120238000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#13120238000071">I

Again, this is on a point that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:40:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Totnes talked about. People with public 
<?notus-xml column=694?>budgets will look at the relatively modest risk, as
they see it, of people contracting asbestosis as a result of there
being small amounts of asbestos still in buildings. From a budgetary
point of view, I understand how it happens that people with modest
public budgets that are very squeezed will sometimes allow a very small
amount of asbestos that is within the limits to remain in place. In the
hospital where my brother was treated—very well, I should
say—there was a sign that said
“Danger—asbestosis”, and that was where the
smokers gathered to have a fag. It made me reflect on the nature of
risk; it was a darkly humorous
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120238000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#13120238000072">Several
Members have alluded to the fact that the industry may well administer
the scheme. I do not have any personal enormous objection to that, but
as hon. Members have said, if the industry is to administer the scheme,
oversight will be a critical element, certainly from the point of view
of public confidence. I am sure that the Government and the industry
will pay careful attention to
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-02?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_02_PT_1/76CC29891A159D196D1BEBCCA4187B9D36C8D516" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="2 December 2013">Monday

long gone, but are engrained in the social history of my town, having
provided employment for many generations of Hartlepudlians. However,
asbestos was regularly used in those environments for lagging and other

2, which sets out the criteria for compensation, is the key part of the
Bill. The criteria include the person being first diagnosed with
diffuse mesothelioma on or after 25 July 2012, and being employed at

Members have said, the arbitrary cut-off date of 25 July 2012 is
grossly unfair, and will mean that many of my constituents who should,
if there is any sense of decency, be compensated for diseases caught at
work will miss out because they were diagnosed before that date. How
can that be fair? There is no possible justification or sensible
rationale for that. My constituents will be penalised because their
symptoms were diagnosed early. How is that fair? At the very least, as
hon. Members have said, the Government should make the cut-off date
February 2010, which is when the last Government consulted on
introducing a scheme. At that point, the intention and direction of

the fact that clause 2 confines the scheme to those employees who were

cases—I referred to one earlier—in which the wife of a
worker developed pleural plaques, then asbestosis and then mesothelioma
as a result of washing her husband’s work clothes, which
released the fibres and allowed them to enter her lungs. Those
women—there are probably many more—suffered and died as a
direct result of asbestos exposure caused by an employer. Surely it is
only fair and just that they should be included in the scheme. I hope
that the Government will accept that secondary exposure is an important
part of what the Bill should provide
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120238000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#13120238000088"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:50:04"></hs_TimeCode>The
third way in which the Bill must be improved relates to the amount of

act from the Government against people facing a terrible, terminal

less than 100% compensation.
Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T19:53:38"></hs_TimeCode> should
victims in Hartlepool miss out on what could be several thousand pounds

the Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright), who spoke so
passionately about the situation in the north-east. Mesothelioma is a
tragedy. It is a global tragedy, but in the UK alone it cuts short the
lives of some 2,500 people annually. The disease has a devastating
impact on all it touches, both the victims and their loved ones. It is
a fatal disease, with life expectancy of between nine and 15 months
following diagnosis. It is a horrendous disease, described earlier as
being like a tree growing inside the sufferer, with branches reaching
out. We cannot begin to understand what that must mean for them. The
people of the north-east suffer greatly from the disease, as a result
of the region’s history of heavy industry, including
shipbuilding, coal mining and steel
manufacturing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120238000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#13120238000095">This
horrendous disease, as a number of Members have explained today, is a
form of cancer caused by exposure to asbestos. It is a long-tail
disease, meaning that people exposed to asbestos decades ago are only
now discovering the consequence of their employers’ negligence.
One of the huge problems with mesothelioma is the latency period.
Someone can work in industry, perhaps for many different employers, and
be in contact with asbestos either unknowingly, as was generally the
case, or knowingly, as was the case in the tales recited by 
<?notus-xml column=698?>hon. Members on both sides of the House about young workers throwing
snow balls of asbestos. Whether someone was throwing snow balls of
asbestos as a young man or woman or whether they were unaware that they

30, 40 or 50 years later.</hs_Para>

created the problem, because many people were in and out of different

liability insurance is one of two compulsory insurances in the UK; the
other is motor insurance. Insurers collected premiums in full and
invested them for decades. The insurance companies used these finances
for generations. They put the money in the bank and paid themselves
dividends. People made themselves rich while at the same time stashing
away the policies—hiding them, burning them, and getting rid of
them. The only people who will suffer as a result are those who are set
to die 30 or 40 years later due to the latency period and the
activities of the insurance companies, which had the money but decided
not to keep it for future generations in case something like this
occurred. They paid out 
<?notus-xml column=700?>nothing on the untraced policies that they lost or destroyed. This could

there is the exclusion of other diseases. Why is this about
mesothelioma only? The employers’ liability insurance for which
the employers paid premiums covered them for claims arising from all
“bodily injury or disease”, not just asbestos-related
disease, and certainly not just mesothelioma. By limiting the scheme to
mesothelioma, the Bill excludes 50% of all victims. Those suffering
from asbestos-related lung cancer, asbestosis and pleural thickening
have been cast aside. Among other industrial prescribed
diseases that might be considered—I pick this one out of the
air—is baker’s asthma, a disease that is crippling for
people who work in the baking industry, whereby they suffer the same
conditions although it does not have such drastic problems with regard
to latency and shortened life expectancy. There are all sorts of
different diseases, including baker’s asthma and other
asbestos-related diseases, that should be covered by the Bill. It is a

the Bill included 50% of asbestos victims, that would represent just
20% of the total cost. It is not acceptable that the scheme is limited
to just mesothelioma. The Government’s justification for
excluding other diseases is to say that proving causation is simpler
for mesothelioma, because asbestos is its only known cause. However,
there is already a successful precedent, namely the Turner and Newall
Asbestos Trust, which administers payments of claims for not just
mesothelioma, but other asbestos-related diseases. The Bill should be

the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery), but I want to start by agreeing
with the Minister, who was right to say that we should not have had to
be here tonight. This issue should have been resolved no later than
when the previous Government were in office and probably much earlier
than that. As my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:15:42"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for North 
<?notus-xml column=702?>Durham (Mr Jones) has said, this has been known about since at least
1965. We should have done something about it. Lots of us had meeting
after meeting with the previous Prime Minister and others in the
previous Government as we tried to find a way forward. I believe that
he was genuine in his approach but that he was badly advised by civil
servants and special advisers who were frightened that the cost would
escalate. As a result, we did not take the action we should have
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:16:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000002"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mike Penning" PimsId="4833" UID="1312031000659" xid="849" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000659">Mike

hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck mentioned the Mick Knighton
Mesothelioma Research Fund. I have been a patron of that fund for more
than a decade. When I was president of Unison I was approached by a
former colleague I used to work with in the mines who asked,
“Can you help these people out,
Dave?”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000005">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:17:07"></hs_TimeCode>
is worth listening to the story of Chris Knighton, whose husband was a
classic sufferer of mesothelioma. He would think nothing of getting on
a pushbike and riding from Newcastle to Berwick and back again on a
Sunday morning before going to the club to see his mates, who had just
staggered out of bed. They would be standing at the bar, bleary-eyed,
asking, “Where have you been, Mick?” He had done a 100
mile bike ride on a Sunday
morning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000006">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:17:14"></hs_TimeCode>
one of those Sunday mornings, the lad fell on the floor. The following
day he went to see his doctor, who told him he had mesothelioma.
“What’s that, doctor?” asked Mick. He told him it
was asbestos of the lungs. “What can you do?” asked Mick.
“Nothing,” said the
doctor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:17:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000007">Within
a matter of months, the lad was dead. His widow set up the research
fund with a good friend, Anne Craig, and they pledged to raise
£100,000. Two years ago they raised £1 million, and all
that money has been put into research into this disease. It is people
like them and the men, women, children, daughters, wives and husbands
who have suffered that this debate should really be

is a history of people exploiting asbestos throughout the world. I was
proud when a member of my trade union went to South Africa and worked
alongside Thompsons Solicitors to litigate against companies there. One
of the stories they heard in Namibia was that one of the ways in which
companies ensured maximum output was by filling big plastic bags with
raw asbestos. How did they make sure they were full? They put young
Namibian kids in them to tamp down the asbestos as if they were
pressing grapes. Those kids were exposed to raw asbestos at the ages of
six, seven, eight and nine. Those are the sorts of people behind the
desperate negligence under

diseases have been mentioned. When compensation for plural plaques was
challenged in the courts in 2007, the case was won and people stopped
getting compensation. As I said in an intervention on
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:19:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

billion windfall on that same day. 
<?notus-xml column=703?>That is what the insurers got as a result of the Law

people may not have mesothelioma or anything life threatening, but the
truth is the same: they were negligently exposed at work to substances
that the employer knew would be damaging. Employers have known that
since 1892, when asbestos was first recognised as a poisonous
substance. As we have heard, they have known since 1965 that it should
have been illegal to do so, but they kept on exposing people to the
substance for days, weeks, months and
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000012">We
are now told that people can have 75% of their compensation. One thing
always sticks in my mind in talking about this. I first had real
evidence of mesothelioma when I spoke to a lawyer dealing with it, a
guy called Ian McFall, who works in the Thompsons north-east office and
is a renowned expert on the issue. He told me that the fibres lie
dormant for decades, but all of a sudden they become active, the person
suffers horribly and then
dies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:20:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000013">I
used those words when there was a discussion about this issue some
years ago. I was approached via e-mail by a woman who was not one of my
constituents, who said that I had really upset her. Her family was
sitting there, with their father going through the process, and she had
tried to be careful to shield her family from knowing the
truth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000014">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:21:23"></hs_TimeCode>
am sorry that I have to repeat those words today, but the people of
this country need to understand how serious this disease is.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:21:11"></hs_TimeCode> is to the
credit of the Government and others that they have accepted that this
is a very special case, because it is a killer. There are no two ways
about it: if you get this, you are going to die. That is the main
reason why the situation has been challenged to the extent it has over
many

insurance companies have put forward the compensation as somehow an act
of benevolence: “We are being really nice to you, aren’t
we?” No, they are not; they have been caught on the hop and
forced into a corner to put right what they should have done. The deal
struck between the Government and the insurance companies is just
that—a deal. It has not involved the people it should have
involved to the extent that they should have been involved, whether
they are claimants, their support groups or, crucially, the trade
unions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000016">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:21:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:22:04"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck spoke about the work of the trade
unions, but that had an impact not only on trade union members but on
every member of the public in this country. Many people are not in
trade unions or in unionised workplaces, but they have the same rights
to compensation and legal redress as those for whom the trade unions
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000017"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Kevan Jones" PimsId="1213" UID="1312031000661" xid="318" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000661">Mr

saying that they can go only so far, because the companies cannot
afford more, but they are forgetting the fact that companies have
received millions and millions of pounds, which they could and should

one day. Is not the whole point of insurance that people should save

hon. Friend the Member for North Durham spoke about some of the
consultations. I went to some of the meetings, which Ministers opened
and then virtually handed them over to members of the insurance
companies to run and to answer questions. Civil servants and Ministers
were not engaged; it was people from the Association of British
Insurers who answered all the questions, and it was clearly in their
interests to do what they have now got away with. It is clear that the
scheme will not provide full protection or full
compensation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:24:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000022">I
share the concerns of other hon. Members about the level of payment.
For the life of me, whatever the cut-off date, I cannot see why the
payment should be anything less than 100%. I made the point earlier
that there is 100% liability on the employer and the insurer, while
100% of those with this disease have died. If people go through all the
hoops they have to go through, which are the same as those in civil
litigation, it is not their fault that insurers, employers or both have
disappeared; the fault lies with the industry, which collectively
should be putting this right. The insurers have had the premiums and
have invested them, so they should pay
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000023">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:25:01"></hs_TimeCode>
are talking about at least 6,000 people who, between them, have lost
somewhere in the region of £800 million. Compensation of 75%
means that people have to absorb 25% of the ongoing costs.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:25:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wansbeck said that that is at least £43,000. To
somebody who is probably on the sick, and whose family is probably not
working because they are taking care of them, £43,000 is a
life-changing sum of money. It might not be very much to insurance
companies or to some of those funded by insurance companies, but it is
clearly a lot of money for people at a time of
grief<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:25:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000024">I
want to pick up what has been said about the exclusion of other
diseases. If people have been criminally exposed to a poisonous
substance, those who did that 
<?notus-xml column=705?>should be brought to book, and the way to do that is to make them pay
compensation. I hope that we would support that and that as the Bill
goes forward we can make that case more and more
strongly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:25:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000025">Again,
why is the cut-off date not February 2010, which is when the
consultation was announced? The written ministerial statement came out
two and a half years after that consultation was announced. That was
two and a half years of what—things gathering dust and people
having discussions? What were civil servants doing? All of a sudden,
there was a statement two and a half years later, followed by a
discussion period to bring us to where we are now. That clearly is not

Kevan Jones:</Member></B> Does my hon. Friend agree that there is at
least some logic in that? The arbitrary date of 2010 is when the

they took the premiums and saved money by not paying

of a sudden the consultation found that mesothelioma was not caused by
exposure at work or employers neglecting their duty in not providing

want to talk, first, about an area that has not been mentioned
particularly today, before adding my voice to some of the strong
criticisms from the Opposition. I am concerned about the implications
for reputable small businesses that are unable to trace insurance. It
is very difficult for a victim trying to suss out exactly who their
employer was when they contracted the disease, particularly if they
worked for several different employers, and for them then to suss out
who the insurer was for that particular employer. Victims are now
finding that many of the companies they have worked for have
disappeared or re-emerged under different names, and sometimes the only
company a claimant can find will be one of a few family firms that have
a good reputation in an area and which want to maintain good health and
safety
standards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000038">One
case in my constituency concerns a highly reputable firm that probably
never had any asbestos anywhere near the victim. Nevertheless, it has
to prove that and defend itself, because none of the myriad other
companies that the poor sufferer of mesothelioma worked for still
exist. Even prior to 1969 when the Labour Government made
employers’ liability insurance compulsory, we are pretty certain
that most companies had such insurance because there was no massive
increase in the number of companies taking it out. Nevertheless,
records seem difficult to trace. The case goes back a considerable
number of years, and finding proof of that insurance is extremely
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000039">The

potential claimants can access from the ELTO the information they need
as simply as possible. Promises have been made in the other place about
improving the money available for research, and taking the issue
extremely seriously. I know that a lot of good work has been done, not

areas of the Bill are not at the point they should be, including the
percentage of payment—a point raised by a number of my hon.
Friends. Insurance companies have said that they would consider figures
that go up to 3% of gross written premium. Why on earth are the
Government settling for 75% of average civil compensation claims when
their team has produced figures to indicate that 90% would still mean
that insurance companies are looking at a percentage of GWP of
something like 2.9%—well within the 3% limit? Indeed, 95% of
average civil compensation claims would be only 3.05% of GWP, and 100%
would be 3.19%. The Government could clearly afford 90% of average
civil compensation claims as a very minimum, rather than a measly 75%
that leaves people up to £18,000 worse off than if the average
were 90%. There is no excuse for plucking a figure out of the air
rather than matching what insurance companies have said they could
afford.</hs_Para>

the date from which the scheme should commence, it was clear back in
February 2010 that we were looking at an insurance company-funded
scheme. In other words, the insurance companies were fully aware of
what was being discussed in the consultation. They knew it would be an
industry-funded scheme, so there is no excuse for the funding not to
start from then, if not considerably earlier, as a number of my hon.

we need to educate people about how to use asbestos and how to react to
it. As a minimum, asbestos should be marked on any public building. If
it is not disturbed, it is not dangerous, but we must ensure that when
it is removed, it is done professionally by people who know what they

but earlier cases have been documented. The Government wrote to the
Confederation of Shipbuilders after the second world war,
congratulating it on the work that it had done during the conflict but
warning about the dangers of exposure to asbestos. However, nothing was
done to protect people from those dangers. Our failure to take the
warning more seriously and react to it at the time is a national
scandal, and a dark stain on the nation’s
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:50:24"></hs_TimeCode>. As

it more quickly, but those affected were mainly poor working-class

was the GMB’s legal officer, and he was very tenacious in his
efforts to ensure that cases were heard and compensation was secured 
<?notus-xml column=711?>for people. A difficulty that used to confront me every week was caused
by the fact that, in the case of many older men, it was not known that
they had contracted mesothelioma until they died. It is awful to have
to say to a family “There must be an autopsy to establish what
this person has died of.” I remember one alarming occasion when
someone rang two days before a funeral was due to take place, and Ian
and I had to stop the funeral to ensure that there was an autopsy so
that the evidence could be used. Ian has great expertise when it comes
to compiling the history of where people worked and trying to trace the
insurance companies. It is time-consuming, laborious work, but it can
be done.</hs_Para>

is important for anyone who has worked with asbestos to make a record
of where they worked with it. I pay tribute to those in GMB Northern
Region who, along with their solicitors, set up an asbestos register on
which people were asked to log that information. They might not have
developed the disease yet, but if they developed it later, at least it
would be possible to establish where they had worked. It was not
uncommon for people to move around different shipyards on both Teesside
and Tyneside, and before nationalisation it was sometimes very
difficult to establish who their actual employer
was<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:54:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Another
industry that proved notoriously difficult in that regard from the late
1980s onwards was the building industry, in which people moved from
site to site—usually on a very casual basis—and were
exposed to asbestos throughout their working lives. Trying to put
together some of those long employment histories was very difficult.
That is why I recommend that anyone who has worked
with asbestos make sure that loved ones or solicitors know where they
worked, because this disease can develop later on and that is vital
information in order to be able to trace the employers and the insurers

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T20:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery). The north-east has nearly 10% of
England’s mesothelioma cases. That will not come as a surprise
to anyone who knows anything about asbestos-related diseases, because
of the north-east’s heavy engineering, coal mining, shipyards
and other industries that dealt with asbestos. Between 1985 and 2005,
some 2,387 people in the north-east died of mesothelioma, and that is
not counting all the other asbestos-related illnesses people died from.
In that period, 192 people died in Durham, 72 of them in my
constituency.</hs_Para>

agree that it is very important to talk about the figures, but I have
dealt with these individuals and have seen the awful way in which they
die and the agony their families go through––and the
poverty, because it is the breadwinner who goes from many of these

have access to large amounts of discretionary income or expenditure.
They need this compensation. It will not be a luxury for these

key thing people who are dying from mesothelioma say they want is help

want to be able to die with the knowledge that their families will be
taken care of. That is not always possible. As has been said, 
<?notus-xml column=712?>thoroughness in these cases is very important. There are certain firms
with a specialism in doing asbestos work, but I have come across some

we have a Bill is welcome, but it is a very disappointing Bill. Much
has been said about the insurance companies and, having dealt with them

order not to accept a claim, not only in these areas but in other
personal injury cases as well.</hs_Para>

insurance companies have done very well out of this Government. They
have convinced everybody that there is a claims culture in this
country, which there clearly is not if we cut away from the headlines
and look at all the actual evidence. They have got assistance through
changes in the law that help them rather than the victims in a whole
array of personal injury cases, and they are going to get off the hook
again under this Bill as it stands, because, basically, what it does is
cap their liability.</hs_Para>

estimate is £350 million. That is a large sum of money to
individuals, but we also need to consider that the insurance companies
have not only not paid out for these cases that they took premiums for
over many years, but they have had the premiums and then failed to pay
out about £800 million of claims on them. If we add it all up,
£350 million is not a great deal of money.</hs_Para>

is also not a great deal of money if we look at the profits the
insurance companies have made over the previous few years. Let me
mention a few, just to give a flavour. Lloyd’s of London
posted pre-tax profits of £1.5 billion between January and June
2012 and its profits for the whole of 2012 were £2.77 billion.
Royal Sun Alliance had pre-tax profits of £233 million between
January and June 2012. The £350 million being offered here is
therefore in stark contrast to the profits that some of these companies
are making.</hs_Para>

according to the Bill, these companies will not pay the money
themselves anyway, because it will be a levy that they will get from
future premiums. In the other place, Lord Freud said:</hs_Para>

insurance companies are not even dipping into their profits for the

strange that we started with a figure of 70% and ended up at 75%. The
hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford, who was not present when I
started speaking, said that she would like to see 80%, but I suggest
that she should have started a bit higher and worked down from there.
In negotiations, people should never start at the figure they actually
want, so perhaps she should have started at 95%. If she is lucky enough
to get on the Bill Committee, I suggest that she start at, say, 88% and
work downwards to the 80% figure that she wants. There is no rationale
for the 75% figure.</hs_Para>

made a very good point about future liability. Since 1972, such
insurance has been compulsory, so most future cases will be covered by
insurance policies. Potentially, the next biggest area is public
buildings and schools, but most such cases will not come under this
scheme because it will be possible to prove who the insurer is and who
is liable for the risk. It is therefore not clear to me what the 75%
figure is based on. The Minister said that he will produce the various
figures. It would have been helpful to have had those during the
debates in the other place and today, so that we could have examined
the basis of the negotiations.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1312031000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000077">As I said
earlier, it seems that the insurance companies have been in the driving
seat in these negotiations, which is a very strange way of negotiating
on behalf of the victims, which is what I expect the Government to be
doing. They will have done the modelling and know exactly the various
costs involved. As my hon. Friend the Member for Middlesbrough said, we
are not talking about people who do not calculate risk. They calculate
risk, and they also calculate the age profiles of the groups that will
be affected. I therefore find it odd that we do not have the relevant
figures before us today.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:04:51"></hs_TimeCode>Again, that
should not be the starting point for the insurance companies. The
starting point should be to ask what the maximum compensation could be
for the victims of this missed justice, and I believe that 100% is the
right figure. I know that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:05:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chatham and Aylesford thinks differently, but if we at least start
at 100%, we might end up with a better figure than the one that is on
the table.</hs_Para>

was also pointed out that the figure is not simply 75%, but 75% of the
average. People should not expect payments that are on a par with those
resulting from litigation settlements or other insurance policies.
These arrangements will not be like that at all, and many of the people
who should rightly get compensation because they have been affected by
the disease through no fault of their own are going to be
short-changed. Let us remember that the insurance companies took the
premiums and benefited from them for many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:06:09"></hs_TimeCode>. There is
a debate to be had in Committee on that.</hs_Para>

the Minister tell us how the negotiations have taken place? If the
rules were set by the insurance companies, rather than by the
Government setting down the starting point, they will have been poor
negotiations 
<?notus-xml column=714?>because they will have started from the wrong premise. I know
that my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:06:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Blaydon wants to question the Government’s
motives in this regard, and he has every right to do so, but if we are
on the victims’ side, we should be trying to get the maximum
compensation for them irrespective of our political party
allegiance.</hs_Para>

is also remarkable that the insurance companies seem to have been in
the driving seat in setting the date of diagnosis from which the scheme
will apply—namely, 25 July 2012. Lord Freud spoke in the other
place about how that decision would affect insurance companies. He said
that if an earlier date were set, the levy would go up, which would be
unaffordable. Like
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:07:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

has been pointed out that the insurance companies have known since
February 2010 that this change was coming. I doubt that they are so bad
that they will not make provision for this in their calculations, but
the Government need to explain why that date of July 2012 has been
stuck to. Was it at the insistence of the insurance companies? I guess
it was, because it will limit their liabilities. Frankly, if I were
them, I would be laughing all the way to the bank if I could cut my
liabilities in that way.</hs_Para>

accept that, whenever we set an arbitrary date, there will be people
who fall either side of the line, but many of those campaigning on
behalf of loved ones who died from mesothelioma before that date will
not get a penny out of this scheme. What is the logic in what has been
decided? People have argued that it would be logical to set a 2010 date
because that was when the consultation started and that it would be
fair to the insurance companies to give them some warning, but that is
complete nonsense. The insurance companies have known about this for
years; it has not come as a surprise to them. There would at least be
some logic in going back to the date of knowledge of
mesothelioma, in regard to the other legal cases, because that argument
has been formed in law.</hs_Para>

suggested this approach earlier, the Minister intervened to say that a
huge group would be included, because it would include families. There
are two issues involved here. First, a number of people will have died
in the intervening period, so we are not going to get any new cases
from that—this is about historical cases. I accept that legacy
cases could come from families who want to pursue a claim, but there
will be very few of those. I have done asbestos work for a number of
years and I know the detail of it. In these cases, someone needs
detailed knowledge of where individuals worked and were exposed to
asbestos. In addition, a lot of these people who died of
asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma would have died without
even knowing this. I find it difficult to believe that the insurance
companies have not done some modelling to know what that figure could
be. It would have been good for us today, and when the Bill was
introduced, if someone had at least asked how many potential cases
could be in that group, but that has not been asked. Again, we have
just accepted that this would be onerous for the insurance
companies—that may be true, but let us find out what the number
is. That debate has not been had. That earlier date would be
more defendable than even the 2010 
<?notus-xml column=715?>decision, which would be arbitrary in that respect. I am not a lawyer,
so I look to the lawyers in the room to answer whether or not people
will legally challenge a date, if it is agreed, of 2012 or 2010 on the
basis that the date of knowledge goes back to 1965.

it is time-limited. When we look at the amount of money that has gone
into cancer research, it is shocking to realise what a small amount has
gone into mesothelioma. That funding has been important for the
pioneering research that has been done with the British Lung
Foundation. I agree with her that we need to insert some reference to
research in the Bill. Without that—I know that she is poacher
turned gamekeeper and clearly knows the inside track and how the
companies operate—there is no way that the insurance companies
will voluntarily give up any money to research unless they have to. I

the Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) no matter how long he speaks
for. Anyone who watched “Britain and the Sea” last
night—I think it was on BBC1—would have seen a great deal
of my constituency, because it was all about shipbuilding on the Clyde.
Unfortunately, that is now part of our history because the remaining
yards on the Clyde are not in my constituency. Although we are proud of
the industry, we have two quite stark reminders of our shipbuilding
past that we would rather not have. One is a large derelict piece of
land at Queen’s quay, on which I hope we will soon see some
houses built. The second is the scourge of asbestos exposure, which
leads to, among other things, the horrible cancer that is mesothelioma.
As we have heard this evening, people have also been exposed in a
number of other industries—among other things, my constituency
had an asbestos factory.</hs_Para>

diagnosed with such a disease is bad enough, but having to fight not
only it but for compensation is a double blow. The average life
expectancy following diagnosis 
<?notus-xml column=717?>with mesothelioma is about two years, which people should not have to
spend battling to ensure that their family have a little financial
security.</hs_Para>

welcome the Bill and want to see it become law as soon as possible, but
I also want the House to work together, if possible—it looks

should be better.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1312031000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000097"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:20:21"></hs_TimeCode>I
want to reinforce a number of points that Members have already covered
today. My first concern is the level of compensation. Why should it be
set at only 75% of the average paid out? I wanted to ask the Minister
that as he was making his opening speech, but he refused to take more
interventions—I do not know whether he takes a daily allowance
of three—and we did not get an answer to that question. I urge
the Government to consider raising the level to at least 90%, although
hon. Members have suggested other figures. According to the
Government’s own analysis, that would still fall within the 3%
levy on premiums that the industry tells us it can afford. The pay-outs
would be raised by an additional £18,000, and I hope that
proposal is considered seriously in Committee.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1312031000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000098"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:21:26"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
the cut-off date for those eligible for the scheme has simply been set
far too late and does not kick in until a good two years after the
consultation was launched. Whether the two-year delay is attributable
to the wheels of the civil service turning slowly, or Ministers
prevaricating with or placating the insurance industry, that is two
years in which people will have been diagnosed who are now excluded
from the scheme.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:22:03"></hs_TimeCode>There is a
seriously twisted irony in the fact that, as I have said, the average
life expectancy following diagnosis with mesothelioma is approximately
the same length of time—two years.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1312031000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000099">As other
Members have argued, it is entirely justifiable for the kick-in date to
be put back to February 2010, when the consultation and the intention
to legislate for an industry-funded scheme were first announced.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>An industry

like other hon. Members I am concerned about the exclusion of other
asbestos-related diseases from the scheme and see no reason why it is

there is the inequitable situation of the compensation that is to be
paid out compared with the clawback of previously awarded

claimants only 75% of civil compensation rates while clawing back 100%
of previously awarded benefits or lump sum payments, and I hope that
that issue will be dealt with in Committee.</hs_Para>

the Bill. In all honesty, we hope that they will help us improve it,

thought that the Minister got off to a slightly bad start by not taking
interventions. He ended up intervening on twice as many Members as he
took interventions from in his speech. He intends to speak a second
time, which is purely in the gift of the House and not just because he
says so, but it might have been easier if he had taken more
interventions. I sympathise that the first piece of legislation that he
has to take through the House in his new role has a name that is quite
difficult to pronounce.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:32:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) came up with a good
suggestion, which was that rather than bothering to say mesothelioma

Members have pointed out, cancer of the mesothelium is a particularly
cruel disease. First, it affects some of the worst paid in society and
some of those who do the hardest physical labour, who are not rewarded
particularly well at all. That is why we have heard from so many hon.
Members this afternoon about how the parts of the country and the
communities most affected are those that have had some of the toughest
industries, whether shipbuilding, as

whole family can be affected, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:33:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

particularly sad story from

is also cruel because of the long tail, which many Members referred to,

compensation, because it is such a long time since the asbestos was
introduced into the body.</hs_Para>

is also cruel because the insurance industry, as many Members have
pointed out, has behaved cruelly through its extreme reluctance to

keeping proper records across the years that has made it all the more
difficult for people to get redress.
Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:34:23"></hs_TimeCode>, it is
cruel because once a person has contracted the illness, as many Members

issues were raised, but I will cover those that are particularly
important and have been mentioned constantly.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:34:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chatham and Aylesford, in an excellent speech that I could not
fault—I hope one day to see her on the Labour
Benches—made the very valid point that the 75% compensation that
is being allowed for by the Government is not borne out by the figures
to which the insurance industry has already signed up through its 3%
commitment. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:35:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stretford and Urmston said, there is a perfectly good
moral case for saying that it should be 100% compensation. We will want
to tease out these issues in Committee. I am grateful for the
Minister’s comments about being able to provide us with numbers
and statistics before we get to the first Committee date, because it
feels as though there has been a bit of jiggery-pokery over these
numbers in the past few weeks while the Bill was in the other place and
since
then<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:35:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000122">The
second key issue is the earlier start date that many of us think would
be suitable. That was mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:35:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Arfon (Hywel Williams), who is not in his place. It seems
inconceivable that any part of the insurance industry was unaware that
there was 
<?notus-xml column=721?>going to be a scheme of this kind after the Labour
Government started the consultation in February 2010, so it is only
fair that we should go back to the earlier start date. Several other
Members referred to this, including

as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:37:11"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East mentioned, there is the
25% that is apparently being allocated to lawyers. When I first arrived
in the House, one of the big issues facing mining constituencies such
as mine was the miners’ compensation Bill. The biggest row we
had was with lawyers who wanted to extract unnecessarily ludicrous fees
for work that could already be paid for, and in fact was paid for, by
the Government. We will want to shine some light on the precise
statistics. If a significant amount of money—say £7,000,
a figure that has been stated several times—ends up being taken
out of people’s compensation to pay for lawyers, that would not
be the justice that people are looking for.</hs_Para>

fifth issue, which was raised by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:38:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith), is who runs the scheme and who
will sit on the technical committee. She also referred to the very
important requirement on us to consider how to ensure that that is not
just a stitch-up between Government and the big players in the industry
when much smaller players need to be considered as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:38:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312031000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0003.htm#1312031000126">The
sixth issue, which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:38:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Dunbartonshire mentioned, is the 100% clawback. It
seems intrinsically unfair for the Government to say, “You can
only receive 75% of the compensation that you would get if you were
going through the civil courts in the normal way, but we will take back
100% of the money that you received in benefits.” There may be
arguments to be had about that, but it is something else that we will
want to look at in Committee. It was also referred to by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:39:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Jim Sheridan) and for
Wansbeck (Ian Lavery).</hs_Para>

hope the Minister will also address the question of the
timetable for the Bill. The programme motion allows for the last
Committee sitting to take place on 17 December. We have always
wanted to help the Government get the Bill through as fast as possible,
with the sole caveat that, while it is a good Bill, it could be
immensely better. Of course, we want to ensure that there is adequate
time not just for consideration in Committee, but for consideration on
the Floor of the House on Report and Third Reading. My anxiety is that
if the Committee finishes considering the Bill on 17 December,
the Bill’s Third Reading will be on 19
December—the day Parliament will
rise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:40:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope the
Minister will be able to reassure us about that, but I cannot see how
else he will be able to get the Bill through before

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:40:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson) made an extremely good
point, namely that we should stop talking about whether the Bill is
generous, generous enough or not generous enough. The most important
thing to recognise is that this is not about generosity. It is not some
kind of charitable act that we are doing; we are trying to right an
injustice. It is a fairly simple
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T21:40:44"></hs_TimeCode>. We
believe that it is only really possible to right that injustice if we
improve the Bill by ensuring that people get a better deal with regard
to the percentage of compensation on offer, as well as by going back to
an earlier date and by looking at some of the many other issues that
have been

have listened very carefully to the debate, and I have tried not to be
party political or partisan in any way, but nobody watching
would think that the previous Administration had been in government for
13 years. The issue has been known about for many years and, as I said

is worrying that we have been asked why the Government have taken two
years to sort out the problem. The consultation was very wide ranging,
and no one would have known from it what the previous Government
wanted. I cannot find out exactly what they wanted, because we are not
allowed to see their papers. The consultation came out in February
2010, just before the general election, after which we had the purdah
period, and then we came into office, and without knowing exactly what
was intended, my predecessor and the very dedicated Lord Freud, the
Minister in the other House, worked with the Secretary of State to
bring forward this

is perfect, and I fully understand that hon. Members on both sides of
the House want to table amendments in Committee and probably on Report.
What is very important, however, is that the Bill is passed and
regulations are laid, and that compensation gets out to the victims of
this terrible disease and their loved ones. If even some points that
have been discussed were put in, the Bill would have to go back to the
Lords and that would mean a period of ping-pong.

Walker:</Member></B> The first of the Procedure Committee’s
recommendations has been accepted by the Government—let us start
on a positive note—as it is uncontentious and simply formalises
the current practice of the Backbench Business Committee taking
representations in public. I think all colleagues will agree that that
fantastic occasion on Tuesday is well attended and extremely exciting.
It portrays and presents Parliament at its absolute best. I
know you share that view, Mr Speaker, if I may be so presumptuous as to
involve you in this

second suggestion does not meet with quite so much favour from the
Government Front-Bench team—nor, I am sad to say, from the
Chairman of the Backbench Business Committee—but I thought that
for the sake of debate I would expand on the Procedure
Committee’s view on this matter. I should say at this early
stage that I do not want to keep colleagues here until the
small hours of the morning, so it is unlikely that I will put this to
the vote tonight. Perhaps I have shown my hand too early, but I know
colleagues have important things to be getting on with in their

second suggestion, which is opposed by the Government, is to amend
Standing Order No. 40, so that it allows for 35 days of backbench
business per Session or, when the Session is longer, a pro rata
increase of one day per each additional week. It is possible to imagine
a scenario after the general election when the incoming
Government—whether it be the current coalition, a Conservative
Government or, dare I say it, possibly a Labour Government—might
decide that their business agenda is so expansive that it requires two
years to put it into place. The Procedure Committee thus thought it
would be helpful—nay, necessary—for the number of days
given by the Government to be commensurate with the additional number
of weeks for which that first Parliament

change would enable the Committee to make provision for decisions on a
series of motions and amendments to those motions to be taken together

before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:11:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000041">I
shall canter through the next part of my speech. I shall have to read
it, because it is quite complex, and I would not want to make a
deliberate or unnecessary mistake. Let me give two examples in which
that power might have been useful. In the case of recent debates on the
sitting hours of the House, the need to take a complex series of votes
before the usual time of interruption required the sacrifice of an hour
and a half of debating time. The debate on assisted dying, which was
scheduled to last an hour and a half, had to be voluntarily stopped 20
minutes early so that the first amendment could be put and voted on, in
order to allow a second vote to be taken before the 7 pm deadline. The
power might also provide for a timetable for decisions to be made on a
series of separate motions at fixed points, or for a day simply to be
divided between two or three debates. That would be entirely convenient
to the House because it would make everything reasonably
predictable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:12:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000042">In
anticipation of resistance from the Government, the Committee has
proposed a fairly formidable set of constraints on the use of the
power, which I shall set out now. I can see that the House is waiting
with bated breath to hear about this series of protections.</hs_Para>

the decision to use the power must be a unanimous decision by the
Committee, made, obviously, at a quorate meeting with due notice given.
Secondly, the Committee— 
<?notus-xml column=733?>unlike the Government—is given no power to
stretch a day, except in so far as Divisions might run past the normal
moment of interruption. It cannot extend the length of a
sitting on Thursday. Thirdly, and most importantly, the House would be
free to disagree with any proposal made by the Committee at the start
of the day to which it applied. The proposal would be put without
debate, but could be divided on and defeated. If the House did not like
it, the House could reject it.</hs_Para>

there is no possibility, in a perfect world—the world that I
would like to see become a reality, although it is not going to become
a reality tonight—of the Backbench Business Committee’s
abusing its power to force the House to make unpalatable decisions in
an unpalatable way. The whole Committee, and the whole House, must want
the business to which this power might be applied to be conducted in a
rational and predictable way. It is not applicable to anything other
than Back-Bench business: it cannot affect Government business,
Opposition business, or private Members’
Bills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:14:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000045">I
appreciate that there is resistance to this. There are many here who
feel that the Government, motivated by good will, would want to ensure
whenever possible that the Backbench Business Committee was able to
achieve its objectives, and that there would be helpful Whips

the view of my opposite number,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:14:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel), who chairs the Backbench
Business Committee. This is a point of principle and
the—slow—direction of travel at the moment is for this
House to take back more powers for itself. It was the case about 110
years ago that if the Government of the day wanted to transact their
business in this place, they had to come and seek our permission. Over
the past 110 years we have given up successive powers through Standing
Orders so now we are in the position of begging the Government for
time, or relying on the good will of Government to give us that
time.</hs_Para>

coming—slowly—when this House will have the courage and
desire to take back some of its own power and we will have the
self-confidence not to rely on the Whips to transact our business for
us on those days when it is our business. I accept that there will be
Government days for business, and that is fine, but I think that on
those days when there is Back-Bench business—those days when it
is our business, when this place comes back to us—in a few

debates. That got mixed reviews and we have chopped and changed that
around, but one of the more successful innovations, which is mentioned
on the Order Paper, was enabling Select Committee Chairs to launch
their reports on the Floor of the House. Interestingly, that 
<?notus-xml column=735?>did not work in quite the way we wanted it to. They used to have to do
it by taking interventions from Members, without being able to stand up
like Ministers and take questions from the Floor. We felt that that
really required a change to the Standing Orders, and we welcome the
motion on the Order Paper today in the name of the right hon. Member
for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), who chairs the Liaison
Committee.</hs_Para>

themselves to decide what they want to do within their own allocated

paragraph in his motion that deals with allowing us to meet in
public and to take representations from Members—as he said, it
simply formalises current practice—we disagree with the points
made in the following paragraphs. The honourable exception to that is
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming), who is a member
of both the Backbench Business Committee and the Procedure Committee,
and supports these changes. We are concerned that these changes impose
rigorous rules on us that might have negative consequences. We have
enjoyed the freedom resulting from there being no rules governing what
we could and could not
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000059">The
first point on which we really disagreed was the allocating of
our time pro rata. At the moment, as the hon. Member for Broxbourne
said, the Backbench Business Committee is allocated 35 days a Session.
As he also pointed out, the first Session stretched to almost two
calendar years. We demanded, quite vocally, that the Government extend
our allocation of time pro rata, and they did. There was a slight
dispute over one or two days that the Government had scheduled before
we came into existence, but broadly, the arrangement worked very
well.</hs_Para>

the 35-day allocation is a minimum; the Government are perfectly free
to allocate us more than that. My worry is that if pro rata-ing is
imposed, there is nothing to say that this allocation will become a
fixed amount of time. By the same token, if a Session is shorter than a
calendar year, there is nothing to say that the Government could not
then pro rata downwards. As the Chair of the Backbench Business
Committee, I would not want that to happen. Given that the arrangement
only happened because of the introduction of fixed-term Parliaments,
for which we were compensating, and given that we now have fixed-term
Parliaments, it is highly unlikely that this situation will ever arise
again. I just do not think it is worth taking the risk of an unforeseen
consequence.</hs_Para>

of debate was allocated. It was considerably longer than an hour and a
half, but it is true that there would have been another 20 minutes of
debate and that votes would have taken place at the end of the day.
However, that problem was identified only in retrospect, so even if we

am concerned that the proposal could have unintended consequences. One
of the things that I have witnessed working really well in Back-Bench
debates is that, at the moment, Back Benchers control their own time by
having flexibility. We are therefore able to respond to events such as
urgent questions, statements and whatever else might happen in the
House on the day. Unlike in debates in Government time, it is
extraordinary how Back Benchers are aware and respectful of any
subsequent debates and of the number of Members who have put their name
down to speak. When time limits are imposed, Members take less time in
order to allow others into the debate and to shorten the debate in
order to allow the following debate enough time to be heard.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>We all know
that, if we started to timetable our debates, that would no longer
happen. When debates are timetabled, we fill that time. We go to the
limit of the time that is permitted. That would take away something
from the Backbench Business Committee that is working extremely well
and that makes Back-Bench debates flexible.</hs_Para>

At the same time, I welcome the spirit in which the report was written

<?notus-xml column=737?>I take nothing away from any of that. I ask
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:28:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Broxbourne to leave the door open so that, if I am wrong and there
are problems of this nature in the future, we will be able to return to

will not press these matters to a vote today, because our two

the wide variety of Back Benchers in this House. I am therefore

do not think that the question of the number of days per year is a
massive issue of principle. If a Parliament were to have a forced

issue. It is entirely reasonable to have a system in Standing Orders

automatically delivered. That is a fair way of working. It is not a big

meant that the Backbench Business Committee was accountable not to
Parliament as a whole, but to the political groups—again, that
increased the power of the Executive. Our proposal is to give
the Backbench Business Committee a power—if it does not work, it
does not have to be used—that is currently held only by the
Executive. That is an important step forward, and it would give

not agree with that, Mr Speaker. When we have statements on the Floor
of the House from Ministers, you, through your wisdom, decide how long
that statement should run, and you do that by seeing how
many Members of the House are standing to ask questions.
Sometimes those statement do not include all the Members who want to
ask questions; sometimes they run for a very long time indeed. The
point is that the allocation of time is not specified beforehand. It is
in your wisdom and at your discretion how long a statement should last.
If, under the proposed procedure, the Backbench Business Committee
allows a statement on a Select Committee publication to take place,
either in this Chamber or in Westminster Hall, it should be up to Mr
Speaker, the Deputy Speaker or the Chairman in Westminster Hall to
decide how long that statement should run depending on the level of
interest in it shown by those Members who are standing to ask
questions. I am disappointed in the rather sloppy wording of the Select
Committee statements motion. The point about how long statements should
run has been missed, and I am very worried that if we have an extended
Session of Parliament the Government will not necessarily provide the
pro rata entitlement to the Backbench Business Committee that this
House would
like.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="1312033000228" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000228"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>10<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:39:12"></hs_TimeCode>.39

Governments of obtaining their business that the House sits shorter

Government’s amendments. If he begs to ask leave to withdraw the

regard to the amendments to the motion relating to Back-Bench business,
we support the first change proposed by the hon. Member for Broxbourne,
which would give the Backbench Business Committee the formal power to
hear representations from Members of the House in public. My
understanding is that that has become the norm. Indeed, I have been
present when Members have made representations. I know, because I have
seen it myself, that it really works, in the sense that it reflects
entirely the slow but welcome progress to ever-greater transparency in
this place. It would therefore be helpful to see that practice written
into Standing Orders. However,
we<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:54:14"></hs_TimeCode> join the
Chair of the Committee and the Leader of the House in opposing a formal

<?notus-xml column=744?>writing into Standing Orders of the principle of extending the number of
days made available for Back-Bench business when the parliamentary
Session extends beyond the usual year. This did not prove to be an
issue in the first Session of this Parliament, which went on for what

unlikely to occur again given the legislation on fixed-term Parliaments

believes that it is important that it should not have the power to
table programme motions. Back-Bench business days have always been more
flexible and the time has generally been split on the day depending on
the number of speakers for debates. This means that Members regulate
themselves and almost always have respectful regard for subsequent
debates. Her fear, as she clearly articulated, is that if the Committee

to the rest of the motion, the House will be aware from the Backbench

listened carefully to the arguments put forward by the Chair of the
Procedure Committee. While I understand the rationale behind the
proposals, I do not believe that either is necessary. The first arose
partly as a result of the unusually long first Session of this
Parliament. We have now passed the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011,
which ties us, other than in exceptional circumstances, to five-year
Parliaments with an election in early May. As a result, a
spring-to-spring one-year Session should be the norm, and I do not
expect a repeat of the two year Session. If there is one—one can
never rule it out—or if a Session extends slightly beyond one
year, I assure the House that business managers will take account of
the interests of the Backbench Business Committee and the House to
ensure a balanced spread of
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000123">In
fact, that is what happened during that long first Session. The
Government did not seek to stick to the Standing Order requirement of
35 days, but allocated the Backbench Business Committee 58 days, which
was—contrary to the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T22:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Kettering (Mr Hollobone)—well above what a simple pro rata
increase would have delivered. Members may recall that it took several
weeks at the start of the Session for the Backbench Business Committee
to become established, during which time the Government provided time
for debates that would otherwise have come from their allocation. That
demonstrates, as the Chair of the Committee has said, that an element
of flexibility is helpful to the House in the unlikely event of future
long
Sessions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000124">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:00:47"></hs_TimeCode>

Friend the Member for Broxbourne will be able to accept those arguments
and the Government amendment. Indeed, he has indicated as much. Should
it come to a vote—although I understand that that will not be
the case—I hope the House will support our position and that of
the Backbench Business Committee and vote in favour of amendment (a),

amendment (b) and business motions, I understand the case made by my

to provide the Backbench Business Committee with the power to table
business motions governing Back-Bench business days. There is already
flexibility for the Committee to indicate on the Order Paper the amount
of time it expects each debate to take. In these circumstances, as the
Committee Chair has said, Members are generally very good at exercising
restraint when necessary and respecting the 
<?notus-xml column=746?>interests of others wishing to speak in subsequent debates. The occupant
of the Speaker’s Chair is also able to encourage Members to
lengthen or shorten their speeches or even to impose formal time
limits, having regard to the interest shown by Members in contributing

inquiries—that practice has found favour in the Scottish
Parliament, as my right hon. Friend the Leader of the House found when
he visited—or by explaining the contents of their reports to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000138">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>
far, 13 Committees have made a total of 14 statements.
Committees now have the chance to ensure that their work becomes a
staple feature of Back-Bench business, although they will have to
compete with many other demands for time. No doubt Committees will wish
to review how the new arrangements work in due

debate. I have learned a lot of procedure during its course, and it is
good to know that, no matter how inexperienced we are, we can always
become more experienced by listening to the wisdom of colleagues. If
this is possible and acceptable to the House, I would ask to withdraw
the motion on Back-Bench business—I understand that that is
acceptable to the Chair of the

Charles Walker</B> (Broxbourne) (Con):</Member> On 27 June, I was
invited by Matilda MacAttram, of Black Mental Health UK, to attend a
conference in Wolverhampton. I did not know what to expect, but this
was a woman I liked and trusted immensely, so I travelled up to
Wolverhampton for a conference on deaths in custody. It was an
extraordinary, moving and profound occasion. The conference comprised
men and women, most of whom had lost sons, grandsons and nephews in
custody, either in a mental health or a police setting. They bore their
grief with great dignity and fortitude, but there was huge upset and
anger in the room at how they had been treated by the establishment, by
the system. I shall come to that in a moment.</hs_Para>

relatives of the deceased bore witness to their treatment at the hands
of the state and of authorities that we should trust. It was gruelling
to hear. I am afraid that much of the commentary focused on the
treatment meted out by certain police officers and the Independent
Police Complaints Commission. I do not want this to be an attack on the
police, so I want to say this now: there were many senior police
officers at the conference, and the pain was etched on their faces as
they listened to the experiences that families had been put through by
some of their colleagues in the police force. It was a terribly moving
day, but as I said, there were some very good police officers there.
The police must be part of the solution, so we need to take them with
us.</hs_Para>

account for about 3% of the population of this country, but
approximately 20% of deaths in custody. This has been a running sore
and an open wound for 30 years, and it is incumbent on us, the
political class, to address it, because if we do not, whatever side of
the House we are on, we have no hope of engaging with this community
constructively. They have lost trust in us. When I was preparing for
this debate, I talked to several journalists, and one of them said,
“But Mr Walker, isn’t it just about racism? Isn’t
this an issue of racism?”, and I said, “Well, racism is
an ugly, ugly word. It is a word I do not want to ascribe to people I
do not know or institutions I am not experienced of”. But let me
say this: for the past 30 years, since I became an adult, I have been
aware of grieving black families on the steps of courts or inquests
flashing across my television screen. I have seen the faces of those
families and the young men they are mourning flash across my television
screen, and up until this point I have chosen to do nothing. Now I am
standing up and trying to do something. I may want to ask others this
question, but I have to answer it: why, for 25 or 30 years, did I do
nothing? Until I answer that question satisfactorily, I will not cast
aspersions on
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000160">Another
person said, “But Charles, you are talking about deaths in
custody. You are a white male, why are you talking specifically about
black people?” Well, I feel there is something very egregious
about the treatment of black people in custody and detained
environments. Any death in custody is regrettable, sad and tragic, but
I am speaking as a parent because I think about what 
<?notus-xml column=752?>would happen if it were my son

mentioned Matilda MacAttram, and Lord Victor Adebowale has done great
work with the police on restraint and how we look after people in a
mental health crisis in a detained environment. I also pay tribute to
Deborah Coles of Inquest who has been extraordinarily generous in the

address the whole system of inquests. In June I met families in
Wolverhampton who had waited six, seven or eight years for an inquest
into the death of their child, their brother. That is wholly
unacceptable. I know the Government are committed to holding inquests
in good time, but many families are still waiting for two or three
years. We must ensure that inquests happen in good time, but an inquest
is only as good as the information presented to it, so we must ensure
that inquests deal with good
information.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000163">We
must address the fact that police officers are not required to answer
questions put to them by the Independent Police Complaints Commission.
That is simply ridiculous; I am aware that many senior police officers
in the Association of Chief Police Officers believe it is a nonsense
and needs to be addressed. We must also have equality of arms. When
there is a death in detention, the various parties of the state have
legal representation—the mental health trust, the police, the
chief constable may have legal representation, all funded by
the taxpayer. The family of the deceased, however, will too often have
their finances gone through with a fine toothcomb—not just the
parents, but grandparents, aunts, uncles and extended family—to
see whether they should pay for some or all of their legal costs. That
is a disgraceful way to treat a mourning family, and if we do nothing
else, it is incumbent on this House to end that inequality in
arms.</hs_Para>

dies in a mental health setting, as opposed to a police custody
environment, we must ensure an independent investigation that carries
the confidence of the family of the deceased and the wider community.
Let us be in no doubt about the sense of anger and frustration at the
current state of play. I do not know how we do this in law, but we must
also end the culture of briefings. When someone dies in custody, the
organisation that had responsibility for that individual’s care
and safety can go into a sort of institutional meltdown and lockdown.
It goes into a default position of getting its side of the story
across, and the names and reputations of good young men are trashed in
such a way that that becomes the accepted
narrative—“Because the inquest is so far away, if we go
on and paint a wholly false picture of this young man, that will become
the accepted story.”</hs_Para>

want to go back to the need for inquests. I am dealing with one family
whose son called the police—there was a domestic dispute and he
felt that he and his child were being threatened—and ended up
being arrested. He was taken to a detained mental health environment.
His sister came to see him. He said, “Please get me out of here.
If you don’t, they will kill me.” He was dead the next
day. It took the family a year and a half to recover the body of their
son and brother. When they did recover his body, it was beaten, bruised
and covered in Taser marks. That is a tragedy. I can understand why
that upsets people so much. It upsets me today and I know that it

turned away. The establishment has turned its back; it has chosen to
walk on the other side of the road. If we are to bring the community
closer to us we need to understand the sense of hurt we in this place,
and the institutions of the state, have caused. The healing process
needs to start at the very top. We need the Prime Minister and the
Leader of the Opposition to stand up and say, “I want to hear
your stories. I want to listen. I am so sorry that we allowed this to

emotion at the age of 45. I always knew that we do not live in a

for Broxbourne (Mr Walker) has hit on one very important
issue—the pain that this matter causes among communities. Deaths
in custody have been an issue in the east end of London for the 25-plus
years I have been a Member of Parliament. A number of names come to
mind—Trevor Monerville and Shiji Lapite, for example. A number
of aspects of the issue of deaths in custody cause pain in communities,
one of which is the disproportionate number of such deaths in the black
and the Irish communities. Another is the briefing that has always gone
on in the wake of a death in custody—that the dead person had
drugs in their system, for example. Then, months later, the facts
emerge and we find that the briefing was completely
misleading.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:26:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

debate has focused particularly on the treatment of black people in
police custody, and I would like to go through a number of important
points that my hon. Friend made, starting with his remark that the
number of black people of Afro-Caribbean origin dying in police custody
is disproportionately high, when the 
<?notus-xml column=755?>overall population is taken into account. In that regard, we need to
step back. Looking at custody populations as a whole, we see that there
is an over-representation of black people. The reasons for this are
complex and at this stage we do not fully understood them. Indeed,
there appears to be an over-representation of black people across the
whole of the criminal justice system. The Ministry of Justice is
conducting work to look more closely at the reasons for this,
identifying where there is real disproportionality in the system and
seeking to develop an appropriate response to it. That is where the
disproportionality lies; it is not necessarily, as in the most tragic
cases, only the deaths of black people in police custody that are
relevant.</hs_Para>

is no statistically significant difference among those who die in
custody based on membership of any particular racial or ethnic group.
The IPCC statistics for 2012-13 show that there were 15 deaths in or
following police custody, of which 14 were white and one was mixed
race. Looking further back at the 2011-12 period, there were also 15
deaths, of which one was a black person and one of mixed race. The 2011
IPCC report on long-term deaths in police custody concluded that the
ethnic breakdown of deaths in custody appeared to be broadly in line
with the make-up of detainees more generally. I entirely accept that
there is disproportionality in the criminal justice system, but it does
not occur only in the context of deaths in
custody<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:29:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000179">My
hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne rightly raised the issue of
mental health and policing. I am aware that black people are one and a
half times more likely to be detained under section 136 of the Mental
Health Act 1983. In response to the fact that such a high proportion of
people with mental health problems—and of all or any racial
origins—are being dealt with by the police, we have introduced a
series of measures to improve the way in which they are
handled.</hs_Para>

right to expect to be treated by the health service rather than finding
themselves in the hands of the police, who will always go to help in an
emergency, but who are clearly not trained as mental health
professionals. The Home Office has been conferring closely with the
Department of Health, and we will shortly publish a concordat agreed by
nearly 30 national organisations, agencies and Departments. It will
provide national leadership by setting out the standard of response
that people suffering mental health crises and requiring urgent care
should expect, and key principles on the basis of which local health
and criminal justice partners should be organised. It will leave not
just the health service but the criminal justice agencies in no doubt
about what is expected of them. It is precisely because a
disproportionate number of black people are finding themselves
sectioned under mental health legislation that the coming improvements
in mental health provision will have a particular impact on those
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000181">One
of the standard—and perfectly correct—complaints is that
too often the police are relied on to transport people who would be

initially intended to exist for three years. However, we have

Green:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has made a valid point. I hope to
explain to him in a moment about the changes that are happening and
those that have already happened, but let me first say a little more
about the Ministerial Council on Deaths in Custody, because it is an
extremely important institution. As well as a practitioner and
stakeholder group, it has an independent advisory panel on deaths in
custody. The panel has just created a two-year research project for the
University of Greenwich, which will deal systematically with a number
of the current problems. The university will conduct a review of the
role of mental illness and deaths in all state custody, and an
evaluation of the efficacy of information sharing between youth
offending teams and the secure estate in relation to the assessment and
management of the risk of self-harm and suicide among children and
young people. Tonight’s debate, and other conversations in which
I have taken part, suggest to me that I should consider whether the
ethnicity of individuals who lose their lives in custody should also be
included in that research
project.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000185">Let
me move on to the changes and the specifics.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:34:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Broxbourne had some harsh words to say about the IPCC,
which must be notified of any death that occurs in police custody.
Following the investigation into the death of Sean Rigg and the
findings of the Home Affairs Committee inquiry into the IPCC, it is
carrying out a review into how deaths in, or following, police custody
are investigated. A progress report was published in September, and the
final report is due to be published next year.</hs_Para>

are happening. The Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill
includes new powers for the IPCC, which it has requested to strengthen
its remit and functions. I agree with my hon. Friend that it has not
been a perfect institution in the past. It has had failings, so we have
strengthened its functions and we have increased its funding. The
functions include powers to enable the IPCC to recommend and direct
that a police force instigates unsatisfactory performance procedures in
cases that involve death or serious injury. It will have extra
resources from the police,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:35:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

mentioned the time it has taken for the deceased to be returned to
their families as a result of inquests. Under the Coroners
(Investigations) Regulations 2013, which came into force in July as
part of a package of reforms, coroners must release the body of the
deceased for burial or cremation as soon as possible. If the coroner
cannot release the body within 28 days, he or she must notify the known
next of kin or personal representative of the reasons for the delay.
When there is a criminal investigation into the death, there may be
more than one post-mortem examination, but the coroner will make every
effort for the body to be released at the earliest
opportunity.</hs_Para>

should also draw the House’s attention to the recent appointment

standards in the coroner system. I hope that will have a direct effect
on the important questions we are debating tonight.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend talked about the requirement for police officers to answer
questions posed to them by the IPCC. In December last year the
Government brought forward emergency legislation to ensure police
officers were required to attend interviews when requested by the IPCC.
If we went further, as my hon. Friend suggested, and compelled police
officers to answer questions in criminal investigations, that would put
them in a worse position than members of the public, who have to attend
but are not required to answer questions. It would seem perverse to
have fewer rights for police officers than for other members of the
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-02T23:37:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000190">My

for Hackney North and Stoke Newington talked about the practice of
off-the-record briefings, which can often stain the reputation of
someone in a way that persists even when it is unjustified. The Leveson
inquiry reset and clarified the boundaries of the relationship between
the police

hon. Friend also talked about equality of representation. I would
simply say that inquests are not trials. Unlike other proceedings for
which legal aid might be available, there are no parties in inquests,
only interested persons, and witnesses are not expected to present
legal arguments. Legal advice and assistance before the inquest hearing
via the legal help scheme is available to interested persons. Legal
help can be used, for example, to assist in the preparation of a list
of written questions that they wish the coroner to explore with other
witnesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000193">My
hon. Friend also talked about the independent investigation of deaths
in NHS mental health settings, as opposed to police settings. NHS
England is working to make the investigation of deaths in hospital
settings more independent. The work will conclude shortly, and guidance
to NHS commissioners will be published early in the new year. I hope
that he can therefore see that, across the board in this sensitive and
vital area, there is a significant amount of change.</hs_Para>

conclude by reassuring the House that the Government are working to
ensure that people are treated proportionately and humanely when in
police custody. The number of people losing their lives in
police custody has fallen. In 1998-99, there were 49 deaths; last year
there were 15, and there were the same number this year. However, there
is still a lot of work to be done. I can absolutely assure the House
that, through the Ministerial Council on Deaths in Custody, and through
working with other Government Departments, campaign groups and, indeed,
the families of the deceased, I will make sure that this issue remains
high on the Government’s list of
priorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312033000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/debtext/131202-0004.htm#1312033000195"><I>Question

the aftermath of such an attack, it is important to take a clear-eyed,
dispassionate approach to the analysis of the circumstances in order
that the right lessons are identified and learnt, and that is exactly
what we have done in detail. However, much of the media reporting on
this subject has omitted the fact that United States Marine Corps and
UK personnel (from 51 Sqn RAF Regiment, 5 RAF Force
Protection Wing) responded to the incursion decisively 
<?notus-xml column=494?>and with great courage. Having contained the insurgent assault, this
combined force counter-attacked and proceeded to clear the airfield,
killing 14 of the 15 attackers and capturing the remainder. During this
brave action in difficult circumstances, two US personnel were killed
and 17 US and UK personnel were wounded. Their sacrifice undoubtedly
prevented greater loss of life and
equipment.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13120235001253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/text/131202w0001.htm#13120235001253">Turning
to your questions. Security of all our overseas bases is a key focus
for the Staff and the Defence Ministerial team. In this specific case,
over the last 13 months, there has been a considerable amount of
activity devoted to increasing understanding of what happened during
the attack, the reasons why the attack was partially successful and
what action was needed to prevent a recurrent. The UK has played its
part in this activity to the full, both in conducting its own reviews
and contributing to work carried out by ISAF and the US. As the
recently published US Review acknowledges, much has been done to
strengthen force protection measures at Camp Bastion since September
2012; as a direct result of this work. I can confirm that these
measures have cost in the region of £3.0M<Sup>1</Sup>, are
considered by our Force Protection experts to be appropriate to the
assessed level of threat, and that threat is kept under constant
review.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13120235001254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/text/131202w0001.htm#13120235001254">In
response to your question about the manning of the watch towers at Camp
Bastion at the time of the attack, I can confirm that 11 of the 24
guard towers were manned. This was a similar level of manning as that
in operation on the US side of the camp, where a 50% manning profile

Security at the base has been progressively strengthened since the base

the period to meet our developing assessment of the threat, not least
as we have moved back from a network of bases across Central Helmand to
a single Main Operating Base and as the Insider Threat has developed.
In terms of specific physical security measures, it has not been
practicable to review all decisions in order to identify options not
followed up; for most upgrades, there was an evolving case that refined
understanding of the threat and the measures appropriate to meet this,
assessing the relative benefits of a range of options to address the

redundant either just before or just after the length of service at

Dunne:</Member></B> The rationale behind each of the decisions cited
was different, although they all represent examples of where the
Government has had to make difficult decisions to focus resources where
they are most needed and balance the Defence budget. They are also
examples where we had a clear understanding of the problems which
allowed us to take those decisions. As we said when we published the
Defence Equipment Plan 2012, we now have the assurance of a stable,
well managed budget with disciplined processes, and confidence that the
equipment programme is affordable and deliverable.</hs_Para>

project suffered from repeated delays and cost overruns and only one
airframe had been delivered to the RAF, but it was the aircraft's
projected future support costs that ultimately contributed to the
decision not to bring it into service. The Strategic Defence Security
Review (SDSR) did assess the options for reducing the fleet size, but
found that the significant fixed costs meant that only limited savings
could be realised by reducing the fleet compared with those from not
bringing it into service at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120235000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/text/131202w0001.htm#13120235000139">The

matured. During the campaign in Afghanistan a wide range of new

policy decision taken in the 2010 SDSR to purchase the carrier variant
of the Joint Strike Fighter was right, based on the information
available at the time. But more detailed technical work subsequently
revealed that the costs had spiralled, from £950 million to
£2 billion, risks had increased and the delivery timescale for a
converted carrier would be longer than previously anticipated. In light
of that assessment we took the decision to revert to the Short Take-Off

"Bikeability" cycle training in England. Bikeability is “cycling

Bikeability is underpinned by the National Standard for Cycle Training.
The National Standard is built upon similar principles to training for
motorcycle riders and car drivers, teaching the importance of assessing
the likely risks faced by road
users.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120235000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/text/131202w0001.htm#13120235000214">To

is being sourced via robust contracts with IT suppliers. Each of these
contracts enables the Department to impose penalties for non-delivery
and poor performance. The specific remedies differ according to the
terms of each contract, however a range of options is available to the
Department, including delay payments for failure to achieve pre-defined
delivery milestones, service credits for poor performance against
service levels, rights of refund related to failure to meet specific
milestones, rights of step-in by the Department or its appointed third

violence on 5 November, but no formal ceasefire was agreed during talks
in Kampala. The military defeat of M23 should therefore be greeted with
cautious optimism. The Kampala process needs to be brought to a
successful conclusion. All signatories to the Peace, Security and
Cooperation Framework need to ensure its effective implementation to
address the causes of conflict, thereby bringing sustained peace. We
continue to monitor the humanitarian situation in North Kivu with

tools and good practice, including an e-learning module for school
staff that we developed to increase awareness in schools of young
carers' issues. The Department of Health has recently started training

coercion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120239000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131202/text/131202w0002.htm#13120239000284">We
are strengthening the Care Quality Commission's (CQCs) regulatory
function. The new chief inspector of Adult Social Care, Andrea
Sutcliffe, will have widespread powers to take firm action on poor care
and to hold both councils and providers to account for the quality of

also give the CQC the power to publish performance ratings on the
quality of social care provision, which will give the public a clear

wherever it arises—including situations where it arises by way
of foreign partnerships. Section 58 of Finance Act 2008 was enacted to
help put that beyond doubt and in so doing, made clear that a wholly
artificial tax avoidance scheme involving a foreign partnership
comprised of foreign trustees did not work. As section 58
retrospectively clarified existing legislation, its introduction had no

students studying for specific qualification aims. Alternative
providers were however asked to submit data to the Higher Education
Funding Council for England (HEFCE) on their 2013/14 recruitment plans.
The Department received this data on 5 November and concluded that some
of these plans were unaffordable, given the need to control public
spending. My officials have therefore written to the 23 alternative
providers that are expanding most rapidly to instruct them to recruit
no more students, unless those students are studying on degree courses,
which remain a priority. All other alternative providers are free to
continue to recruit students to all courses designated for student
support for the remainder of the 2013/14 academic year provided that
the number of students they recruit does not exceed their planned
