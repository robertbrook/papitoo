He quotes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:38:14"></hs_TimeCode> Sir
John Major; let me offer him a quote from Alan Milburn in November. In
responding to criticism about why the previous Government had not done
more to advance social mobility under their 13 years in office, he said
that it
is,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121759000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000207">“wrong

Government have introduced the pupil premium, which is targeted at
disadvantaged pupils; free childcare; and an increasing number of
apprenticeships. As for the noble Lord’s point about charity
status, that is for the Charity Commission. Of course, it has to
demonstrate that there is a public benefit to that status, and I know
that many independent schools take that very seriously and forge many
partnerships with schools in the state sector as
well.</hs_parafo>

Campbell-Savours (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister and,
indeed, the House and the whole country know that public schools are
not charities. Their existence and treatment as charities brings
charity law into disrepute. Why do we not end that arrangement, and if
we need to subsidise private education—many might well want
that; I do not know—transfer responsibility for subsidy from
charity law to the Finance Act? Then we can have a full debate in
Parliament, in the House of Commons when it is dealing with Finance Act
issues, on what that level of subsidy should
be.</hs_para>

Bates:</Member></B> The noble Lord raises an interesting point which
begs the question of why, if that was the key issue to be addressed,
his Government did not tackle that over their 13 years. The point is
that this is intergenerational; it stretches over a long time and the
solutions will take a long time coming. The problems have been a long
time coming, too, and this Government are focusing particularly on the
work of people such as Graham Allen on early intervention in
specialising and targeting the help at the poorer families to redress

which is that the route back into social

through the place of work. That is why we are opening up 1.5 million

people in government—principally the Deputy Prime
Minister—are focusing on how to make that more accessible

are encouraged to sign up and have fairer and more inclusive
recruitment policies. It has to be said that it is not just the

a gap between rural development programmes by encouraging applicants
who were originally considering applying for grants in 2014 to bring
these forward to 2013. The Forestry Commission is presently considering
applications to fund the planting of up to 2,600 hectares of woodland
in 2014. The current RDP has seen over 12,000 hectares of woodland
planted and funded through the English woodland grant scheme. Current
applications for planting in 2014 therefore represent an annual

companies, with a collective turnover of over £24

exceptional and indeed a mandated requirement of winning the

Government not wanting to move on the situation; it is that we have
concluded, as did the previous Government and Select Committees, that
there is a better way of resolving this. The noble Lord mentioned
fraud, but the Fraud Act 2006 is readily available. Local authorities
have by-laws already in existence, and those are precisely the by-laws

Patel (</B><B>CB</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for his reply. Dementia is the dreaded diagnosis, particularly for the
elderly, as it affects more than 5% of people over 65 and between 20%
and 40% of those aged over 85. Because of the increasing number of
elderly people, an increasing number of people are affected. I commend
the Government and congratulate them on taking the initiative at the G8
and particularly on involving the WHO, because now it will become a
global initiative. I have two questions. The first is about the funding
that the Government announced. There is a great deal of confusion. Is
it new money, money that has already been allocated to research or
money that the Department of Health is giving for better diagnosis of
dementia? Research on dementia must also focus more widely on
understanding the biology of the disease, the inflammatory process and
the epidemiology. Ring-fencing around a disease will not necessarily
get to the point that the Government wish to get to. Secondly, what
impact do the Government think the EU regulation on data protection
will have on dementia
research?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13121759000730" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000730">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> The noble Lord asked a number of questions. The
Government have stated an ambition to double research funding in
dementia. That will depend on the quality of the proposals that come
forward and on the rate of scientific progress. We very much hope that
arising out of the summit, momentum will be gained, not only in this
country but internationally. As regards the noble Lord’s second
question, we recognise how important this is for future dementia
research and I can tell him that the Government, through the Ministry
of Justice, are negotiating with member states in Europe and are aware
of the impact that the proposal would have on research. It is likely to
be some months before there is an agreed approach between member states
and the Commission, and the Parliament is unlikely to vote on the
proposal before 2015.</hs_para>

dementia, at least to a basic level, in a way that is appropriate to

proposals from other G8 countries, but I can tell the noble Baroness
that the summit was not the end of the story. The G8 countries will be
meeting throughout 2014 to build on and develop further agreements. We
have agreed to host the first legacy event on social-impact investment
in March next year. That will be followed by an event in Japan on what
new care and prevention models could look like, and by an event hosted
by Canada and France on how industry can harness academic research.
There will then be a meeting in the United States in February 2015. We
hope that the momentum generated by the summit will elicit the kind of

the increased incidence of dementia is a result of the fact that many
of us are living much longer than was the case in the past? Does he
further agree that there is clear research evidence to suggest that
continuing intellectual and physical activity, care and attention to
diet, and control of blood pressure can delay the onset of dementia in
many individuals, and that, as a consequence, once early dementia
appears, programmes to promote such physical and intellectual activity
are very valuable? In such programmes, volunteers play a very important

points. My department is looking at the role of volunteers in a number
of areas. He is right that increased age is the greatest predictor of
dementia. It has been estimated that delaying the onset of dementia by
two years could decrease the global disease burden by 22.8 million
cases by 2050. The point that the noble Lord makes is therefore well
made, and I have no doubt that there will be an increasing focus on
this over the coming

Butler-Sloss (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, it is with some regret that I
have not sought to remove the presumption from the wording of Clause
11, although I still think it is unfortunate. I recognise the good
intentions of the Government and their genuine desire to involve both
parents, and more often the father, in a continuing relationship with
the children after the separation of the parents. I entirely support
that important aspiration. A serious part of the parting of parents is
the failure of one parent, often the father, to have any future
relationship with his children, who are then brought up in a one-parent
family without the advantages of knowledge of and support by the absent
parent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:11:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000066">I
am, however, concerned about the message that separating parents may
receive from the current wording of Clause 11. Originally the heading
for this clause was “Shared parenting”. That heading,
thank goodness, was removed, but it had been picked up by the press,
and this clause may be seen by some as containing the right to equal
access to children. There is concern, not just on my part but on that
of many of the agencies, including the NSPCC, Barnardo’s and
Coram.</hs_para>

disproportion which is not appropriate for the welfare of the children.
We know from the Norgrove report of the fine line between children at
risk in the private law sector and those seriously at risk in public
law. The parents of some of those children at risk may well make their
decisions outside court. I want the weaker parent to have something in
statute to hold on to if
browbeaten.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000069">I
also worry about those who would go to court with an erroneous view of
what this clause actually means, and with an inbuilt sense of their

public come to terms with putting the welfare of their children first.

Childline and CAFCASS, who found themselves in that situation. They
often feel that they are at the centre of that battle and not
individuals themselves. I remember another famous quote that the noble
and learned Baroness, made at another time: we should never see
children as objects of concern but as subjects in their own right. When
parents haggle over children as property, it is our responsibility to
ensure that their welfare is seen to. What has happened in the outside
world is that in our attempt to focus, mainly on fathers, I have to
say—there is not a balance between mothers and fathers, but a
particular focus on the needs of fathers—we have lost some of
that understanding of welfare, and the press really believe that
fathers have had a bad
deal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:15:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000072">I
draw attention to a piece of research that was carried out recently by

courts are actively promoting involvement with the non-resident parent

further additional legislation. In 50% of all parental disputes
studied, the post court care arrangement included regular, overnight
contact allowing both parents to have involvement in the child’s
day to day routine. 25% of cases ended in daytime only contact with the

as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, pointed, out, our
great concern is for the families who do not go to court. Courts will
often find a good solution and be able to work through it. However,
there is sometimes a perception among families that there is a
presumption that children will be shared. I sometimes think of that
picture from the Old Testament of the child being held up by one leg
with the sword of Damocles held over it; it was the good parent who
said, “No, I don’t want my child to be shared”.
That is often what you find: it is the good parent who gives in and
gives the child to the other parent, because they want the best for
their child. It is therefore on that basis—and before my voice

Deech (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly in support of
the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, who knows more about
children’s law than practically anyone in this House. There is
one real problem after divorce, which is that fathers, for whom the
door is open, do not come and visit their children. We cannot do
anything much about that. The clause may give such absent fathers the
notion that they have rights but no responsibilities. If there is one
thing that our family courts have got right in recent years, it is the
welfare of the child. I very much hope that the House will listen to
the wisdom of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and
will let the courts get on with the good job that they have been doing

I made clear in Committee, I start from the position of sharing the
Government’s desire to enshrine in public policy the principle
of joint parental involvement in a child’s life, including after
separation. I argue that for most children, the paramount principle of
the 
<?notus-xml column=1146?>child’s welfare, as enshrined in the Children Act 1989, cannot be
fully met unless both parents are fully involved in the child’s
life and have a continuing relationship with the child. Perhaps
slightly differently to the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, I think that
there is an issue to be addressed here, particularly for fathers. I
agree with the Government that the principle of parental involvement
needs
strengthening.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000078">However,
if we agree—as I think we all do—that the paramount
consideration is the welfare of the child, and that this
principle should not be jeopardised or diluted, then we must also
ensure that the presumption in Clause 11 is not misinterpreted and
applied in ways that can be detrimental to children. Specifically,
Clause 11 must not send the signal that parental
involvement, which regrettably the Government initially called
“shared parental responsibility”, is taken to mean that
the child is divided according to some a priori formula, whether that
is 50-50 or something else. Clause 11 gives a right to the child to
expect continued meaningful involvement by both parents after
separation. It must not be interpreted as giving a right to both
parents for equal—or near equal—time with the child as
possible. I know that the Government’s Explanatory Notes make
clear their intentions. But there are a number of reasons why the
Minister must take seriously the possibility, indeed the likelihood, of
such
misinterpretation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000079">First,
the experience in Australia is that 65% of fathers interpreted
“shared parental responsibility” to mean equal time.
Litigation between parents increased as a result, and they had to
change the system. Secondly, as touched on by the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth: the
clause, unless it is qualified on the face of the Bill in the way that
this amendment seeks, could inadvertently increase the risk of harm to
children, because only 10% of separating couples resort to the courts
to resolve their contact disputes, with the majority of parents
reaching agreements privately. There is concern that if it is the
expectation of those parents that the law now says that the
child’s time has to be carved up, then some parents may seek to
use the new changes as a bargaining tool and put pressure on the other
parent into making contact arrangements which are not in the best
interests of the
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000080">Again,
evidence from Australia suggests that similar reforms resulted in an
increased reluctance for mothers to disclose abuse, for example, with
many feeling that if there is a legal presumption of shared contact,
there was little point in disclosing problems in the family. Given that
the vast majority of cases do not go to court, if as a result of Clause
11 there is a common perception that having the child’s time
shared out will be the norm in future, then even in families where
there is no abuse or there are not problems we may still see the
unintended consequence of nomadic arrangements, with a child moving
between homes in a way that we would all want to avoid for obvious
reasons. This would not be in the interests of most
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000081">Finally,
and very significantly, we have to respond strongly to those parts of
the media, which have promoted the interpretation which we are
discussing now, despite the best efforts of the Government. I do not
believe that any amount of communication or 
<?notus-xml column=1147?>clarification can shift this now. This is why Amendment 14 is
so necessary—the Government’s intention and
interpretation would be quite clearly on the face of the Bill, and
enshrined not in guidance but in
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000082">Last
night we received a policy statement from the Government about Clause
11 and Amendment 14. This makes clear the Government’s
intentions—it is not to promote a particular division of time,
but they feel that the most effective way of dealing with this is
through a wider communication strategy to explain to parents what the
interpretation is. This is wholly inadequate, for the reason I have
just expressed; this view is already well entrenched, partly because of
the initial nomenclature of shared parental responsibility and partly
because parts of the media have triumphantly proclaimed that this means
an equal proportion of the child’s time is to be spent with
father and mother. That view is now so well entrenched that I am very
concerned about the impact on expectations and, therefore, on
negotiations between parents, particularly those not going to court.
The most emphatic and unambiguous way of disabusing people of that
false impression is to put the amendment alongside Clause 11 into the
Bill. The Government will then have something in law that they can go
to town about in communications, explaining Amendment 14 if it became
part of the

would give either parent a belief that this is equal-time parenting or
anything else. It is still an attempt to encourage both parents to be
involved in the future of their children, but in a way that safeguards
the welfare of those
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>. As
noble Lords know, part of the aim of this policy is to address this
perception that the courts are biased against one parent, generally

just so that the record is absolutely straight, the Minister has
mentioned on two occasions the perception that fathers were not getting
the same sort of attention as mothers. Does he acknowledge that the
research carried out by CAFCASS and by Nuffield shows that that is a
perception and not an accurate procedure? If the noble Lord continues

she has said to heart; what I am trying to avoid is replacing one
perception with another. There is equal danger that, after a debate
such as this, another perception gets flagged. What I want is to
emphasise what is in the legislation and what is intended by the
legislation and to use all the means at our disposal to make sure that
that is fully understood by all the agencies involved and the widest
range of public opinion as possible. As my noble friend has indicated,
that also means that there is a certain sense of responsibility on the
part of the media in reporting the intentions of
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:33:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000091">When
a case is before the court, neither parent has a right to any specific
level of contact, direct or otherwise. The court must consider the
child’s welfare above all else and make its decision on that
basis, weighing up the evidence before it. That will continue to be the
case, and nothing in Clause 11 changes that. The wording of the clause
is deliberately neutral; it does not seek to pre-empt court decisions
and, as now, it gives courts the flexibility to determine the
arrangements that they believe are best for the child, taking account
of all the evidence before them. We think that that is the right

I agree wholeheartedly with those who have highlighted the need for a
clear understanding of the policy. The reality is that any
provision which impacts on parents and their private family
relationships is extremely sensitive. Even the wording of the amendment
could be misinterpreted in the media and give rise to unintended
consequences. There is no guarantee that it would not. For example, as
I said, a parent who already has very limited contact through no fault
of their own may interpret the wording as endorsing that position. Our
priority must be to draft legislation which achieves our intended
effect and to take other steps to communicate to society more widely
what that effect is. As I said, it is unlikely that separating couples
will look to the Children Act 1989 to try to predict the outcome of
their dispute. They will look for information online or talk to their
friends and family, to organisations which they trust or their legal
advisers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121759000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000093">The
Government’s “Sorting out separation” web app will
be the first port of call for many parents looking for information
about any aspect of separation and it will then signpost them to
further sources of help. The app itself will set out clear information

the change is not intended to be about the division of the

ensure that organisations with the Help and Support for Separated

that have this kitemark, including, for example, Relate. This means
that people accessing these websites will be able to click on a link
and access information on the web app. In addition, the minority of
separating parents who turn to the courts will need, first, to have
attended a MIAM, and they will be encouraged to find a different way of
resolving their dispute. Parents will be given information through all
these routes and through other services that they may engage

way to ensure an accurate understanding of the policy is for
the Government to work with organisations in the sector to develop

thanking him. I am particularly grateful to my noble friend Lady
Howarth, who has put right the perception that in some way the courts
are unfair to fathers. It is a perception which has, from the
beginning, been inaccurate. When I was President of the Family
Division, I went round the courts and made a lot of inquiries. After I
had retired, I was very grateful for the CAFCASS report, which
absolutely clarified what I had understood to be the case from judges
right across the country—that they try cases fairly and that
there is no prejudice against fathers.</hs_para>

understand why the Minister thinks that what I think is a very modest
amendment for clarification is going to be widely misinterpreted and
somehow bring back the situation before Clause 11 was put
forward. I take issue with him on one point. He talks about going to
legal advisers. How many people in this country have the money to go to
legal advisers if they do not have legal aid? It is this Government who
have taken legal aid away from private law cases. When he talks about
going to legal advisers, it will be a very small minority of that very
small minority who actually fight cases who will get to lawyers at all.
They may or may not go on the web and they may or may not read what I
consider to be the excellent advice that the Government give. They will
look at what the press has said and, despite the wonderfully
impassioned suggestion of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, may or may
not choose to take any interest in this particular debate, and may

must say that I worry about ordinary people on the ground who cannot
get on and decide to separate. I sometimes used to say to warring
parents, “You are the last people who should be making decisions
about your own children because you cannot think straight about what is
happening next”. Those are people—without legal advice,
lawyers in court or probably ever going to court—where
one of them will be dominating the 
<?notus-xml column=1151?>other and the arrangements for the children will be unsatisfactory and,
in some cases, positively dangerous. All I am asking for is some
clarification, particularly for a mother because there may well be a
more dominant father, although there can be a dominant mother. I have
certainly seen dominant mothers and not only in the American press. It
is possible that the mother or father who is not the dominant parent

statistics about families that we have heard today seem to confirm
that. For example, the Centre for Social Justice has recently
calculated that family breakdown is now costing this country £46
billion a year—more than the defence budget. According to the
Office for National Statistics, the proportion of children born to
unmarried mothers last year hit a record 47.5%: that is, very nearly
half. Almost half of all marriages, as well as a huge number of
informal parenting partnerships, now end in divorce or separation.
According to the Marriage Foundation, only 50% of children born today
will be living with both their parents on their 16th birthday. What are
known as “four-by-four families” are increasingly
becoming a problem for schools in some disadvantaged areas. In case any
noble Lords do not know what a “four-by-four family” is,
it is a mother with four children by four different
fathers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000103">Every

Amendment 15 simply suggests that the Government should be more
transparent in the way that they define the responsibilities of
parenthood—and, perhaps more particularly, the duties of
fathers. It may be that marriage as we know it has or will become
optional, but I suggest that parental commitment cannot be optional,
because it is a duty to the child. It can be avoided only by providing
adequate alternative stability and loving care. To provide non-parental
alternative stability and loving care for a child is not easy. It can
be expensive unless the family is prepared to step in. A much better
solution must surely be to help more parents to find fulfilment in
raising their own child and to help parents do the job well by
adequately preparing them for it before they start having children. Not
having children may become a desirable option for some, but these
things are not going to happen unless all young adults are
aware of how much their child needs their love and care, and of the
stability of growing up in a supportive
family.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000105">Amendment
15 suggests that a change in the wording of the law could make it
clearer to all parents how important they are to their children. Since
Grand Committee, I have had a very helpful meeting with the noble Lord,
Lord McNally, on this subject. I also want to thank Relate, which has
kindly prepared for me a very useful report on the current position of
the definition of parental responsibilities and duties in the law, in
this country and in other European countries. I think that all 29
countries that it examined realise that it is a difficult area for law,
but few if any European countries have a less helpful definition than
ours.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000106">Undoubtedly,

<?notus-xml column=1156?>Lord McNally, suggested that the Government may be
able to come forward with other proposals to encourage responsible and
committed parenting that might be even more effective than changing the
law as it defines the duties of a parent. If the Government are able to
achieve that objective without changing the law, I accept that that may

Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as a trustee
of the Marriage Foundation. I express my admiration for the tenacity of
the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in pursuing this difficult, worrying
and extremely important issue. Parenting must be a matter of
responsibility rather than rights; that point needs to be put
forward again and again in every single place where it can possibly be
put. The admirable proposals that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, put
in Amendment 15 ought to be placed somewhere by the Government. Whether
they should be in primary legislation, I am not convinced, but
certainly they should be in guidance and, possibly, in part of the pack
given to parents when they separate so that they can recognise their
responsibilities after separation. I should like to see this sort of
thing in libraries, as part of the school pack in the sixth form and in
sixth form colleges, and in universities and colleges of further
education. The duties of parents
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:05:35"></hs_TimeCode>that the noble
Lord, Lord Northbourne, has set out here should be part of what all

have in their

ought to stop talking about the rights of parents and start talking
about the responsibilities referred to in the Children Act, and also
about duties. It is interesting that the word “duty” is
almost never used, but it is as important today as it was in the 19th
century. It is time we started to use it again. I express again my
admiration for the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and I hope that what

quite the right place to put across this very important
message. I agree with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, that it is important to emphasise at every opportunity
that this is about parental responsibilities rather than rights. That

it at the new-parent stage, at the education stage and especially in
the various advice and guidance packs that are 
<?notus-xml column=1157?>available for separating parents. It has a lot to

be looking at this matter more fully, I suggest as a footnote to this
discussion that he might look at the Family Law (Scotland) Act—I
think I have the correct name of the Act, although I cannot give the
date. The introductory text to that Act makes exactly the point the
noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is making. It talks about the
responsibilities of the parent to the child. The following section I
think uses the word “rights”, but it is talking about the
child’s rights rather than those of the parents. It is the
counterpart to responsibilities. It has been set out in primary
legislation, I think on the recommendation of the Scottish Law
Commission, that it is a useful checklist of the corresponding rights
of the child, but particularly of the responsibilities that rest upon
the parent throughout the child’s childhood. The Minister might
find this piece of comparative law

While I probably agree that the Bill is not the right place for these

in your Lordships’ House and what was then the new Labour
Government had brought in something called citizenship. It generated a
lot of excitement because it would obviously have been a good place in
which to put over the responsibilities of parents. Alas, it never
happened, because citizenship got whizzed all over the place.</hs_para>

my views over time on PHSE. That also could be used rather more

emphasise the point that the earlier you can work with children on what

will it prepare them for being better parents but it might also help
them be rather better sisters and brothers, if they are living in

inspect prisons in Kenya on an extradition case. I was very struck that
as we went inside each prison, there was a large board that was
published by the Human Rights Commission of Kenya, listing the rights
of prisoners and, underneath them, a list of their responsibilities.
Reflecting on what my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss said,
I remember seeing in a young offender establishment in Belfast the most
imaginative course that I have seen for young people, which was called
“Learning to live alone”. In addition to all the
practical things that it taught them, parenting skills were in there. I
remember being very taken by the fact that the question of rights and
responsibilities was used in that course to educate them in their
responsibility as parents. It was very well and admirably done, because
it was not overdone; one 
<?notus-xml column=1158?>has to be terribly careful about preaching to the young. The sooner that
one can start getting the idea of parental responsibility out while
people are at school, rather than waiting until they become parents,
the better.</hs_para>

one point that I wish to make, which follows on from what has already
been said by more than one contributor to this debate, relates to

of their children, and indeed of contact with them. A huge campaign,
which I think is very misinformed, has been fought over the years, and
I know many judges who have suffered considerably on account of the
malicious attitudes of people in that connection. The point that I wish
to make is the obvious one: we should be thinking all the time of those
hundreds of thousands, possibly millions, of fathers who have no
interest whatever in maintaining any relationship with their children.
As a circuit judge sitting in family matters, I felt that if there was
a magic wand that one could wave to bring about a better situation in
the family context, it would be someone to inculcate those people with

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, all the contributions that have been
made share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that it is
important that children have appropriate support and guidance as they
go through life, and as they themselves become parents. I do
not think that there is disagreement here, although I think that a
number of noble Lords caveated their support for the noble Lord with
the same doubt that I have over whether what he seeks to do is
necessarily best done in primary legislation.</hs_para>

points that have been raised colour this debate. I fully agree with the
noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, among

certainly take the suggestion made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Hope of Craighead, about looking at family law in Scotland and how it
deals with the matter. In my period in this job, I have been advised
that “They do this better in Scotland” on a number of
occasions. I must be careful that I do not influence decisions yet to

other’s experiences, and I will certainly do that.</hs_para>

getting the balance between rights and responsibilities and duties
right. This House may perhaps sometimes seem fuddy-duddy to a younger 
<?notus-xml column=1159?>generation, but one of its jobs is to remind our citizens about their
duties as well as their rights and responsibilities and it is in that
mood that I respond to this debate. No one would disagree with the aim
of this amendment, but there may be differing views on how best to
respond to the challenge. Parental responsibility is a fundamental
concept in the Children Act 1989 and refers to all the rights, duties
and responsibilities of parents towards their children. Case law has
established a clear understanding of what that means. A parent’s
responsibility for protecting and maintaining their child is considered
to be among the most important components of parental responsibility.
So, too, is having contact with the
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000122">However,
what parental responsibility means in practice, and how it is exercised
in practice, will be linked to the circumstances of the individuals
concerned. For example, a parent who for many possible reasons does not
have contact with a child is unlikely to be able to exercise parental
responsibility in the same way as the parent who lives with the child.
Any further definition of what is meant by parental responsibility
would erode the courts’ flexibility to determine what parental
responsibility amounts to in individual cases in a way that moves with
the times. No evidence has been put forward to suggest that the
existing definition is problematic, and we have had no indications from
the judiciary, which applies the definition routinely in family
proceedings, that change is needed.</hs_para>

with the noble Lord’s objective, I am not persuaded that this is

ways in which we are doing this. I summarised them in a recent letter
to the noble Lord, which was copied to others who spoke on this debate

number of organisations whose projects support parents and families in
a variety of ways. As part of this, we are funding One Plus One to run
a series of campaigns to promote relationship support targeting young
people and new parents in particular so that they see accessing
relationship support as a normal thing to do to strengthen their
relationship, rather than at crisis points. The family nurse
partnership programme, funded by the Department of Health, is a
licensed programme for vulnerable first-time young mothers. It works
with young parents on attachment, relationships and psychological
preparation for parenthood through intensive and structured home
visiting delivered by specially trained nurses from early pregnancy

my noble friend Lady Tyler about the important role of schools. All
schools are required to provide a balanced and broadly based curriculum

including academies through their funding arrangement, to have regard
to the Secretary of State’s <I>Sex and Relationship Education

achieving the objective we hope. I wonder if we could not perhaps
rethink how we approach this issue. Instead of telling young people
what they should not do, why do we not make them feel good about doing
what they should do—proud to be a father, proud to be a good

31 is usually referred to as the threshold provision. Section 1 sets
out the welfare principle, and it is at the welfare stage that the
court decides, after a full hearing on all the facts, what is in the
best interests of the child in question. The fact that the threshold
stage is satisfied in any particular case does not mean that a child
will necessarily be taken into care. Conversely, if the threshold test
is not satisfied, the court has no power to make an order under Section
1 and the child will remain at risk, if there is a

are the relevant provisions. How then have they worked in practice?
Where a child has been seriously injured while in the care of its
parents, it may be taken into care without the court having to decide
whether it was the father or the mother who inflicted the
injury—let us call that child, child A. The difficulty arises
when the father and the mother split up. Let us suppose that the father
goes to live with another woman who already has a child—let us
call it child B —about the same age as child A. If the local
authority has proved on a balance of probabilities that it was the
father who injured child A, child B may be taken into care, depending
on what is in the best interests of that child. The threshold in that
case will have been passed. However, it often happens that the father
and the mother each blame the other for the injury to child A and, as a
result, the court cannot decide at the threshold stage where the truth
lies. One very experienced judge, Mr Justice Wall, later to become
President of the Family Division, described this as a commonplace
occurrence. In a very recent case, Re J, the Supreme Court has decided
that if at the threshold stage it cannot be decided whether it was the
father or the mother who injured child A, child B will remain at risk

noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale, who gave the leading judgment in
that case, went on to say that such cases are of “vanishing
rarity”. I am not sure why she should have made that point. She
cannot surely have been saying that because such cases are so rare it
does not matter if an occasional child is left at risk. But, whatever
the reason, it is on this point that I would respectfully disagree with
her and for a number of
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000134">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:24:41"></hs_TimeCode>
the first place, if cases in which the court cannot reach a decision at
the threshold stage are as rare as all that, why have they caused so
much concern? That they have caused concern is not, I think, in doubt.

of an earlier observation made by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Hale, in a case called S-B, a case on very similar facts in which she
held that the threshold had not been crossed. Once again, the noble and
learned Baroness described that case as being one of “vanishing
rarity”. Again, if that be so, why did the local authority in
the more recent case, Re J, go to the length of constructing an
artificial case, which it did, in order to challenge the decision in
S-B? Why did it take that case all the way to the Supreme Court to test
that very point? It simply does not make sense. The answer must surely
be because cases such as S-B and Re J are not as rare as the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Hale, had in mind and because the decisions in
S-B and Re J have caused real concern among local authority social
workers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000135">Secondly,
I turn to the Government’s approach. On 25 November the three of
us—one of whom cannot be here today—had a useful meeting
with the Bill team, for which we are very grateful. In a
letter dated 29 November it was said that the Government could find no
evidence that social workers were in any way concerned about the
present state of the law. That letter was followed up by a letter of 4
December, in which the Government quoted the views of the Association
of Directors of Children’s Services that it does not recognise
Re J as having caused concern among social workers and it is unaware of
any problem in this
field<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:30:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121759000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000229">4.30

Government’s case in response to the amendment —so far as
I know, it is the only response—is that there is nothing here to
worry about. That approach is impossible to reconcile with the evidence
of John Hayes QC, leading counsel specialising in the field of child
protection. I have a copy of the opinion dated 12 December in
case anybody would like to see it. He describes the views expressed in
the letters written on behalf of the Government as very surprising. In
his experience and that of his colleagues working in the field, the two
decisions to which I referred have indeed caused considerable concern
to local authority social workers. He quotes chapter and verse, which I

I must refer to the judgment of Lord Justice McFarlane in the Court of
Appeal in Re J. As the House will know, he is a very experienced judge
in the Family Division. He gave the leading judgment in the Court of
Appeal in Re J, with which the noble and learned Lords, Lord Judge and
Lord Neuberger, both agreed. The judgment is 30 pages long, so I will
not read it to your Lordships—but I have read it myself, and I
have reread it many times, with increasing admiration. There is no
doubt that, unlike the Association of Directors of Children’s
Services, Lord Justice McFarlane does see a real problem here. There is
no doubt that he would have allowed the appeal of the local authority
in Re J if he had not been constrained, as he was, by the decision of
the Supreme Court in S-B, the case to which I have already

on the evidence, I have made such inquiries as I can of the judges who
decide such cases at the threshold stage. How often does it happen in
practice that, on the evidence available at that stage, it cannot

uncommon. It is certainly not vanishingly
rare<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:33:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I accept,
of course—indeed, I am greatly reassured—that in most
cases the judge will be able to decide, by taking other factors into
account, whether it was the father or the mother. But there will
undoubtedly be some cases in which the judge simply cannot decide at
the threshold stage. It is the purpose of this amendment to cater for
those cases and it does so by enabling the case to proceed as smoothly
as possible to a full hearing on the facts at the welfare

must now refer, as briefly as I can, to some of the points made in
Grand Committee. In replying to the debate the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, was concerned that the amendment would enable the local
authority to make a case on the ground that the father might have
inflicted the injury—in other words, on the ground, as he put
it, of unsubstantiated suspicion. I cannot stress strongly enough that
that is not the object of this amendment, and nor would that be its
effect. The amendment would apply only where the father was one of two
people who did inflict the injury, which is a very different
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:35:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000140">The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, made the point that Section 31 has
stood the test of time, and I agree. But why has it stood the test of
time? The answer is because, until very recently, courts up and down
the country have followed the guidance given by Mr Justice Wall, as he
then was, in 1998, before he became President of the Family Division,
in a case called CB. That guidance was approved by the noble and
learned Lord, Lord
Nicholls<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:35:38"></hs_TimeCode>, in the
House of Lords in a case called Re O that was decided in
2004. That guidance worked very well until very recently when the noble
and learned Baroness, Lady
Hale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>, threw
doubt upon it in Re S-B and until in Re J the Supreme Court went
further and disapproved that
guidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:36:12"></hs_TimeCode>. The
purpose of this amendment is to restore the position as it was before
Re J. It is therefore in no sense a leap in the dark. If John Hayes,
the learned Queen’s Counsel, is right in paragraph 19 of his
opinion social workers will breathe a sigh of relief if this amendment
is accepted and will know definitely where they
are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:36:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000141">Finally,
and with apologies, I must refer to the speech of my noble and learned
friend Lady Butler-Sloss. She made much of the point in Re J that it
was a decision of seven judges, two of whom have great experience in
this field, and that they were all, as she put it, absolutely
unanimous. I agree of course that they all reached the same result.
However, the point would perhaps have somewhat more force if they had
all given the same reasons. They did not. One of the judges, Lord
Wilson, who has great experience in this field, disagreed with the
others, and three of the judges, led by Lord Reed, expressed their
concern that the law in this field had become so complicated but said
that it was now too late for the Supreme Court to do anything about it.
It cannot, I think, be said that the trumpet in Re J has given a very
certain sound. Be that as it may, what is certain is that there is a
real problem here which needs to be solved, and solved urgently. The
purpose of this amendment is to do just that. I beg to

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, I
supported this amendment in Grand Committee, and having added my name
to it, I support it again today. I stress again today, as I did in
Committee, that this is a threshold provision—that is
fundamental. That provision dictates just when the court gets
jurisdiction to deal with a case. The situation is identified in the
proposed amendment and has been explained by the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Lloyd. The question is, when an adult who is caring for a
child is the possible perpetrator of the death of or serious injury to
another child, does the court have the power to deal with the case? Has
the threshold been
crossed?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000143">That
is a very different question—and this is also
crucial—from asking whether a care order or a supervision order
should then be made. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of
Clashfern, said in Committee that it would be “quite
unfair” to take someone’s child into care merely because
another person who has come to join that family is a possible
perpetrator of another child’s harm. I entirely agree with him
on that. But as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, noted in

it is now suggested by some that there is no real need for this

that I ever practised in the field of family law, so I can claim no
personal experience of the problem resulting from Re J. But having read
and reread more than once the very full counsel’s opinion by a
Queen’s Counsel specialising in this area of work—an
opinion to which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has already
referred, and which he yesterday copied to many of those who were to
take part in this debate—it is difficult to see how the present
interpretation of the Children Act 1989 could be thought not
to cause concern. It is all very well to say, as has been said, that
Section 31 has stood the test of time. As has been pointed out, Section
31 only received its present interpretation in the 2009 case of Re S-B.
It was that interpretation by which all seven members of the Supreme
Court understandably felt themselves bound in Re J last

the circumstances of the case and decide whether, in those

harm and the importance for the child and the rest of the family of not
removing that child from the family home on insufficient evidence. In
the case that precipitated this amendment, as the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, pointed out, the seven members of the
Supreme Court were in fact unanimous on this issue although they
disagreed on some less important points, as I would respectfully call
them. They decided on the balance of the bare facts of the case that
they were against the removal of the children and that the threshold
had not been crossed. Put at its simplest, this is a question of
whether you remove a child on suspicion or go to the welfare stage on
suspicion or whether you have to have evidence before you cross the

suggest that this House should be cautious, when seven judges have said

length the two cases that I think are relevant, because we go back to
1996—we do not start in 2009—but it is probably
unnecessary. However, it was unrealistic for the Supreme Court to be
given the one bare fact and not the surrounding circumstances, although
it was undoubtedly intentional. In my experience of 26 years sitting as
a family judge, 15 of them spent hearing this sort of case—many
children who died and many who were seriously injured—as well as
eight years spent hearing them on appeal, then going back to hearing
them again as a first-instance judge, I do not remember a single case
where this bare fact was the only point that the court had to deal
with. So I believe that the cases are rare, although I entirely accept
what the noble and learned Lord says—that even the rare cases,
naturally, have to be protected. But if there is nothing but suspicion,

be able to enter the house or make the proper investigations. With the
person, P, having been in a pool of possible perpetrators of
the death or injury of a child—in the particular case of J, the
child aged, I think, three weeks died of asphyxia but also had terrible
injuries—the social services, if they had been alerted that P
was in a new family, would see that as a highly relevant factor and
naturally very worrying. The local authority has a duty under 
<?notus-xml column=1167?>Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare
of children in the area who are in need. It is almost certain that the
sole fact available, that P had been in a pool of perpetrators,
would trigger immediate action by a local
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121759000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121759000163">Under<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>
Section 47(1)(b), a local authority in circumstances such as these
would have a duty to make inquiries. A social worker would investigate
and be likely to visit the family. If the inquiries are frustrated by
access to the children being unreasonably refused, there may therefore
be grounds for seeking an emergency protection order under Section
44(1)(b) or (a), for possible removal of the children from the home

interim care order from a family judge under Section 38(2) in respect
of the children. It would not look well to the judge if the parents
refused access to the children; that would be a major marker against
what was going on in the family. The children might be taken into
interim care but, in the case of J, the mother very properly left the

period leading to the substantive care hearing, the family would no
doubt be examined in depth. At the main hearing, P would clearly have
to give evidence and be cross-examined as to what happened in the first
family when the child was injured and died. She—it was a woman
in that case—and J would be cross-examined up hill and down dale
as to why she had not protected the child, whether she was actually the
perpetrator, why she had not seen the injuries to the child, what she
was doing while this child was being hurt, and whether she covered up
for the other parent. Those are terribly relevant factors and, I would
suggest, relevant factors to crossing the threshold if she gave
unsatisfactory answers and if she was not believed by the judge. There
would be assessment reports from the social worker, and of course the
guardian would give his or her own report on the
family’s position. All the circumstances would be very carefully

having been in the pool but not having been proved to be the

and the judge would not make a care order or some other order excluding
P from the care of the children. That is the point at which, if you do

very grateful to my noble and learned friend for giving me the
opportunity to read the opinion of John Hayes. Of course, I respect his
experience as an advocate in care proceedings but I disagree with his
conclusions. Perhaps I may make a number of points on his opinion. He
talks about a case of twins where the unharmed twin would be in danger
if not removed from the family where the first child had been injured.
In that case, the unharmed child would certainly be removed. However,
we are considering a new family where one adult member is a possible
perpetrator but there is now a new family unit with an adult against
whom there are no allegations at all. It may also be relevant that in
the J case the injuries perpetrated on the child took place seven or
eight years before, and undoubtedly P would have matured. I believe
that in that case she was extremely young—16 or 17
years old. She was in a much more stable and supportive
environment and therefore might not pose a
threat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:57:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

made by Mr Hayes, if a local authority becomes aware that a possible
perpetrator is in the new family, I have no doubt that it will issue
the proceedings even if there are no other concerns, and I am surprised
to hear John Hayes say something to the contrary. I do not believe that
the judge at the interim care stage would dismiss the proceedings
before having the opportunity to see all the reports and examine all
the evidence. If counsel for the parents applied at the interim
directions stage to have the case dismissed, I would be equally
surprised if the judge dismissed the case before the full hearing. I
certainly would not have done that because I would have been worried.
Of course, you would be worried until all the facts were in front of
you. I would hope that the child’s guardian would look at the
best interests of the child in the broadest sense and take into account
the need for a balance between protection and the right of the child to
have a normal life with the natural family.
Interestingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:58:29"></hs_TimeCode>,
Mr Hayes talks about the balance between protection of the child and
the rights of the parents to have a family life. For goodness’
sake, the right of the child to have a family life is much more
important than the right of the child’s parents. What we have
here is a balance between protection and the right to family
life.</hs_para>

coin is the real danger that, if this amendment is passed, children may
be permanently removed from their parents, their homes, their schools
and their friends on a suspicion that the person concerned was in the

Deech:</Member></B> My Lords, I have grappled long and hard with this
tricky issue. I should like to reduce it to three brief propositions,
which have led me to agree with the noble and learned Lords, Lord Lloyd
and Lord Brown. First, it is sadly too frequent that we do not know
which of two parents may have harmed  
<?notus-xml column=1169?>a child. Each blames the other; it is not provable;
and one of them goes on to form another family. There must, therefore,
be some danger because the parent either did it or stood by while it
happened. Secondly, we are talking about only reaching a threshold. It
is not a question of leaping to the conclusion that the child must be
removed. It simply triggers the ability of the courts and social
workers to investigate what is going on. Thirdly, there is absolutely
no possibility of harm ensuing from the amendment put forward by the
noble and learned Lords, whereas there is a distinct possibility of
harm if this amendment is not agreed. A number of distinguished
academics have written with great alarm calling for a change in the
current situation and in support of the amendment moved by the noble
and learned Lord, Lord
Lloyd<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:00:47"></hs_TimeCode>, with

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I find myself in a
maelstrom of lawyers with no voice. My position is that we been asking
two questions which do not necessarily have the same answer.
When I read the response from the department about this
proposal, it became clear that we are considering two different issues.
One is whether a local authority has enough powers to move into a
family and take action if it believes that there is significant harm or
the likelihood of significant harm. Of course, the ADSS and everyone
else will say that they do have enough powers because that is clearly
so. The criticism comes when local authorities do not move when they
have that

question we are considering is when two people have been in a situation
where a child has been harmed. Perhaps I may put a bracket around that
thought for a moment while we remind ourselves of the time
when, if a child was murdered and you could not prove which of two
people had done it, both were acquitted. There was a huge campaign by
the NSPCC to ensure that that could not happen; that is, if a child was
dead and clearly it was one person or the other, both people
involved were likely to find themselves found guilty until such time as
there was greater clarification. We can close the bracket there and
say, “Here we are: we find ourselves in a situation where there
are two people involved, someone has committed harm and maybe killed
the
child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:02:48"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Recently, I spoke to a serious lawyer and a previous Attorney-General,
who I probably should not name at the moment, who said, “If
there is the slightest margin that there is a risk that the child might
end up dead, what action do you take?</hs_para>

noble friend Lady Deech has made the speech which I would have liked to
have made. She has made important points. This amendment will do no
harm. This afternoon, your Lordships have had a real seminar on Section
31 of the Children Act and the level of thresholds. It is important
that we take action that protects children if it does no harm. I am
more concerned that action is not taken by local authorities than that
they are likely to whip children into care. To use a word we heard
earlier, the “presumption” that local authorities take
children into care wantonly is just not true. In fact, it is very
difficult to get your child into care if you want
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:04:06"></hs_TimeCode>. A great deal

very reluctantly to oppose the amendment. No one could be
fuller of admiration and respect for my noble and learned
friend, Lord Lloyd, who moved the amendment, but it is right to say a
few words because this is not just a point for lawyers. It is a point
of enormous importance. It is a terrible thing if a child is taken by
the state away from his parent or parents on inadequate grounds on the
basis of suspicion that is unfounded. It is also a terrible thing if
the child is not protected against abuse in the home. There will always
be cases in which it is hugely difficult for the courts to

Lordships’ House in its judicial capacity or by the Supreme
Court. It is not correct that the case of Re J has suddenly plunged the

sad case, as so many of them are. I will say a word about that and

child A died of serious non-accidental injuries at the age of only
three weeks. That led to proceedings in relation to child B, who was

complicated situation indeed, and it was children C, E and F in

appeared to be in a stable relationship, but in the proceedings
relating to the death of child A and the future welfare of child B, the
family judge said, almost in terms, that it was unnecessary to decide

the background to the later child proceedings in relation to child C,

to the Supreme Court as Re J. They took an extraordinary course, as my
noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss mentioned, in that the local
authority, for reasons best known to itself for which it no doubt
sincerely thought good, decided that the case should be tried solely on
the fact that the mother had been a possible perpetrator of the
fatal injuries to child A, without letting in any other facts at all.
That was the remarkable feature of Re J, which was the subject of
considerable adverse comment in the Court of Appeal, in which my noble

not a particularly bright idea at this time in the afternoon, but I
declare an interest as I was a member of the Court of Appeal that
decided, when we decided it, the case of J. The case was brought to us
so that the threshold test could be clarified: that was the only
purpose of it. It was brought by a local authority, deliberately
focusing on the single fact of possible perpetration and
omitting any other consideration, so that the issue could go to the
Supreme Court and that five previous decisions of the House of Lords
could be analysed once more. We followed the previous decisions of the
House of Lords and immediately gave leave for appeal to the Supreme
Court—a very unusual step for the Court of Appeal to
take—because it had to be addressed in that court.</hs_para>

that an individual living in a household in which a child or children
have been killed or seriously injured was one of the possible
perpetrators of the injuries, but the evidence is not sufficiently
clear for the court to identify who is actually responsible, where does
that leave us? It leaves us with the possibility that the individual
was, indeed, responsible for the death or those injuries or some of
them. That seems to me to be a stark fact, but there is a further
consideration. Often the ill treatment has been repeated; these awful
occasions are not, generally speaking, a one-off. Generally, what you
have is a series of repeated assaults on the child that culminate in an
attack in which the child sustains fatal injuries. J was such a case.

in many of these cases, although not all of them, the person who has
not actually caused any injury has undoubtedly been aware of the fact
that the child has been suffering. It is not just that the child
cries—we all know that babies whinge and cry, some more than
others—but this was a child with evidence on its little body of
injury. Indeed, although these cases are largely confined to the family
court, one needs to stand back and wonder why on earth criminal
prosecutions under the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act are not
undertaken—not simply to establish who is guilty of the murder
or manslaughter, but, where the evidence is uncertain, to demonstrate
that both, on any view, are culpable in the sense that they have
allowed the child to be bullied and abused in the way that has
culminated in its death. If there had been a criminal prosecution and a
conviction, it would not have occurred to anyone to say, “Oh
well, that conviction is irrelevant to the threshold test that the
family court has to ask in relation to another case”.</hs_para>

combinations of events like those that have happened, it seems to me

should be allowed to be tested by reference to all 
<?notus-xml column=1173?>the relevant evidence. If all the relevant evidence
reveals that the threshold test should be passed, then you move on to

Hope of Craighead:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that I may be forgiven
for adding one more lawyer’s speech to those which have already
been given, and particularly that the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth,
will forgive me for doing this. My reason for wanting to speak is that
I presided over the case of In re J in the Supreme Court. I think that
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, expressed great concern that
the issue was being brought before the courts on a hypothesis; I think
I am right in saying that he said that it is not the business of the
court to judge hypothetical cases. We took the view that we should
decide the case on the material that we were given, but it is right to
stress, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale, stressed, that
the situation we were presented with was highly artificial in order to
test one particular point: whether the “sole fact”, as it
is put in the noble and learned Lord’s amendment, was enough to
cross the
threshold.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000006">I
do not want to add anything to the clear description which the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, gave us as to what the
case of In re J was all about, but I should like to say briefly why I
join with the noble and learned Baroness in resisting the amendment. In
my case, it is particularly on account of its wording, given the use of
“sole fact” and the reference to “real
possibility”. My objections can be summarised on three simple
grounds: first, the amendment as it stands is wrong in principle;
secondly, when you look at the structure of the statute it is
unnecessary; and, thirdly, from the point of view of family life in
circumstances that are quite likely to occur, it could indeed be
damaging.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000007">First,
on the principle, I respectfully suggest that the golden rule is that a
prediction of future harm has to be based on facts which have been
proved on a balance of probabilities. It is only then that the state
would be justified in removing a child from the family; in our
democratic society, it is not enough that there should be suspicion. It
has to be based on proof, so the state should be required to
demonstrate that it has real and current concerns about the
child’s safety before the child is taken into care. I appreciate
that I am moving through all sorts of stages in making that
proposition, but that is the background to the point I wish to make. I
stress that if we look at the wording of Section 31(2) of the Children
Act, which we do not have on the paper before us, when it states that a
child may be taken into care only
if,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121770000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000132">“the

think the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood,
accepted, the amendment has the effect of lowering the threshold to
some degree. It assumes that the state cannot prove that the carer in
question was the perpetrator—that all it can prove is that she
was a possible perpetrator—and that that bald fact is all that
can be done. Even allowing for the 
<?notus-xml column=1174?>point at the end of the proposed amendment, that
this is a “real possibility” and something that cannot
sensibly be ignored, I suggest that we are still below the threshold
which Section 31(2) sets.</hs_para>

it is important to appreciate that the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Hale, was not saying that the problem which the amendment is addressing
is rare in itself. She was not saying, I think, that it is rare for two
people in the situation in which the carer in this case was placed to
blame each other, so that the court is unable to decide between the
two. What she was saying was extremely rare was the situation which the
court was being presented with: that this was the sole fact. As she put
it in her judgment, the issue hardly ever comes before the court at the
threshold stage packaged in that way. The point which she was making,
and which one can see by studying the structure of the Children Act, is
that in Part V, and in particular in Section 47, powers are available
to the local authority to make inquiries and, if it is thwarted, to
take further steps which may ultimately lead to an emergency protection
order being applied for and so on, as the noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Butler-Sloss, explained to us.</hs_para>

there was a difference of view as to whether the sole fact which has
been referred to was relevant at all. In my judgment, I used the words
“relevant” and “sufficient” to try to
explain the difference of view. Lord Wilson and Lord Sumption said that
it was not relevant at all; the rest of us said that the fact of the
possible perpetration was relevant and could not be ignored, but it is
not enough and is not sufficient to cross the threshold and therefore
something more must be

problem with the amendment is that it has absolutely no context
attached to it. The sole possibilities are stated in the amendment in
the starkest possible terms. However, as soon as you start to examine a
particular case—as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, did
when he talked about the number of injuries inflicted in that tragic
period of three weeks—you are adding something that is not in
the amendment. Indeed, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said
that the amendment is dealing with the situation of two possible
perpetrators only, but it does not actually say that. It just says
“a possible perpetrator”. As soon as you begin to make
inquiries and search around, you are going to add things in which begin
to build up a context which the social worker will be able to put
together before the threshold stage has to be crossed when the case is
brought into court. My objection to the amendment is really that: that
it does not give you any context at all. Surely, that is taking the
matter too

third and final point is the risk of damage. Let us contemplate a
situation which is not far removed from the situation of In re J, where
the woman—and let us take the woman because it was the woman in
In re J—is living in an abusive relationship. That was indeed
the case here because she had separated from the previous partner
because he was violent to her repeatedly and eventually she left him.
All sorts of reasons can be imagined why she did not blame him. She may
have been under pressure from him. She decides to create a new life for
herself, as indeed she 
<?notus-xml column=1175?>was doing in In re J, making a relationship with
somebody who is absolutely blameless, who has children of his own
already. There she is, now in family with him with a further child of

concern is that, if the amendment is passed in its stark form, it holds
a threat over that relationship from the very beginning. There must be
a question about, “Is it wise for me to enter into this
relationship? Am I always going to be at risk of being before the court
for a full threshold inquiry, simply because of what happened in the
past?” The amendment pays no regard to the length of time that
may have elapsed between the incident when the perpetration occurred
and the moment at which the inquiry is being initiated. Without
elaborating further, it is the starkness of the amendment, which lowers
the threshold, that is a cause for real
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000014">I
wrote to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, with a suggestion
about how one might approach the problem—because I do
appreciate that there is a problem—by suggesting that, without
using the word “sole”, one might be able to reassure
social workers that this factor is relevant, which I believe firmly
would be the case. If an amendment were to be framed which made that
point and put it beyond doubt, then I would be entirely happy and I
hope very much that it would reassure social workers. However, the
amendment as phrased goes far too far and is too stark and for that
reason I support the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, in

Kennedy of The Shaws (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, oppose the

mentioned the difficulty where there is background of abuse against the
mother of the child. I have been involved in cases where that has been
the situation. That can often be the reason why a woman at trial does
not testify, or at the police station does not give an account, of what
has happened at the hands of her abusive partner who has also abused
her child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000016">I
was glad to hear the discussion that has just taken place, but my
concern is the narrowness of the drafting. Before any judgment was
made, I would want to be sure that one was able to explore the context

battered women are frozen into a situation where they do not act to
protect their child, and we should be very careful about not letting
someone have a chance to make a new life with a new partner in very

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> I certainly had not intended to take part
in this debate, which has been at a very exalted level. However, the
speech from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, reminded me of
another point that has not been touched upon. If one reads the
amendment as it is worded, one has the impression that the test should
very probably be on the balance of probability. The noble and learned
Lord, Lord Hope, referred to the judgment by Lord Nicholls in Re H
18 years ago. The judgment as I remember it, and 
<?notus-xml column=1176?>correct me if I am wrong, was to this effect: normally the test will be
on a balance of probability—less or more likely.
However—I believe that these were his words—the more
serious the accusation, the more cogent must be the evidence to
establish that accusation. If I am right about that, and I believe that
I am, it means that this amendment would undermine that principle in Re
H
completely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hughes of Stretford" PimsId="5818" UID="13121770000580" xid="2080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000580">Baroness

an issue to be addressed; and those who believe that there may be an

debate that there has been a change in the way in which courts, rather
than social workers, can apply the Children Act. That change was as a
result of the intervention of the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Hale. In those situations where a child is living with someone who is a
possible perpetrator of proven abuse to another child, whereas
previously the court could have said, “That’s enough,
that’s the threshold; we will now consider the welfare
issues”, the noble and learned Baroness has said, “No,
that is not enough”. Now the court cannot even consider the
welfare issues to the child in the round. That is the crucial
change.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121770000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0001.htm#13121770000021">I

shall just make one or two comments. The noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Butler-Sloss, for whom I have the most enormous respect, said that
there ought not to be the possibility of court intervention on the
basis of suspicion. Normally that would be right, but the problem in
this case is that it is not just suspicion; there is a proven fact of
harm or death to a previous child by one or other, or more, of the
parties. The difficulty is that we do not know which one.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Walker, said that it is a terrible thing if a child
is removed from its home on unfounded evidence. Yes, it is, but it is
also a terrible thing if we learn only with hindsight that that child
was actually living with someone who was the 
<?notus-xml column=1177?>perpetrator and who was a danger to that child and
injured or killed that child. Those are the very difficult judgments. I
feel that, faced with that very difficult situation, I would be more
comfortable—I am entirely with the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Judge, on this—if a court were considering those issues rather
than it having to say, “No, we can’t look at it, because
we’re not allowed to any longer because the threshold
can’t be met and that is the current ruling”. That is a
great concern. As I say, I hope that the Minister will rise to the fact
that we have a hotly contested issue on a very serious matter
on which people whom we respect across the piece have come to
different judgments. This needs to be resolved, and I hope that the

achieved.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_17_PT_1/FD77E171CD92323A695CC85964F5084B0B31AFCD" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 December 2013">Tuesday,

promote equality of opportunity, to plan to increase access over time
and to make reasonable adjustments to policies and practices. For the
most part, however, the measures he referred to were what I might call
“soft measures”, such as continuous professional
development of staff and development of expertise in supporting

about Amendment 34A. My Amendment 16A covers the importance of
developing an inclusive system in which disabled children and young

education is maintained in Clause 33. That is why it is disappointing
that the potential for special academies to admit children with SEN
without an education, health and care assessment and plan is included
in Clause 34(9). The fact that academies are brought within the SEN
framework by this Bill is very welcome, but the inclusion of Clause
34(9) seems oddly at variance with this approach. As I said at Grand
Committee, this clause undermines a long-standing consensus that
children and young people should be placed in special schools only
where this has been identified as the most appropriate placement,

welcome this power because of the potential to give swifter access to a
special-school place. Without a full assessment and decision-making
process, however, there is a high risk of inappropriate placement. This
new power to place children in special schools outside the rigour of a
statutory assessment and decision-making process risks a return to a
time when parents could be pushed into accepting a special-school place
for their child, not because it is the best placement for them but
because the mainstream school had not, for whatever reason, provided
the appropriate support. In fact, it would take us back to the

Currently, as we know, any child who has special educational needs but

understand the Government’s position, which the Minister set out

in implementing inclusive educational practice. This has increased the
number of disabled children and young people with a wide range of
impairments and health conditions being included in mainstream
education. But while some local authorities have been proactive in
promoting inclusive education at a strategic level, a lot of work still

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall briefly, but
strongly, support both amendments. On Amendment 34A, the noble
Baroness, Lady Howe, has fully explained her concerns, which I share,
about the possible consequences of allowing specialist SEN academies to
admit children without an ECH plan. That seems to run
counter to the principle of inclusion and it also seems dangerous to
admit children without that comprehensive assessment of their specific
needs. I hope that the Minister will respond positively to
that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:15:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121770000070">When
the noble Lord, Lord Low, moved Amendment 16A in Committee, he rightly
said that although the code of practice had improved guidance on
inclusion, in the Bill as it stands, inclusion is not referred to
anywhere. Given the commitment of the Government and of noble Lords
across this House to increase access to mainstream schools and to act
in accordance with the recommendations of the JCHR, it seems very odd
that this overarching principle is not enshrined in the
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:16:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment is to insert that general principle alongside other general
principles that are included in the Bill. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Warnock, has said, this is not about pushing inclusion above everything
else; it is about parental choice. At the moment, because local
authorities and schools have not moved far enough towards making
mainstream schools accessible to disabled children, many children are
denied that
choice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:16:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

other key principles to which local authorities must have regard in
fulfilling their obligations under Part 3: the wishes and feelings of
children and their parents; the importance of child and family
participation in decisions; providing adequate information; and
supporting the child’s development and educational progress.
Those are all very important. But equally important, I would argue, is
the principle that local authorities should seek to maximise the
opportunities for
inclusion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:17:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121770000073">As
the noble Lord, Lord Low, told us, when the Minister was arguing
against the amendment in Committee, he said that the Bill maintained
the general principle of inclusion in a number of other provisions and
went on to list some of them. He also said that schools and colleges
had important duties under the Equality Act and he told us about other
measures that the Government were adopting to help mainstream schools
improve their ability to include disabled children more effectively.
However, he did not tell us why the Government would not accept this
amendment alongside the other general principles that appear on the
face of the Bill. If the Minister is not minded to accept the amendment
today, I hope that he will not rehearse that information as we have
already heard it and it is on the record. What we really want to know
is why he will not accept the general principle of inclusion sitting
alongside the other principles in Clause 19. That would send a strong
signal to all educational settings, and to local authorities, that they
must up their game and move closer and faster to being able to offer
places to 
<?notus-xml column=1187?>disabled children. That would catalyse a very
positive and marked shift. I hope that the Minister will accept the

make it clear at the outset that the Government are fulfilling their
commitments under the UN convention. The Bill maintains the general
principle of inclusion and does so through some of its key provisions.
It places duties on schools and colleges to use their best endeavours

presumption for inclusion in relation to choice of schools and colleges
through Clause 33. However, it also recognises that children and young
people have different needs and different preferences for where they
wish to be educated, including specialist settings such as special
schools and independent specialist colleges. That is entirely
consistent with the reservation and interpretative declaration that the
Government made to Article 24 of the UN convention recognising special

schools in the provision of auxiliary aids and services, such as
specialised computer programmes, sign language interpreters and hoists,

academy could admit only children or young people without plans who had
a particular type of SEN set out in the agreement. Changes that
suggested reducing the number of places for children with statements to
enable the admission of children without statements would not be
approved unless the case was supported by the local authority, by
parents, and a lack of demand for statemented places could be
demonstrated. Secondly, such a child or young person would be admitted
to the academy only if their parents or the young person had applied to
go to it. Thirdly, the child or young person should have those
particular needs and their admission 
<?notus-xml column=1190?>should be supported by a relevant professional
opinion, such as that of an educational psychologist. Of course,
parents of young people will continue to have the right to ask for a
statutory assessment of their child’s needs to be undertaken and
a right of appeal to the tribunal if the local authority decides not to
carry one out. The academy would also have to adopt fair practices to
such admissions in line with the principles of the school admission
code. We would take very seriously indeed any instances where these
freedoms were being abused. Very significantly, the new
secondary accountability, the best eight progress measures, will become
the main measure by which we assess the performance of all maintained
schools and academies. This new approach will strip away the previous
perverse incentives and will hold schools to account for the progress
made by all their pupils, not just blunt measures of absolute
attainment at grade C. This will move schools that have focused too
much on those pupils who can achieve a C grade to focus on the progress
of all their pupils and should particularly benefit SEN pupils in those
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:30:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121770000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121770000142">6.30

Minister. I thank the Minister for his full response. However, I have
to say 
<?notus-xml column=1191?>that I am not entirely persuaded by it. It was not a real advance on
what we heard from the Minister in Grand Committee. In moving the

needed the

I heard him, he has not said anything very different in substance
today. He said that children have a variety of different special
educational needs. That is right. These include a need for special
school placement. In moving the amendment, I went out of my way to make
it clear that nothing in the amendment is inimical to special school
placement. The amendment follows the language of the
Government’s own interpretative declaration when they entered
their reservation to the UN convention. Therefore, there should not
really be anything in the amendment that would be difficult for the
Government to
swallow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121770000091">Like
the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, I do not see what is causing the
Government so much difficulty about this. But I want to make it clear
that I do not feel embattled. I moved the amendment not in a spirit of
ideological embattlement or to provide a further chapter in the history
of passionate and sometimes bitter arguments between adherents of
inclusive and special education. I see it as much more a matter of good
legislative housekeeping, in which we get the appropriate principles on
the face of the Bill to drive their amplification in secondary
legislation and guidance. As I have made clear, the code of practice as
so far drafted, although a considerable improvement on the outline
draft which was initially circulating, is still woefully defective
compared with the guidance on inclusion, which we have at present. The
code, as so far drafted, is a real step backwards in this area. I feel
very strongly, not as a matter of special education ideology, but as a
matter of legislative housekeeping, that we need something like this
amendment on the face of the Bill in order to drive the major
strengthening of the code of practice on inclusion which is required.
In that quite moderate and not embattled spirit, I nevertheless
wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13121770000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121770000143">6.37

Amendment 17 would, for the purposes of Sections 22, 24, 25,
26, 27, 30, 32 and 62 of Part 3, include children with a disability,
under the Equality Act. It would interpret children and young people
with SEN to include children and 
<?notus-xml column=1195?>young people with a disability as well. The
Government have tabled a number of amendments, I think, to achieve the
same

this is not now contentious, given that the Government have moved on
the issue, but my amendment would ensure that key clauses that relate
to identifying children with needs, duties of the health authority,
joint commissioning arrangements, the duty to keep provision under
review, the local offer, advice and information for parents and so on
would all now apply equally to disabled children without a special
educational need under the terms of the Equality Act. This is
important, not only in principle, but also in its practical effects,
particularly for the local offer, which we will debate later on Report.
The local offer is particularly important for children with a
disability but without a special educational need because that is now
to be the only way in which they can get services that they and their
families need. It is very important for the local offer, particularly
Clause 26 on the joint commissioning arrangements between
health education and social care. When they are looking at what
is needed in an area they will have to take into account the needs of
all children with a disability, including those without a special
educational need, which was not the case under the Bill as it was
drafted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:51:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government’s concession here, as far as it goes. The Minister

achieved a truly inclusive, integrated and comprehensive system for all
disabled children, whatever their disability and whatever the extent of
their need. Many feel that this was the promise of the Green Paper.

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, it may be helpful if I outline our
government amendments in this group to enable noble Lords to have a
debate if they wish to. In Grand Committee we had an extensive debate
about the support for disabled children and young people and I
know that this is an issue on which the noble Baroness, Lady
Hughes, has reflected deeply, as have I since then. Many Peers
expressed concern that disabled children and young people
without SEN would miss out on the benefit of our reforms and,
at the time of the debate, I introduced a government amendment to
require schools to make arrangements for supporting children with
medical needs. I also asked for help from noble Lords in understanding
which groups of disabled children would not be supported by this Bill,
the government amendment in respect of children with medical needs, the
provisions of the Equality Act 2010 and Part 3 of the National Health
Service Act 2006.</hs_para>

they think that this would promote their well-being, including in

people, both in relation to the information to be published and in
developing and reviewing the local offer and publishing comments. In
Clause 32, the requirement on local authorities to arrange for young
people with SEN and parents of children with SEN to 
<?notus-xml column=1197?>receive advice and information on SEN would be extended to include
provision for disabled young people and the parents
of disabled children to be provided with
information about matters related to disability. I have also tabled an
amendment, which we shall come to later, to extend the requirement to
cover children themselves as well as their parents. Clause 73 would
make it clear that the definition of disability applied to the
provisions covered by these government amendments is that in the
Equality Act 2010.</hs_para>

Northover (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to speak to
the group containing government Amendment 17A and Amendment
18, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. Both amendments seek to
set out the circumstances in which provision that would otherwise be
health or social care provision should be treated as special
educational provision. The Government have consistently given an
undertaking to maintain existing protections for parents in
the new system. Clause 21(5) was drafted as part of that
undertaking. It sought to replicate as far as possible the case law
established under the present SEN legislation, which in our view makes
it clear that health provision, such as therapies, can be educational,
non-educational, or both, depending on the individual child and the
nature of the provision. Case law has established, in particular, that
since communication is so fundamental in education, in addressing
speech and language impairment it should normally be treated as
educational provision unless there are exceptional reasons for doing
otherwise. We have reflected this in section 7.9 on page 109 of the
draft SEN code of
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121770000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121770000105">We
all share the aim of carrying the current established position through

for his involvement with the 
<?notus-xml column=1198?>Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, which kindly shared and
discussed its legal advice with the department. We
have taken that advice into account in drafting
government Amendment 17A, which we believe would maintain the position

this into the new landscape of the Bill in relation to education and
training. We believe that our wording is expressed a little more simply

Again, it is a question about implementation, as my questions usually
are. When anything classified as social care and health becomes an
education provision, it will be financed. However, how will it be
financed in a college for disabled youngsters where there are myriad
therapists, who might be physiotherapists or speech therapists, or
where the youngsters may have a residential social care provision in
the same place but that is linked to the education? That is rather

to this amendment. Clause 22 requires local authorities to identify
children with special educational needs. This amendment would require
the local authority to publish these data within its formal offer. I
have tabled the amendment because I am concerned about the availability
of good-quality data on children with SEN and disabilities. It is an

number of children in their area is vital for local authorities
effectively to plan and deliver services. The draft SEN code of
practice, particularly in the section on joint commissioning, outlines
the importance of local data sets in identifying the needs of children
with SEN and in informing their decision-making. Without good-quality
data, it is difficult to see how the Government or local authorities
can effectively plan and commission services for children with SEN and
disabilities. It also means that we have a very weak basis on which to

that the Government will be amending the Bill so that local authorities
have a clear duty to identify children with disabilities, as well as
those with SEN. However, there is compelling evidence that existing
data sets are failing accurately to identify all children with SEN and

can vary widely. Using deafness as an example, I know that
different figures on the number of deaf children vary by as much as
30,000: according to the disability register, there are 7,500 deaf
children; according to the school census, there are 16,000; and,
according to the National Deaf Children’s Society’s

has also identified a widespread failure accurately to identify numbers
of children who are deafblind. In the local authority of Kensington and
Chelsea, Sense has found that, according to the prevalence data, there
should be around 10 deafblind children. However, the local authority
has identified four. How many have been identified by the school
census? The answer is none. These children urgently need specialist SEN

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment tabled
by the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins. Good quality data on children with
SEN and disabilities must be in place before we proceed with these
reforms. Unless action is taken, there is a clear risk that some
children will continue to fall through the net. The department’s
draft SEN code of practice acknowledges that issue and specifically
highlights the importance of quality data on children with low
incidence needs. Given that these children’s needs are
relatively less common, there is an even greater need to establish
their needs and whether local provision is sufficient to meet

as the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, has pointed out, existing data
sets are flawed. The code of practice refers to the disability
register. However, in the case of deaf children, I understand that it
is identifying only around 7,000 to 8,000 children, whereas other
estimates suggest that 40,000 would be closer to the truth. I
understand that the department recently published guidance to local
authorities on implementation of the new nought to 25 special needs
system. In that, the Department for Education asks local strategic

what has been said by the noble Baronesses, Lady Wilkins and Lady Howe,
but perhaps I could ask the Minister one or two questions which it
would be helpful if he could respond to in responding to the debate.
The information currently collected clearly does not include all
children with SEN. What is being done to address that by the 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>department? It is also clear that the information
needed to be collected in order that we might get effective planning
and commissioning is spread out over different data
sets. It would be helpful to know what is being done to bring together
the information to be found all over the place in different places to
ensure that we get well informed commissioning and

does the Minister know whether the department will take in hand the
co-ordination of all the data required, or will that be left to local
authorities? If it is going to be left to 152 different local
authorities, it is difficult to see how the department will be able to
meet the ambition set out in the Bill to improve commissioning without
the data sets being improved. Does the Minister agree that it would be
better for the department to co-ordinate this area of work rather than
leave it to 152 local authorities? If it is left to the local
authorities, it is hard to believe that we will get a coherent
solution. There are bound to be variations and the data is bound to
remain very patchy. Therefore, it would be very valuable if the
department would take a stronger hand in co-ordinating this work and in
making sure that we get the data that we need to have in order that the

Government probably do not want to increase the level of bureaucracy in
local authorities in terms of information gathering. I also understand
that they possibly do not want to have centralisation when one of their
main tenets is to decentralise to local government. That being said,
however, successive Governments have failed to get this right. Those of
us who were involved in trying to implement the Chronically Sick and
Disabled Persons (Amendment) Act 1976, which was a long time ago,

need to plan their strategy for some very large amounts of provision. I
have chaired a number of committees where we have needed data in order
to make a decision as to how we are going to move resources from one
area to another. If you do not have that information, you can get that
wrong. I would like to know how the Minister thinks that that kind of

22 already sets out that it is a requirement on local authorities to
identify all children in their area with SEN. The Government obviously
intend this data gathering to take place and this work to be done; 
<?notus-xml column=1203?>otherwise they would not have put this in the Bill.
It therefore needs to be collected and collated in an organised and
effective way. It cannot be argued that it is an
extra administrative burden when the basic requirement for the

raised genuine concerns about the quality of data in the past and the

like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Wilkins, for raising
this important issue and noble Lords who have spoken on this matter. I
accept noble Lords’ concerns on this. I understand that the
noble Baroness’s purpose behind tabling the amendment is to put,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, has said, local
authorities and schools in a better position to make good
commissioning decisions. Good commissioning is clearly an important
underpinning to the reforms that we are making and the Bill already
provides for joint commissioning arrangements across education, health
and care for the provision that is reasonably required for local
children and young people with SEN. That commissioning will be informed
by the local joint strategic needs assessment and the data that are
already available on these children and young
people.</hs_para>

accept absolutely that good data need to be available to inform
commissioning, but I do not think that the local offer is the right
place to publish that data. The purpose of the local offer is to set
out what provision children, young people and families can expect in
their local areas and it is to be used as a vehicle for discussion
about the development of local services. It is not designed to publish
information on the numbers of children and young people in the area
with different types of SEN. It would not be appropriate to clutter up
the local offer with such data. We accept that that information will be
material to discussions about the development of provision in the local
area, but that information is available elsewhere.</hs_para>

department already collects data from schools and local authorities on
the number of children with special educational needs and publishes
this annually on the department’s website. This includes data

will be expanding this information. At present, we publish data by type

will also publish data by type of need for children who are currently
at school action.</hs_para>

local authorities are already under a duty to maintain a register of
disabled children and young people under Section 17 of, and Schedule 2
to, the Children Act 1989. The draft, new SEN code of practice reminds
local authorities of that duty. The department also collects data on
children in the early years through the early years census. For
post-16, the Education Funding Agency and the Skills Funding Agency
also collect data on young people in the further education sector,

together these different data sets into one place is concerned, as I
said, I do not believe that the local offer is the appropriate place to

doing. Some local authorities may well be poor at carrying out their

Unfortunately, agreement has not continued from previous amendments. I
thank all other noble Lords who contributed to this debate, but I find
the Minister's reply extremely disappointing. He said that the local

cluttered up by it. But he then went on to enumerate various forms of

would have spoken first to Amendment 19, which is by far the most
important in the group, because it is designed to try to strengthen the

commissioning arrangements to satisfy the vast majority of children
with special educational needs, including speech, language and

they attend will have to try to obtain external support services such

adolescent mental health services and behaviour support teams for them.

the basis of what is “reasonably required”. Health
partners can use the NHS Act 2006 to decide for themselves what that

securing the provision agreed under Clause 26(3)(a). It also includes
an obligation similar to that in Clause 26(4)(b), requiring local

health partners actually operate the joint commissioning arrangements

not otherwise do. Amendment 23 inserts a specific

noble friend would have made two further points. First, he would have
sought clarification from the Minister on the role of the Minister for
Youth Policy in all this. On 3 July, the Government announced that
cross-cutting responsibility for youth policy was being transferred
from the Department for Education to the Cabinet Office, which would
now lead for the Government on: cross-government youth strategy and
policy co-ordination; management of the statutory duties on local
authorities for youth provision in their areas; and strategic
relationship management with young people and youth sector
organisations on policy development. Looked at objectively, nothing
needs more cross-cutting than what is sought by these amendments. Can
the Minister tell the House whether the Minister for Youth Policy, Nick
Hurd MP, has a role in

having read the government amendments published this morning, and in
anticipation of the many amendments to Clause 30 on local offers, which
turn out not to be offers at all but merely information about what
might be available, I suggest to the Minister that at the heart of my
noble friend’s concern is the single word
“implementation”. On the face of it, there is a
disconnect between local authorities and health partners—which I
suggest means the Department of Health, the Department for Communities
and Local Government and the Department for Education, no doubt
exacerbated by the amount of change that the NHS is currently going

with the amendment, particularly the point raised by the noble

rightly said, we are talking about a large number of children—a
much larger number of children than will have EHC plans—and it
is important that there are facilities to meet their needs. The onus is
now on schools to provide those facilities, but we know that
traditionally, schools have relied considerably, first, on local
authorities to help provide them and, secondly, on health authorities

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, I support the
amendments, especially Amendment 19. I do so because Clause 26,
which deals with joint commissioning arrangements, is an extremely
important part of Part 3 and the new apparatus that the Government are
constructing. I support the amendments because they are aimed at
strengthening the joint commissioning arrangements. They need
strengthening because of the wording of the Bill. We discussed this in
Committee. Clause 26 seems to provide that local authorities and health
and education authorities must set up arrangements so that they can
have a discussion about what needs to be provided in an area, but it
does not say that they must secure the provision that they think is
needed. That is an odd omission. Amendment 19, in particular, would
create an obligation to secure the provision for children and
young people who have not got the education, health and care
plans agreed under Clause 26(3)(a). That is a very important amendment
to make to the Bill.</hs_para>

it says that the local authority and its partner bodies “must
make arrangements”. The omission to do with
“securing” is particularly important with regard to
health. As we said in Committee, potentially they can use other
legislation for absolving themselves from improving on the provision
available, on the ground of cost. It would be very helpful
if the Minister could put on record the Government’s
intentions in Clause 26 in relation to securing the 
<?notus-xml column=1209?>provision that is identified as being needed through the joint
commissioning arrangements, particularly, but not exclusively, in
relation to health.</hs_para>

seeks to strengthen Clause 26 in relation to that securing
and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, has said, identifies the rather
insecure position at the moment of children and young people without
plans, I support it and hope that the Government are
sympathetic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000042"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13121787000348" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000348">Baroness

Howe, for speaking on behalf of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham and
arguing his case for him. He and I had very useful discussions before
he had to leave and I know how reluctant he was to depart. Noble Lords
are right: this is a very important issue. These amendments are
designed to ensure that those without education, health and care plans
can have their needs met and that the joint commissioning arrangements
are transparent and effective. We understand the purpose behind
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121787000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000043">It is
worth emphasising—and helps me in understanding the provisions
here—that I have just come, as it were, from the Department of
Health and worked on the health Bill. The NHS is, and continues to be,
a universal service. It must respond to the reasonable health needs of
the population it serves. That will be an absolute requirement,
connected with the fundamental duties on commissioners to meet the
health and care needs of children and young people, and supported by
the requirements in the National Health Service Act 2006 on CCGs to
engage with the public and with professionals and to promote
integration of health and social care and health-related services. It
is worth remembering, then, the strength of those provisions from the
health side when looking at these arrangements.</hs_para>

the heart of the new arrangements for SEN. The statutory framework

requirements are backed up by powerful statutory accountability. NHS
England’s mandate—the “must dos” for the

for delivery of that, and it in turn will hold CCGs to

is also local accountability, as every CCG’s plans and

representatives from each local CCG, Healthwatch and the local

Countess of Mar (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a long list of
amendments with, the noble Baroness will be pleased to hear, a brief
message. The Government are trying to ensure that children with special
educational needs have the best education and we are all agreed that
that is commendable. The Bill focuses on provision for SEN children and
young people who are within mainstream education. This excludes some
100,000 youngsters who cannot have access to the traditional schooling
system for reasons of chronic illness, disability, exclusion,
relocation of looked-after children, or children who live in a secure
environment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000062">The
Government often give the impression that they believe that excluded
young people are not interested in learning. As a result, the focus is
on mainstream education. At Second Reading, my noble friend Lady Howe
of Idlicote highlighted the BIS research paper from January 2013 on the
motivation and barriers to learning for NEETs—young people not
in education, employment or training. I discussed it further in Grand
Committee. It is obvious that it is actually these barriers which make
young people feel disillusioned. This leads to their exclusion from the
education system and puts them at risk of joining the 979,000 young
people who 
<?notus-xml column=1213?>are currently on the NEETs register. These
young people cost the taxpayer about £56,000 a time.
It is vital that they are not left behind.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121787000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000063">We know that the right
support given at the right time can make an enormous
difference and helps young people to achieve their personal ambitions.
Students who appear to opt out of education do not do so on impulse.
There is usually a chaotic background to their lack of
engagement that needs to be dealt with sensitively. We must bear in
mind when developing an education solution for these vulnerable young
people that one size does not fit all. Clause 19 shows clearly that the
Government are determined to involve children and their parents in the
decisions around specialised education and that they get the right
support at the right time. Surely, by allowing parents and children to
have direct input into the organisations that could be part of their
education provision, the Government would ensure that they have the
best provision with the widest range of suppliers, helping them to
achieve their objective.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121787000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000064">Education provision for
those outside the mainstream is often supplied by individual
organisations such as Nisai and the Red Balloon project, which have
created innovative ways to help those pupils who are currently out of
school. Online and blended learning is one such innovative technique
that has been utilised by parents to ensure that their children have
access to the education they need. I described in Grand Committee the
means by which this is achieved so I will not repeat myself. As I said
then, this type of learning is an important tool for many parents but
is not recognised as part of the framework of education provision for
young people with special needs. This means that it cannot be rolled
out to help numerous other children. It is available just to those
parents who are in the know and can afford to pay. As it stands, money
assigned to a pupil or student while inside the mainstream school
system does not follow them once they cease to be on the school roll.
This means that it is often difficult for them to access the
alternative provision that would help
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000065">If
online and blended learning was officially recognised as part of the
education provision that can be provided by local authorities, it would
become easily accessible and enable the Bill to fulfil its
purpose,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121787000302" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000302">“to

addition, the costs make sense. Online and alternative providers can
help to save the Government money. Students will no longer need to be
taught in isolation for a few hours a week by home tutors. They will
join virtual classrooms of 10, with one teacher, and will have access
at any time of the day or night. Local authorities, which are under
pressure to reduce their costs, will be able to save on other parts of
their budgets. For example, I understand that in 2010 Northamptonshire
County Council spent more than £6 million on taxis for disabled
special needs children, expelled pupils and young mothers. Saving these
costs by centralising the use of online and blended learning would
enable local authorities to allocate funds to other vital
services.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121787000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000067">If
online and blended learning were to be formally recognised, there need
be no fear that anything need be taken away from mainstream education
for the 
<?notus-xml column=1214?>majority of children. These amendments are simply
about adding a safety net to catch youngsters who would otherwise be
drinking at the last chance saloon. I have already used the example of
Nisai to highlight the important role of individual organisations which
have created imaginative ways to help those who are excluded and
produced excellent results. It makes sense that the good work which
alternative education providers have been doing for a small percentage
of vulnerable young people can be rolled out to reach the most
vulnerable in society.</hs_para>

the Minister that it is obvious that the use of online learning has
support from all sides of the House. We noticed that in Grand
Committee. We really need to enter the digital age in this educational
field. Virtual education has been used successfully by universities for
many years and I am sure that the noble Baroness would agree that it is
time that primary and secondary education caught up. Most children are
computer literate at a very early age and those who cannot attend
mainstream schools would probably enjoy the ability to access
educational material in virtual classrooms. I think particularly of the
young people who I know best: those who are housebound or bedridden
because they have ME. They can take small bites of material at a time
and many have had excellent examination
results.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000069">I am
very grateful for the meeting that I had with officials yesterday. I
hope that, as a result, the noble Baroness will look on my amendments
kindly and that, even if she is not prepared to see them within the
Bill, she will ensure that online and blended learning are included in
the relevant codes of practice. I beg to

Morris of Yardley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment
of the noble Countess, Lady Mar. I do not know what the Minister is
about to say, so it might not be necessary for me to speak. However, in
case we are not entirely satisfied with the Minister’s response,
I shall offer a few comments in support

may be missing an opportunity here. There has been a great improvement
in blended and online learning over the past few years. A decade ago, I
should have been sceptical about an amendment such as this. I should
have still wanted almost to squeeze these children into the traditional
model of education, which is of course what many of them are rebelling
against, and which has failed to meet the needs of many of them. Having
visited places like Red Balloon and talked to people who have now
become proficient in online and alternative ways of supporting these
children, I think the time has come when we ought to acknowledge that
it could provide a very important, successful form of education for
children whom we have failed in the past. I might not have thought of
its fitting into this Bill, but it is an ideal place to acknowledge the
growing importance that online and alternative methods of learning are
playing in our education system. We ought to seize that
opportunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:01:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000072">My
second point is that this fits in with two important aspects of the
Government’s education policy. The first is the change needed in
the IT curriculum for children in formal education, which the
Government 
<?notus-xml column=1215?>have done well to acknowledge. In doing so, they seem to acknowledge
that changes in IT and learning are here to stay, and that we need to
seize ways—of which this is one—to acknowledge the
importance of information technology and digital learning in our
education
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000073">The
second, more obvious, fit with government policy is that this is an
alternative to mainstream education. Among all the alternative
provision, such as free schools, about which I have serious concerns, I
see this as finding a way to let innovative education play its part in
the education of children—something that we are not good at
doing. Whereas I am sceptical about a lot of the ways that the
Government are finding to put that innovation into the system, I wish
they would seize this. If they were to look seriously at this amendment
and touch base, they might see in it, for some children with special
educational needs who are rebelling against mainstream education, and
for whom mainstream education has never done a decent job, something
which holds the
key<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:09:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000074">I
look to the Minister for an acknowledgement of that, and either for
this to go in the Bill or for a strong message to go out that this is a
good thing which we ought to do all we can to support. Trying to read
the Minister’s mind before she has spoken is difficult,
but I hope that she is going to be sympathetic, if not in
accepting this amendment, in giving a really clear signal that this is
good, welcome and deserving of maximum

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Countess, Lady Mar,
for highlighting this area. She has fought long and hard for those with
ME, to whose situation she has made reference. In Committee, my noble
friend Lord Nash clarified the Government’s position; that the
majority of children and young people are best served by attending a
mainstream institution. We had a key discussion on this earlier. We do,
however, recognise that for some children and young people mainstream
education is not appropriate, as both the noble Countess, Lady Mar, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said. The education arranged for these
individuals could indeed include the use of online provision as part of
a blended package of support. Indeed, I understand that earlier this
month, the Nisai Learning Hub was registered as an independent school
that will provide alternative provision through a mixture of supported
online and face-to-face
learning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000076">Decisions
on the use of such provision clearly need to take into account
children’s and young people’s academic needs. It is also
vital that their social and emotional development is supported, and
that their health and safety are protected. Because of that, we believe
that local authorities, mainstream institutions or special institutions
should remain accountable for these decisions. However, to reinforce
the point made by my noble friend Lord Nash in Committee, the
provisions in this Bill do not prevent the use of alternative
provision, including online and blended learning. I can reassure noble
Lords that it can be included within an EHC plan, it can be funded by
personal budgets and it can be part of the local offer used to support
pupils without an EHC plan.</hs_para>

underlying aim of these amendments is to highlight the benefits of
online and blended learning for certain groups. The noble Countess,
Lady Mar, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, made their case
effectively and powerfully. We do not think that legislation is the
appropriate vehicle to achieve this aim, but we shall reflect carefully
on how the SEN code of practice and statutory guidance on alternative
provision can better support informed decisions on this type of

they offer vital safeguards in relation to the education, wider

Gardiner of Kimble (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the Bill is a prudent
measure, seeking to increase public protection for consumers based in
Great Britain by tightening current legislation to ensure that all
remote gambling, whether provided by British or overseas suppliers, is
a licensed activity subject to the Gambling Commission’s
standards and controls. This is a small but significant Bill, the key
purpose of which had broad support across all sides in the other place.
In fact, this Bill has its origins in the previous
Administration’s review of the remote gambling regulatory
framework.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000083">Remote<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:09:06"></hs_TimeCode>
gambling is gambling in which people participate by the use of remote
communication—internet, telephone, television or other kinds of
electronic communication. Remote gambling is on the increase year after
year. According to the latest Gambling Commission statistics, it has
increased by 5% from last year alone, fuelled by the spread of fast
internet connections and the use of mobile
phones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000084">The

required to hold a Gambling Commission licence and are subject to the
commission’s licence code and conditions. However, there is no
such requirement for remote gambling operators based wholly overseas.
The Gambling Commission estimates that around 85% of remote gambling
activity by British consumers currently takes place with operators that
the commission does not regulate, and that includes many of the well
known high street brands. This is a sizeable proportion outside the
scope of the British regulatory regime. While these operators are
governed by the regulatory regimes of the jurisdictions in which they
are based, British consumers can experience varying levels of
protection.</hs_parafo>

number of British consumers using these services, it is time to extend
the regulatory framework established by the 2005 Act to this growing

consumers enjoy consistent consumer protection in an age where the use
of technology is prevalent and means that operators transacting with
British consumers can be based anywhere in the world.</hs_para>

accessibility to online gambling products means that we need to take
this opportunity to ensure that the Gambling Commission can monitor and
respond 
<?notus-xml column=1218?>swiftly and effectively to developments in remote gambling. While the
current arrangements have not as yet led to widespread problems for
consumers, the Government are committed to staying ahead. The market is
growing and we need to take this opportunity to give the Gambling

before they manifest themselves on a larger
scale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000087">The
Bill therefore seeks to extend the regulatory regime established by the
2005 Act to all remote operators that seek to advertise and sell into
the British market, whether they are based in Britain or abroad. In
this sense, the regulation of remote gambling will move from the point
of supply to the point of consumption by
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000088">With
this change, all remote gambling operators advertising and selling into
Britain will be required to hold a Gambling Commission licence, making
them subject to robust and consistent regulation by the commission,
increasing protection for British consumers; supporting action against
illegal activity, including sports betting integrity; and establishing
fairer competition for British-based operators. As licence holders,
they will be required to comply with the Gambling Commission’s
licence code and conditions, which include social responsibility and
technical standards requirements, including licence conditions that
protect children and vulnerable adults. It means, too, that for the
first time all remote gambling overseas operators will also have to
inform the Gambling Commission about suspicious betting patterns to
help to fight illegal activity and corruption in sport. The recent
allegations of match fixing illustrate the importance of extending this
requirement to overseas operators, and the Financial Conduct Authority
will further strengthen the existing arrangements by issuing new
guidance to sports spread betting operators about their requirements to
notify of suspicious market
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000089">Advertising
is of major importance to operators and central to their ability to
attract custom; in many ways it is their life-blood in a very
competitive market. The Bill will bring operators’ ability to
advertise in Britain in line with the new regulatory regime. As a
result of the Bill, all remote gambling operators wishing to advertise
to British consumers will be required to hold a Gambling Commission
licence. The requirement for a licence means that a failure to comply
with the advertising codes of practice, which seek to ensure that
adverts do not glamorise gambling, exploit vulnerable people, appeal to
children or suggest gambling as a solution for financial difficulties,
could result in an operator losing their licence. The loss of their
licence would mean they could not advertise in Britain, which would go
to the heart of the viability of their
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000090">The
change in the licensing regime means the end of what has become known
as the white list. At present, operators based in the EEA, including
Gibraltar, or in a non-EEA country designated by the Secretary of
State, are able to advertise remote gambling to consumers in Britain
without a British licence. Those countries, known as the white list
countries, include Antigua and Barbuda, the Isle of Man, the States of
Alderney and Tasmania. The list was closed in 2009, pending the outcome
of the consultation on the proposal 
<?notus-xml column=1219?>for the Bill. The white list will be repealed by the Bill, and all
operators, whether based in the EEA or elsewhere, will require a
British licence.</hs_para>

new offence of unlicensed advertising of remote gambling in Northern
Ireland, which has been welcomed and agreed by the Northern Ireland
Executive and Assembly. Unlike Scotland and Wales, gambling is a
devolved matter in Northern Ireland, but the law there is silent on
remote gambling. For that reason, Section 331 of the 2005 Act, which
prohibits the advertising of remote gambling by an operator from a
non-EEA or white list jurisdiction, was also extended to Northern
Ireland. The changes being brought in by this Bill require the repeal
of Section
331.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000092">The
Northern Ireland gambling laws are currently in the process of being
rewritten and updated. In the mean time, the Government and the
responsible Northern Ireland Minister, the Minister for Social
Development, Mr Nelson McCausland MLA, were concerned to ensure that
Northern Ireland consumers continued to have the same protection as
other British consumers in relation to the advertising of remote
gambling, as was the case under Section 331. This new offence achieves
that. It means that all UK consumers will enjoy the same protection in
respect of the advertising of remote gambling.</hs_para>

is concerned, overseas operators that are required to hold, but fail to
obtain, a Gambling Commission licence will be committing the offence of
providing facilities for gambling or the separate offence of
advertising unlawful gambling. The Gambling Commission is empowered
under the 2005 Act to take appropriate action against illegal
operators.</hs_para>

has a number of enforcement tools available to it under the 2005 Act
with which it is able to detect and disrupt unlicensed operators. It
has wide investigatory powers under the 2005 Act and the Regulation of

illegal advertising is an important way the commission protects
consumers from illegal operators. The Gambling Commission has
demonstrated that it is able to take effective, swift action to remove
illegal advertising, including working with third-party carriers such
as Google and Yahoo. Third parties which carry illegal advertising are
themselves at risk of prosecution under the 2005 Act. Player education
is another important tool in combating the use of unlicensed services.
The commission also has power to bring criminal prosecutions, including
in absentia.</hs_para>

also continues to build links and information-sharing gateways with
regulatory bodies across the world. Many jurisdictions take account of
prosecutions overseas when considering the ongoing suitability of

course, I do not claim that the commission can eliminate all instances
of illegal activity. The commission will, as it currently does, take a
risk-based and proportionate approach to enforcement. There will always
be some operators who do not comply and players who disregard the
risks, but the Government 
<?notus-xml column=1220?>are content that the existing powers under the 2005 Act provide the
commission with broad investigatory and enforcement powers with which
to achieve the consumer protection aims of the Bill. The situation is
not unlike the difficulties posed by counterfeit goods. We cannot
necessarily act to prevent their manufacture in overseas countries, but
we can use all the tools at our disposal to disrupt and prevent their
importation and sale in this country.</hs_para>

consumer protection. As a result of the Bill, all operators selling or
advertising in the British market, whether from here or abroad, will be
required to hold a licence from the Gambling Commission. This Bill is a
significant step towards enhanced consumer protection. It extends the
scope of the 2005 Act to protect British consumers in this fast-growing
market and will ensure consistency of consumer protection and a level
playing field between operators. The increase of remote gambling makes
this the right time to act to ensure that the Gambling Commission has
the ability to intervene to protect British consumers of remote
gambling now and in the future. I beg to

gambling, I am far from being a usual suspect in your Lordships’
House. In fact, this is the first time I have ever addressed your
Lordships’ House on this topic. I do so tonight because I have
two important personal interests. The first is as a Channel Islander
because this Bill has major implications for the Channel Islands,
particularly Guernsey and Alderney. I am a very proud Guernsey
woman—the only one, I think, in your Lordships’
House.</hs_para>

of major importance to both islands and is crucial to the economy of
Alderney. The sector provides approximately £50 million a year
of benefit to the Bailiwick of Guernsey’s economy, and it
employs almost 400 people directly and in related services. For
Alderney, one of the smallest of the Channel Islands with fewer than
2,000 residents, it accounts for 12% of its GDP. The consequences for
Guernsey and, particularly, for Alderney, should this sector be
threatened, are significant and would be of concern to those of us who
recognise the importance of the Channel Islands to the British family,
which the islanders always emphasise.</hs_para>

e-gambling in Alderney since 2000 has been a huge success, largely
because of the quality of regulation that its Gambling Control
Commission provides. The commission knows that to survive and succeed
it has to meet and exceed the highest international standards of
regulation. It has set itself objectives which seek to ensure that all
electronic gambling on Alderney is conducted honestly and fairly, that
the funding, management and operation of electronic gambling on
Alderney remains free from criminal influence and that electronic
gambling is regulated and monitored so as to protect the interests of
licensees’ customers as well as the young and
vulnerable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000102">In
order to do that, Alderney invested considerable effort and resource to
become one of the very few jurisdictions to be placed on the
UK’s e-gambling 
<?notus-xml column=1221?>white list, which was mentioned by the Minister. The
UK recognised Alderney as one of only five jurisdictions with
regulatory regimes that were benchmarked to be of such a high standard
that Alderney operators were allowed to advertise their e-gambling
services in the UK. To achieve this, the Alderney Gambling Control
Commission had to demonstrate the very highest standards of regulation,
propriety and probity. It has done so to such an extent that the
UK’s own Gambling Commission has come to rely on the AGCC
providing a benchmark of best practice and it has recognised its
enormous expertise in regulating remote gambling. Many British firms
have established themselves there and have accessed the British public
with little or no negative consequence in terms of player
protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:23:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the Bill should be that the UK and ordinary regulators should work
even more closely together to protect the consumers of e-gambling. This
would not only avoid duplication of effort, which is in itself sensible
enough, but also ensure that, where the Gambling Commission finds
itself stretched thinly by the new responsibilities in this Bill, it
can ask Alderney to assist. Over the years the AGCC has worked closely
with its UK counterparts in developing its own regulatory framework and
has been influenced by what we do in the UK. It is one of the very few
jurisdictions outside the UK which has placed a mandatory requirement
on its licensees to contribute to research, education and counselling
of problem gambling, and could be an exemplar for other jurisdictions.
I know there is much concern about problem gambling, and rightly so,
especially if unregulated operators are allowed to advertise their
services, which might be a temptation to problem gamblers. Other noble
Lords will no doubt speak about

within the framework of this Bill. Ministers will, I hope, not only
recognise these developments but preserve them, as it is clearly in the

point-of-consumption licensing regime would constitute state aid, but a
recent and comprehensive ruling from the European Commission
will perhaps change the Government’s legal position. A French
levy on online horserace betting has been approved, recognising
racing’s special status and common interest with the betting
industry. It sets a vital precedent and is, I believe, in the process
of being reviewed by DCMS for any read-across to the
Government’s previous legal position. I hope that the Minister
will be able to update the House on that. The legal advice received by
the British Horseracing Authority is that the collection of levy 
<?notus-xml column=1223?>from remote operators under a point-of-consumption licensing regime does
not constitute state aid. Amendments were put down on this matter in
another place. Would the Minister be prepared to accept similar
amendments in your Lordships’

Clement-Jones (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it has undergone a lengthy
process but I welcome this Bill, which I hope will remedy clear flaws
in the Gambling Act 2005. It has already undergone extensive
pre-legislative scrutiny and well informed debate in the Commons. As my
noble friend the Minister outlined in his introduction, the Bill will
require remote operators to hold a Gambling Commission licence to deal
with British consumers or to advertise in Great
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:31:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000115">The
licences will be important. I understand that the licences for such
online sites to be granted by the Gambling Commission will include a
condition for comprehensive reporting of suspicious patterns of
activity, but will the penalties for non-compliance be adequate? Much
needed also is a licence condition for protection of player accounts
following the Full Tilt case. What is the status of the consultation on
this? Can the Minister give us an update
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:32:36"></hs_TimeCode>? What
restrictions on advertising—for example, before the
watershed—can the Gambling Commission impose and include as part
of its licensing conditions. I hope that the Minister will be able to
answer those

questions remain with regard to the Bill and online gaming. What are
the Government doing to combat problem gambling online, particularly as
regards the ability to self-exclude, including “one stop
shop” exclusion? What pressure are they and the Gambling
Commission putting on operators to develop and use the necessary
technology, such as play scan, to identify this? Will there be
kitemarking of sites, as recommended by the Culture, Media and Sport
Select Committee last May? Is it the Government's intention to
introduce this and how will they fulfil it? Why are there no powers to
block illegal offshore sites being introduced? If no statutory powers
are proposed, is progress being made towards a voluntary agreement
between ISPs? Why are there no measures such as payment blocking along
the lines of the US Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act, which
has been adopted by so many countries? Why are there no proposals,
voluntary or statutory, to ensure that illegal sites cannot appear
prominently in search results on search engines? How effective will
monitoring and enforcement be? How will licensing checks be carried out
by the Gambling Commission? Will adequate resources be given to the
Gambling Commission to carry out regular test purchases 
<?notus-xml column=1224?>and enforce conditions of the licences?
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:34:24"></hs_TimeCode> is it
anticipated that the Bill will come into effect? How will the
transitional provisions operate, particularly with regard to
white-listed countries? The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley,
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:34:36"></hs_TimeCode> that
point.</hs_para>

is widely expected that the Treasury will announce a POCT—point
of consumption tax—rate of 15%. Is 15% the right level to ensure
that overseas operators cannot compete unfairly with UK-licensed sites
in future? Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:35:17"></hs_TimeCode>
of the companies that continue to develop their software in the UK have
concerns. They believe that the consequence of setting POCT at 15% will
be that they and companies like them will be forced to relocate core
services outside the UK. Investment in research and development, and in
UK marketing, will be cut. The unregulated market, they say, will
flourish, to the detriment of players and decent operators. The overall
tax burden will be greatest for companies resident in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:35:30"></hs_TimeCode>. What is the
Government’s response? Can the Minister rebut these dire
predictions? What discussions have they held? Why is the POCT being set
at 15% if there are such risks in

question of whether the new legislation conforms to EU law, as it could
be argued that one of the major objectives of the Bill is to bring
offshore sites into the UK tax net. What, if any, moves are being made
towards common pan-EU standards and compliance? Is there no prospect of
a harmonised approach across Europe to ensure minimum standards and
effective
enforcement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:36:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000119">The
Minister will also be aware that the National Casino Forum is seeking
to amend the Bill to allow the UK onshore casino sector to provide its
customers with the same online gambling experience as the online
sector. Under existing regulation, onshore casino operators cannot
indicate that the product is available from any internet-linked
computer within the casino or advertise their online site on or around
an actual computer with internet access. So a customer can bring their
own internet access device—a tablet or a smartphone—into
a casino and play online, perhaps even on the casino’s own
online site, but the casino operator cannot offer that
facility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:36:58"></hs_TimeCode>. What
are the Government’s reasons for resisting such an amendment so
far, despite the recommendation in its scrutiny of the draft Bill
by the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, and the wide
support that that has received? It appears that this is under
consideration, but only by means of secondary legislation. That route
seeks to categorise an internet access device as a gaming
machine—perhaps a category A machine—if it is offered for
use in a casino. Someone playing in the bar on their own iPad is not
playing a gaming machine, but someone playing a device offered by the
casino would be. If an internet access device is categorised as a
gaming machine in these circumstances, it would become subject to
gaming machine technical standards regulations. So a player using two
different devices—one provided by the operator on the gaming
floor in the casino and the other their own device—might face
different conditions of play. That is totally confusing and
unnecessary<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:38:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000120">By
contrast, the industry offered an amendment in the Commons that would
have allowed the Secretary of State to control the number of such
devices a

reconsider their position during the passage of the Bill through this
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000121"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>At
the end of the day, we have to recognise that the Bill is very limited
in scope and there are some key questions relating to ongoing
Government intentions in other areas of gambling. The noble Baroness,
Lady Pitkeathley, raised an important subject and concisely put the
argument for going beyond the current four-year voluntary agreement
with the bookies. Why is there no government commitment to consultation
on future statutory arrangements to ensure the future of racing
industry finances? I know that Ministers have believed hitherto that a
new revenue-raising point of consumption licensing regime might
constitute state aid. However, as the noble Baroness mentioned, the
recent case in which a French levy on online horserace betting has been
approved, in recognition of horseracing’s special status and
common interest with the betting industry, now sets a vital precedent.
I very much hope that Ministers will take note of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000122">There
is also the question of spread betting. That is, of course, currently
regulated by the FCA, but how will its licences compare with those
issued by the Gambling Commission? Should that not be included in the
Bill, as some have argued, and brought within the ambit of the Gambling
Commission? If not, can my noble friend confirm that an equivalent to
condition 15.1 on reporting suspicious activity to sports governing
bodies will be introduced, which will be enforced by the
FCA?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000123">Then
there is the desirability of ensuring portability of casino licences
as, faced with unused licences in a number of localities, logic would
dictate. There are also all the issues surrounding FOBTs, which are now
extensively under discussion. Of course, we have the whole area of

Falkland (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, this is quite a simple Bill, as
other noble Lords have pointed out. I do not know whether other noble
Lords have read the Second Reading proceedings in another place. In the
past I did not normally have the habit of reading Second Readings, but
I read that through twice and very interesting it was, too. It was
really a kind of double act between Mrs Grant for the coalition and the

<?notus-xml column=1226?>Davies, who is a rising star in another place. I

a Treasury matter.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T20:44:28"></hs_TimeCode> lot of the

it was foreseeable and acceptable, I would not oppose at all the idea
of the Treasury to seek further contributions by introducing this
point-of-consumption tax in Europe—provided that the licences
are in order and so on—but the mistake that it made, if I may
make this comment early, is the one that was made during the
discussions we had on the pre-legislative scrutiny committee. The noble
Lord, Lord Faulkner, who was in his place and is now elsewhere, was
with me on that committee and will remember what killed the whole idea
of casinos. When the Budd report came out, the idea that we could
restore the magnificence of the seaside resorts by gambling and
possibly by resuscitating entertainment and so on seemed rather
improbable and fanciful. That appealed to the Government on one basis,
which is where they fell down badly. That was that to address the
danger of gambling by vulnerable gamblers, those people would have to
decide to take money in their pockets and make sure that they had an
adequate amount to spend over a weekend when they went up to, say,
Blackpool—that was the most discussed place. But it was killed
absolutely stone dead as was explained to me by experts from America
because there is no way that you could get investment to produce the
right project when the Treasury was putting such a high tax rate on
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000128">As I
understand it, the guide is that a tax rate of 15% will be required. It
is very interesting that the Treasury should do this. It is short-term
thinking but it is also quite dangerous, because if you start putting a
tax of 15% on licensed companies, it is going to make it very difficult
for them to operate in a way that satisfies their customers. A large
number of their customers will leave the well-regulated, satisfactory
operators. The online companies that are licensed are extremely
satisfactory. It will encourage people to go to places where they will
be less secure as consumers, where there will be ability for people who
are in danger, with their addiction going and so on. That has not been
thought through by the Treasury, although I can see nothing
wrong with the basic idea of the Treasury getting its hands on some
more
income.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0002.htm#13121787000129">Various
other things have already been mentioned this evening that spring to
mind. The Gambling Commission, for example, will have a great deal of
responsibility as a result of this. I do not particularly like quangos
of any kind, and I have not been too impressed by this quango so far.
It is a poor replacement in terms of performance compared to its
predecessor, on which it was based, which controlled casinos from the
1960s. The Gaming Board was extremely successful in that it did not
grow unsatisfactorily into a kind of an empire. It seems to me
that the possibility of empire-building as a result of this Bill is
considerable. They will be flying around Europe inspecting places and

something quite worrying. But I came away fully persuaded by the way in
which that operation was run, how it took into account dealing with
vulnerable gamblers, and the excellence of the staff—in
particular, as regards protecting themselves from dangerous and
vulnerable gamblers. For companies that work online, the last thing
they want is those kinds of people. They would rather spend money on
weeding them out before having to deal with them. They want regular
players who have got the money to do what they do. They act responsibly
and check them out thoroughly. They had three or four highly educated
young women in that company who had psychology degrees. Their entire
job was to follow and trace their customers’ betting patterns so
that they could detect at any moment if they thought such and such a

official world of cricket and, to my knowledge, that of football and
horseracing, is at the forefront of the debate about the impact of
corrupt betting. Cricket has over many years faced high-profile issues,
such as the South African Hanse Cronje and the more recent cases of
international cricketers and English county cricketers exposed by
national newspapers. Dealing with the impact of these cases has meant
that the England and Wales Cricket Board, as with other national

this greatly concerning

stated, proposes that the UK moves to a licensing system based on the
point of consumption rather than the point of supply, but sports bodies
worry that this Bill fails to address the anomaly of spread
betting—as mentioned by my noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones—such as on the first no-ball, the first corner, or
when England will ever get a first innings lead against Australia this
winter. While traditional betting operators are, as already mentioned,
regulated by the Gambling Commission, at present spread betting
operators are regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, the FCA,
with which there is no equivalent of the relevant licence condition
15.1. This means, therefore, that spread betting companies are under no
legal obligation to report suspicious activity. My honourable friend
the Minister for Sport, Tourism and Equalities has now publicly
confirmed that the FCA will publish new guidelines for spread betting
companies, comparable with requirements set out for fixed odds
operators under that licence condition

is urgency for the FCA to publish these guidelines. Will my noble
friend the Minister give an assurance that this matter is under serious

companies must be regulated in the same way as traditional operators.
The International Cricket Council was the first international body to
have a global anti-corruption unit and the England and Wales Cricket

match fixing is an activity that consumes considerable resources for
national governing bodies. Will my noble friend the Minister therefore
urge the DCMS to consider whether this expensive resource could be

must make a contribution? Anti-doping agencies receive around £6

understand that the ECB recently met the Financial Conduct Authority,

again, the FCA has said that it cannot replicate licence condition 15.
Perhaps the Minister can tell us why that is so. It means that
information on any betting irregularities need not be given directly to
any national governing body. This is a major flaw because those
governing bodies need to know of any betting issues immediately so that
they can act to prevent a manipulation of any aspect of any match or
competition under suspicion. I urge the Minister to consider amendments
to the Bill so that spread betting is specifically

also mention the need for the Government to look more widely at the

that the initial consultation proposing action was launched by Labour

further their dubious activities. I urge the Minister to give every
assurance that measures will be taken to give sport the weapons and
resources it needs to protect the integrity of genuine sporting
conflicts, and to protect the consumer. After all, sports governing
bodies should not have to rely on newspaper stings or whistleblowers to
reveal betting scams. If the Bill includes legislation to cover the

finances of racing are based on a system which nobody now likes at all
and which has repeatedly attracted very reluctant government
involvement. Additionally, the levy has shrunk from a high point of
£115.3 million in 2007-08 to the current very anaemic
£73.9 million. By contrast, the French state-owned Tote monopoly
returned €876 million in 2011 to the industry body, and even in
Australia a total of £280 million was returned to
racing from betting. The comparison is obvious.</hs_para>

point made by the noble Viscount, Lord Falkland. Today there are

unreservedly, at least inasmuch as it takes us in the direction of some
resolution of racing’s dilemmas and introduces clearer consumer
protection and the monitoring of possible illegal activity. When the
Gambling Act was introduced in 2005, it was hoped that online gambling
would remain in the UK with its economic benefits. It was an error by
the then Chancellor of the Exchequer to try to secure revenue by
seeking to impose a tax and regulatory regime that simply helped to
drive almost every operator offshore. At the heart of the Bill lies the
objective of trying to secure a level playing field between onshore and
offshore gambling by making the point of consumption the focal point of
the system. The Bill has been welcomed across the party political
divide and endorsed by the Select Committee for Culture, Media and
Sport.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000152">Undoubtedly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T21:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>,
we hope that this will have some effect on increasing the size of the
levy and bring greater transparency to betting activity. If that proves
to be the case, and the prize money situation improves, it will be
hugely welcome. However, the truth is that the history of contact and
agreement between the governing bodies of racing and the bookmakers has
been at times fractious and unproductive. Of course, the hope is that
with this legislation offshore betting activity will be persuaded at
least in part to return home and that levy payments will be
automatically paid under the regulatory umbrella provided by the
Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act 1963.</hs_para>

review. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T21:05:47"></hs_TimeCode>

of consumption levy would breach EU state aid rules but the French, as
we have heard, appear to have been given a green light by the EU
Commission to operate their parafiscal
levy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000154">I cannot
but believe that the levy ultimately is unsustainable over the long run
as the basis for financing a good portion of racing in this country.
Therefore, however welcome this Bill is, surely we need to look
further, but regard this Bill as an important and significant step
towards an enduring, long-term and viable financial structure for the
industry. Modern technology and changing consumer habits and practice
offer this possibility. I therefore invite the Minister to reflect on
the possibility of looking seriously at a sporting right which would
give organisers of potentially many sports fixtures the property rights
over the outcomes of the event, the product on which bets are placed.
This product would be licensable so that any operator offering or
accepting bets on the sport would need prior authorisation and pay a
fair return accordingly. This would promote a commercial relationship
between dependent industries, allowing the value of the products to be
determined by a market rather than the Government, creating a level
playing field and unlocking funding for horseracing and other sports,
particularly at the grass roots level. This approach essentially has
been adopted in France and Australia.</hs_para>

the levy with a true sporting right would represent a major step
forward for racing and gambling regulation more widely. Sport governing
bodies could determine the market value of their product in line with
the move to bring taxation and regulation of remote gambling onshore,
as per this Bill. It would also recognise the interdependent
relationship between the sports and gambling industries and force them
to negotiate in good faith on commercial lines rather than, as in the
case of horseracing, bringing about unwelcome government
intervention.</hs_para>

conclusion, I repeat my welcome for this Bill and earnestly hope that
it fulfils its sound objectives but I believe that there still needs to
be another step forward ultimately to move away from the levy system.
Moreover, I ask the Minister, as this legislative process is
undertaken, echoing the point made by my noble friend, that this is
brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible. There has been the
thought of potential delay of up to four years. Big problems are being

2010 <I>British Gambling Prevalence Survey</I> shows that the UK
problem gambling figure is 0.9%. That may not sound like very much, but
it amounts to about 451,000 people in the UK. Problem gambling is a
hugely destructive process that destroys lives. In assessing its public
policy significance, it is important to remember that since no man or
woman is an island, the destructive chaos that impacts those 451,000
people actually impacts a far larger group when we factor in the
families and work colleagues of those 451,000

considering the challenge of problem gambling from the perspective of
this Bill, we must consider that the figure for people gambling online
is much greater. Far from being 0.9% of the whole population, the
problem figures for online slot machines are actually more than 9% and,
measured on a monthly basis, are 17% of those who gamble. It is vital
that we approach the Gambling (Licensing and Advertising) Bill mindful
of this challenge and mindful of the need to ensure that any changes it

first major problem with the Bill, as a consumer protection Bill, is
that half of it is missing. The whole point of having a regulatory
regime is to protect customers, including the vulnerable, and this
depends on being able to enforce that regime. In principle, the 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>idea that all online gambling providers that want to access the UK
market should require a licence is excellent. If we are to follow
through on this protective measure, however, it is imperative that
those online gambling providers that do not have a licence are

noble Lords scrutinise this Bill, however, they will see that this
vital enforcement provision is missing. There is an incentive—a
carrot—for gambling providers to get a licence, which is the
opportunity to advertise, but there is no stick—no means of
preventing unlicenced providers from accessing the UK market. Without a
credible enforcement mechanism, the chief effect of the Bill is
actually further to widen the scope for online gambling operators to
advertise. Bereft of this key component, a Bill that is supposed to be
about consumer protection looks increasingly like the online gambling
liberalisation

the other place, the Minister was pressed as to why the Bill is all
carrot and no stick. Specifically, she was asked why there are no
provisions in the Bill for either IP blocking or financial transaction
blocking. The Minister’s response seemed to be based on a
fundamental misunderstanding about these mechanisms. In the first
instance, she seemed to seek to refute both financial transaction
blocking and IP blocking<Sub>,</Sub><Sub> </Sub>through arguments that
only really pertained to the latter and which did not provide a<Sub>
</Sub>reason not to proceed with financial transaction blocking. In the
second instance, she seemed to operate on the basis that because
neither mechanism is 100% effective they are failures. If we are
concerned to protect British consumers from unregulated providers, we
should want to avail ourselves of the technology that is available.
Even if it was only 50% better, that would be 50% better than doing
nothing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000163">The
implication seemed to be that unless blocking technology is 100%
successful it is a failure, which is rather like saying that because
people wearing seat belts still sadly die in some road traffic
accidents, seat belts are ineffective. The truth is that financial
transaction blocking has been deemed sufficiently useful to be employed
as a tool to protect consumers from unregulated online gambling

Netherlands, Norway and the
USA<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T21:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>. If the

about consumer protection, they must introduce a clear enforcement

second failure of the Bill pertains to the way in which it effectively
liberalises gambling advertising without taking any steps to help the
problem gamblers, who will be made even more aware of online gambling.
To understand that failure, we must understand a failure of current
efforts to help online gamblers today, even before the Bill takes
effect. One of the accepted standards for helping problem gamblers is
self-exclusion. Indeed, a form of self-exclusion is already part of the
UK regulatory regime. Problem gamblers have the option of
self-excluding from gambling providers for a fixed period of, say,
eight months or longer. The provider is then obliged not to serve them
for the 
<?notus-xml column=1234?>duration of the agreed self-exclusion period and to take them off any
marketing list they may be on. This tool works in that, as well as
having weak days, problem gamblers also have strong days. On a strong
day, they will be able to get round the four betting shops in their
town and thus deny themselves the option of gambling for, say, eight
months, during which time they can get help and seek to put their lives
back
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000165">Currently,
however, online problem gamblers are effectively discriminated against
because, although they can self-exclude from gambling websites, they
still have a difficulty. They could self-exclude from four gambling
websites that they can access from home, but they will still be able to
access hundreds, if not thousands, of online gambling websites. It is
simply physically impossible to self-exclude from all those websites.
Unlike the problem gambler who, in a strong period, self-excludes from

current failure, however, is massively compounded by the Bill, because
it proposes increasing the scope for even more online gambling

existing discrimination against online problem gamblers. Happily, there
is something that can be done to address that problem: the provision of
a one-stop shop self-exclusion mechanism. The principle is very simple.

hunt racing, in all the years I have been involved with Cartmel I have

sometimes misunderstood and believed to be some kind of subsidy to
racing; it is of course nothing of the kind. Put simply, it was
established in 1961 with the power and the duty to collect a statutory
levy from the horseracing business of bookmakers and the Tote. In
effect, the mechanism was a recognition that betting operators owed
something to the racing industry for providing the races on which
people liked to
bet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000176">The
majority of the levy income is distributed, as noble Lords have heard,
by the Horserace Betting Levy Board in direct support of horseracing.
That will include improving the breeds of horses, the advancement and
encouragement of veterinary science and veterinary education, integrity

enhances prize money, which in turn generates more levy—and so
the cycle goes
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000177">Parliament’s
original intention when establishing the levy was to provide a means of
compensating racing for the loss of attendance that was anticipated 
<?notus-xml column=1236?>when off-course betting shops were legalised in
1961. As your Lordships have heard, the levy has decreased sharply in
recent years. There are a number of reasons for this but by far the
biggest factor in the leakage of levy can be accounted for by the
bookmaking industry moving to offshore locations to escape the levy.
The consequences of this have been so well described by the noble
Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, that I will not repeat them. Suffice it to

offshore remote betting that escapes the levy is of course
disadvantageous to racing. It is also unfair to the taxpayer and very
unfair on those betting operators who have chosen to remain in the
United Kingdom, as well as those companies which have entered into
voluntary agreements that mitigate forgone levy payment. The Bill
before us will indeed license all remote gambling in Britain at the
point of consumption. What it does not do, as has been said, is to make
any provision in relation to racing or the horserace betting levy. It
is the strong contention of British racing, and my strong contention,
that the Bill provides a perfect opportunity to put this right. Here I
pay tribute to Mr Clive Efford, who put in heroic work in another place
on this subject. The honourable gentleman indeed tabled amendments
which, as your Lordships have heard, would have meant that the levy was
once more payable by remote betting operators. The Government, again as

horses, and my mare drifted out in the betting. Sure enough, she
struggled to keep up with the field and a mile out, I could see that
she looked tired and outclassed. Quite suddenly, coming round the final
bend, she gathered herself and headed with visible courage and
determination through the driving sleet to win by a short head. She was

Morrow (DUP):</Member></B> My Lords, the stated intention of this Bill,
namely that all online gambling providers wanting to access the UK
market, no matter where they are located in the world, should be
required to get a UK Gambling Commission licence, is to be welcomed.
However, detailed examination of the actual provisions in this Bill has
led me to feel that, on balance, the Bill makes matters worse not
better. Indeed, in wrestling with this question one is left with a more
fundamental question: what is the real purpose of this
Bill?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000188">In the
other place the Government claimed, as they have today, that this Bill
is all about consumer protection. It was suggested from other quarters,
however, that the real guiding principle at work was a desire for
greater taxation revenue for the Exchequer. The notion that all online
gambling operators seeking to access the UK market should get a UK
Gambling Commission licence certainly seems like an attempt to protect
UK consumers from providers that do not make the grade. In the first
instance, we should surely stop depending on the regulatory frameworks
of the European Economic Area and the so-called white list
jurisdictions, and regulate providers seeking access to the UK
ourselves. In the second instance, we should certainly do more to
protect UK consumers from providers whose regulatory regimes do not
make the grade, rather than simply putting them on a theoretical black
list.</hs_para>

on the regulatory frameworks of other jurisdictions has had an
unintended consequence. It has meant that online gambling providers
based in the UK could move to the EEA and white-listed jurisdictions,
yet still be deemed to be sufficiently regulated to advertise in the
UK. In this context, all but one online gambling provider relocated to
white-listed jurisdictions where they could pay less tax.</hs_para>

aware that alongside the Bill there is a separate proposal that
henceforth all gambling providers with a UK licence must pay UK tax.
The idea is that we move from regulation and taxation at the point of
supply to regulation and taxation at the point of consumption. Of
course there is no reason why the interests of robust regulation and
robust tax legislation should not go together. I have nothing 
<?notus-xml column=1239?>against making sure that online gambling providers accessing the UK
market are properly taxed. My concern, as I shall explain, is that the
weakness of the regulatory framework proposed by the Bill is such that
it causes me to wonder whether its primary purpose is not actually
being a means to the end of providing a framework on to which the new
taxation regime can be hung.</hs_para>

regard as the three main regulatory failings of the Bill, I shall pause
to reflect on the sad reality of problem gambling in the UK today, the
reason why robust regulation of online gambling is so important. Some
people almost dismiss problem gambling as unimportant—this point
has already been made by others today—on account of the fact
that in 2010 the problem prevalence figure was 0.9%. The truth,
however, is that that accounts for approximately 451,000 people in the
United Kingdom. Moreover, if we are to compute the real significance of
the problem, it is crucial to understand how one person’s
problem gambling affects others. Last year the Gordon Moody
Association, which treats the most serious addicts, estimated that each
addict,</hs_para>

have to understand that gambling online has a significantly higher
problem prevalence figure than gambling generally, another point that
has been made today; the problem prevalence figure for online slots is
actually over 9%.</hs_parafo>

though, are all a bit abstract. When I think of problem gambling, I
think of people such as Lisa Carville, an accountant from Northern
Ireland who stole some £50,000 to feed her online gambling
habits between March 2010 and September 2011. I also think of Michael
Garner, a financial adviser who stole almost £1 million from
friends, a charity and investors to feed his online gambling habit
between December 2011 and May 2012. Anna Mackenzie, defending Mr
Garner, told the court that he was remorseful and understood that his
actions had devastated the lives of himself, his family, his friends
and his victims. She added that his marriage appeared to be over and
that his matrimonial home, his only asset, had been sold to help to pay
off the civil claim made by the investors against him. These are just
two examples of the terrible social devastation that can be left in the
wake of online gambling habits. Let me be very clear: I am not trying
to argue for a split-second that this always happens or that it usually
happens. My point is simply that it does happen and that there is a
very serious obligation on us as legislators to make sure that the
online gambling industry that this Bill addresses is robustly
regulated.</hs_para>

suggest that the Bill has three major weaknesses. The first problem is
that this legislation provides no credible enforcement mechanism. You
cannot say on the one hand that we want to protect British consumers
and so require all online providers that want to access the UK market
to get a UK licence, and at the same time do nothing to prevent those

proposal for financial transaction blocking or IP blocking in another
place, the Minister rejected both, at least for now. I found her
approach profoundly unconvincing. In the first instance, the Government
seem to conflate IP blocking and financial transaction blocking as if
they are the same and have the same results. Let me be very clear: they
are not and they do not. Evidence suggests that financial blocking is
significantly more robust. Indeed, it works well, as has already been
stated, in places such as Belgium, Estonia, France, Hungary, Israel,
Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway and the US, which deem it worth
while.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121787000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000195">In the
second instance, I find the notion of mixed success in the context
rather troubling. I assume by this the Government mean that it does not
always work, which is certainly true, but if in this imperfect world we
rejected all public policy solutions that were not always successful we
would greatly restrict what we could do. The world would be much poorer
on account of the misguided commitment to make excellent the enemy of
the good. If we had a mechanism available that could protect UK
consumers from 50% of transactions with unregulated websites, it would
be a significant step forward—one we should
take.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000196">Moreover,
it is important to remember that financial transaction blocking is
likely to be more successful in the UK than anywhere else, because in
other jurisdictions where there is a closed market with a limited
number of licensees or a semi-open market that allows any number of
licensees but only for some forms of gambling there is a great deal
more that needs to be blocked than in the UK. In these environments,
gamblers have incentives to try to bypass blocking to access forms of
gambling that are not permitted. However, that would not be the case
here in the UK where we do not prohibit any form of gambling and allow
anybody who meets our regulatory standards to access our
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000197">If we
do not back up the licence requirement with financial transaction
blocking, the simple truth is that the primary implication of the Bill
will be simply to allow more gambling providers to advertise in the UK.
All those located in EEA and white-listed jurisdictions can currently
advertise, but after this Bill all providers that get a licence will
also be able to advertise regardless of whether they are based in what
is currently an EEA white-listed or black-listed
jurisdiction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000198">It
is concern about the implication of the Bill for advertising in the
absence of a credible enforcement regime which takes me to the second
major worry about this Bill. While it proposes making problem gamblers
in the UK more aware of online gambling opportunities that can get them
into difficulty, it introduces no compensatory measures to provide
problem gamblers with additional help in the context of the new
environment. To really understand this deficiency in the Bill, however,
one must understand the problem with the current
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000199">One of
the key accepted mechanisms of helping problem gamblers is through the
provision of self-exclusion. Put simply, self-exclusion allows someone
with a gambling problem to take control by self-excluding from gambling
providers for a certain period; say, five 
<?notus-xml column=1241?>or six months, or whatever it might be. This mechanism is credible in an
offline environment. It recognises that people suffering from a
gambling addiction will have days when they are stronger and able to
take steps to try to break free. On such a day it would be possible for
a gambler to visit all five betting shops in his town and self-exclude
for five months, providing him with an opportunity to get help and to
try to put his life back
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T21:45:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000200">This,
however, simply does not work in an online environment because, after
you have self-excluded from five online gambling websites, hundreds if
not thousands of sites are equally available. Denying online gamblers a
credible self-exclusion mechanism is, I believe, a matter of
discrimination, one that exists without the Bill before us today.
Mindful of this current injustice, I find it quite inconceivable that
the Government should consider introducing the Bill, which proposes
widening the scope for problem gamblers to be made aware of online
gambling opportunities, without at the same time providing any
compensatory help for online problem gamblers. We should, at the very
least, provide online gamblers with a credible self-exclusion

the Minister in another place was confronted with this idea, she had
nothing of any great substance to say. She suggested that the industry
was doing a good job and that she wanted to give it more time, although
she failed to outline what it needed time to do. She did not say that
she had asked the industry to introduce a one-stop shop for
self-exclusion. The Minister also made the assertion that introducing a
one-stop shop would be complicated. I have no doubt that introducing a
one-stop shop would present some challenges, but I do not believe that
there is any evidence that they cannot be dealt with. The question that
we have to ask is: can we be bothered to do the additional work to
protect online gamblers? One would hope that the answer to that
question, in considering a Bill that the Government say is all about
consumer protection, would be a positive yes, but apparently not, at

is a UK licensing condition to maintain a register of self-excluders,

Gainsbury is very clear that the technology is present to deliver a
one-stop shop. She cites a program called VeriPlay.com, already

final problem with this Bill relates to the detail of the general UK
regulatory framework. If this legislation becomes law, those websites
currently supplying UK customers that are subject to the regulatory
regimes of the EEA or white-listed jurisdictions will instead be
subject to UK regulation. At the moment, if they decide to relocate
back to the UK, player protection will in some cases be eroded. It is
therefore important that our licensing is amended to provide the same

best EEA or white-listed

a jurisdiction to which some UK online gambling providers relocated,
offers player protection that is superior to the UK licensing regime.
The Alderney Gambling Control Commission gives any player the right to
tell a company the limits on their gambling that they want to set
themselves. This means they can inform a company that they wish to set
such limits to the amount that they can deposit during a specific
period, or to how much they may lose by reference to a number of
gambling transactions or a period during which the amount can be lost.
Setting such personal limits is one way in which gamblers can ensure
that they gamble within their means, without chasing their losses and
without spending too much time gambling. Those are all signs that a
problem is
developing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000207">Just
last week, I visited Sweden on a different matter altogether, but I
want to draw the House’s attention to what happens there.
Players in Sweden are given the option to make use of a technology
called play scan. This helps and guides players in their gambling
activity, warning them about increased addiction or significant changes
in their behavioural activity. The prompts are in the form of green,
yellow and red-light indicators. When a player’s behaviour
changes, a message informs them
immediately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000208">A
further example is in the area of online poker, a style of gambling
which the Swedes have designated as being particularly related
to problem gambling. In Sweden, a player needs to apply for a card,
which has a specific number associated with it. Gamblers authorise the
transfer of funds from a linked account to the card, and any winnings
are paid automatically into the gambler’s account. To play,
customers are required to 
<?notus-xml column=1243?>set time and money limits. The setting of limits is the main function of
the card, but it also offers play management features—including

companies selling into the UK market are licensed and regulated at the
point of consumption, rather than where they are based. This is a major
improvement, which I welcome. However, there is an anomaly here.
Punters can play on remote internet sites on their mobiles or computers
while at home or on the move, in any public place, or even inside a
casino. But casino operators, who often also hold a remote licence, are
not allowed to show or advertise their products in their casinos, or to
show that there is an opportunity to use a computer. This makes
promoted online gambling in a casino illegal—yet not illegal if
unpromoted, if it is on one’s own mobile or computer. That seems
a strange state of affairs. As casinos are the most highly regulated
and inspected of any gaming premises, it looks bizarre. Many of them

However, as my noble friend Lady
Pitkeathley<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T22:00:42"></hs_TimeCode>

of which have operated to very high standards for so many years. We

need for changes in the licensing of remote gambling operators was
identified by the previous Government, and much good work on that issue
was done before the last election. Therefore given what I have said, it
will be clear that we support this modest Bill, in principle, although
there are many areas which we think need to be strengthened, and there
are, as has been pointed out during this debate, a number of rather
alarming

the then Minister for Sport, Mr Gerry Sutcliffe MP, ordered a review of
overseas gambling operators which advertised in the UK. In 2010, the
previous Government began the consultation on extending Gambling
Commission licensing to include online gambling operators which offer
services in the UK. Consultation responses were published after the
general election in July 2010, but it took a full year before the
Government issued a Written Statement on the plans to legislate. The
draft Bill was published in December 2012, and the Select Committee
published its report on the draft Bill in May 2013. Therefore it took
four and a half years and four Ministers, but we have finally got the

was all the waiting about? As the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones,
identified, clearly the loss of taxation revenue is the real driver of
this regulation move. When he comes to respond, perhaps the Minister
could say where things have got to. In August 2013 there were reports
that a deal had been done, and the figure of 15% was mentioned. Of
course it would be quite inappropriate for a mere Minister in a
department to mention taxation, which is a matter reserved for the
Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, perhaps a hint about where we are
on this might not go amiss. The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, made the
point that 
<?notus-xml column=1246?>this shift to a point-of-consumption basis for operating the regulatory
function parallels the change to a point-of-consumption taxation. At
least in his words, that is what is driving the Bill. In order to get
the tax take of about £300 million, which has already been
scored in the Budget accounting, a deal has to be done to introduce
light-touch regulation, otherwise we will frighten the horses—I
am sorry about that metaphor. I hope that we will learn about that in
the Minister’s
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000223">We
have before us—and we can only discuss—this rather slim
five-clause Bill that deals with the licensing of remote gambling at
the point of consumption. That is not contentious: virtually everyone,
including large parts of the gambling industry, although perhaps not

bringing the Bill forward could be understood if it addressed many of
the issues that have come to light since 2007, but it does not do
so.</hs_para>

online gambling, which has grown exponentially over the past few years,
and we accept that revised regulation is necessary. However, the Bill
deals solely with matters that have been under consideration for four
years or more, and over which there is pretty much unanimous agreement.

is enjoyed by more than 56% of the population, and the figure rises to
more than 70% if the purchase of lottery tickets is included. One

Clement-Jones, mentioned, there are still some concerns about other
lottery operators, which could be considered within the Bill. As we
said, we welcome the move to create a level playing field between the
operators which have remained onshore, and those which have moved
offshore, and we would like to make sure that the approach which
removes the divide between them is pursued. But as the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, and the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, have mentioned, we are
worried about the paucity of sanctions included within the Bill, which
are neither financial nor operational. It was the noble Baroness, Lady

across the world has an effective a regime as possible. The noble
Baroness, Lady Heyhoe Flint, made good points on this matter that we
think we would support; we hope she will consider putting down
amendments in Committee. We 
<?notus-xml column=1247?>wonder why the Government have not used or looked again at the Gambling

context it is surprising, as many noble Lords have mentioned, that the
Bill contains no measures to ensure that spread betting is licensed in
the same way as other forms of betting. It is my understanding that
this is because spread betting is seen as primarily a financial
transaction rather than betting in the way it is interpreted in the
Act. Therefore the consequence would be that the regulation should lie
with the FCA. But the logic of this escapes me. Surely it is better for
one body to have overall control in this activity, particularly as we
realise that spread betting is now being provided by companies that
also provide betting services. As was argued in another place, the Bill
should deal with the issue both in terms of principle and practicality.
If there is not to be single responsibility, there should be a common
approach, such as licence conditions mentioned by the noble Baroness,
which we support. Otherwise the information about the cancer of match
fixing will never be
obtained.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121787000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-0003.htm#13121787000228">A

The noble Viscount, Lord Falkland, says it does not matter about
advertising. I fundamentally disagree on this point. Anybody who has
watched television recently would be aware that the amount of
advertising, and the sharpness of it, has now much increased. Although
we had a recent report from Ofcom which described the volume of
advertising and the limits on it due to the restrictions on the
watershed, it is clear that there is a big loophole which needs to be
looked at. This is the situation affecting games that are sports
fixtures that start before 9 pm, for which advertising is allowed, and
therefore which reaches not only problem gamblers but also children. We

My figures said 450,000, but the common consent for those other people
who have mentioned it is 451,000 people who seem to be affected by
problem gambling. I am sure the 1,000 will make a big difference to our
thinking on this matter. On the one hand we have an NHS which provides
support for those who have addiction problems with drink and in other

proposals; they are not relying on the existing model but are not yet
sure about which one they would like to pick. Of course, Governments do
not pick winners; it might be worrying if they did start to do that,
particularly in this area. But, levity aside, this is obviously

course many industries could argue that the betting or gambling

were, of the activity that they are involved in but does not in any
sense put back sufficiently into grass roots or other activities. So
there is a broader discussion here as well as the narrow one about what
to do about the levy. Clearly, something must happen in this area,
whether within the Bill or some time in the very near future. At least

category of unused funds which in many areas there are plans to begin
to use, and it is equally true in the area of gambling. The money could
be put to use for treatment for problem gambling, or support for
education about gambling, perhaps even into grass roots. If the
Government are not ready to legislate for this issue, although they
have said that they would like to, I suggest to the Minister that we
require some information here at least, perhaps from the betting
operators as part of the licence, to record exactly how much and what
they hold in dormant betting accounts and unclaimed winnings, so that,
when or if the Government decide to legislate, they will be able to do

need for a rethink on a number of issues. We need to consider seriously
some amendment to come from all parts of the House, which would make
for a good Committee stage—and from that would come an improved

on the betting levy, a number of your Lordships have raised this. It

football in Britain, is immensely important to many people. I should
declare an interest in that there is a point-to-point course on the
family farm in Kimble and I am very much aware of amateur
racing—so I was particularly interested in the racecourse of my
noble friend Lord Cavendish, where I remember a horse of my grandfather
winning. I also remember the fairground, which was going merrily while
the racing proceeded. It is clear that training yards and racecourses
up and down the country are playing their role in what is a huge part
of the rural economy. The noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, mentioned
members of her family. I have sat on horses and ridden, probably behind
a pack of hounds, with her
son-in-law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T22:14:33"></hs_TimeCode>. The

debate on 15 October this year, introducing this legislation
specifically for those seriously injured service and ex-service
personnel resident in Northern Ireland who are entitled to an Armed
Forces independence payment, or AFIP. This legislation provides access
to additional benefits, schemes and services, known as passported
benefits. The Motion was passed by the Committee but, due to a
procedural error in the progress of the statutory instrument in the
other place, the legislation must be debated again before it can come
into force.</hs_para>

been available to seriously injured service and ex-service personnel
resident in Northern Ireland, the legislative changes to provide access
to passported benefits have not been implemented. A second statutory
instrument, amending secondary legislation, will be in place shortly.
Today’s debate gives Members a second opportunity to debate this
legislation. It provides access to two minor but important legislative
changes in respect of carer’s allowance and the Christmas
bonus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000005">This
legislative change will ensure that those who provide invaluable
support to seriously injured members of the Armed Forces in receipt of
AFIP have access to carer’s allowance in Northern Ireland from
the Department for Social Development. Carer’s allowance is
currently £59.75 per week. This change will make provision
specifically for those who devote their lives to supporting our
seriously injured people, providing some financial support for doing
so. It is only right that a person caring for an AFIP recipient should
have 
<?notus-xml column=256?>access to carer’s allowance. The provisions relating to the
Christmas bonus will ensure that all recipients of AFIP automatically
qualify for the tax-free, lump sum Christmas bonus of
£10.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000006">By
putting in place the provisions to give AFIP recipients resident in
Northern Ireland access to the additional benefits, schemes

treatment equal to that offered to service personnel and veterans
resident elsewhere in the UK. It is important that we address these
issues, meeting the principles at the heart of the covenant across all

Empey (UUP):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister will know that my
interest in these matters goes back to the passage of the Armed Forces
Bill in 2011, when a number of amendments were discussed in relation to
ensuring that the military covenant was applied universally throughout
the United Kingdom, particularly in Northern Ireland. One of the points
made at that time was that many of the services that are required to be
provided for soldiers, former soldiers and their families are devolved
matters in different parts of the United Kingdom. The question then
arose: how could the Secretary of State for Defence prepare and deliver
a report to Parliament, given that he or she would not be in control of
many of the services required in the regions? It was also based on the
general principle that these services should be as universally
available to eligible personnel throughout the UK as
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000008">There
are a couple of aspects to this. I understand the technical matters
that the Minister has addressed, and the fact that the legislation has
had to be reintroduced. However, I seek the Minister’s assurance
on a couple of issues. First, the welfare issues are currently before
the Northern Ireland Assembly. I have no doubt that amendments will be
tabled in that Chamber. Whether they affect any of this is unclear, but
sooner or later the Welfare Reform Bill will be passed in Stormont, and
then we will see where that takes us. Any amendments may well involve a
cost to the Northern Ireland Assembly from the block grant. I think
people realise that is the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000009">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:35:29"></hs_TimeCode>
issue that concerns me more than that is that the Minister is saying
that the Government have received the consent of Northern Ireland
Ministers from the relevant departments for these proposals. Does that
mean that the Government will require a legislative consent Motion to
come from the Stormont Government or the Assembly, or is there
sufficient administrative flexibility for Ministers in Northern
Ireland, on their own, to give the Minister and the department the
assurances they
seek<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:36:03"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000010">The
second point is one I made during the passage of the Armed Forces Bill,
and I know the Minister is aware of my concern. Although the
fact—if it is the case—that he has the consent of
Northern Ireland Ministers is welcome, Ministers in various departments
will change from time to time. Therefore, the consent of Ministers
cannot be guaranteed in the long term. 
<?notus-xml column=257?>What does the Ministry of Defence do in the event of a Minister refusing
his or her consent? That was a point I made during the passage of the
Bill. In the short term there is no problem; however, in the long term
there may well be
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000011">I
therefore seek an assurance from the Minister that the Government will
take all necessary steps, legislatively if necessary, to ensure that
the services provided to injured personnel and their families will be
provided throughout the United Kingdom, even if there is opposition
from the local Administrations. I fear that a pattern has developed
whereby we are hiding behind the Sewel convention, to the extent that
it is now regarded as a shibboleth. Is Parliament devolving powers or
giving them away permanently to local Administrations? That is a big
issue for devolution
generally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000012">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>
specific issue before us is that currently the consent of Ministers in
Belfast is required. I understand that. At the moment, it appears that
that consent is being given, and I am glad about that, but in the long
term it might not be. I say to the Minister that when the next Armed
Forces Bill is introduced, which I gather will be around 2016, I would
be willing to bring forward proposals to correct any difficulties that
might arise because the ministerial team in Belfast had, by then,
changed. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:39:42"></hs_TimeCode>
issue that concerns me could arise—we have seen it already with

feel very strongly about this issue. The House accepted, during the
passage of the Armed Forces Bill, that regardless of where they come
from or live in the United Kingdom, the services provided to help
former soldiers and service personnel who have served in the UK Armed
Forces should be available as equally as possible. Nobody should suffer
discrimination because they happen to come from a devolved region. This
is Parliament’s responsibility, because the Armed Forces are an
excepted matter under devolution. In my opinion, it will never be a
devolved issue. Therefore, this Parliament has an overarching
responsibility to see that these services are provided on an equitable
basis, irrespective of where the recipient comes from. I seek the
Minister’s assurances on all these
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000014"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:39:41"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Rosser" PimsId="462" UID="13121756000120" xid="1693" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000120">Lord

Astor (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, electronic cigarettes are tubes
that simulate the effect of smoking. Some e-cigarettes contain
nicotine, but importantly they do not contain tobacco. Inside an
e-cigarette is a small computer chip, a lithium battery, a heating
element and a cartridge filled with water containing dissolved
pharmaceutical-grade nicotine. You take a puff and the heater fires up
the element to around 150 degrees centigrade, which heats the liquid in
the cartridge so that it can evaporate. You inhale and that gives a
so-called nicotine hit. You then exhale what looks like smoke but is in
fact water vapour. E-cigarettes are regarded by some as a new and
dangerous nicotine habit, but by others as a successful way to quit
smoking. The truth is perhaps somewhere in the middle, but it is clear
that e-cigarettes are here to stay. The market is expected to grow from
£1 billion this year to £10 billion over the
next five years. It is unregulated at the point of sale in this
country, as it is in most countries
worldwide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:01:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000022">There
has been a recent attempt by the European Commission, which introduced
a draft directive, backed by this Government, to regulate electronic
cigarettes as medicines, but the proposal was thrown out by the
European Parliament. A majority in the European Parliament supported
using a mixture of tobacco regulation, controls on promotion and the
reporting of adverse reactions. I understand that negotiations are
continuing right up to today, and I hope that the Minister will be able
to give us notice of any
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:01:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

encouraged e-cigarette producers voluntarily to seek a licence for
their products so that they can meet standards of safety and quality
and be sold on prescription. Can the Minister say how many of the
companies that produce and sell e-cigarettes have signed up to the
voluntary code, and how many are estimated not to have signed up?
Perhaps he could also confirm what the cost of validation might be for
producers complying with a medical directive. I understand that it
would be more than
£250,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:02:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
This would put most of the smaller suppliers out of business and hand
the industry over to the large tobacco companies, thus perhaps stifling

London on the M4, one can see three new vast advertising hoardings
promoting e-cigarettes. Do the Government approve of this kind of
advertising, which would not be allowed for normal cigarettes? There is
a difficult issue here because most e-cigarettes are made up with 5%
nicotine, but some, probably 10% of the market, have no nicotine in
them at all. They are, for example, cherry or bubblegum flavoured. Some
look like cigarettes and some like pencils, while others look like a
pipe end without a pipe. If they wanted to regulate, how would the
Government regulate an e-cigarette that contains no nicotine? Indeed,
is it an e-cigarette, is it a toy or is it something
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:03:17"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

e-cigarettes can be sold to children. Does the Minister believe that
there should be an age limit, or will we see school playgrounds full of
puffing children—or perhaps I should say even more full of
children puffing? If so, would it be illegal for them to puff an
e-cigarette that does not contain any nicotine?  
<?notus-xml column=260?>After all, what comes out of an e-cigarette is just harmless vapour, not
smoke. Most e-cigarettes are made in China, with the nicotine and other
flavours mainly being manufactured there. Is there any form of
inspection regime for the importation of this nicotine

America that e-smoking is on the increase, but not necessarily that
e-cigarettes are a gateway to smoking, although it is estimated that
the US has around 2.5 million users. We do know that nicotine is an
addictive drug, and this new invention could set some on the path to
nicotine addiction, but that is nicotine in very small amounts, which
is hardly harmful in comparison with the danger of and damage caused by
smoking. E-cigarettes could save the lives of millions of smokers by
weaning them off normal cigarettes. They are a welcome aid to smokers
trying to quit; for example, those who have failed with nicotine
chewing gum or the patches. The value of the health gains associated
with a single successful quit attempt is very substantial, and the
Government’s own Department of Health estimates it at more than
£70,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000027">This
is the dilemma facing health experts, policymakers and

to home, ASH—Action on Smoking and Health—supports the
use of licensed nicotine products as an aid to cutting down or quitting
smoking, and as a substitute for smoking. They satisfy the desire to
smoke, help cut down on cigarettes and, of course, eradicate the smell
of stale smoke and the effect of passive smoking on anybody nearby.
Most diseases associated with smoking are caused by inhaling smoke,
which contains thousands of toxic chemicals. As I have said, by

question to my noble friend the Minister is: do we have to wait until
the European Commission and European Parliament finally agree—if
they ever do—or can the Government introduce sensible

use, they will increase the costs to health in this country and miss an

I visited the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, which I think is
the largest trade exhibition in the world, in January this year, I saw
about 200 Chinese manufacturers of e-cigarettes open for business.
There is a tide of these things coming. They were the most common new
product at the show after iPhone cases. One could wish that they would
just go away, but of course they will not. So I congratulate my noble

are addicted to nicotine but it is the tar that kills them. This seems
well established. However, part of the addiction to cigarettes is not
just the chemical nicotine but the handling of a cigarette, the
sociability and the feel of it. Certainly, e-cigarettes provide a
substitute for some of these sensations. They seem a reasonable and
less dangerous product than conventional
cigarettes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000034">The
trouble is that we are fighting the battle against the killer tobacco
on three fronts: on cost, by increasing consumption taxes; with
education at earlier stages to ensure those likely to start smoking,
namely teenagers, are aware of the risks involved; and by making
cigarettes abnormal, by keeping them locked behind shutters  at
the supermarket and with other proposals such  as plain
packaging. It seems that the third front, denormalisation, is at least
as powerful as the other two. The concern is that e-cigarettes can undo
a lot of the good work that has been done to make smoking an unusual
habit and smokers akin to pariahs. If it is okay to smoke e-cigarettes,
will it become okay to smoke normal ones again? Will users ever kick
the habit of enjoying nicotine and holding a
cigarette?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000035">Another
important question must be addressed: what are e-cigarettes? Do they
contain just nicotine and vapour, or anything else at all? This seems
to call for regulation as a simple product, to ensure quality. Will my
noble friend the Minister encourage his department to sponsor some
research into the effects of nicotine alone? It is said to be dangerous
to those with a heart problem or to pregnant women, but the truth is
that there has not been enough research on the subject to be
sure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000036">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:09:32"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to understand how e-cigarettes  are changing the
behaviour of smokers of conventional cigarettes. ASH has reported that
as many as  1.3 million people occasionally use
e-cigarettes and that 400,000 people are using e-cigarettes
in total or partial replacement of normal cigarettes. That is great
news.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000037">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:12:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:10:05"></hs_TimeCode>
danger people spot is that children might become more likely to take up
normal cigarettes after trying e-cigarettes. We cannot tell if that is
so, because there has been not been any research on it, but logic
suggests otherwise. Teenagers smoke cigarettes to look cool, and
e-cigarettes are not cool—they are about giving up an addiction.
No teenager wants to look as though they are giving up something: they
want to look as though they have no problems.</hs_para>

choosing today for this short debate, my noble friend Lord Astor has
shown a downright astonishing ability to predict the future, because a
provisional deal was reached last night in Brussels between MEPs and
national Governments on a new tobacco products directive. Martin
Callanan MEP has said that this directive will take the majority of
e-cigarettes off the market. It would restrict all but the weaker
e-cigarettes, even though smokers who are considering using
e-cigarettes to break their addiction tend to begin on stronger
e-cigarettes and gradually reduce their usage. Making stronger
e-cigarettes harder to come by will encourage smokers to stay on
tobacco. Among the points made in the draft directive, paragraph 3.7

Lord Astor, on securing this debate. It is an issue of much greater
importance than the sparse attendance might imply and one that is
growing in importance. I have no interest to declare in electronic
cigarettes: I dislike smoking and have never done it. I have only once
tried a puff on an e-cigarette, which did nothing for me. I am
interested in this issue as a counterproductive application of the
precautionary principle. I should say that I am indebted to Ian Gregory

are, at the moment, about 1 million people in this country using
electronic cigarettes, and there has been an eightfold increase in the
past year in the number of people using them to try to quit smoking.
Already, 15% of ex-smokers have tried them, and they have overtaken
nicotine patches and other approaches 
<?notus-xml column=263?>to become the top method of quitting in a very short time. The majority
of those who use electronic cigarettes to try to quit smoking say that
they are
successful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000044">Here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:14:05"></hs_TimeCode>

only 10% of the 1 million users in the country are successful in
quitting, that would save £7 billion, according to the

who thinks that licensing will create extra quit attempts? By adding to
the cost of e-cigarettes, by reducing advertising and by unglamorising
them, it is far more likely that licensing will create fewer quit

a policy of licensing e-cigarettes would have to reduce quit attempts

patches are also used to reduce smoking and they have been medicinally
regulated, but there has been extraordinarily little innovation in them
and low take-up over the years. Does the Minister agree with the report
by Professor Peter Hajek in the <I>Lancet</I> earlier this year, which
said that the 30-year failure of nicotine patches demonstrated how the
expense and delays caused by medicinal regulation can stifle
innovation? Does my noble friend also agree with analysts from Wells

stifled,</hs_para>

should try a thought experiment. Let us divide the country in two. In
one half—let us call it east Germany for the sake of
argument—we regulate e-cigarettes as medicines, ban their use in
public places, restrict advertising, ban the sale of refillable
versions, and ban the sale of e-cigarettes stronger than 20
milligrams per millilitre. In the other half, which we will call west
Germany, we leave them as consumer products, properly regulated as
such, allow them to be advertised as glamorous, allow them on trains
and in pubs, allow the sale of refills, allow the sale of flavoured
ones, and allow stronger products. In which of these two parts of the
country would smoking fall fastest? It is blindingly obvious that the
east would see higher prices—and prices are a serious deterrent
to attempts to quit smoking because many of the people who smoke are
poorer than the average. We would see less product innovation, slower
growth of e-cigarette use and more people going back to real cigarettes
because of their inability to get hold of the type, flavour and
strength that they wanted. Therefore, more people would quit smoking in
the western half of the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000047">What
are the drawbacks of such a policy? There is a risk of harm from
electronic cigarettes, as we have heard. How big is that risk? The
Minister confirmed to me in a Written Answer earlier this year that the
best evidence suggests that they are 1,000 times less dangerous than
cigarettes. The MHRA impact assessment

turning to real cigarettes. Just think about that for a second. For
every child who goes from cigarettes to electronic cigarettes, there
would there have to be 1,000 going the other way, from e-cigarettes to
cigarettes, for this to do any net harm. The evidence suggests, as my
noble friend Lord Borwick has said, that the gateway is the other way.
Some 20% of 15 year-olds smoke, and evidence from ASH and a study in
Oklahoma suggests strongly that when young people use electronic
cigarettes they do so to quit, just like adults do.</hs_para>

precautionary approach to the risks of nicotine, will the Minister
consider regulating aubergines as medicines? They also contain
nicotine. If you eat 10 grams of aubergine, which you easily could with
a plateful of moussaka, you will absorb the same amount of nicotine as
if you shared a room with a cigarette smoker for three hours. It is not
an insignificant quantity. That is data from the <I>New England Journal
of Medicine</I> in 1993. If we are worried about unknown and small
risks, can the Minister explain to me why, as Professor Hajek, put it,
more dangerous chemicals, such as bleach, rely on packaging and common

licensing?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000050">There
has been approximately an 8% reduction in the use of tobacco in Europe
in the past year. The tobacco companies are worried. A big part of that
reduction seems to be because of the rapid take-up of electronic
cigarettes. They are facing their Kodak moment—the moment when
their whole technology is replaced by a rival technology that, in this
case, is 1,000 times safer. Does my noble friend think that there may
be a connection between the rise of electronic cigarettes, the rapid

the medicinal regulation of electronic

tobacco; big pharma has shown significant interest in the regulation of
electronic cigarettes. That is not surprising because they are, again,
a rival to patch products and other nicotine replacement therapies.
Perhaps more surprising is that much of the medical establishment is in
favour of medicinal regulation. I never thought I would live to see the
BMA and the tobacco industry on the same side of an argument. The BMA
says that electronic cigarettes cannot be considered a lower-risk
option, but this completely flies in the face of the evidence. As we
have heard already, electronic cigarettes are 1,000 times safer. The
BMA says that it is worried about passive vaping, the renormalising of
smoking and the use of electronic cigarettes as a gateway to smoking.
The excellent  
<?notus-xml column=265?>charity Sense About Science, to which I am proud to be an adviser, has
asked the BMA for evidence to support those assertions. I must say that
there is a strong suspicion that the only reason the medical
establishment wants to see these things regulated as medicines is
because it cannot bear to see the commercial sector achieving more in a
year in terms of getting people off cigarettes than the public sector
has achieved in
10<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:21:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Instead of
talking about regulating this product, should we not be talking about
encouraging it, promoting it and letting people vape indoors if they
want to—in pubs, on trains and in football
grounds—specifically so that they are tempted to vape instead of
smoke? That would be of enormous benefit to them and to the country as

asking specifically in relation to the agreement that, as we heard from
my noble friend Lord Borwick, was agreed last night, what its impact
will be on what is happening, and in particular on advertising. As I
understand it, under the agreement reached yesterday, it will be
possible for the advertising of these things to be banned as if they
were cigarettes. What is the justification for that, given the
proportionality and the evidence that they will actually save lives
rather than harm
them?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_17_PT_1/E200E326C58D8E68D81F6B943217603C6F49B215" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 December 2013">Tuesday,

than 100,000 people dying from smoking-related diseases across Britain
every year, it is clear that we need to do all we can to support people
to give up smoking and discourage young people from taking it up in the
first place. One thing I am convinced about is that e-cigarettes have
the potential to provide a significant boost to public health. I
understand that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence
supports the use of nicotine-containing products such as e-cigarettes
to aid smokers in cutting down on tobacco. As we have heard, an

the comments of the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, on the risks of
regulation, and I agree with him that it is important that regulation

fast-emerging product, some additional safeguards may be needed to
cover any gaps in our existing consumer regulations. I want to ask the
noble Earl, Lord Howe, about this. Does he consider that the medicinal
regulation of e-cigarettes would put a lot of the current e-cigarette
companies out of business? The noble Earl is of course very well
acquainted with the work of the MHRA, issues to do with the regulation
of medicines and, indeed, herbal medicines, which may be relevant in

the noble Lord, Lord Borwick, has commented, e-cigarettes have clearly
been very successful in encouraging smokers to quit and to use
e-cigarettes instead. He posed the question of whether there are
circumstances in which e-cigarettes could be a passport to tobacco

some of the marketing approaches of the e-cigarette manufacturers might
provide a cool image to young people, who would take up e-cigarettes
and then be tempted to go on to tobacco products. I do not know whether
the noble Lord, Lord Borwick, saw the complaints made about an advert

we have heard, e-cigarettes are nicotine-containing devices that work
by atomising a nicotine solution which is then breathed in as a vapour
by the user. E-cigarettes claim to deliver nicotine to the user without
the toxins and carcinogens found in tobacco smoke. They do not involve
any combustion and do not produce smoke. E-cigarettes are a very recent
innovation. They are available in various shapes and sizes, as we have
heard, and many are designed to both look and feel like conventional
cigarettes. Some even incorporate a light at the end of the device that
glows when the product is being used, to replicate a cigarette. Today, 
<?notus-xml column=267?>they are marketed as a cheaper and healthier alternative to smoking
tobacco. However, e-cigarette manufacturers have avoided directly
suggesting that their products are smoking cessation aids, as making
such claims would subject their products to regulation as
medicines.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000062">I
turn to whether e-cigarettes are safe to use. When we compare the use
of e-cigarettes to smoking of tobacco, the Department of Health is
confidently able to say that e-cigarettes are likely to be much safer
to use. That does not mean that e-cigarettes are safe to use; it
probably says more about how enormously unsafe it is to smoke tobacco.
Nevertheless, the safety of e-cigarettes is yet to be fully
established. Given how novel these products are, we need to see much
more evidence about their safety, especially regarding the use of
e-cigarettes over a long
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000063">At
present, e-cigarettes are sold without any product-specific controls
relating to quality and safety in use, or specific provisions on
advertising and promotion. There are general product safety provisions
that apply to these products, but they are not designed for these sorts
of product and are not fit for this purpose. We also must keep in mind
that nicotine itself is not only highly addictive but can be highly
toxic. Electronic cigarettes are not risk-free. Known and reported
health risks include acute effects on lung function, possible pneumonia
and other risks related to poor product
quality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121756000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121756000064">My
noble friend Lord Astor made reference to Action on Smoking and Health.
ASH says that there is significant variation in device effectiveness,
nicotine delivery and cartridge nicotine content, both between and
sometimes within product brands. ASH cites research that suggests the
presence of toxins, released in low concentrations, from the
vaporisation process involving certain e-cigarette cartridges. It cites
other research that concluded that e-cigarettes have a low toxicity
profile, are well tolerated and are associated only with mild adverse
effects.</hs_para>

we have heard during this debate, the e-cigarette market is growing
rapidly. More than 300 companies are estimated to be importing or
supplying e-cigarettes in the United Kingdom. The e-cigarette market in
the UK is estimated to be worth in excess of £100 million, and
we know that across the world the tobacco industry is becoming
increasingly involved. There is little doubt that awareness of
e-cigarettes has increased quickly through advertising and promotion of
these products. It has been said that e-cigarettes are being promoted
in similar ways to how cigarettes were promoted before we introduced a
comprehensive ban on tobacco advertising in this country. I am sure
that I am not alone in noticing the vast amount of promotion for
e-cigarettes in my local convenience store, or the representatives of

in Great Britain in 2013, 95% of 11 to 14 year-olds and 90% of 16 to

people, e-cigarette use appears to be confined to those who have
already tried smoking. Nevertheless, we remain concerned that
e-cigarettes could quickly become popular with young people,

smoking illness and death is to encourage smokers to quit completely,
there are other ways of reducing the harm from smoking, even though
this may involve the continued use of nicotine. If someone does not
want to, is not ready to or is unable to stop smoking in one step, the

The problem is that there is not good evidence of effectiveness. These

we feel that we want to exploit the potential that we see in them. He
referred to aubergines as potential medicines. I think he would agree
with me that people do not eat aubergines in the expectation that that
will help them to quit smoking. Clearly, whatever remedy we encourage

e-cigarettes. Moving forward, the Government will want to be satisfied
that the directive can deliver the right checks and balances on
e-cigarettes. It is important to underscore the fact that there is a
wide consensus across the European Commission, the European Parliament
and European member states that additional regulatory safeguards are
needed for this relatively new category of product. We are listening

report, <I>Towards a Financial Transaction Tax?</I>. That report found
the Commission’s proposals seriously wanting, and likely to fail
the five objectives that the Commission had set itself. We contended
then that there was a significant threat of relocation of financial
activity outside the EU as well as the City of London, were the FTT to
go live. You would have imagined that we would have rejoiced when the
proposals for such an EU-wide FTT later ran into the sand—far
from it. Let me

June 2012, a breakaway group of 11 member states, led by France and
Germany, announced their intention to proceed with an FTT under the
enhanced co-operation procedure, whereby nine or more member states can
take a proposal forward without binding those who do not wish to
participate. The UK Government made clear, with my committee’s
support, that they would not participate. However, we were deeply
alarmed that the proposal could nevertheless have a serious detrimental
impact on the UK. We grew even more agitated when the Council vote
approving use of the enhanced co-operation procedure went ahead without
a text having been published—a veritable case of buying a pig in

weeks later, on 14 February 2013, the Commission did indeed publish its
detailed proposal, but the revised version included new and disturbing
anti-avoidance provisions, including the significant issuance
principle. When we took evidence from Commission official Manfred
Bergmann in March 2013, he told us, to our open-mouthed astonishment,
that there would be no legal obligation on UK authorities to collect
the new tax. This contradicted our view that the United Kingdom could
indeed be obliged to collect the tax on behalf of participating member
states under the EU regime, which requires all member states to assist
each other in the recovery of tax. In our view, the proposal failed to
meet the key criterion for enhanced co-operation, which requires that
any proposal must respect the competences, rights and obligations of
all non-participating member states.</hs_para>

light of these significant developments, we undertook this short update
inquiry, taking evidence from Heinz Zourek, Director-General, Taxation

view, the Commission has failed to demonstrate that it has taken full
account of the interests of non-participating member states. The
Commission confessed that it had brought forward a deliberately
contentious proposal with the studied intention of challenging
participating member states to excise those elements they found
inimical—an unworthy and divisive tactic. Moreover, it
undermines the Commission’s obligations to defend the interests
of all member states and throws into doubt use of the enhanced
co-operation tool in the future—a significant by-product of this
study. In contrast, we found the Council Legal Service opinion highly
persuasive. It demonstrates in concrete terms how the proposal would
breach European Union law in respect of the integrity of the single
market. Moreover, we jib at the Commission’s artificial

Vallance of Tummel (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I simply want to
reinforce one specific point that has just been made by the noble Lord,
Lord Harrison. Our report raises an important issue concerning the
deployment of the enhanced co-operation procedure itself. The FTT case
is only the third time the procedure has been used since it came into
being in 1999, but it could well become more commonplace in a future
where different groups of EU nations wish to take different courses, or
proceed more quickly than
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121760000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121760000012">In
the FTT case, the use of the procedure has left a bad taste in the
mouth. When it was put to the vote last January, I imagine that, in
abstaining, our Government naively assumed that the terms of the tax to
be adopted would mirror those the Commission had already put forward
and which had failed to find favour with many states, including the UK.
But as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, has said, the proposal
the Commission advanced only three weeks later was significantly
different, not least in its assertion of the twin principles of
“deemed establishment” and “issuance”. That
combination of principles could clearly have a major impact on
financial institutions in non-participating and third-party countries
which could not have been foreseen at the time of the
vote.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121760000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121760000013">It seems
unlikely that the Commission was entirely unaware of the principles and
their potential impact when the vote took place. Was this a matter of
oversight or deviousness on the part of the Commission and sponsoring
countries? Who knows? However, one can imagine that had the boot been
on the other foot and a principal sponsor had been the UK, tales of
Albion’s traditional perfidy would have been doing the rounds in
the corridors of Brussels. This has not been one of the European
Union’s finest hours and I say so sadly, as a strong
supporter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121760000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121760000014">As
to the lessons for the future, whatever the outcome of the FTT
proposal, the enhanced co-operation procedure needs to be tidied up,
made more robust and be seen to be fair. Put simply, all significant
cards need to be face-up on the table when a vote is taken to adopt it.
Ideally, a fully fledged scheme should be worked up and open to
scrutiny before a vote is taken, accompanied by a thorough impact
assessment that distinguishes between participating and
non-participating countries, and with an analysis of any
extra-territorial consequences. Without a reformed approach along these
lines, what could be a useful and effective procedure will simply fall
into disrepute. That is not in the interests of the European Union or
its member states and I hope that, when the dust has settled on the
specific FTT issue, the Government will take the initiative in calling

Dear (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, on securing this debate. My contribution, like that of
others, will necessarily be short and I will take a broad brush to this
issue. I am a member of the EU Select Committee and of the Economic and
Financial Affairs Sub-Committee, which conducted this inquiry. I think
I speak for all of us 
<?notus-xml column=274?>when I say that we considered the financial transaction tax looking for
a kernel of benefit to this country, and we looked for a scintilla of
logic behind the imposition of the tax. What we found, it is fair to
say, was instead a desire to generate revenue quickly and to punish the
financial institutions that it was thought had landed the whole of
Europe—indeed, perhaps the whole world —into the
sort of financial difficulties that we now experience.</hs_para>

legitimacy of the tax itself and the tax’s impact on the
financial markets, particularly, for example, on high-frequency
trading. The consequences, as the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, has said,
would include damage to the City: if the tax comes into being, it will
almost certainly drive business away to places such as New York, Hong
Kong and Singapore. Then there is the impact, as has already been said,
on the 17 non-participating states and perhaps even on the whole of the
EU. To put it another way, enhanced co-operation, on this occasion at
least, seems to be the minority dictating to the majority, to the

were disappointed by the slow take-up by Her Majesty’s

adopted by the EU, which was typified in the evidence that was given to
us on 19 March by Manfred Bergmann, the director of indirect
taxation and tax administration at the EU— DG TAXUD is
the acronym. Mr Bergmann seemed to take a particularly benign view of
what would happen, and his evidence on the impact of the issuance

surprising. We welcomed the fact that the Council’s own legal

Hamilton of Epsom (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, one of the reasons
given for the introduction of the financial transaction tax is to
punish the banks. This is a populist idea into which, I am afraid, our
Government have also fallen. We do not want to punish the
banks,  
<?notus-xml column=275?>we want to punish the bankers. The problem is that the bankers have all
now gone, taking with them their bonuses and severance pay, and we are
left with the banks, which we want to rebuild and whose balance sheets
we want to get stronger. Instead, we impose levies on them and ask them
for better borrowing ratios and to build up their reserves. When they
are trying to do this, as well as dealing with a loan book that is
looking a bit dodgy, we then complain bitterly that they are not
lending to small and medium-sized enterprises. I am afraid that you
cannot have it all ways round and we have to do something to encourage
our banks to strengthen their balance sheets rather than tax them,
which is of course what we would be doing with the financial
transaction
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:03:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121765000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000002">This
morning we were debating in our committee what the priorities were for
the EU. One of the areas identified was tackling the serious problem of
unemployment, which looks to be structural in the EU today, and in
particular the very high levels of youth unemployment. So what do we
do? We introduce the financial transaction tax, which seems to be
coming down the road and, according to an impact assessment conducted
by the Commission, will cost 1.76% of gross domestic product in the EU
and 500,000 jobs. Since then, the Commission has said, “No, that
is not accurate”. Okay, I will take half of that:
perhaps we will see GDP depressed by 0.85% and it will cost only
250,000 jobs. That is all right then, isn’t it? It
will cost a fortune and do everything to counter the
objectives of the EU such as bringing down unemployment—it will
actually increase unemployment. This is the extraordinary way that this
Commission
operates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121765000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000003">Many
of your Lordships have been to Brussels. Do we ever hear the people in
the Commission talking about how they will make the EU more competitive
and how they will deal with the challenges from the global marketplace?
No, they are always talking about themselves and as if the EU was the
centre of the universe, which to an increasing extent it is not. The EU
is facing up to a diminishing share of world trade as time progresses,
and it is time that it started to look outwards rather than inwards,
and work out how it will face these challenges. The impact assessment
thoroughly analysed that a lot of this business will be pushed abroad,
and that is why it will cost so many
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

gentleman from the Directorate General of Taxation and Customs Union,
did we not? We asked him, “What are you going to do about
getting these other stock exchanges and so on to collect this
tax?”. “Oh”, he said, “We are going to
incentivise them to collect this money”. We said,
“Really? How are we going to do that?”. He said,
“We will allow them to keep the interest on the tax that they
have collected for six months”. What world is this so-called
intelligent man living in? Does he really think that the United States
will collect taxes for foreign countries? It is quite unbelievable, and
this is the real problem behind all this. I cannot imagine why anyone
would want to stay in the EU, and I am glad that we will have an
opportunity to get out of it  in 2017.</hs_para>

Carter of Coles (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble

Dear, I take a wide view of this but want to focus on a couple of
issues around the Treasury’s response, globalisation and the
unreality of the course being proposed. We would all like to see a
financial transaction tax that spans the globe, but it is totally
impractical, as is such a tax that is driven by 11 members

various arguments around specific concerns but we need to look at the
unintended consequences of domestic legislation in a global financial
world in which we have often seen ingenuity outrunning regulation. It
is the lot of this market that it is ingenious and finds ways around
things. As a precedent, we need only look at what happened in Europe in
the 1960s, when the famous Regulation Q from the United States drove
business offshore; it just shifted and created the Eurodollar market in
the UK. It was a great achievement, and it is on that that
London’s success is based. It is therefore rather strange that
we are looking and not learning from those sorts of lessons.
Inevitably, this activity will be driven offshore, and it will take
with it jobs, data centres and all those things because these people
need to be near the source of the power that drives it. The market will
go to Hong Kong, Singapore and New
York<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:07:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121765000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000007">While
other noble Lords have dealt with issues of enhanced co-operation and
so on, I should like to focus on the issue before the Treasury. As our
report shows, despite repeatedly calling the attention of the Treasury
to the threats posed by the FTT, it was only in May that we had
recognition of the issue and the concession that significant economic
impact would result. I normally have a high opinion of Her
Majesty’s Treasury but I have to say that on this occasion it
was rather like the proverbial dog watching television: it could see it
but did not get it. I hope now that the Treasury has got it because,
unless there is an understanding of the consequences of the FTT, we
will be in a serious

forward. One of the great successes of Britain in the post-war era was
its re-emergence as the great centre of finance. That was driven by the
Eurodollar. It is rather ironic that the people who drove it forward
were, in fact, Harold Wilson and Lord Cromer. They understood the prize
to be won, grasped it and created what now is a major source of
national wealth. It would be slightly ironic if this market-friendly
Government were unable to moderate or prevent the FTT. It would be
interesting to hear from the Minister how we are going to preserve our
place as the leading financial centre of the world.</hs_para>

for the millions who own or trade shares but for those who have
pensions. Almost everyone will be affected directly or indirectly. This
is the thin end of the wedge, the slippery slope: a direct tax on
individuals. Even worse, it is 11 countries attempting to tax
individuals—nationals of countries outside their group and their

this country and our citizens will not be adversely affected. I will
just have time to address this if I borrow a little of the time of the

objectives—I will not read them all—as laid out. On
objective (a), as far as I am aware, there is currently no
fragmentation to worry about. Objective (b) talks about the costs of
the recent crisis. None of what we are talking about, or the bank

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I start by
congratulating my colleagues, who did 90% of the work on this report
before I joined the committee, on having done some sound work and
having revealed, way ahead of the Commission or the Government
realising it, the impact on non-participating states of this
proposal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:17:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=279?><hs_para UID="13121765000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000021">By the way, the
Government’s position is quite absurd. Most reasonable, sensible
people litigate  only when they feel very strongly about
something. If they feel strongly about something they are
given the opportunity to vote on, they vote against. This
Government succeeded in abstaining and then in starting litigation.
Their credibility is pretty
small<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:17:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121765000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000022">In my brief time, I
will summarise in four propositions what I feel about this proposal,
about which I do not take as tragic a view as many of my colleagues.
The first proposition is that all taxes are unpopular. Any new tax
produces an outcry, sometimes hysterical, from those who are going to
be, or might be, impacted. One has to keep one’s cool against
that noise.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121765000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000023">Secondly, all taxes
have perverse economic consequences. I say to the noble Lord, Lord
Hamilton, that all taxes, as a first-order effect, reduce GDP because
they reduce demand. Whether they ultimately have a negative effect on a
net basis depends on how that money is spent by the taxing authority.
However, direct taxes are enormously dangerous because they impact
directly on incentives to work, to save, to take risks, to set up
enterprises and to invest. On the other hand, indirect consumption
taxes have the effect of impacting most, by definition, on people with
the highest consumption ratios—in other words, the poorest
people in society—so they are very
unfair<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:18:52"></hs_TimeCode>. The
financial transaction tax has neither of those two disadvantages. If
you implemented it around the world, it might be pretty close to being
an ideal
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:18:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121765000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000024">Thirdly, contrary to
what you might expect theoretically, tax arbitrage, or displacement of
financial markets in response to taxation, is actually much less
effective and efficient than you might suppose, for a whole host of
reasons. One is that people always want to trade in the deepest
markets. If you move out of the most liquid, deepest markets, you will
find that you are operating against wider spreads, which will more than
compensate for any avoidance of tax. That is particularly true if, as
in this case, a tax is 10 basis points.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121765000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121765000025">The main reason why the
market in trading in UK equities has not moved into derivatives,
contracts for difference, the option market and so forth is because
people would be paying for much greater spreads than they would be
gaining on the stamp duty tax—that tax, of course, is 50 basis
points. There are other reasons why there is not so much displacement
as you might expect, one of which is the time zone problem, another of
which is that financial markets, particularly clearing houses and their
principal customers—the major banks—do not like cutting
across major tax authorities. They are particularly terrified of the
IRS, of course, but they do not want to have an argument with any major
tax authority, including, in this case, the Fisc or the Finanzamt. They
do not want to have an argument with the Inland Revenue, which is why,
when they set up American depositary receipt markets in New York in
British equities, the American banks concerned have always paid the
stamp duty at the front end on an advance basis: I think it is
something like 200 basis points. They have accepted that although I do
not think that obligation could ever be enforced in a court of law.
Perhaps the Minister will confirm
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:20:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

argues that this tax will impact in practice on a lot of investors,
both retail and wholesale, and on a lot of
residents—institutional and otherwise, corporate and
otherwise—in this country, even though we do not participate in
it. If we get none of the benefits because we do not receive any
receipts from the tax, of course, and the benefits of displacement from
other markets where they are participating directly in the tax are much
less than anticipated, there may well come a time when the equation is
such that it would be worth our while to join in the tax and join in
sharing in the proceeds. This is a matter which we need—if the
tax comes in at all—to keep permanently under
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_17_PT_1/1C93903538CC5608E0ADDD88235F44567B7CB9B2" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 December 2013">Tuesday,

New York and Hong Kong are not subject to the mutual assistance
directive; we are. New York and Hong Kong would not collect this tax,
as the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, pointed out. They would be laughing
all the way to the bank. The true cost of the financial transaction
tax—if it comes in—would be the transactions displaced,
which would migrate offshore, out of the whole of the EU, including
away from London. It is a pernicious
proposal.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121767000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121767000003">I

Government attaches great importance to the principle of tax

introduction of a FTT is of great importance to several of the

think that is completely absurd. I entirely agree with the doctrine of
the principle of tax sovereignty, but that means that member states are
entitled to impose whatever taxes they like in their own countries
provided they do not discriminate against other member states and do
not damage the interests of other member states. However, it does not
mean that they are entitled to impose a tax that damages us because we
have to collect it at no benefit to our Exchequer but at great damage
to our markets. That is an absurd reading of tax sovereignty. It shows
a defensive Treasury that is refusing to get out there, argue
proactively and build alliances. After all, 17 member states are not
going to implement this tax. Had we approached them and argued the EU
interest, and argued that EU markets,  
<?notus-xml column=281?>including their markets as well as ours, would be damaged by this tax, I
do not believe that it would have been impossible to block it. I think
that the Government now agree, because they are litigating, that it is
a highly undesirable
measure.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121767000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121767000004">I
draw four short morals from this sad story. First, it is almost always
a mistake to say, “Roll out the red carpet, let them do as they
like, the business will come to London”. That was Boris
Johnson’s position. As usual, he got completely the wrong end of
the stick. Sadly, the Government seem to have held on to the wrong end
of the stick for some considerable time.</hs_para>

as the noble Lord, Lord Vallance, said, the enhanced co-operation
procedure is a new procedure. Case law is being developed. It will take
some time to construct sensible ground rules for ensuring that Articles
326 and 327 are respected. I suggest three rules: first, the
substantive proposal must be on the table before the procedural
decision is taken, as was suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Vallance;
secondly, the Commission and the Council secretariat must ensure that
any subsequent amendments do not introduce detriment to
non-participants; and thirdly, the overall EU interest must be
respected at all times by all the institutions, including the
Commission, which must not allow itself to become the secretariat of a
subset of member states.</hs_para>

we know that the Treasury is short-staffed and short on EU expertise.
It is all the more sensible, therefore, to listen to the expertise
available in this House and stop dismissing our reports with delay and
disdain. I know that the Minister will not do
that.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121767000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121767000018">5.26

this debate. We agree with what my noble friend Lord Harrison said. He
posed a number of relevant questions to the Government and the Minister
that need to be answered. A rethink of the financial transaction tax is
probably under way in Brussels at the moment. I remember, as a naive
young man, reading the article by the Nobel laureate James Tobin which
first proposed a version of the financial transaction tax and being
very impressed by it. However, it was always clear that it was a very
difficult proposal. It would certainly be difficult to make it work
unless there was a transatlantic agreement—in the modern world,
it may not be possible to do it even then.</hs_para>

raises hugely difficult issues in this area. Under the treaty, enhanced
co-operation can go ahead only where it does not do damage to the
member states that are not taking part. Therefore, the Government were
right in this case to mount a legal challenge. I am not normally of the
view that one should conduct one’s engagement in the European
Union by mounting legal challenges—negotiation  is much
better—but in this case, where enhanced  
<?notus-xml column=282?>co-operation was being pushed ahead in a way that was detrimental to
other member states, they were right to take the
matter to
court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121767000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121767000010">Anyone
who has talked to people on the ground knows that this proposal has run
into great difficulties, that many of the member states that initially
supported it are having very serious second thoughts and that it is
almost certain that the Commission proposals will be heavily revised.
We do not know what the outcome of that will be, but the existing
proposal looks pretty dead in the
water.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121767000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121767000011">However,
noble Lords have to take into account the extremely strong feeling on
the continent—and in this country—that it was the
financial sector that caused the crisis and it is the financial sector
that has to pay for the consequences of its irresponsibility. Of
course, that is not an argument for a financial transaction tax but
that is the principle on which a lot of the political momentum behind
this proposal is based. It is linked to the idea that when things go
wrong in future there should be bail-ins, not bailouts, and is intended
to provide revenues for dealing with bank resolution in the
future.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121767000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121767000012">In
Britain we have raised taxes on the financial sector. The bank levy is
now going to be £3 billion by 2018-19, and stamp duty will be a
similar amount. So £6 billion a year, more than we raise in wine
duty, vehicle excise duty and inheritance tax, will come from specific
taxes on the financial sector. We should talk to our partners about
much more effective ways of taxing the financial sector across the
Union and get rid of this unfortunate enhanced co-operation
proposal.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_17_PT_1/5A3B3E69C41EA44915957246A09F817DC7875AAA" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 17 December 2013">Tuesday,

Newby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Harrison, for introducing the report, and to all noble Lords
who have spoken. I think that all bar a couple of members of the
committee have participated in the debate or are here. I therefore feel
that I am giving evidence to the committee rather than making a speech
to the Grand Committee, which makes the
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> all
the more formidable.
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>As one would
have expected from the committee, the document is thorough and well
researched, and is bound, as previous reports on this subject have
been, to help colour perceptions and debate in Brussels and across the
EU, where sometimes the reports of your Lordships’ EU Committee
are read more carefully than they are in the UK.</hs_para>

committee’s report makes a number of points with which the
Government strongly agree. First, the committee expresses strong
misgivings about the legality of the FTT proposal. Obviously, the
Government share those misgivings and that is why we have taken the
case to the European Court of Justice. As the committee notes, of
particular concern to the UK is the extraterritorial impact of the
so-called residence principle, which, for example, would bring into
scope of the tax a UK pension fund buying UK government bonds from the
London branch of a bank headquartered in Frankfurt. This is, in our
view, an infringement of the provisions of the treaty designed to
protect the position of non-participating member states under enhanced
co-operation, and that is at the heart of our challenge to the
proposal.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=283?><hs_para UID="13121777000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000003">That brings me on to the
second point that your Lordships’ committee discussed and which
has been raised this afternoon: the credibility of enhanced
co-operation as a way of doing business at all. The committee makes the
perfectly valid point that there  is a real risk of harm to the
credibility of enhanced co-operation as a tool in the future because of
the way that it has been operated in this case. We agree that there has
been a triple failure: in bringing forward this legislation in undue
haste; in paying insufficient regard to the views of non-participating
member states; and in failing to support the proposal with a
sufficiently thorough impact analysis—a point tellingly made by
the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton. We completely agree with the committee
that, particularly if this tool is to be more frequently used, it must
command the confidence of all member states. Indeed, this is the very
point that the Government have been making to Council colleagues during
these negotiations.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121777000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000004">The conditions that
govern the use of enhanced co-operation are set out in the treaty in
quite high-level terms, which makes it important during these early
uses of enhanced co-operation that the right precedents are set in
order to give the kind of confidence that we believe all member states
need if it is to be used more frequently. Like the committee, we do not
believe that this has been a helpful precedent in that respect. The
conditions set out by the noble Lords, Lord Vallance and Lord Kerr,
about the future use of the procedure seem eminently
sensible.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121777000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000005">The
third concern, rightly highlighted by the committee, is that it is
highly unclear how the tax will be collected, and what collection
obligations are implied for non-participating member states. What is
clear, as the committee points out, is that the UK will be required to
fulfil any obligations it incurs under the mutual assistance in
recovery directive. For that reason, as the committee acknowledges in
its report, we have included in our legal challenge the ground that an
FTT would impose collection costs on non-participating member states
that should properly, under the terms of the treaty, be fully borne by
the participating member
states<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:35:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000006">However,
there is a theme in the report on which I cannot agree with the
committee: the suggestion that the Government have been in any way
complacent in relation to the risks of an FTT. The Government made
their concerns about an FTT clear from the outset. In November 2011 the
Chancellor highlighted the serious problems with the
Commission’s original proposal to other member states, and
indeed UK-led opposition to what was on the table resulted in that
proposal being
dropped.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000007">It
was obvious then that the proposal had not gone away, and the
Government were very soon considering, and indeed taking legal advice
on, the implications for the UK of an FTT under enhanced co-operation.
When Council authorisation for enhanced co-operation was sought at
ECOFIN this January, we tabled a statement to the minutes of the
meeting recording our serious reservations about the legality of the
authorising decision. The report acknowledges the Government’s
point that it would not have made a difference to a  
<?notus-xml column=284?>vote if we had voted against the decision, rather than abstained, but
argues that we should have sought support for a blocking

disagree on this. As the previous Financial Secretary pointed out in
the correspondence that the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, quoted, it was clear
from discussions that took place in the lead-up to the ECOFIN meeting
that a qualifying majority of member states was prepared to support the
authorising decision. Moreover, abstention had no bearing on the
prospects for our subsequent legal challenge. The noble Lord, Lord
Kerr, talks about building alliances, an issue that arose when we last
discussed this matter, but we have to accept, as the noble Lord, Lord
Liddle, pointed out, the strength of the political will across much of
the EU to introduce this tax. The UK standing up to say, “We are
going to vote against it” would not have affected that. It is
inconceivable that this would not have gone ahead at that meeting,

account of which member state we spoke to at which point. The view was
taken, which I believe was the correct one, that at that stage this
proposal was unblockable, because of the political will to which the
noble Lord, Lord Liddle, referred. We may think that other member
states are misguided. History may prove they are misguided. But there
is a slight tendency in the UK to believe that we always know best. We
may well know best in this case, but the French and the Germans think
they know best, and it is a bold UK Government—or committee of
your Lordships’ House—who are unambiguously sure that
they know better than a large number of major EU member
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000012"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:39:22"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Davies of Stamford" PimsId="5785" UID="13121777000151" xid="2057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000151">Lord

saying that the Government did not vote against this proposal because

thought that at any one time there might be a majority against them. If
the Government really felt strongly about something, so strongly that
they were 
<?notus-xml column=285?>prepared to litigate, which is a much more provocative thing to do

the Barnett formula today for three reasons: first, because the debate
that will take place over the next few months prior to the referendum
on Scottish independence in September will cause the Barnett formula to
be under close public scrutiny; secondly, because of the rising demand
across England for devolved powers from Whitehall similar to those
available to the devolved Administrations of Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland; and thirdly, because public spending cuts in England
are making people in England question why the Barnett formula exists.
That is of course a question that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, has
himself asked many times. Indeed, it is unclear why it has been left
alone for a generation, why it is so out of date and why it allocates
more money to the devolved Administrations per capita than it does to
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000030">The
Barnett formula was devised as a temporary measure to resolve problems
over the funding allocations between England, Scotland, Northern
Ireland and Wales ahead of the 1979 referendum on Scottish devolution.
Many things have changed since the formula was created. As the Local
Government Association chairman, Sir Merrick Cockell, said recently, it
is “a historic relic”. He is right, because it has locked
inequalities into its system of distribution. The consequence is that
in terms of identifiable public spending by country and region, all
three of the devolved Administrations have higher public spending per
head of population than that of any English region, including London.
The Office for National Statistics says that in 2011-12, Scotland
received £10,088 per head, Wales £9,740, Northern Ireland
£10,623 and England just £8,491; those are the latest
available figures. It is very hard to justify England doing so
relatively badly, not least because of the claim, sometimes correct,
that public services in Scotland are better than in England. There is a
rising tide of opinion in England that tax revenue is being raised in
England but is then diverted from England to be spent in Scotland on
higher standards of public services. However, that is not entirely
true: the tax raised in England is actually raised in London.
Furthermore, if the formula did not exist and if Scotland was
independent, tax revenues from oil would broadly make up for the loss
because 90% of the oil would be in Scottish
waters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000031">A
Select Committee of this House reviewed the Barnett formula in 2009. It
pointed out that the formula was used to allocate over half the total
public expenditure in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. It also
pointed out that although the annual increment in funds is made on the
basis of recent population figures, the baseline, accumulated over the
past 30 years, does not reflect today’s population in the
devolved Administrations. It is therefore out of date and takes no
account of the relative needs of any of the devolved Administrations.
The Select Committee recommended a UK funding commission—which
seems to me to be an extremely good idea—that would identify a
small number of need indicators and oversee the transition to a new
system of block grant made over between three and seven years. It has
not happened, of course, but I would submit that it cannot be delayed
for long.</hs_para>

demand for devolved powers in England. The recent London Finance
Commission report, <I>Raising the Capital</I><I>,</I> results from
London’s boroughs and regional government looking closely at the
issues of taxation and finance in the wider south-east region with a
view to considering a Barnett formula-style settlement for the capital.
That is welcome, except for one thing. I am increasingly aware of a
rising tide of opinion in London that it should keep more of the taxes
it raises. The implications of this are potentially very serious for
the rest of the UK, which is why we need to think very hard, as a
United Kingdom, about where taxes are raised and from whom, about what
levels of public spending should apply in each part of the UK, and
about a system in which need is the basis for
distribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000033">This
debate now goes further than just London. The Core Cities Group,
representing Birmingham, Bristol, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester,
Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield, is calling for a suite of fiscal
reforms for England’s larger cities. The aim is the devolution
of property tax revenue streams, including council tax, stamp duty,
land tax and business rates, with the ability to reform those taxes
while retaining prudential rules for borrowing similar to recent
changes in Scotland through the Scotland Act and as now proposed for
Wales. The aim would be to generate funding to stimulate economic
growth according to local needs, allowing cities to raise sustained
investment for vital infrastructure projects. These proposals would be
cost-neutral at the point of devolution, with no additional money being
sought from the national pot beyond that which the core cities already
receive, along with the ability to raise new local taxes. Such reforms
would give practical effect to the ambition of the coalition Government
to promote “radical devolution”. Together, the English
core cities and London represent more than half of the UK economy and
almost half the population, but they control only around 5% of the
taxes raised in their areas. Empowered cities could join up public
services and reduce dependency on London, which takes me to the current
state of local government finances in
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000034">Last
week’s Autumn Statement exempted local government from the
further reductions that were applied to Whitehall departments. These
measures are welcome. However, some council services are in serious
difficulty, particularly because those councils more dependent on
central grant cannot raise large sums through council tax and other
fees and charges. Central grants for local government are to be cut by
43% by 2015-16, and there will be a funding gap of more than £15
billion by the end of the decade if things go on as they are. That
takes me to the issue of
fairness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000035">The
way the Barnett formula is calculated is widely acknowledged to give
more to Scotland and Northern Ireland compared with their relative
needs, and less to England and Wales than their relative needs would
justify, by more than £4 billion a year. This is unsustainable.
Governments have consistently said over many years that they will not
review the Barnett formula and, in the case of this Government, not
until the public finances are stabilised. I understand the
Government’s  
<?notus-xml column=289?>predicament. I do not argue that Scotland should necessarily get
less because I believe in a funding system based
upon a needs assessment, but I do argue that Wales and the constituent
parts of England should be treated equally and empowered to create more
of their own tax income.</hs_para>

Birmingham has called for a single funding pot at the city region level
for local authority spending, health, and for expenditure by the
Department for Work and Pensions. Savings are there to be made by
reducing duplication. If the referendum next September in Scotland is
in favour of independence the Barnett formula will be abolished. If
there is a no vote there will inevitably be a debate about yet further
devolution beyond the Scotland Act, and I personally would welcome
that. When that debate happens there will be a rising demand for the
fiscal and political devolution offered to Scotland also to be
available in England, with a system of allocation based on needs. Now
is the time to act and to set up the UK funding commission proposed by
the Select Committee of your Lordships’ House four years ago. We
should create a place-based system of finance in England. This could be
based on the governance that has developed locally—combined
authorities, health and well-being boards, joint committees, local
enterprise partnerships and so on. We should give local government and
their partner organisations the power to allow individual areas to
shape public services and investment, and to incentivise local growth
by devolving powers on taxes and spending to suit local needs beyond
the 50% permitted from growth in business
rates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000037">In
conclusion, it is important that we are not divisive. We should learn
from the wealth of evidence on this issue and have a mature discussion
as a United Kingdom on how devolution can drive growth and a bigger
local tax base, as well as on how resources can be allocated more
fairly on the basis of need. In the mean time, as we await the local
government settlement tomorrow, it will not be enough for the
Government yet again to push this issue into the long

course most understandable that devolved Administrations and local
government are all looking harder at the way funding from central
government is divided up. All are facing much-reduced budgets and the
actual cuts relate considerably to the application of the Barnett
formula. Until the last election the Scottish Government revelled in
the fact that their block grant increased by two and a quarter times to
nearly £29 billion. The two years of the current Administration
has seen this cut so far by £589 million. My right
honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 29 June, in
<I>Hansard</I> at col. 306, seemed to estimate that the block grant in
the current year would be only £26 billion. Perhaps the Minister
can tell the Committee if this is still the figure that would
apply.</hs_para>

course being felt across all Administrations. As my noble friend Lord
Shipley was saying, there have been many calls for a needs-based
approach to be used in a new calculation—to the extent that many
in the public now think that this occurs under the Barnett formula; but
of course this is not true. There is some evidence that it was
considered in the early days under what was known as the Goschen
formula, which was replaced in 1979. The arguments will have been used
by Scottish Secretaries of State and others to obtain funding, but the
approach has not been part of the Barnett
formula.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000041">The
needs-based approach was certainly central to the recommendations of
the report referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, which your
Lordships’ committee produced in July 2009 and which was firmly
rejected by the Government. It now appears that the issue has been
taken up by the more recent Holtham commission. It would be interesting
to know whether its needs-based formula was the same as that put
forward by your Lordships’ report, but this development has
meant that people are now beginning to put figures on the disparities
that it has thrown up, and local government is taking much greater
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000042">Of
course, there is a great deal of rethinking going on, both in
administration and on the financial front. The Scottish Government are
having to juggle three scenarios: the cuts to their previous budget
envisaged by the Chancellor using Barnett; their own proposals for a
totally independent country, where we are not in the least clear as to
what funding will be available under a great many headings; and the
wholly new settlement promised by the implementation of Part 3 of the
Scotland Act 2012, where the Scottish Government will be raising half
the taxation required for their domestic budget. Of course, this will
still be governed by the overall size of the estimate of what is due
under the block
grant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000043">Given
the complications that all this envisages, it is quite easily
understood that there is not much sympathy from that quarter for any
further adjustments. If the Minister cannot give a positive response to
the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, perhaps parties should think about
whether this is something that should be in their election
manifestos.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121777000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000134">6.01

background to the Barnett formula was the consequence of three
beleaguered Administrations of which I was a member, led first by Prime
Minister Harold Wilson and then by Prime Minister James 
<?notus-xml column=291?>Callaghan. The latter Administration was sustained by a Lib-Lab pact of
a kind. In those crisis years, as he was addressing the complex algebra
of local government finance, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, knew that
the IMF was kicking in the doors of the Treasury, that the British
manufacturing smokestacks were falling down by the day, that the OPEC
nations had trebled—indeed, quadrupled—the price of oil,
and that a fearful inflation was raging, some 27% year-on-year in 1975.
That also triggered off what is now called in shorthand trade union
militancy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000047">I
will give the following brief vision of how the noble Lord coped as
Chief Secretary. You would find him in the Members’ Dining Room
in another place with his great friend, the noble Lord, Lord Sheldon,
and he coped by opening a half-bottle of House of Commons champagne. He
then went back to the Treasury that little bit better in his morale. It
was from these fires in British governance that the Barnett formula
arose, as it were, metaphorically so, from the political loins of the
noble Lord, Lord Barnett. My one observation is to be careful for what
you wish if you are a Welshman in governance, particularly in Wales.
Whatever the outcome of the Scottish constitutional debate, Barnett
will come to the fore in all our deliberations and arguably shall be in
the manifestos of the great political parties. That is for
certain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000048">My
caution is this. Roughly speaking, per head of the population in
England the sum of money per citizen is exceeded in Scotland by
£1,400; and in my own country, Wales, by some £800. I
have spent only 43 years here in Westminster, and I am concerned that
when Whitehall mandarins have their monthly meetings they may be
tempted to consider how they may be able to get rid of the
responsibility as it affects the Celtic fringes. I therefore feel that
before one advances one should know precisely what the outcome is. That
is what the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, always did; he was an accountant
by profession. I offer again the sight of the noble Lord quaffing his
half-bottle of Commons champagne before going back to address problems
of great crisis.</hs_para>

Local Government Association estimates that allocating funding on a
needs-based formula would potentially increase public spending in
England by £4.1 billion. This would make a huge difference to
services currently stretched to their limit. There would be a decrease

Scotland as overfunded. In a recent report, the Treasury said that

unfairness is understood by most people in England. In 2012, the Future
of England survey indicated that 52% of those surveyed felt that
Scotland received 
<?notus-xml column=292?>more than its fair share of funding; this was up from 24% in 2002. What
implications does this have for the adult social care system, which in
England is underfunded? Over the past three years, budgets have reduced
by 20%. There is a growing gap between the demand  for social
care and the resources invested in it. The Government are not providing
councils with enough funding to deliver the care people need. An
additional £400 million a year is needed to maintain the same
level of service, excluding
inflation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000052">In
Somerset, a secondary school which covers an area of 600 square miles
transports children to and from their homes, an expensive and large

to the next client is  30 minutes away.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:08:14"></hs_TimeCode> solution is
to reshape local health and social care systems and invest in
community-based services. These will alleviate pressure on the acute
sector. The Government have acknowledged this with the Care Bill and
duties on councils to provide or arrange services that prevent, delay

needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000053">Reforms
require proper resourcing. If the funding arrangements across the UK
were fairer, more could be invested in the English social care system
and preventive community care services, with reduced spending on
expensive A&amp;E acute services. People will rightly see the current
distribution as unfair and look at comparisons in local services
received north and south of the border. The English and Scottish social
care systems are different. There is different legislation, and there
are different entitlements and progress on integrating health and
social care. Scotland is the only part of the United Kingdom to
introduce free personal care where the full costs are covered by the
state. In England, the plan is to cap costs. That is a major
difference. In effect, English taxpayers, through the Barnett formula,
are subsidising a level of care to which they themselves do not have
access.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000054">I am

Barnett is not to question the future of Scotland in our union.
Instead, this debate is about the question of basic fairness across the

Shipley, for initiating this important debate. I strongly support the
recommendation made by the Local Government Association that the
Barnett formula should be scrapped, and I call on the Treasury to start
evaluating the alternatives. As we have heard, figures from the United
Kingdom Government highlight that Scotland is overfunded. The noble
Lord, Lord Shipley, 
<?notus-xml column=293?>has made the case as to why the formula is unfair and I support his call
for the return of the £4 billion to England that he referred to
so strongly. This is imperative at a time when money is desperately

just about the money, important as that is. It is also about devolution
from Whitehall to local government in England. This will give people a
greater say in their public services and a more meaningful reason to
vote in local elections. Recent polling by Ipsos MORI showed that 79%
of people trust their council, whereas only 11% trust central
Government. English councils are delivering for their communities and
the Barnett formula should reflect
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000057">I would
now like to turn very briefly to how the Government can deliver
devolution across the United Kingdom in a way that is fair to England,
Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. As we have heard already in
today’s debate, Her Majesty’s Government need to ensure
that money is distributed fairly across the four countries. Having
reformed the Barnett  formula, HM Government should aim to
implement the informative recommendations made in the document produced
by the Local Government Association entitled <I>Rewiring Public
Services</I>. They would make sure that the benefits of devolution are
felt across England, and this could be achieved by, first, adopting
five-year funding settlements for local government across the lifetime
of a Parliament. Progress towards this goal was made in the Autumn
Statement, which announced that local public services will get the same
long-term indicative financial statements as central
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000058">Secondly,
money should be shared more fairly around England by taking financial
distribution out of the hands of Ministers and replacing it with an
agreement across English local government. Thirdly, local government
should be given wider revenue-raising powers, and fourthly, developing
a market in municipal bonds that gives local government access to
alternative forms of finance.</hs_para>

England is currently dealing with unprecedented reductions to its
funding. Core funding will have been cut by 43% across the lifetime of
this Parliament. There is, as the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, has said, a
projected £15 billion funding gap by 2019-20 that councils must
close in order to meet their legal responsibility to balance the books.
The size of the challenge is so great that tinkering at the margins
will not be enough. Without radical change in the way funding is
distributed across the UK, we risk a situation where services in
England that the public care deeply about will start to fail. Bold,
imaginative action and political leadership are required to restore
financial stability. It is time for a fairer deal for England and
English
councils.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121777000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000137">6.15

address the point that if any reform—which he may or may not

begin now. Elections are 
<?notus-xml column=294?>coming along and it is most unlikely that people will put forward
radical solutions before an election. If you wait until after the

noble Lords have explained how this money is needed and I will not
spend time talking about that. The previous speech indicated that bold
action is necessary, but bold action rarely comes very late on in a
Parliament, so I do not expect it to happen immediately. However, I do
expect a real attempt—cross-party agreement would be
achievable—at a proper in-depth examination of the issues which
have been revealed. I do not know how such a thing can be set up or how
independent it can be but I urge the Minister to really look forward
and give us some hope that things are going to get better. Everybody
knows that local government services in many places are on the point of
breakdown. As these cuts continue for the next two years, it is going
to get very serious indeed, and politicians, at the next election or
immediately afterwards, have to come up with some convincing formula
about how this is going to be

that does not mean there is any justification for letting this hang

government has a really good input. I commend that to the Minister and

am glad this opportunity has arisen to comment on the LGA’s
submission on the Barnett formula in the context of the Autumn

it is worth noting that the LGA is working on alternative funding
proposals, which will be published, I believe, next summer. I welcome
that, although I hope they will consult both the WLGA and the devolved
Government in Wales in taking that forward. The implication is that
there should be mechanisms for distributing resources according to need

Holtham commission, which investigated these matters in Wales, produced
two assessments. The first,

million. The second independent assessment identified a £400
million shortfall. The Silk commission, which reported on possible
changes to the financial powers of the National Assembly, agreed with
Holtham in its analysis. The Holtham commission set out, as an
alternative to the Barnett formula, parameters for a needs-based
formula which included the number of children, the number of older
people, ethnicity, income poverty, prevalence of ill health and
sparsity of population.</hs_parafo>

Teverson (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I note that the noble Lord, Lord
Wigley, asked that political parties include a needs-based formula in
their manifestos. I somehow suspect that they will not be on the front
pages or among the first six pledges—or three or however many
pledges we choose—because this is one those subjects that has
become all too difficult, which is why this temporary situation has
lasted for three decades. It certainly needs to be changed but, having
said that, what is the difference that such a change would make in
England? It would be an extra 4%, which I am sure would be very much
welcomed by local authorities but is not a big
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:23:37"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is rather an obscure issue for the electorate, which does not make it
any less important, but most people would probably interpret it as
something to do with the financing of one of the more obscure London
boroughs, rather than attribute it to one of our noble colleagues
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:23:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on and ask: what should really be done if the situation gets a little
more difficult? A needs-based formula would certainly be better. I am
slightly sceptical about an independent commission but the European
Union manages rather objectively to distribute structural funds, so it
may be that this sort of thing can happen even within a political
environment. Two areas are even more important than this, one of which
is the rural/urban divide that, unfortunately, my Government have so
far not been able to mend much, if at all, during their period in
office. I remind noble Lords that rural areas pay higher tax bills, get
some 52% less in government grants, and have fewer public services
because they are more difficult to deliver there. That is one of the
fundamental areas, which, if we keep a similar form of local government
finance to what we have now, needs to be fixed very quickly and
thoroughly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:24:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000075">The
other area that has been mentioned by other noble Lords, which is
equally if not more important, is that we need to do something far more
basic than changing the Barnett formula: we need to increase
substantially the taxation that is raised locally. Rather than mess
around with the Barnett formula, we need to start to implement a much
greater degree of localism. Clearly, we have got rid of a lot of
ring-fencing over the past few years. We have got rid of capping,
although we have replaced that with other ways of restraining local
expenditure. We have taken away barriers stopping local authorities
from raising revenues in all sorts of ways. I welcome that, which came
from one of the Government’s early initiatives under localism.
However, 
<?notus-xml column=297?>over the medium term we need to move financing from 5% towards 20%, and
hopefully in the longer term far higher, so that we have much more
local accountability and democracy, and better local decision-making.
Within Europe we are the most centralised state as far as taxation is
concerned, certainly among the major states. That needs to change. We
need to change the rural/urban divide. If we can do all that, then I
would support my noble friend Lord Shipley in changing the Barnett
formula as
well.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121777000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000140">6.26

was a member of the Select Committee which recommended moving from the
Barnett formula to needs assessment. However, the first thing we learnt
from the evidence was that the Barnett formula is extremely simple to
operate, which was a bonus for the Treasury, which knew immediately how

Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:27:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000078">We

Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:27:00"></hs_TimeCode> a
disproportionate number of young people. We also learnt, as I sincerely
believe, that Wales misses out under the current arithmetic of the

more valid reason, and in my view the only possible justification, for
the £1,600 per person additional spend in Scotland is that the
tax take from Scotland does not include the oil and gas revenues,
because these are allocated to the slightly fictitious area called the
United Kingdom continental shelf, not to
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000080">Ultimately,
any perceived proposed reduction in the Barnett formula is a gift to
the yes campaign and the possibility of Scotland becoming a better
democracy. It was a great disappointment that there was no White Paper

understand that the three major parties still have no idea what they

all talk about more devolution, but I wonder how much more can be
devolved before eating into what I call the four pillars of

will give us a bit more information than we were able to get in an
exchange at Question Time, and address some of the points I am going to
make about the funding of local government in England and Wales. Like
all noble Lords, I am aware that the formula which bears the name of my
noble friend Lord Barnett was devised when he was Chief Secretary to
the Treasury and has been used for more than 30 years to allocate more
than half of total public expenditure in Scotland, Wales and Northern

Barnett formula has been criticised on a number of grounds. It has been
argued, among other things, that, because of its focus on population,
it fails to recognise higher levels of poverty. In this debate it is
useful to look at what has happened to local government in England and
Wales in recent years, and in particular since 2010. We have a picture
of local government that has been described by the Prime Minister
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121777000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000129">“officially

his Government have made bigger and earlier cuts to local government
than to any other part of the public sector. Their actions have been
criticised right across local government and real inequalities and
unfairness have crept into the system. I still find it shocking, when I
look at the figures, to see that they highlight the West Oxfordshire
District Council, the local authority that covers the Prime
Minister’s constituency, which is ranked in the multiple indices
of deprivation at 316—with one being the most deprived and 325
being the least deprived—and which is actually getting an
increase of 3.1% in its spending power. Meanwhile, other local
authorities such as Hastings on the south coast and Burnley in the
north-west, which are ranked 19th and 11th respectively in the same
indices, are facing the maximum cut in their spending power in 2013-14,
which equates to a reduction of
8.8<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>%. I agree
very much with the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley,

themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:31:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121777000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000086">It
is also shocking to note that the 10 most deprived local authorities in
England will lose six times the amount of spending power per head of
the population when compared with the 10 least deprived local
authorities by 2014-15, when compared with 2010-11. The noble Lord,
Lord Shipley, also referred to the calls for further devolution of
powers and fiscal reforms in England. I very much agree with his
comments about the core
cities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:32:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000087">Will
the noble Lord, Lord Newby, address in his response the points that the
Local Government Association are calling for, to which the noble
Baroness, Lady Eaton, referred, including five-year funding settlements
across the public sector to give more certainty to local government?
That is a sensible idea. Will he also address the point about the
distribution of funds in England being taken out of the hands of
Ministers and replaced with an agreement across English local
government? The current arrangements are opaque 
<?notus-xml column=299?>and, as with the figures I highlighted earlier, people struggle to
understand them and how they are arrived at. They just demonstrate
unfairness in the process—a process which disadvantages people
living in our most deprived areas and
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:32:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I
very much agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, that the
devolution of further power to local government in England is a good

is essentially a mathematical equation, the Barnett formula retains the
capacity to generate considerable passion and debate, as we have
demonstrated today. Clearly, noble Lords are aware of the
formula’s origins in the late 1970s. The Government of the day
decided at the time of the devolution Acts in 1998 to retain the block
grant and Barnett formula arrangements for determining the budgets of
the devolved Administrations. The noble Lord, Lord Jones, gave us some
gory details of the state of the British economy at the time but also
of the extremely civilised way in which the noble Lord, Lord Barnett,
grappled with them. I am sorry that there is only water on offer to the

and local authorities. While it clearly is not perfect, the Barnett
formula has proven to be a relatively transparent, durable, robust and
fair method of calculating changes in budgets for the devolved
Administrations since devolution. It operates at a high level, based on
population shares and changes to spending by comparable  UK
departments. Despite a considerable element of

local authorities, exempted local authorities from any further
reductions in annual revenue budgets to assist them in freezing council

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, as I was saying, changes to the
devolution settlements already legislated for in relation to Scotland,
and in prospect for Wales, are increasing the levels of accountability
and flexibility the devolved Administrations there will have in future
over their own fiscal position. That has been warmly welcomed in both
those parts of the United Kingdom. Similarly, in England, the
Government have already initiated an historic shift of power to local
areas by removing ring-fences from £7 billion of local
government funding and giving councils the ability to retain 50% of the
business rates they collect; I will come back to that in a
moment.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121777000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000096">At

the concerns expressed about the formula, as made clear in our

English, Scottish and Welsh contributions to the debate in turn. The
noble Lord, Lord Shipley, made a powerful argument for more devolution
within England and greater autonomy  for the core cities, and
London in particular. I have 
<?notus-xml column=301?>considerable sympathy with that. I was very much involved in plans for
regional government during the previous Administration. My preference
would have been to have powerful regions as counterpoints to, to a
certain extent, Scotland and Wales. However, that vision of how we
might manage affairs in England rather crumbled to
dust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000098">It is
interesting to note how the core cities have stepped up to the plate
and are coming up with a number of innovative proposals, to some of
which the noble Lord referred, to enable greater devolution to them.
However, the problem with the core cities approach to devolution goes
to the point made by my noble friend Lord Teverson, which is that they
have the mass and momentum to take devolution forward, but if you are
not careful, that will leave a lot of the rest of the country behind.
It is difficult to see how to get some kind of uniformity of approach
if the cities themselves take a huge leading role.</hs_para>

the need to develop further the place-based approach to financing local
government. Although this may be a little pessimistic, it is one of the
relatively rare innovations in public policy which I think has been an
unambiguous success. I hope very much that we press on with it because
not only does it give the flexibility that enables considerable
efficiencies to be driven forward, it also gives local authorities a
greater sense of their own destiny, which is important if they are to
flourish in the medium term.</hs_para>

argument, the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, discussed the inequality in per
head allocations between England and the devolved Administrations.
There are, of course, very considerable differences between the regions
of England. As he knows, the north-east has higher public spending per
head than, for example, does Wales. There are obvious reasons for that,
but it is worth pointing out that England differs considerably in the
level of expenditure per head that it enjoys at the moment.</hs_para>

Bakewell was one of a number of noble Lords to set out the
straightforward English case for a review of the formula as proposed by
the LGA. I understand absolutely why she feels so strongly about it.
She talked particularly about adult social care. As she will be aware,
the Government are making enough funding available to ensure that local
authorities do not need to reduce the level of social care services
that they are providing through to 2015-16, and the range of reforms we
are introducing are all aimed at allowing local authorities to do more
in order to deliver better outcomes, including the new £3.8
billion health and social care integration pool. That is another
example of taking an integrated approach rather than a silo-based one
which, whatever is done with the Barnett formula, is very
important.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121777000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000102">My
noble friend Lord Bradshaw enjoined the Government to start working on
how we might replace the Barnett formula and suggested that we might
adopt a cross-party attempt to do so. I suspect that that would be
quite tricky between now and the next election, and I think that the
most he can realistically 
<?notus-xml column=302?>hope for is a clear statement in each of the manifestos on how the
parties plan to deal with this issue in the next
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121777000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-gc0001.htm#13121777000103">The
noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, pointed out the extent to which the
Government are moving towards at least some of the LGA proposals, not
least in terms of long-term indicative financial statements. That is a
very welcome move, particularly because it has taken so long to do it.
We are sometimes pretty reticent about claiming progress when we make
it, but that is something which local authorities have been asking for
for a long time, and there is real movement.</hs_para>

Kennedy, made a point about the funding in West Oxfordshire. The only
thing I would say about funding for any local authority area is that,
if the Barnett formula has elements of the Schleswig-Holstein problem,
local government funding allocations in England are vastly more
complicated than Schleswig-Holstein ever was. Despite there being
allegedly objective formulae for determining that, I have always found
it difficult to get from the formulae to the actual results; no doubt
that is my inability.</hs_para>

Duke of Montrose, asked us to confirm a number of figures in relation
to Scotland. I believe that they are correct, but if I am wrong I will
write to him. He asked whether the Scottish Government’s current
block grant absorbed the cuts. The cuts to devolved Administration
budgets have tended to be proportionately smaller than those to
Whitehall departments, but that is due to the comparability factor
built into Barnett: specifically, the protection to English health and
school budgets.</hs_para>

Wigley, discussed the challenges in Wales in this area, and talked not
least about the Holtham commission, which was an extremely thorough
piece of work and demonstrated one approach to an alternative
needs-based formula to Barnett. Clearly, it is not absolutely
straightforward to get from where we are now to a needs-based approach
which everybody agrees is the optimal way forward, but I pay tribute to
the Holtham commission for its work.</hs_para>

complications of making comparisons, several noble Lords, including the
noble Lord, Lord Wigley, referred to the public expenditure statistical
analysis figures on per capita expenditure. It is worth clarifying that
these are not simply devolved Administration budgets. They include some
bits of UK-wide expenditure, not least welfare. One must take that into
account when looking at the comparability.</hs_para>

have been able to completely satisfy my noble friend Lord Shipley and
other noble Lords, but I hope that I have been able to demonstrate that

2011-12. Almost £59 million in compensation 
<?notus-xml column=128?>was paid to victims of crime, of which £25 million was funded by
criminals’ cash and assets recovered through confiscation
orders. In addition, following a change to the victim surcharge, HMCTS
is able to report increased receipts for victim support with £11
million being collected and paid in the year to support this
work.</hs_para>

one of the key mechanisms available to the Government to deprive
criminals of the proceeds of their crimes. The value of the order
imposed, which is often very high, is based on the criminal benefit
attributed to the crime and may, therefore, exceed the value of
realisable assets that are known to the court at the time of
imposition. Crucially, an outstanding order stops the criminal
benefiting from the proceeds of crime and ensures that, if the assets
are discovered in the future, they can be seized.</hs_para>

comprise 70% (£1.4 billion including interest) of total
outstanding impositions. All available actions and sanctions are taken
to recover this debt and bring it to account as expeditiously as
possible. However, around one half of this amount (excluding interest)
cannot be collected as it includes £109 million (8%) relating to
individuals who are deceased, deported or who cannot be located;
£84 million (6%) relating to orders which are being
appealed and cannot be enforced while under appeal; and
£136 million (10%) relating to orders where all the
assets have been assessed as hidden following the conclusion of
financial forensic investigations. In addition there is a further
£339 million (24%) of interest accrued on confiscation orders
which are outside agreed payment terms.</hs_para>

who do not pay is an absolute priority. The agencies involved in the
enforcement of confiscation orders, including the Ministry of Justice,
the Home Office, the Serious Fraud Office and the Crown Prosecution
Service, take every step to tackle outstanding debt including the
addition of interest and imprisonment for those who do not pay. In
relation to the outstanding fine debt, the sanctions include taking
deductions from offenders’ benefits or their earnings and
seizing and selling their property and goods. Those who do not pay can
also be
imprisoned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121758000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-wms0001.htm#13121758000015">Criminals
go to extraordinary lengths to hide the proceeds of their crimes by
transferring funds abroad and concealing it with friends and family,

first two items were progress reports from the Presidency on
the Proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the
Council concerning measures to ensure a high level of network and
information security across the Union (First reading—EM6342/13),
followed by the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament

the only substantive item, which was an “orientation
debate” guided by a paper and two questions from the Presidency.
The first question related to the Proposal for a Regulation of the
European Parliament and of the Council laying down measures 
<?notus-xml column=132?>concerning the European single market for electronic communications and
to achieve a Connected Continent (First reading—EM13562/13 and
13555/13 + ADDs 1-2). It asked Member States to indicate which of the
actions contained in the proposal they regard as priorities and whether
it was appropriate to carry out such actions at EU or Member State
level. Commissioner Kroes opened the debate by noting the difference in
pace between the Council and Parliament in discussing this file and
expressed concern that there had been little progress in Council since
the October European Council, compared to that of the European
Parliament.</hs_para>

extensive debate in which all Member States intervened. All began their
interventions by welcoming the overall objectives of the package in
terms of completing the telecoms single market and the associated
growth opportunities. However, France, Portugal, Czech Republic,
Denmark and Sweden called for the prioritisation of other, more
advanced, legislative proposals over the Connected Continent package,
in particular the proposals on electronic identification, broadband
cost reduction and network and information security. France, along with
others, also forcefully questioned the speed with which this proposal
was drawn together and called for the Commission to re-examine the
rationale and evidence behind several parts of the
package.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121758000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-wms0001.htm#13121758000043">There
were mixed responses to the individual components of the package. Many
Member States, including the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy, did
not want to see the Commission gaining any further competency over
spectrum management, especially national auctions, although there was
recognition that there were some gains to be made from closer
co-ordination between Member States. On the roaming proposal, many
Member States supported the reduction of EU roaming charges, but noted
that the current proposal was too complex, unlikely to achieve its
desired effect and may have a negative impact on competition. Opinion
was mixed regarding the net neutrality proposal. Spain and Hungary
supported the draft proposal, while UK and Latvia did not. Similarly,
Member States’ views on the consumer protection elements of the
package were also mixed. They were supported by Spain, Portugal,
Hungary, Luxembourg and UK, while Germany, Austria and Ireland were
concerned that the current draft would erode their currently high level
of domestic consumer protection. France added that the proposals did
not add any value to their domestic regime and were opposed on this
basis, while Malta and Luxembourg were concerned about the effects of
them on smaller electronic communications
operators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121758000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-wms0001.htm#13121758000044">The
second question considered the Conclusions of the October European
Council that covered several aspects of the digital economy (eg cloud
computing, big data and digital platforms) that are currently either
unregulated or rely on “soft” regulation; the Presidency
asked if any regulatory framework was required and whether regulation
should be at Member State or EU level. The major focus of this
discussion was on big data and cloud computing. All Member States began
by recognising the importance of these two areas and the need to make
progress. However, responses about how to achieve this were mixed, with
some calling for 
<?notus-xml column=133?>further regulation and others pressing for a light-touch approach.
Germany, Italy, Slovenia and Slovakia supported further work in this
area, including the development of specific European frameworks.
However, Sweden and the UK called for a light-touch approach and did
not support further regulation on cloud and big data. However, it was
recognised that the use of standards could help form any common
framework.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121758000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-wms0001.htm#13121758000045">During
summing-up, Commissioner Kroes stated she saw the debate as a turning
point. She suggested that Council supported an extensive examination of
the Connected Continent proposal under the Greek Presidency, and that
there was high-level consensus on the need for action on spectrum, net
neutrality and consumer protection, while acknowledging that roaming
may be more difficult to reach agreement on. However, she also called
for further progress under the current Lithuanian Presidency.</hs_para>

agreed with the Commission’s assessment, although felt that the
views of Member States on parts of the package were more strongly held
and differed from those that the Commission suggested. They would
therefore hand this file over to the Greeks to begin detailed work on
the file. However, in a procedurally unusual move, Commissioner Kroes
challenged the Presidency’s conclusions, as she believed that
Member States were calling for work to begin under the Lithuanian
Presidency. The Presidency disagreed with this view, which was
supported by an intervention from
France.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121758000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-wms0001.htm#13121758000047">There
then followed two items under AOB. There were no major interventions on
either of these items. The first was an update from the Presidency on
the Proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the
Council on guidelines for trans-European telecommunications networks
and repealing Decision No 1336/97/EC (First reading—EM16006/11);
the second item was an update from the Presidency on the Proposal for a

department is responsible for key areas of public protection, and many
of its regulations are therefore essential to protect patients and the
public by ensuring essential standards are maintained. Nevertheless, we
have actively embraced the regulatory reform agenda. There are a number
of proposals the department is looking to take forward,
including:</hs_para><hs_WAIndent>simplifying a large
number of professional standards regulations following the Law
Commission’s
recommendation;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>working
with Department for Communities and Local Government to address the
problem of duplication of inspections between the Care Quality
Commission and local authorities through the Focus on Enforcement
review of Adult Care Homes;</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>updating the
Nursery Milk regulations to make them fit for purpose to help
effectively deliver a scheme that is efficient, sustainable, and gives
better value for
money;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>improving the
operation of the Healthy Start scheme, which provides vouchers for
fruit and vegetables, milk and formula milk to low-income pregnant
women and children under four. The department will work with retailers
to explore and implement practical ways to make the paper vouchers
easier to handle by the end of
2015/16;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>implementing the recommendations to
review the human tissue legislation, which will potentially bring
benefits to the regulated sectors through improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the regulators; and streamlining regulation;
and</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>revoking the regulations which ban the
sale of HIV home-testing kits, which is expected to benefit business
significantly and have positive wider benefits for the public. The
department is taking forward work to implement this and other changes
identified through the Red Tape Challenge process by the end of this
Parliament.</hs_WAIndent>

to stop there. Some of the comments the department received through the
Red Tape Challenge related to non-regulatory issues. For example,
comments received about the deprivation of 
<?notus-xml column=135?>liberty safeguards suggested that while the measures were important, the
number and complexity of some of the forms made it difficult and
time-consuming for people to use them. In response the department plans
to tackle this in 2014 by both reducing the existing number of forms
and redesigning them so that they are easier to use. Another
non-regulatory improvement will be a reduction in the amount of
unnecessary guidance issued by the Care Quality Commission when they
introduce new fundamental standards of care, saving people time in
familiarising themselves with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121758000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131217-wms0001.htm#13121758000055">I am

share a vision for the Territory as a vibrant and flourishing
community, proudly retaining aspects of British identity and generating
opportunities for its people. In this spirit of partnership, the
British and Anguilla Governments agreed a Framework for Fiscal
Responsibility and Development, which was passed into Anguillan law in
November 2013. This set out the Government of Anguilla’s
commitment to a balanced budget, borrowing guidelines and a medium term
fiscal plan for the management of public finances over the next five
years. On 26 November, the 2013 Joint Ministerial Council brought
together UK Ministers and Overseas Territory leaders and agreed an
ambitious agenda to support economic diversification, jobs and economic
growth in the Territories. In Anguilla, the British Government is,
among other things, supporting efforts to develop professional skills
for the financial services and information and communications
technology sectors, vocational skills and commercial

the Immovable Property Commission established in the north provided an
effective remedy for local property issues related to the Cyprus

of the Cyprus problem and we believe it can best be addressed as part

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of

the General Register Office, for the registration of deaths. The
process of death registration is normally straightforward and timely.
Deaths that are not referred to a coroner are usually registered within
a few days of occurrence after the appropriate certification has been
issued. When a death is the subject of a coroner investigation the
registration takes place after its conclusion, when the cause of death
has been established. Where a coroner has started an investigation, he
or she may issue a certificate of the fact of death to interested
persons but this cannot be used for registration purposes. The Chief
Coroner has issued guidance to all coroners on the operation of the
Coroners and Justice Act 2009, which includes setting out the coroner's
role in the registration of deaths. The Department of Health's death
certification reforms when implemented are not expected to have any
significant bearing on the existing time period for the registration of
deaths. Deaths not investigated by a coroner will continue to be
registered within a few days of
occurrence.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">
