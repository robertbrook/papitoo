The Government take the problem of late payment very seriously and have
taken a number of steps to support small businesses. We have
strengthened the UK’s legislative framework on late payment; we
have put pressure on large companies to commit to good payment
practices, resulting in the majority of FTSE 100 companies signing up
to the prompt payment code; and we have helped
small<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:07:51"></hs_TimeCode> businesses

Harrison (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, given that the Forum of Private
Business says that action is now long overdue on this issue, and given
that 94% of the firms in the British Chambers of Commerce are
habitually paid late, when will this quixotic Government, forever
tilting at the wrong windmills of public policy, implement the late
payment on commercial debt legislation so that government departments
pay on time and big businesses do not use small businesses and
suppliers as shadow banks? Will the Minister institute a kitemark for
those good firms that do pay on time and that are currently unprotected
by this idle
Government?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13121847000250" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000250">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, we need no lessons from the
former Government opposite on how this matter is handled. The fact is
that tackling late payment requires a change in business culture and
that the Government alone cannot solve the problem without 
<?notus-xml column=1256?>interfering in the freedom of businesses to contract with each other.
However, the noble Lord makes an important point about a kitemark and,
in effect, an accreditation system. The Prime Minister decided to
consult on this issue and on 7 December we published a discussion paper
on building a responsible payment culture in the UK. We are working
with business organisations to ensure that we get views from a wide
range of businesses, and we will decide what further legislative or
non-legislative action to take based on responses to this
paper.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Maddock" PimsId="1636" UID="13121847000251" xid="1335" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000251">Baroness

consultation, but I am sure that the Minister is aware that huge
quantities of money are held up through retentions and that many small
businesses never get complete payments at the end of their contract. As
I understand it—I would be grateful if he could confirm this,
and, if it is the case, do something about it—neither of these
issues is part of the consultation that the Government have put
forward. I hope he can assure me that they will be

Peston (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, first, I congratulate my noble
friend on asking this important Question, although I hope he would
agree that it is not only small firms that suffer from the late payment
problem. All firms tend to find that the problem arises. Does the
Minister agree that there are two aspects to this Question? One is an
ethical aspect: namely, businesses simply should not, as a matter of
course, use late payment as their method of financing themselves
temporarily. Do the Government agree that this is a serious ethical
problem and that businesses ought to start to behave better? The second
aspect is an economic one. Does the Minister agree that, rather like
the parable of the fleas, if a big firm does not pay the next firm
down, it in turn will not pay the next firm down and it will go on ad
infinitum until eventually someone will go broke? When they go broke,
lots of firms will go broke and the system will become destabilised.

new form of
destabilisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:12:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="13121847000254" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000254">Viscount

important points. It is an ethical issue. The previous Government
brought in the prompt payment code, which is voluntary. My honourable
friend in the other place—the Minister of State, Michael
Fallon —contacted a number of FTSE 100 companies and
managed to increase the number signing up to the code from 30 to 72.
The noble Lord is completely 
<?notus-xml column=1257?>correct on the economic issue. That is why we have made some good

failed to sign up to the prompt payment code. However, companies that
pay their small suppliers in 90 or 120 days could still be signatories
to the code. In fact, at least one FTSE 100 company extended its

the demand for skills would be significant, not only with HS2 but with
all the other infrastructure projects that are being launched thanks to
the actions of this Government. My noble friend will take some comfort
from the fact that the National Skills Academy for Railway Engineering,
which was established in 2010 with wide railway industry support, is
helping to tackle the current and future skills needs 
<?notus-xml column=1259?>within the industry. It is working closely with HS2 to identify skills
gaps and promote railway engineering skills. We obviously have the
Tunnelling and Underground Construction Academy, which has played an

do so with the super-sewer for London and then
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>. The skills

that HS2, along with various engineering companies, is taking out is
targeted at schools in Britain rather than those overseas. For example,
HS2 sent a contingent of 30 people to the skills show in Birmingham to
which youngsters came from all over the country. I am confident that a

Standards Agency—and shows that putting folic acid in flour
causes no side effects for males. Is it not therefore time to change

feasibility study of, for example, radio broadcasting in North Korea,
but has concluded that because of the North Korean Government’s
ability to jam broadcasts, the reach that would result from such
broadcasting would not provide sufficient value for money. The noble

is a catastrophe in Syria and also, in terms of the effects, outside.
As the noble Baroness knows, getting access is extremely difficult. We
have been pressing extremely hard on this issue as well as making a
financial contribution. She will be aware that the UNSC made a

Hardie (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 166,
I wish to speak also to Amendment 166B. At Second Reading, a number of
noble Lords expressed concern about the changes to the existing limits
on controlled expenditure that Clause 27 seeks to introduce.
Justification for such a change is obviously necessary. The Explanatory
Notes provide no assistance in understanding the rationale for this
change. In his response at Second Reading the Minister, the noble Lord,
Lord Wallace of Saltaire, did not explain what problems had been caused
by the existing limits. I am confident that if there was sound
justification for reducing the expenditure limits based on past
experience of the operation of Section 85 of the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act 2000 within its limited scope
of activities, the Minister would have advised the House of that. That
is particularly so where justification was sought by noble Lords, but
none was
forthcoming.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000086">If
there have been no problems, why reduce the limits which have been in
existence for at least 13 years? Moreover, how can the
Government justify reducing expenditure limits while at the same time
increasing the range of qualifying activities? In his reply, will the
noble and learned Lord the Advocate-General please answer the following
questions? First, what is the reason for Clause 27(1)? Secondly, what
problems have been caused over the years by having the existing limits?
Thirdly, in proposing to reduce the limits, what assessment did the
Government make of the likely increase in expenditure caused by the
extension of controlled activities introduced by Clause 26? If the
noble and learned Lord has no answer that justifies this extreme
provision, will he acknowledge the strength of feeling that exists that
this clause is grossly unfair, is a disproportionate interference in
the right to freedom of speech and political engagement, and is an
obstruction to
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:03:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Monday in Committee, the noble and learned Lord repeated the
Government’s commitment to bring forward amendments on Report
that will increase the registration thresholds. That is a welcome
acceptance by the Government that Clause 27(1) cannot remain in its
present form. In these circumstances will the noble and learned Lord
accept this amendment today to remove this clause? The effect of that
will be to restore the status quo, and the Government can start afresh
with their thinking about the appropriate limits informed by the
debates that we are about to have today. Thereafter, the Government can
come forward with a clause that is more appropriate and can be
justified by
Ministers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000088">I
turn to Amendment 166B, which goes further than the previous amendment.
The effect of the previous amendment is to restore the status quo as
far as financial limits are concerned but it makes no allowance 
<?notus-xml column=1273?>for the increase in the list of activities

It abolishes the distinction between the constituent parts of the
United Kingdom and proposes an increase to £25,000. The fifth
report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, <I>The Funding of
Political Parties in the United Kingdom</I>, which was presented to
Parliament in October 1998, recommended that the expenditure limit
should be fixed at £25,000, hence my choice of that figure. No
distinction was drawn in that recommendation, which was number 55,
between the constituent parts of the United Kingdom. In their response,
presented to Parliament in July 1999, the Government accepted the
proposal for a scheme of registration for third parties but fixed the
limit at £10,000. That response did not distinguish between the
constituent parts of the United Kingdom. The footnote to paragraph 7.27
of that response is as
follows:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121847000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000181">“The

is a hint of a distinction there, but the government response did not

recognise that a distinction should be drawn between the various
countries when one considers total expenditure by a recognised third
party in each one, because that distinction reflects the number of
constituencies in each one. That distinction is preserved in
paragraph 3(2) of Schedule 10 to the 2000 Act, but I do not

one is to encourage democracy and keep that bureaucratic burden to an

overall limits of total expenditure. That approach will also benefit
the Electoral Commission by reducing the number of organisations that
it requires to monitor; £25,000 is below the current total
allowable expenditure for each country, although I appreciate that it
will exceed the total expenditure proposed in the Bill for
each of Wales and Northern Ireland. Obviously, if these new limits are
approved for these countries, a different figure should be fixed for
each, but this amendment proceeds on the basis of current figures. On
any view, even if changes are proposed in the Bill, the figure of
£25,000 would seem appropriate for England and Scotland, because

debate on 
<?notus-xml column=1277?>this important topic. Amendments 167 and 168 accept that there need to
be limits, but seek to change as little as possible. As was pointed out
by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, the reason for this is that
there is not evidence that the limits so far have caused great
difficulties or given rise to many problems. The amendments therefore
seek not to reduce the amounts from £10,000 to £5,000 and
from £5,000 to £2,000, but merely to restore the
purchasing power of those figures. I must say to my noble and learned
friend on the Front Bench that I think £2,000 for a single
constituency is a very low sum indeed. Hiring a hall and some audio
equipment would make a very sizeable dent in that
sum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000109">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:19:15"></hs_TimeCode>
Bank of England’s inflation indicator, a wonderful thing to play
with of an afternoon, enables you to check purchasing power on any day
from 1750 to 2012. The purchasing power of £1 in 1750 is
equivalent to £187.76 in 2012, just as an aside. The relevant
figures are from 2000 to 2012. The purchasing power of £1 in
2000 was equivalent to £1.42 in 2012. In other words, inflation
has averaged 2.9% per annum, and therefore the purchasing power of
£1 is now only 70p. On that basis, applying that across the
piece, you come out with a figure of £14,200 from
£10,000, or £7,100 from £5,000. I have merely

the registration thresholds be lower for those nations? Although our
commission eventually plumped for the figure of £10,000 for
those three nations, we were very tempted to put it higher,
particularly because of all the difficulties in Northern Ireland, the
key role that charities are playing there and their great desire not to
be identified with any particular political party at this time of
emergence from conflict to democracy. There is therefore a very strong

activities—even if you take out staff time, as we hope the

fact, we understand that the Countryside Alliance had specific legal
advice that its activities would be subject to PPERA regulations if it
spent enough on materials to breach the registration threshold. It did
not register, but that is only because it did not spend enough on
printed materials. As the case study in the second commission report
shows, it would clearly have needed to register under the Bill because
of the new activities subject to registration. Its activities were not
just to become transparent through regulation but would have been
restricted because of the lower spending cap and the very low
constituency

our report we set out the particular case of the Countryside Alliance
and the difficulties that it would find itself in as a result of the

charities that they are not in the business of promoting 
<?notus-xml column=1279?>or procuring the electoral advantages of a
particular party, but that reassurance does not work because the sting
is in not that sentence but the qualifications. A charity campaigning
on policy can suddenly find that inadvertently, even if it has not
mentioned a political party, and even if its primary purpose is
something else altogether, it is coming up to the line where it might
be caught by this regulation. It is this in particular that the
commission wishes to draw to the attention of the Minister as we debate
this amendment on thresholds; they need to be as high as possible in

to find a balance between the very legitimate arguments put forward by
charities, not least by the noble and right reverend Lord himself, and
the real danger—I am sorry to have to say this again—of
there being very heavy expenditure within one or a few constituencies
that might, almost inevitably, alter the outcome of an election,
despite the fact that it was not the intention to elect a particular
candidate. At a certain point the level of material, campaigning and so
on begins to reach such a high volume that it is very hard to make that

that we hear from the noble and right reverend Lord on the issue of
bunching together different kinds of campaigns in a particular

kinds of ways around our incredibly complicated registration and

grow to be quite big fish, and there is a temptation to follow the
examples elsewhere. Not only does that give an illegitimate basis on
which to hold the election but, perhaps equally important, it
discourages people of moderate income from standing for Parliament
because of the very large figures that they are supposed to meet. Will

Lord Harries, has

thresholds and I will confine what I am going to say, quite briefly, to
that aspect. It is clearly accepted that the thresholds are going to go
up from those proposed in the Bill, which are very low indeed. The
question is clearly: how far? If the aim is to catch wealthy
organisations and individuals and to prevent undue influence on the
electoral process by those with money, the response has got to be
proportionate, as I am sure the Minister would accept.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has been having difficulty sleeping.
Indeed, the speech from the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, on
Monday caused me some lack of sleep. She chided  me about what
I had said about ogres coming out of the woodwork, so I had a further
look at it. Because she has just raised the point now, I will say this.
She produced shocking figures about what was going on in America and
raised the spectre of this somehow creeping across the Atlantic and
affecting our electoral process. No specific evidence has been produced
for the need for specific constituency spending limits. The Government
have produced no specific examples in defence of their argument on this
topic—for example, of disproportionate spending in one
constituency that has had undue influence on the
outcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000126">However,
this is not the only piece of legislation that deals with this matter.
There is also the Representation of the People Act 1983. Even if there
were to be targeting of a specific candidate in a specific
constituency, that Act covers constituency spending by candidates and
also—this needs to be restated—spending by non-party
campaigners who have campaigned for or against a specific candidate.
What is more, breaches of the Representation of the People Act are the
responsibility of the police to investigate, with all the sanctions
that follow from that. The Electoral Commission does
not  
<?notus-xml column=1281?>have the enforcement powers for these rules. So, if

noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, with his extraordinary mathematics on
inflation, telling us how much it actually costs to put on a show, be
it a conference or a different occasion, I was completely convinced.
Then the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said  that these things were
costing far too much. Has he seen printers’ bills lately and

in relation to Clause 26 was that of smaller charities. The noble Lord,
Lord Tyler, was quite right in describing the role of smaller

these charities are linked in a coalition? I know that we are going to
discuss the coalitions again, but it hinges on this a little bit. Many
of these charities which were spawned by the larger
charities—Oxfam and Christian Aid—are now growing in
their own right but nevertheless have a symbiotic connection and are

Advocate-General for Scotland (Lord Wallace of Tankerness)
(LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Hardie, for introducing these amendments. It has been obvious since
Second Reading in this House, and indeed before, that the registration
threshold has given rise to considerable controversy and debate. As
noble Lords are aware, third parties that incur controlled expenditure
are not subject to any electoral controls on their activities provided
they campaign only up to a particular expenditure threshold in a
relevant election.</hs_para>

threshold at £10,000 for third parties campaigning in England
and at £5,000 for third parties campaigning in Scotland, Wales
or Northern Ireland. As has been said by numerous contributors, the
Bill amends these amounts to £5,000 and £2,000
respectively. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, perfectly fairly
asked the purpose of this. The aim is to increase openness. There is a
good argument that those who spend money in a way that can reasonably
be regarded as intended to promote or procure success at any
relevant election—to promote not a policy but the advantage of a
party or candidate—should do so transparently. Amendment 166,
tabled by the noble and learned Lord, seeks to return the thresholds to
their original PPERA levels. The amendment tabled by my noble friend
Lord Tyler seeks the same result, but proposes a
third threshold of £5,850 where spending has been incurred
solely in a single
constituency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121847000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121847000142">My
noble friend Lord Hodgson goes a step further and suggests thresholds
of £14,000 in England and £7,000 in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. The amendments tabled by the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, go further still and propose
thresholds of £20,000 and £10,000 respectively. Finally,
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, suggests a registration
threshold of £25,000 applied to each of the constituent parts of
the United

Lords will know that when a third party registers with the Electoral
Commission, it becomes a recognised third party. Upon registration, the
third party becomes subject to spending and donation controls for the
duration of the regulated period of the relevant election. The Bill
intends to ensure greater transparency of campaign finance, which is
why it revised the current registration thresholds to £5,000 and
£2,000. It was intended to have the effect that more third
parties would be required to account for expenditure and provide
details of the donations they receive, bearing in mind that the fact of
registration means that the

keeps using that phrase, which is accurate, and in the Bill. However,
that is only part of the definition. The House needs to recognise the

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> I hear what the noble Baroness
says. I am sure, as she recognises, that it is difficult to be
criticised for quoting directly from the Bill. However, she makes the
point that there could be detriment to a party. It is quite proper,
too, that if a third-party organisation was to campaign to try to
defeat the Labour Party’s chances in a range of constituencies
and its activities could be quite reasonably seen as aiming to thwart
the Labour Party in a campaign, it is important that there is
transparency—that people know where the money comes from and
what is behind the campaign to do down a particular party.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:46:41"></hs_TimeCode> Monday we had
a debate on principal purpose which the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Hardie, introduced. Of course there can be other purposes. It may be
that in trying to do down the Labour Party that group hopes to raise
funds and increase its membership. However, that does not detract from
the fact that there is an electoral purpose, which is what we seek to
catch. I see the noble Baroness shaking her head, but it is
important to remind the House that the definition we are
talking about is one that her party put into legislation in the 2000
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:47:56"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
slightly ironic that I am having to defend that definition, when her
own party put it into the original 2000

which are quite clearly and easily defined as this. The worry about
this clause is that it includes rallies that might happen. They are not
aimed at harming the Labour Party. On Iraq, they were aimed at stopping
the war. The effect was to affect a political party. Therefore again,
the Minister is suggesting that the activity has to be aimed at
electoral outcome rather than at a particular policy. Every group that
has spoken this morning about this as a result of reading his words on
Monday, says that his words are narrower than what its lawyers tell
them is suggested by the wording of the

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, it is not a subjective
test—we made that very clear. The Labour Party did not put a
subjective test into its legislation in 2000. It is an objective test.
Therefore, to say that it is solely about what a particular third-party
organisation aims to do is not a fair representation of what it says.
It is about what can reasonably be regarded. That is an objective test,
and we rehearsed all the arguments for and against an objective or
subjective test. Therefore it is not unreasonable to remind the
Committee about what is here in the Act, which is a definition that the
Government introduced by amendment in the other place because people
clearly expressed that they wanted us to use the tried and tested
definition that was used in the elections of 2005 and 2010. However, I

chilling effect. I think I said that on Monday, and I accept that

or an opposition party, adopted that policy—or, indeed, adopted
a policy directly contrary to it? A party might adopt that campaign
objective as policy—or, indeed, a party might introduce
legislation affecting it. If the organisation steps up its campaigning
because of the change in the political situation, does that core policy

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> I think I addressed that point in
our debate on Monday, and I quoted from the Electoral
Commission’s guidance on the subject. The noble
Baroness’s final sentence was interesting, because she asked
what would happen if the organisation stepped up its campaign. I think
I gave reasons on Monday why, if an organisation had a campaign that
had been going on for many months or even years, and one party
subsequently decided to endorse it, that should not affect the
organisation. However, if it seized on that development and sought to
ratchet up its campaign by several notches, and encouraged—at
least by implication—people to vote in a certain way, that would
make a difference. That is reflected in the Electoral
Commission’s guidance. On Monday we had a discussion on whether
it would be better to clarify 
<?notus-xml column=1286?>such things in the Bill or to leave it to guidance. That is a perfectly
legitimate question, and as I said then, it is one on which the

Mallalieu:</Member></B> Will the Minister, during the reflective
period, focus on the idea of something that suddenly becomes topical
because the Government of the day introduce a Bill that does exactly
the opposite of what the campaigning organisation wishes to achieve? He
talked about “ratcheting up”, or increasing the volume.
Surely that would be an inevitable part of campaigning if the
organisation were suddenly faced with what it saw as a piece of hostile
legislation. Would that organisation not then be able to campaign
actively against the measure—although presumably, that is not
something to which a Government who were anxious to encourage democracy

this subject on Monday; I do not want to go over again everything that
I said then, and rerun that debate. I will certainly reflect on what
the noble Baroness has said; indeed, I spoke on Monday about some of
the clarity sought. I think that the noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries, was encouraging me to act, and said that a number of
people wanted to put things in the Bill. He listed a number of things,
and I said that there had to be a balance between what we put in a Bill
and what we leave to guidance. That is a perfectly proper matter for us

charities and other campaigners had expressed fears that because
low-level campaigning and expenditure could be regulated as a result of
the Bill, small organisations would face a disproportionate reporting
and compliance burden. Those concerns have been reflected in most of
the contributions this morning. My noble friend Lord Tyler talked on
Monday about the balance between transparency and regulation. Almost
inevitably, the more transparent we seek to make the arrangements, the
greater will be the amount of regulation. That point was echoed this
morning by my noble friend Lady

should be greater clarity about who is campaigning for the electoral

fear of having onerous burdens placed upon them. Therefore, in line
with what my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire committed in the

individual to spend £24,999.99p in one constituency without
being in any way accountable for how that money was spent and 
<?notus-xml column=1287?>without having to be transparent about where the money came from, even
though that sum would far exceed what we might
expect to have as the limit on spending. It simply would not be known
that that was happening because the registration threshold was so high;

restrictions on spending in individual constituencies, that sum would

that, if you have a campaign, you cannot answer for it if you are a

that, in reducing the thresholds from £10,000 and £5,000

decrease for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. I have certainly

effect of that provision is that the relevant figures for the countries
are: £319,000 for England, reduced from £793,000;
£35,000 for Scotland, reduced from £108,000;
£24,000 for Wales, reduced from £80,000; and

will not repeat the figures, but I will ask the noble and learned Lord
the Advocate-General to justify the changes in this particular
paragraph. The activities subject to control have been extended, yet it
is proposed to reduce the total permissible expenditure. Moreover, the
period covered is 12 months before an election. At Second Reading I
drew attention to the following anomaly: in the context of Scotland, I
doubted whether a campaign group could fund a national rally about an
issue of importance to it, within a budget of £35,000. Even if
it could, such a rally would exhaust its budget, leaving it unable to
campaign effectively in any other way.</hs_para>

expenditure is highlighted when one has regard to the provisions in
paragraph 5 of Schedule 10 to the 2000 Act about elections to the
Scottish Parliament. The relevant figure for controlled expenditure is
£75,800 and the relevant period is four months prior to the
election. At the risk of showing my lack of the mathematical expertise
that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, has, I say that a simple
arithmetical approach of multiplying that figure by three would produce
an equivalent annual figure of £227,400. But that, I
acknowledge, is oversimplistic, as the greater part of any allowance
will be expended in the last few months prior to an election.
Accordingly, although probably still higher than the current annual
figure of £108,000, the equivalent extrapolated figure would be
approximate to it. If the proposed figure of £35,000,
represented by the 2% introduced by Clause 27(2), is implemented, the
discrepancy between the allowance for UK elections and elections to the
Scottish Parliament is vast. Such a discrepancy for the same country in
the same schedule to the 2000 Act demands an explanation and
justification. In his reply will the noble and learned Lord the
Advocate-General provide the House with the required explanation and
justification for this
disparity?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000005">The

democratic process and to avoid the absurdity and likely confusion that
will arise from such disparate figures in Scotland, where campaign

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak to
Amendment 169A. I would like to ask the Minister what the rationale was
behind such a drastic reduction in the spending limits. For England it
was a 60% reduction; for the other nations it was 70%. This is a vast
reduction, for which no reason was given. The commission which I have
the privilege of chairing simply wishes to revert to the original PPERA
figures plus inflation. Those are written in the amendment, and would
mean £1,125,000 for the year for England; the comparable figures
for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales would be £155,000,
£86,000 and £40,000. We are simply recommending the
original PPERA figures plus
inflation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000008">I
will give one example of a big spending campaign which is concerned
about the cap. In the 2010 general election, Hope not Hate registered
£319,231 of spending in England with the Electoral Commission.
It is a 
<?notus-xml column=1290?>national grass-roots organisation that seeks to challenge and expose
openly racist political parties, candidates and policies. It works on
the assumption that there is a risk that far-right racist policies
might be campaigned on vigorously at election time, and it wishes to
oppose that with racially tolerant policies. For example, in an area
like Barking and Dagenham in 2010 where it mobilised people, its
spending included printing of leaflets and Hope not Hate newspapers,
staff time  to write campaign literature, media coverage costs,
communicating the campaign to supporters, and its battle bus bill. Of
course, an organisation such as this, quite properly, needs to register
and needs to be totally transparent in what it does, but the spending
limits proposed in the Bill would severely reduce what that
organisation would be able to do. It spent in 2010 £319,231,
which is above the limit in the Bill. There is clearly a strong case
for reverting not only to PPERA but to PPERA plus inflation on the

Lord a question. He and his commission have justifiably encouraged us
to see the package—how different elements of the Bill stick
together. I draw his attention to the fact that his amendment, combined
with other amendments to remove all constituency limits that he and his
colleagues have proposed, would, if they were to be implemented, mean
that the sum of £1.25 million could be spent in a small
number  of target marginal constituencies. That is a huge sum
of money. When we come to the other sections that deal with
constituency limits, will he think about the implications of the

Horam (Con):</Member></B> I intervene briefly to support the Government
and oppose the amendments put forward from the Cross Benches because
the overall argument about undue influence is important here. As the
noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has just said in his intervention, it is not
only a question of the total amount of money spent but of the way in
which it is deployed in any geographical area, whether it is in one
constituency, a number of constituencies, Scotland, Wales or England.
That is the problem and that is why the Government are right to try to
reduce the spending limits, with a view to reducing the possibility of
undue

discussion of the figures of a 60% or 70% reduction, and I obviously do
not know exactly how they were arrived at in detail, but I know, as we
all know, what happened at the last general election. As the noble and
right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, rightly pointed out, spending by the
Hope not Hate campaign throughout the whole country totalled
£319,000. It was the third biggest spender, and only two
registered third parties spent more than the Government are
proposing—the public services union, 
<?notus-xml column=1291?>Unison, which spent £671,000, and Vote for Change, which is a
Liberal Democrat-backed organisation wanting change to the electoral
system. Those are the only two organisations, apart from Hope not Hate,

Government.</hs_para>

fully accept that there will now be a different definition of
controlled expenditure, and on previous amendments I pointed out that
the Government should look very carefully at what is included in
controlled expenditure, particularly in relation to staff costs. If
they were to be removed from the definition of controlled expenditure,
most of the problems in that regard would be solved. However, leaving
that aside, the fact is that the spending of most other organisations
that registered—all the fuss is about only the 30 or so
organisations that took the trouble to register in the last general
election—was way below £319,000, which is the limit
proposed by the Government in the Bill. There is plenty of headroom
there for people to run a proper campaign, given that they can
concentrate those resources in a particular area. However, it is the
overriding view of the Government that such a campaign should not
unduly influence the result in any particular constituency. It is

not appear to have happened. This is a pretty draconian cut of between
60% and 70%. It is perhaps right that I should simply add that, so far

perhaps because Labour is outspent by the Conservatives. The current
situation is bad for democracy, not simply for ourselves, and the major
reason is because money and politics rarely mix. We want all groups,

Government to propose and for Parliament to decide on the appropriate
limits, in order to balance that freedom of expression against controls
of undue influence. The commission listed some of the factors we ought
to think about, such as inflation and the wider range of activities.
However, we find it difficult to see how the Government have thought
about those matters in the way that my noble friend Lady Lister

the House will remember, were set on last time? Did these figures just
come out of a roulette wheel without rhyme or reason, or is there
something that we could look at to test the Government’s

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, again we are grateful to
the noble and leaned Lord, Lord Hardie, for introducing this part of
the Bill and the consideration of the overall spending limits. As no
doubt the Committee is aware, third parties are subject to limits on
the amount of controlled expenditure that they may incur during the
regulated period of a United Kingdom parliamentary general election.
The initial figures set out in PPERA 2000 set the limit at
£988,500 for the whole of the United Kingdom and this Bill, as
has been heard, seeks to amend that limit to £390,000. The limit
in either case is of course the aggregate of individual limits of each
part of the United Kingdom. That means that expenditure is allocated in
accordance with where its effect is most significantly felt. If a body
has its head office in Scotland, for example, but undertakes and
targets its campaign work only in England, then that spending will be
allocated to the English limit and not the Scottish
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:21:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Hardie, has tabled amendments so that the spending limit for
third parties remains as it is in PPERA 2000, and the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, has proposed limits that
would take the spending limit to £1,406,000 across the United
Kingdom as a whole. This substantial increase, as I understand it, is
to reflect inflation since the original limit was set 13 years ago.
There has been considerable discussion, not just in this House but also
in the other place, about third-party campaigners and the potential to
incur significant amounts of expenditure in campaigns. This was spoken
about very eloquently by my noble friend Lady Williams. The noble
Baroness, Lady Hayter, indicated that her party has no desire to see
the cost of politics increase, nor, indeed, do we want to see a
disproportionate effect on elections by those who have lots of money to
throw
around<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:22:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

potential, given that limits are imposed on political
parties—let us remember that, if we look at this in its full
context, there are limits on political parties—that we would
undermine that regime if their supporters could still demonstrate their
backing by diverting funding to a formally or informally aligned party.
Allowing very large sums to be spent to the benefit of parties that are
candidates in this way risks, I believe, undermining the basic rules
that have evolved over the years in terms of restriction of political
spending in elections. The nature of third parties means that controls
on their spending are necessary. I do not believe that we have really
debated limits, but I do not think that anyone has challenged the
principle that there should be some control on substantial
spending<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of third-party expenditure increasing. In 2010,
eight third-party organisations spent more than
£100,000, although, as I think my noble friend Lord Horam
correctly pointed out, most who were registered—and only 30 were
registered—spent considerably less than that. Indeed, some who
were registered spent nothing at all. Although there were eight who
spent more than £100,000 in 2010, in 2005 only two groups did
so. I believe, and we have said all these things many times, that it is
about trying to strike the right balance to ensure transparency. We
believe that the figure in the Bill is a reasonable limit for national
third-party campaigning. Most campaigns in the last election did not
spend anywhere near either the total amount that was available then or
the amount that is proposed in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000026">It has
been argued that these previous campaigns did not require third parties
to account for a much wider range of activities, but it is worth
reflecting on the fact that the Green Party, a political party, spent
£330,000 on its national campaign in the 2010 general election.
That campaign activity included incurring expenses on advertising,
unsolicited materials, manifestos, market research, transport, media
events and rallies—all activities that third parties should also
account for. No one can doubt that the Green Party had a very strong
voice in that campaign and indeed succeeded in getting its first ever

national debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:25:14"></hs_TimeCode>.

third parties should be dominating the electoral landscape—by
“third parties” I do not mean political parties but such

campaigners have to include staff costs, so there is not an even
playing field. Furthermore, will he acknowledge that the whole
political landscape now is very different from what it was, say, 20 or
30 years ago, with a dramatic decline in political-party
membership and the rise in membership of third-party campaigners? Does
the apparent indifference of so many people, sadly, to political-party
campaigns and their enthusiasm and commitment to third-party campaigns
not indicate that third-party campaigns should be treated equally

Lord Harries, makes a fair point that, as a party, the staff costs were
not included, but I think one of the reasons was referred to by my
noble friend Lord Gardiner on Monday. Political parties’ staff
are fully committed and are very transparently fighting an election,
whereas one might reasonably assume that, when larger organisations
undertake political campaigning—and we accept that they are
registered because they believe that their campaigning could reasonably
be judged to give an electoral advantage, or disadvantage, to one party
or another—their staff’s time is not entirely taken up
with it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:29:10"></hs_TimeCode>. He

or another—it is not unreasonable that there should be some
transparency in that. Equally, it is not unreasonable that the rules
which have been set about party-political expenditure should not be got

Electoral Commission, which after all is the Government’s

up the spending limits, because everything is going to be covered. Some
organisations have been mentioned already, but the BMA, NCVO, RSPB,

know, the law says that it is immaterial whether something can be

think I can honestly say that there is a scientific means of arriving
at a figure, any more than I suspect the Labour Government used a
scientific method to reach their figures for spending limits and
thresholds in 2000. I repeat that the balance we seek is one that will
secure greater transparency but not lead to unnecessary regulation,

were anticipating that by now we might be moving on to the QSD. It is
certainly not at my insistence that this group of amendments should be
taken at 1.41 pm. However, as we have been gathering from all sides of
the Committee during discussions this morning, the constituency limits,
which are the subject of Clause 28 and therefore of this group, are
very important and of central significance to the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000046">We
have heard that the Government did not bring this legislation forward
to affect charity campaigning or to stop NGOs having their say about
policy issues. The purpose of the Bill is to stop big money flooding
into constituencies in the year before an election in an 
<?notus-xml column=1299?>attempt to, in one direction, augment or to subvert candidates’
own spending limits. As I have already had occasion to say to the
Committee, even if we in this House did not think that was important,
there will be Members at the other end of the building who would think
that it was extremely important—not least, perhaps, those
pro-Europe Conservative MPs and candidates who might well be targeted
by substantial sums of money, let alone others who may be in a similar
position and a target for single-issue campaigning by individuals,
multimillionaires or
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:42:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000047">Clause
28 is very important but it is by no means perfect, as has already been
made apparent by many noble Lords this morning. The Bill talks about
activity that has “significant effects” in a particular
constituency or group of constituencies. The difficulty is that some of
the groups that we have all met might, for example, hold a rally in one
constituency which would have an effect on a great many others. I
recall chairing just such a constituency rally, but if it had that
significance for neighbouring constituencies in Cornwall, it would be
very difficult to allocate the actual expenditure in any particular
way. It would be very difficult to see what relative effect this was
going to have in different adjoining constituencies. Frankly, as a
former candidate, I rarely worried about somebody holding a meeting in
the neighbouring constituency—or, for that matter, even in my
own constituency—in terms of that affecting the outcome of the
election. What affects elections most strongly is direct communication
with electors and, as has already been mentioned this morning, the
means of doing that have become more effective and cheaper in recent
years. That is what can really sway a constituency result one way or
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:43:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121848000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000071">1.45

amendment, Amendment 170A, seeks to make the constituency limit about
just those direct activities. The Electoral Commission cites our
amendment as having “potential benefits”. It would define
the limit as dealing with election material—leaflets, letters
and so on—sent to electors, in one way or another, through their
doors. It would deal also with what is called “push”
polling. That is where someone rings up to say, “Are you aware
of the Labour Party’s record on crashing the economy?”
or, for example, “Are you aware of the Conservative
Party’s plans to give inheritance tax cuts to
billionaires?”. Some may think that that is entirely objective
and legitimate polling. It does happen and becomes increasingly
effective—needless to say, there is very effective push polling
in relation to my own party. It would also deal with ordinary
canvassing by telephone. All these things cost money but make a real
difference in constituency campaigns and affect the outcomes of
elections<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:45:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000049">The
groups that I have met—I am sure it would apply to
others—look relieved when I suggest this amendment to them. It
would make things simpler for those who are caught by the definition
because, where telephone calls are being made or letters or leaflets
sent to someone’s home, you would know it is a campaign targeted
at that particular geographical area and deliberately trying to affect
the outcome in that constituency. There can be no uncertainty about
that. The amendment sticks to the vital policy intention to 
<?notus-xml column=1300?>have a constituency limit but makes its operation much simpler. As I
have said, I am pleased to note that the Electoral Commission, with
which I have not agreed about everything, finds this a very helpful and
practical solution to an otherwise rather tricky
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:45:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000050">My
noble friend Lord Greaves and I have different amendments, which get
rid of the obscure reference to a percentage of national units and
instead make clear, in the Bill, precisely what the pound sign applies
to, rather than having a percentage figure. Again, that
would be a simplification. There is a case of course for
these limits to be lower than suggested, and the opportunity
to hear that case is there in Amendments 170C and 170E. I am
not sure whether they will receive much support in your
Lordships’ Committee but the issue of the appropriate limit
remains extremely important for the whole legitimacy and effectiveness
of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:46:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000051">Amendment
170F would permit the limits to be changed later by statutory
instrument. One of the campaigners we met said that he thought that the
limits should only be changeable upwards in this way, to avoid any
suggestion that voices could later be quashed by a quick fix. That is a
fair suggestion and I hope that, when we come back on Report, we may
decide that any such changes should be limited to upward changes.
However, the principle that these limits may not be perfect is not a
new idea and worth acknowledging with an order-making power. That would
of course be a much more limited power than the power currently in the
Bill to change the whole of Schedule 3 by statutory instrument,
something that we will deal with later and which may raise the whole
question of a Henry VIII

170G sets out to acknowledge the clear difference between, on the one
hand, a millionaire walking into a constituency to spend lots of money
swaying the result in the direction that he favours and, on the other
hand, a local group raising lots of money from small donations. That
surely is different in principle and it would be very helpful if we
could find a way of differentiating between the two. Our amendment here
would allow for the local groups to spend more money than the
millionaires, provided the money could be raised locally. For the
provision to work, they would have to record all those
donations—not just those below the present recording
threshold—and declare them. That will be their choice but a
local group might well be prepared to do just
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:48:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000053">Extra
transparency and local fundraising would mean extra spending capacity.
We should all recognise that idea as being legitimate, and we therefore
wanted to float it at this stage. It introduces no extra complexity for
those who keep to the normal constituency limit proposed in the Bill
but gives flexibility to those who think that they could exceed it with
a genuine, local, grass-roots campaign. The Government should endorse
that principle, even if the amendment itself could be
improved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121848000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121848000054">Our
amendments in this group are designed to help make the constituency
limit do what it is intended to do but without doing what it is not
intended to do. Our approach avoids bogging people down
needlessly in accounting for things that do not matter very much at
a constituency level. It adds much needed clarity
to the 
<?notus-xml column=1301?>whole concept of a constituency limit and
acknowledges the role of local campaigning and local fundraising. In
exactly the same spirit as the noble and right reverend Lord’s
commission, this is a practical package. It could be
implemented and is workable, but it meets the extremely important
objective of this legislation, which is to ensure that we still have
proper controls over spending at the constituency level. I beg to

take seriously what the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has said and
what earlier on the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said. Clearly, if
there is a possibility of abuse, that must be guarded against. The
commission takes that seriously. However, we must also take into
account a number of other factors, not least that the Electoral
Commission regards constituency limits as they are in the Bill at the
moment as unworkable and unenforceable. It
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121859000382" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121859000382">“In

should also be noted that political parties’ national
campaigning during the year before a UK general election is not subject
to limits on spending at constituency level. Why is there one rule on
this for political parties? Perhaps I can ask the Minister to reply to
this. Why, when according to the Bill there is to be a limit on what
third-party campaigners can spend, should the political parties have a
rule that says that there is no limit on what they can spend in a
particular constituency? Furthermore, PPERA did not contain the
provision for constituency limits. We have heard a lot about the threat
of abuse at constituency level, but there was no clear evidence of
abuse at the 2010 general
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0001.htm#13121859000004">The

main burden of the commission’s report, backed up by a number of
vivid case examples, is that it would be impossible to
comply with this law because a fair amount of campaigning crosses a
number of different constituencies. For instance, the Save Lewisham
Hospital campaign operates across three parliamentary constituencies.
So far, the campaign has collected and spent around £36,000. The

campaigning organisation without its own legal team would be able to
look at it and understand it. They would be bound to have to seek

amazed that the commission of the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord

should they have an unlimited influence in a particular constituency as
opposed to the people who have actually got the guts to stand for

the argument is put forward by the commission that any limits placed
are unenforceable. Obviously, the commission is making the point that
it is being asked to do a new task. Previously, the commission has
looked post hoc at what has happened in a general election; here it is
being asked to do it in real time, during the course of the election,
to find out exactly what is going on and whether the system is being 
<?notus-xml column=1304?>abused. That is a very difficult task and the commission is right to say
that it is having tasks imposed on it that it has not done before and
which therefore may well be very difficult to enforce, to the point of
being unenforceable in some
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000019">Those
of us who have fought elections know that the existing limits on what
parties can spend in elections are very often unenforceable in
practice. As I know to my personal cost, parties find all sorts of
devious ways around the amount that can be spent in a general election
and it is very difficult to track them down. In that sense, the
existing rules are unenforceable, but they do have a restraining
effect. As a candidate in a general election, when I came to fight the
election I knew that I had to get a little war chest together. The
general assumption was that you had to try to get together about
£10,000 to fight an
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000020">I
will say in passing that most associations and local parties are
extremely poor. Getting together £10,000 is quite hard to do. At
the penultimate general election, when I was defending a majority of
269 against the Liberal Democrats, I reached £10,000 only by
having a gift from the noble Lord, Lord Ashcroft, of £6,000;
otherwise, I and the local party would have had to fork out. We are
living in a poor world. Local parties do not have the resources of
Oxfam and all those large organisations that want to home in on an
election and put their view—as they rightly should, within
proportionate limits—to the people who stand in
elections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000021">Having

issue has been raised, in relation to the Save Lewisham Hospital

could have the expenditure divided between three constituencies. Some
expenditure would not be allowed in a particular constituency. In
Orpington, for example, there was always a huge banner, usually taped
up by the Labour Party, in one main road in my constituency and it was
never accounted for in the local expenses of the Labour Party in
Orpington although it would actually influence people going round the

something that the commission made quite clear at the beginning of its
report: that its recommendations were for the 2015 election only and
that there should be a proper review post-2015. We had only six weeks
to consult, despite the recommendation of a lot of bodies, including
ourselves, that there should have been a proper three-month or
six-month review. In the six weeks, we could not find a workable
solution to 
<?notus-xml column=1305?>this, so for the 2015 election our recommendation was that we should not
have limits. We could not get our minds round this to find one that is
really workable. The Government may be able to do this—we will
just have to see—and they may accept the amendment in the name

Sunday in September 1973 when I was accompanying my then boss, the
Chief of the General Staff, to Matins during an official visit to the
American army. A delightful elderly ex-ambassador to South Vietnam whom
we met earlier in the visit said to him, “The trouble with this
country is that it’s governed by whizz-kids, and the trouble
with whizz-kids is that they haven’t got time to listen. You

it dawned on me. Looking around Whitehall, I am struck by the numbers
of whizz-kids advising every ministerial office. I understand that this
is soon to be increased by 10 more per Secretary of State. They are not
civil servants but whizz-kids: clever young people employed because
they are uninhibited by practical experience. They are not afraid to
put forward blue-skies theories, many of which I suspect that the more
experienced Ministers would confine to the waste-paper

Atlantic and rotting up the 2015 election. Having panicked, they then
tried to prove their virility by dreaming up preventive measures, which
in their headlong rush they tried to process without submitting them to
the normal procedures which, as we know, rubbished them once they saw
them. This House too was swept along by this rush, until on Monday the
voice of experience had a chance to make itself heard. I hope that on
looking through <I>Hansard</I> their bosses will have realised that

what happens in the 2015 election to see what action may need to be

thing the Government ought to do is risk alienating voters by
threatening the contribution of the voluntary sector, which is one the

Clearly, it will have to have the resources to do that and, in
appropriate cases, it may then have to use stop notices even where risk
to the system is not an issue. If that is not the
expectation and there is not to be contemporaneous enforcement but
regulation after the event, as it were, then one calls into question
the enforceability of these provisions. I accept, of course, that as

Harries about the fact that political parties do not have to account in
this way for individual constituencies. At the moment political parties
and third parties do target marginal constituencies, particularly
constituencies where they think that their resources will be most
effective. That is unconstrained on the part of political parties,
except within the overall expenses limit. After the Bill becomes law,
if Clause 28 remains political parties will still be able to act in
this way, but third parties will not. What is the reason for that
discrimination against registered third parties? Apart from their being
prevented from operating in the same way as political parties, there is
the added concern that they will be obliged to return a note
of expenditure in each constituency during the regulated period of a
year before the election, if the expenditure exceeds £5,850. Why
was this figure given rather than £9,750, which is fixed for the
total period of

the reason for that, it is clear that the administrative burden on
third parties occasioned by this provision will be significant. When it
is taken along with the other restrictions imposed upon them
by the clauses that we have already debated, the impression is that we
are discriminating against third parties. There is a positive
disincentive to them to become engaged in the political process in the
crucial period immediately before an election. The public may well
consider that this clause is simply another illustration of their
belief that politicians consider that politics is for professional
politicians and that the general public will be discouraged as far as
possible from participating in politics. That is the wish of
politicians. Their only wish is that the public’s only
participation should be to cast their vote and otherwise to remain
silent. In the absence of sound reasons for imposing this additional
restriction solely on recognised third parties, I invite the Government

boundaries. However, political parties at least have a very good reason
to organise by constituency; campaigning organisations do not. They
campaign against wind farms, for a new zebra crossing, against payday
lenders, or in favour of badgers. As we know, badgers move, as does
HS2, which will run through 
<?notus-xml column=1309?>hills and dales, counties and boroughs. Such
campaigning does not fall into neat little constituency boundaries,

attracted considerable discussion, not to say controversy. The
fundamental point here, which was very well made by my noble friends
Lord Tyler and Lord Horam, is that it would be wrong if a third party
could choose to direct its entire national spending limit at only one
small part of the UK, thereby focusing the full force of the
considerable spending available to it on that very small part. It would
be disproportionate if that was one constituency. That point was

much was focused on one

experienced by those who have to act as election agents in allocating
and working out expenditure returns for those who are involved in it.
The noble Baroness wishes to intervene but I am just going to give an
example. In 1979, my noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood, then David
Steel, the leader of the Liberal Party, probably introduced the battle
bus to British politics. Immediately after that election in May 1979, I
was adopted as the Liberal European candidate for the south of
Scotland, which included the constituency of Roxburgh, Selkirk and
Peebles. I had as my election agent the agent for Roxburgh, Selkirk and
Peebles, who had been David Steel’s election agent in the
general election that immediately preceded it. He went by the wonderful
name of Riddle Dumble, and, as my election agent, he told me,
“I’ve got this nightmare of trying to do David’s
election expenses return; I have to sit down and allocate the amount of
time that his battle bus was in the constituency, and what part of it
represented constituency campaigning and what was part of the national

there might be some responsibilities that go with that, particularly
with the kind of substantial volume of money that we are talking about
being spent in one or a number of focused geographical
areas. No one is asking them to account for the work that they are
doing in trying to tackle mental health issues or alcohol problem
issues—that does not arise. They are caught by this only if the
amount that they are spending in one particular constituency or group
of constituencies is caught by these provisions, in which case there
might just be a responsibility that goes with that. The point that I am

mean that election materials—leaflets, mailshots, adverts and so
on that were specifically addressed to or delivered to households in a
constituency, and unsolicited telephone calls to
households—counted towards constituency limits. The main issue
that I have with this amendment is that there could be key activities,
such as rallies or events that were deliberately focused on an area,
which would not be regulated, and it would not restrict material from
otherwise being distributed or displayed. As I said, leaflets being
handed out in the middle of George Square in Glasgow are different from
leaflets being handed out in the marketplace of Thurso, for example, in
the Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross constituency, which could not
be said to be influencing any other constituency. However, I hear what

involve unmanageable compliance. Given the concerns that have been
expressed about compliance and regulatory burdens, that factor would
have to be borne in mind. It would increase the burden and would also
risk having the opposite effect to what was intended. A large third
party organisation with members and donors across the country may be

a disproportionate advantage, whereas a small organisation funded by

Sheikh (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased that this important
subject was called for debate today. The centenary of the First World
War is almost upon us. This war saw conflict and suffering on an
unprecedented 
<?notus-xml column=1315?>scale. The four war years serve as both a reminder and a commemoration
of the struggles and the sacrifice of so many people across the world.
I hope that time will encourage us all to honour and appreciate the

generations to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000073">In March
this year I spoke in a debate on the centenary of the war in
your Lordships’ House. I specifically focused on the
contribution of Indian forces then and I want to expand on those points

to be fully appreciated. I hope today’s debate will serve to
inform others and help address the
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000074">This
matter holds a special significance to me; I trace my family heritage

to Uganda in the 1920s. I feel a deep connection with the many stories
documented by Indian soldiers throughout the conflict. On the outbreak
of the First World War all opposition to the British Government ceased,
and the feelings of Indians at large were well summed up by the
Honourable Pandit Madan Mohan Malaviya, a former president of the
Indian National Congress. He assured the viceroy and the
governor-general

raised the world’s largest volunteer army, with a
total of 1.5 million people, during the First World War. Indians from
all over the world, from such remote countries as Australia and
Argentina, came forward to serve the Empire in its hour of need. More
than 1 million of these personnel were sent overseas and
140,000 were engaged in active service on the western front. This
marked the first time that Indian soldiers had ever fought on European
ground.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000076">They

seven Indian expeditionary forces provided crucial support and fought
directly alongside British Forces in Europe. For example, at the battle
of Neuve Chapelle they provided half the attacking force. A British
general described them as a magnificent body who performed the most
useful and valuable service. The expeditionary forces also saw action
in east Africa, Mesopotamia, Sinai, the Suez, Gallipoli and Palestine.
The Royal Indian Marine also served alongside the Royal Navy in a
number of functions. Some ships served as gunboats and others as
coastal minesweepers. Their merchant services in transport and supply
were also crucial to the war effort. More than 74,000 Indian troops
were killed or declared missing in action during the First World War, a
number that is testament to the level of sacrifice and loyalty shown by
the Indians in supporting the Allied Forces.</hs_para>

Indian subcontinent were recognised for their bravery and valour in
combat during the First World War with more than 9,200 decorations,
including 12 Victoria Cross medals. Sepoy Khudadad Khan was the first
native-born Indian to win the Victoria Cross for his gallantry in the
face of overwhelming numbers in Belgium. He served in the 129th Duke of
Connaught’s Own Baluchis regiment. Similarly, the courage of
Naik Darwan Singh Negi of the 1st Battalion of the 39th Garhwal Rifles
was recognised in 1914. He was one of the very few soldiers to have the
great honour of being personally presented with the Victoria Cross on
the battlefield in France by King George V. A notable example of the
spirit and pride of the Indian subcontinent soldiers is that of a
platoon of Sikhs, who in 1914 died fighting in Belgium to the last man,
who shot himself with his last cartridge rather than surrender to the
enemy. The soldier believed in the concept of chardi kala, which gave
him the strength to be courageous and not to
surrender.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000079">The
participation of the Indian subcontinent was not confined to the
battlefield alone. Doctors and students from the Indian Medical Service
provided care and rehabilitation to the wounded and many Indian
military hospitals were set up across the UK, perhaps the most famous
of which was the Royal Pavilion Hospital in Brighton. This housed more
than 600 wounded soldiers from the western front. As shocking as these
facts and figures are, we must also remember the personal and social
hardship that was felt by Indian citizens and families not directly
involved in the conflict. Much of the essence of the war is captured in
writings from the time, and India contributed in this respect, too. One
of the greatest poets during those years was an Indian called
Rabindranath Tagore. Tagore wrote in a letter on 18 November 1915 that
the war was
fought,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121859000431" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000431">“for

Indian soldiers who fell in different parts of the world. There are
indeed numerous similar memorials in existence across the world to
commemorate those soldiers who gave their lives during the First World

near Brighton. It is associated with 53 Hindu and Sikh soldiers whose
remains were cremated at that spot. A memorial service is held there
every year. There is also a Muslim burial ground on Horsell Common in
Woking, where 17 Indian soldiers were originally buried.
Further burials took place after the Second World War. Renovation works
are currently taking place there in preparation for next year’s
anniversary. In Neuve Chapelle in France, there is a memorial that has
been erected to honour the memory of the Indian soldiers who died
fighting in Europe. In addition, I know that some years ago the noble
Baroness, Lady Flather, led a successful campaign

Parekh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, next year we
commemorate the centenary of the First World War, which until 1939 used
to be called the Great War. The Government, the British Library and
various organisations have provided a syllabus of a wide range of
activities that should be undertaken, and adequate resources for this.
I welcome this, but have two
reservations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:53:28"></hs_TimeCode>.
First, I am not sure that those organisations are entirely clear about
what they are commemorating. Commemorating the war: what can that mean?
Do they mean our victory in the war or remembering those who
died? We need to be clear about what exactly we are
commemorating<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:53:49"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, how should we be commemorating? Are we proceeding along the
right
lines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:53:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121859000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000083">On the first question,
the war needs to be placed in a context. We need to ask how the war
started. How did it become a world war, so that it was not just an
ordinary war but had to be given a special name: the Great War or,
after 1939, the First World War? What were we doing in the war? How did
we use the war to break up the Ottoman Empire? How did the Germans
intervene in the war in order to urge the Ottomans to declare jihad
against Britain and France, while we in turn asked the Arabs to revolt
against the Ottoman Empire and change the geography of the Middle East,
as it is now? In short, we ought to understand the origins of the First
World War and draw important lessons. It was a horrendous war which
resulted in enormous tragedy and pain, as seen in the letters and
poetry that grew out of it.</hs_para>

could use the event to exorcise the fascination with war that has sadly
been an important part of our psyche. We have more statues devoted to
military generals and heroes than many other countries. It is about
time that we asked ourselves whether there are some elements of our
national psyche that need to be addressed more carefully than we have
done so
far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we need to commemorate the fact that the war was a collaborative
effort. We were able to survive, maintaining our liberties
and prosperity because of the enormous contribution of the Commonwealth
troops. Indians alone contributed substantially: 1,250,000 Indians were
involved, of whom about 72,000 died, 12,000 won medals and about 11 won
the Victoria Cross. We must also not forget that about 200
Army nurses died, of whom more than 50% were Indians. Many
of the Indian soldiers fought in a climate which was
not at all familiar to them, in the European theatres of
war. Many of them spent weeks in freezing, waterlogged
trenches<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

collaborative effort, in which others countries helped us, it is
important to highlight the fact that this is not peculiar to the First
World War. The situation was only slightly different in the
Napoleonic wars. You need only to walk down the Royal Gallery and see
the fresco on the right, which depicts Napoleon’s death. In that
picture, you see a black gentleman and an Arab, showing that even
during the Napoleonic wars, countries other than our own contributed.
Those are the two things that I would like to see
commemorated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:57:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Obviously, exhibitions, lectures and information packs for schools are
all important, but I suggest three things in particular as relevant to
commemorating the Indian contribution. First, the Indian community here
should be involved in the planning and execution of the various
projects, because the whole thing seems to be operating over
their heads. Secondly, we should commemorate in such a way that the
multi-ethnic character of Britain is highlighted and our people are
able to feel at ease with it. In those areas where large numbers of
ethnic minorities are concentrated, it might be useful to devote
greater attention than we have done to commemorating the Indian
contribution to the First World War so that Indian kids grow up knowing
that they were part of this country’s history long before they
arrived, and white kids grow up recognising that Indians are not simply
arrivals from after the Second World War but have also been making an
important
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:58:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

occasion to consolidate consciousness of the Commonwealth in our
schools and the Commonwealth as an international institution, because
the Commonwealth played an extremely important part. If we are lucky,
in emphasising the Indian contribution we might also be able to bring
the Indians, Pakistanis and Bangladeshis together and create, here in
Britain, the kind of harmony that should obtain, but sadly does not, in
the subcontinent
itself.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_18_PT_1/B34ED836F401EB1673EA721160D168C91E2A5EE1" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 December 2013">Wednesday,

<?notus-xml column=1319?>Passchendaele, the war poets, literature, plays and so on. However, the
role of the Indian Army in World War I is not as widely understood in

Indian Army played a critical role in France and Belgium in the early
days of the war because it plugged the line on the western front before
Kitchener’s army was ready to cross to Flanders and France. As
we have heard, it was the first time that troops from the Indian Army
had fought in Europe. The Indian Army also played a critical role in
Mesopotamia in the early months of the war. In 1914, it was the largest
volunteer army in the world and, during the course of the war, over
800,000 volunteered for the army and 400,000 for non-combatant roles.
Some 657,000 troops went to Mesopotamia; 144,000 to Egypt and
Palestine; 138,000 to France. Troops also went to East Africa and
Gallipoli, and there were of course people in the navy and merchant
navy. In autumn 1914, troops were moved from India to Mesopotamia to
secure the oilfields if Turkey came out in support of Germany. As I
mentioned, the move of troops to Europe at the end of September 1914
was to help hold the western front against the German invasion of
Belgium and France.</hs_para>

of those from the Indian subcontinent and all that they did? There are
two ways: places and people. On places, we have to have specific events
on the western front. First, the role of the Indian Army in the first
battle of Ypres in October 1914 was particularly important. In the
first attack, on 26 October, the Indian Army demonstrated huge bravery,
with over 200 soldiers killed. Secondly, its role at Neuve
-Chapelle, 25 miles south of Ypres, two days later on 28 October, when
the German troops had driven a gap in the British lines, was
marked. Its troops were engaged for six days in house-to-house fighting
in Neuve-Chapelle: 500 Indian Army officers and men were killed
and almost 1,500 wounded. On 23 November, when German troops
broke through at Festubert, near Ypres, Indian Army troops were ordered
to recover the line by dawn, which they did showing immense bravery. I
suggest there should be events at all three of those places,
on the relevant centenary dates, to mark their massive contribution in
those early days of fighting on the western front.</hs_para>

committed to Mesopotamia, which was largely an Indian Army campaign.
Despite eventual success, by October 1918 11,000 Indian Army troops
were killed, with 4,000 more dying from wounds and 12,500 from disease.
Some 51,000 were wounded, many of whom were shipped home in inadequate
hospital ships because they had to use ordinary troop ships. We should
also mark the disaster at Kut, in the spring of 1916, where 9,000
Indian Army soldiers were captured and marched northwards. They were
not treated as prisoners of war and 2,500 died on the march. We have
heard about the East Africa campaign and Gallipoli, where another 1,700
died in 1915.</hs_para>

have heard about the award of Victoria Crosses. There were nine on the
western front, eight in the first two years of the war and they were
won in Mesopotamia, Palestine and Egypt. Is there a case for
commemorating the award of those

pondering the enormous contribution made by so many individuals. Let us
not forget that people from the Indian sub-continent kept volunteering
throughout the war. We owe them a very great deal for the sacrifice of
so many so far from

Flather (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I also thank the noble Lord, Lord
Sheikh, for securing this debate. Part of me is sorry that there are
not more speakers, and part of me is very glad because it gives me a
few more minutes to speak. I hope this is not because of lack of
interest: perhaps holidays have started for most
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000097">This
is an important issue and is particularly so for me personally because
my father volunteered in the first war—I was going to say
“Great War”. Gandhiji said to Indian students that they
should volunteer but not fight to kill. So my father was a stretcher
bearer in Mesopotamia. Goodness knows what kind of a time he had there.
He would not speak about it, which tells us it was a pretty awful time
for him. All I know is that he lived on bully beef. I remember him
saying that and it was the first time I had heard the word.</hs_para>

studying in this country also volunteered because Gandhiji said so.
Gandhiji himself was an amazing man who had fought in the Boer
War—I know we are not talking about that war—and was at
the battle of Spion Kop. Spion Kop was a hill that some noble Lords
will know about. All the stretcher bearers at that battle were Indians
and Gandhiji held the rank of sergeant-major. It is good to remember
his contribution. As the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, said, he actually
canvassed people to join the British Army in the first and second wars
and said, “We have to save the Empire”. Even Mark Tully
got that
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000099">When I
was deputy mayor and then mayor of Windsor and Maidenhead, I laid the
first wreath on the war memorial. During my mayoralty, one of my fellow
councillors asked me if Remembrance Day meant anything to me. Noble
Lords might feel the same shock I did that an educated man, an elected
councillor, had no idea what the Indians had done in the two world
wars. This was so shocking to me I started to think about the memorial
mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh. It took me many years to get
people to agree to work for it and I am not sure anybody really
believed we would get a memorial in the end, but we have one. I note
what the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, said about the Indian community. I
have been very disappointed indeed by the interest it has
shown—or not shown—in the memorial. It is their memorial,
built not by the Government but by people giving money. However much I
have tried to get them interested in visiting, I have not been very
successful. Every year, we have a commemoration—a gathering not
a service—when we try to remember the people. 
<?notus-xml column=1321?>The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, asked, “What is war?”.

remind noble Lords that when the British Expeditionary Force went to
France the British standing army was very small and it lost. The first
group who came to support them were 150,000 members of the Indian
standing army. When they arrived in November they had no warm clothing.
It was not just that they were not used to the cold: the army had not
thought to provide them with the appropriate clothing. This has
happened in many wars. There was also a lot of racism, and
many problems with food. Nevertheless, our people were stalwart, and
stayed with the Army and fought—and in such a way that they
cannot be said to have been just cannon fodder. They were wonderful
people and had a very important role to play in both

during the First World

much to remember, and so much to hold firmly in our minds with
gratitude and veneration as the centenary of the outbreak of this
terrible conflict approaches. The part played by the Indian Armed
Forces and by all those who assisted it in its many tasks in three
continents, on which my noble friend Lord Shipley has elaborated,
should feature prominently in the period of commemoration that lies
ahead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:11:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000104">Speaking
as a historian, although I lack the eminence of the noble Lord,
Professor Lord Morgan, who is to follow me and who can correct all my
mistakes, I am particularly glad that the Imperial War
Museum—the world’s leading authority on conflict and its
impact, which as many noble Lords know is so conspicuously involved in
the work of commemoration—has incorporated within its plans full
recognition of India’s role as the biggest imperial contributor
to the war. The museum’s famous First World War galleries will
re-emerge next year, utterly transformed. One of the central objectives
is to ensure that a proper understanding of India’s contribution
and of the sacrifice made by its peoples is conveyed vividly and
powerfully to visitors. 
<?notus-xml column=1322?>Film, photography and representative items of warfare, which can stir
the imagination so strongly, will all be deployed effectively for that
purpose. Nor will the disappointment that was so widely felt in 1918
and thereafter be neglected. The final section of the renovated
galleries will make clear the widespread discontent aroused by
Britain’s decision to withhold from India the large measure of
self-government that was conferred elsewhere as dominion status
emerged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000105">I
very much hope that the Imperial War Museum’s plans will be
widely noted, as I am sure the Minister will agree. The plans need to
be reflected at all levels throughout the country to make commemorative
activity full and complete. That is particularly important where India
is concerned, since among British historians there was for too long a
tendency to underrate the contribution its peoples made. It was
suggested, for example, that the Indian Army Corps, dispatched to
France on the outbreak of war, failed to come up to expectations.
Nothing could be further from the truth, as the current generation of
my fellow historians has now properly acknowledged. Indian
troops—and they alone—made good Britain’s acute
shortfall in trained manpower in the first year of war on the western
front. As one senior British officer
emphasised,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121859000433" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000433">“they

should be added that that was at a great cost to themselves. By 1915
the Indian Army Corps had lost 50% of its original strength. Indian
troops taught the rest of the British Expeditionary Force the art of
patrolling in a form that would be suited to trench warfare on the
western front. Skills that had been learnt while skirmishing in the
Himalayas were adapted to a new purpose in the first night raids on the
western
front<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:14:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121859000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000106">We

hope that that might provide a measure of reassurance to the noble
Baroness, Lady Flather, who wondered about the treatment that had been

the moment we know rather less about what courageous Indian troops had
to say about the grave hardships which they faced in Mesopotamia, where
most of them served—some 650,000 altogether, as my noble friend
Lord Shipley mentioned. It was very much an Indian campaign from first
to last. In Britain today it is not remembered with the gratitude that
it deserves, or with sufficient consciousness of the sacrifices that
were made. My noble friend Lord Shipley referred to the siege of Kut in
early 1916, where Indian soldiers endured terrible privations. After
the inevitable surrender they were held captive by the Turks in
conditions so  
<?notus-xml column=1323?>appalling that more than half of them died. Next year’s

Morgan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this debate, admirably launched by
the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, is very welcome. It enables us to pay
proper tribute to the courage and sacrifice of the over 1 million
Indian troops who took part in the First World War, as well as enabling
us to test the Government’s resolve: how far will they subscribe
to what we heard from the Minister, that the commemoration of the war
would not be a celebration of militarism but would deal with matters
such as the role of women, trade unions and new currents in poetry, and
that in the case of Ireland it would focus not only on the Irish troops
who volunteered to fight in the war, but also on the fact that it led
to the Easter Rising and to the domination of Sinn

should be in India. As we have heard in a series of admirable speeches,
Indian troops fought in very large numbers on the western front and in
east Africa; enormous numbers fought in Mesopotamia and at the terrible
siege of Kut al-Amara. The names of Indian troops are recorded in
monuments in at Neuve Chapelle and on the Menin Gate. My own father

encouraged Indians to volunteer for the British Army. At the same time,
it is important to say how Gandhi shows how the war changed the
perceptions of so many public figures in India. He was not at first the
major nationalist in India—that was BG Tilak, who founded the
Home Rule League. By the end of the war, Gandhi was convinced that the
experiences of India in the war—the sacrifice of Indian
troops—had given a new sense of unity and identity to all
Indians; as we know, Gandhi worked a great deal with Muslims as well as
with Hindus. The war gave the movement for home
rule—swaraj—and Gandhi himself a new historical
significance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:19:12"></hs_TimeCode>.
Gandhi therefore illustrates what we should perhaps most fundamentally
commemorate about the First World War.</hs_para>

war encouraged movements in India to expand and to take up wider
horizons. At first, Gandhi himself focused on internal issues within
India—famously, the role of the untouchables, which he worked in
a dedicated fashion to cope with in his own community. But by the end
of the war he was adopting a much wider viewpoint, and challenging what
he saw as the harshness of British rule, and how far a war supposedly
fought to liberate subject nationalities was in fact reinforcing
British control over his country. 
<?notus-xml column=1324?>It is enormously important both for Gandhi and for the Indian
nationalist movement that the First World War within India encouraged
the famous non-violent strategies with which Gandhi is associated to
work against the grain of imperial policy and win support for Indian
nationalism outside India. Gandhi did this very conspicuously, if I may
say so, within the Labour

First World War should be commemorated above all because in India, and
thereby in a wider world, it was a period of historic change. The
legacy of the Indian troops fighting so gallantly, on the western front
and elsewhere, was not a stronger commitment of Indians to imperial
rule; it marked the beginning of the end for the Raj. It was followed
by the Rowlatt Bills against what was called terrorism, and by the
terrible massacre at Amritsar. General Dyer was sacked after Amritsar,
but Indians were appalled by the sympathy shown by many people in this
country for his conduct. It is deeply to the discredit to the House of

there was no conscription: every man was a volunteer. Some regiments
were strictly of one warrior, martial tribe; others were mixed. There
were about 14 or 15 Punjab regiments, and in those there were Sikhs,
Muslims, Hindus and Christians, completely integrated. There is a
lesson there, you know, for the good people of Bradford and elsewhere
in our nation. Of course they lived, not separately, but alongside each
other, because they all ate different types of food,

battalion we had only about a dozen, because underneath those 12 or so
officers the Viceroy commissioned officer was also an officer: he had

officer was not accepted in the Indian Army unless he passed very high
up out of Sandhurst. My father was the Indian Army instructor at the
Staff College next door to Sandhurst, and I remember all those hopefuls
coming to him to be looked at to see whether they were up to the very
high standard of British Army officer required. He took some, and I

to say two things. It seems to me that the legacy of the Empire and
Commonwealth soldiers, like so many aspects of the First World War,

the tale of the Empire and Commonwealth soldiers is a contested,
complex story—a human story of valour and tragedy, of victory
and futility, of respect and racism, and of forgetting and
re-remembering. What cannot be doubted is that these events and
encounters provide an important foundation stone for an understanding

Bill Office, whose staff have been extraordinarily helpful on this
occasion, as on so many others. In order to run through my amendments
and to make sure that I understood the Bill properly and what I was
putting forward, I asked about this clause, and what it really meant. I
said to them, you are all highly trained lawyers; you will be able to
tell me what it is all about. They said that they deliberately do not
have lawyers in the Public Bill Office because it is very important for
people to understand legislation, and that is why they are lay people
and not lawyers. I said, “That’s very
good—I’ll leave this with you for a day, and perhaps you
can tell me what all of this is about”. I went back the next day
and they said that they were very sorry but they did not think they
would be able to help me with this one. I then contacted the lawyer who
specialises in electoral law who has been advising the commission,

that is written in the living language of gobbledegook, although that
is living only in parts of Whitehall. I, too, was completely puzzled by
it. I obtained the Explanatory Notes, read them with care, and was none
the wiser at the end of it. This, I hope, will also be included in the
undertaking that the Minister gave when he said that he felt an
obligation to look at those parts of the Bill that are
incomprehensible. This certainly needs translating; it has been written
by lawyers for lawyers—of a specialist sort—yet not for

Advocate-General for Scotland (Lord Wallace of Tankerness)

of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 do not
prevent political parties benefiting from expenditure by third parties
in a way that would enable the political parties to avoid party
spending limits. Although measures exist to regulate political party
spending, third-party spending and the notional campaign expenditure of
political parties—that is, spending by third parties for or on
behalf of a political party—those measures are not necessarily
effective in ensuring that all spending for the benefit of a political
party is properly captured. Our concern, which influences or informs
this clause, is that that risks undermining trust in the controls on
party
spending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000140">Clause

that manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>. I
heard and will certainly reflect on what the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries, of Pentregarth, said—that this might somehow
be something that innocent people or groups can stumble into, but I
rather think that the political reality on the ground is that if a
particular group is, to all intents and purposes, supporting the
Liberal Democrats—I am being neutral about this—it will
not do so innocently or without any notion that that is what it is
doing.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121859000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000141">Under
proposed new Section 94B(3), authorisation would be required only in
instances where the third party wishes to incur expenditure that
exceeds 10% of its spending limit for a part of the UK. This would be
treated as “targeted controlled expenditure”, and the
Bill defines it as more than 0.2% of the maximum campaign expenditure
limit for political parties in that part of the United Kingdom. That
limit would be £31,980 in England, £3,540 in Scotland,
£2,400 in Wales and £1,080 in Northern Ireland. If a
political party does not want the third party to spend more than 10% of
its spending limit in support of it, or for that expenditure to count
towards its limit, it can simply withhold authorisation. A third party
will commit an offence if it either exceeds the targeted expenditure
limit without authorisation or exceeds an authorised cap set by a
political party. In other words, if such a group comes to the Liberal
Democrats, in the highly unlikely event that the Liberal Democrat
treasurer says, “Sorry, we are not going to accept your offer of
going beyond the 10% limit and we are not giving you
authorisation”, it would be an offence if the group then spent
money in obvious support of the Liberal Democrats beyond the
10%.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121859000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000142">The
intention of this clause is to bring a greater degree of transparency
where third parties campaign to support a particular political party or
its candidates. Requiring expenditure incurred as part of that
campaigning to count towards the spending limits of both the third
party and the political party, and for this information then to be
disclosed to the public, will prevent political parties evading their
spending limits by relying on co-ordinated support from campaigning 
<?notus-xml column=1331?>groups. Clause 29 will not prevent third parties campaigning up to a
significant limit without needing any kind of authorisation from a
political party. Nor will it curtail third-party expenditure that
cannot reasonably be regarded as intended to benefit a particular
party—for example, because that expenditure supports multiple

concern. Indeed, they have caused great confusion 
<?notus-xml column=1332?>and, more than anything else, given rise to the alleged chilling effect
among smaller organisations. I checked with the Electoral Commission
earlier this week about what exactly is meant by the present rules.
Suppose organisation A contributes £15,000 to a combined
operation, which acts in concert in some form of policy coalition. Then
organisation B contributes £375,000 to that same campaign.
Therefore, under the present rules, A and B have to record
£390,000 as having been spent. However, vitally, organisation A,
which has spent only £15,000, is recorded as having spent right
up to the total of £390,000. That creates an extremely difficult
situation for small organisations. Just by being caught up by some
joint operation, they get clobbered because they might very well want
to take on some different campaign activity that is nothing to do with
that original campaign, and then find that they have already exceeded
the limit. That is the nature of the present law, and that is the
nature of the present problem that so many organisations have drawn to
our attention.</hs_para>

referred to in the 2000 Act. We are effectively saying that the money
spent on that plan should be capped—it should not then be
carried forward for any other campaign of a different nature—or
that that money spent by a different organisation should be capped. If,
in my example, organisation A was spending only £15,000, that
would be the limit of the restraint on it because it clearly would not
be contributing a huge sum. Just because organisation B has spent a
considerable sum in pursuance of the common plan, it should not be

Bill is our opportunity to deal with it, remove that

a real constraint on what they are permitted to do. I should say
briefly that, on these Benches, we strongly refute the case
for Amendment 182A, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of
Blaisdon, which would seek to take away all the coalition rules. It
would mean no constraint whatever on organisations, allowing them
simply and artificially to multiply and then provide multiple spending
limits. I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, is not here to
explain exactly the rationale for those original 2000 PPERA rules,

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish
to speak to Amendment 170M. First of all, the charities and
campaigning groups have indicated very strongly that what the present
Bill puts forward on coalition working is totally unacceptable. All
charities are encouraged by the Charity Commission and by their own
trustees to work together in coalitions. We have seen many very
successful examples of coalition working, but under the law as it is
put forward in Part 2 of the Bill, the total amount of money spent by
the coalition is attributed to each single member of the coalition.
This must be, by any standard, totally unfair. We have racked our
brains for the past six weeks and do not feel that we have come up with
any solution to the fundamental problem. Therefore, in the first week
after we come back, we will be calling a round table conference to
which the Minister has agreed to come and various other people will be
invited, to see whether, together, we can crack this fundamental
problem of coalition working and how it can be fairly regulated. I am
sure that the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, to which I put
my name in a private capacity, will be very much on the table to be
considered at that point.</hs_para>

mentioned, our Amendment 170M will go some way towards solving the
problem for smaller groups. In that amendment, we mark the
difference between a minor third party and a nominated third
party. A minor third party is one that has not yet reached the
registration threshold. If it is working in coalition with
other parties, on the basis of my amendment it will be able to nominate
another party, called the nominated third party. With the agreement of
both the third party and the nominated third
party, the money that the minor third party spends on that
campaign will be attributed to the nominated third party as part of its
overall expenditure and the minor third party will simply be able to
indicate to the Electoral Commission that it is below the threshold and
has, as it were, contributed this amount of money towards the nominated
third party, which is very likely to be
regulated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:59:38"></hs_TimeCode>. We
believe that this is quite a neat way of ensuring that smaller
parties—those which do not hit the registration threshold and
certainly are very anxious to work in coalition —will not be
brought within the scope of regulated
expenditure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Electoral Commission, in examining this amendment, remarked that it is

issue of coalition working is one of the key areas about
which charities and campaigning groups are concerned. I will not go
through any of the examples set out at the end of our report, but I
would draw the attention of noble Lords to the Human Rights
Consortium in Northern Ireland, which has been referred to at least
once in this debate already, where something like 180 NGOs work
together on a crucial issue. That gives some indication of why getting
coalition working right is absolutely fundamental to the charity sector

Tyler of Enfield (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I add my support for
Amendment 170H, to which my name is attached. As my noble friend Lord
Tyler has already explained, the amendment seeks to apply the limit of
£390,000 to any one registered third party or to any one
coalition campaign, but not to limit the spending of one body by virtue
of the spending of another. That is a key

issue, it became clear that, under the existing 2000 legislation, if a
number of organisations campaign together on one issue, each member has
to account for the full amount spent on that joint campaign, regardless
of their individual contributions, however large or small. As I
understand it, this aggregated reporting of coalition spending was put
in place at the time as a form of anti-avoidance mechanism for these
rules. My concerns are based on my own experience of working in
coalitions of charities, and focus on the impact that this can have on
collaborative working across the voluntary sector. I am particularly
concerned about the impact on small and medium-sized charities and
other organisations. In the year before an election, small
organisations are quite unlikely to join coalitions for fear of having
to deal with the related administrative burdens, while larger
organisations are likely to walk away from such coalitions in order to
avoid reaching the maximum expenditure

they will have to deal with two regulators. I know very well that the
Charity Commission encourages coalition working in order to achieve the
efficient use of resources—and, frankly, because when smaller

was all about the impact that very high-conflict separation of parents

affected by this legislation unless these amendments are taken on

able to campaign effectively, often over a long period of time, to get
their point across. I think, for example, of the Mental Health
Alliance, which has existed for nearly 10 years. The lead organisations
in any alliance or collaboration need to have clarity that they
themselves will not be penalised by excessive regulation if their
campaign happens to straddle election periods. They also need to be

unless an amendment of the type that we are talking about is taken

Mallalieu:</Member></B> My Lords, my name is on Amendment 170M. This
issue creates a number of problems, some of which have been mentioned
and some of which have not. One concern is that it gives a completely
misleading impression of what each partner in a coalition has spent,
because it has to include everybody else’s contribution with its
own. This does not give the impression of transparency—if that
is what we are trying to achieve—but just the opposite. It gives
the public a picture of smaller organisations, and the campaign as a

also of course reduces the amount that can be spent by those groups on

Pitkeathley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there is little wonder that
there is so much concern in the charitable and voluntary sectors about
the idea of collaborative working being detrimentally affected by the
Bill. That is because collaborative working coalitions are the most
effective way of campaigning and bringing about policy change. They
bring together large and small organisations, single issue and multiple
issue organisations, service providers and self-help organisations, and
charities and other types of organisation. As well as enabling a
powerful voice, collaborative working moderates the kinds of demand
that are made and makes them more realistic. You have to achieve some
kind of consensus, if, for example, you are putting together a
manifesto, as many coalitions do in the run-up to an election. This may
mean moderating the demands of the more extreme and pushing along the
demands of the more cautious. These coalitions are very effective and
this is why it is important that we get this right.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> issue

about encouraging charities to work together. Let us look at the
example of slavery, which is in the minds of the Conservatives at the

from the voluntary sector and the Liberal party and not the
Conservatives. Why is that? It is because the ecumenical coalition
against trafficking and Anti-Slavery International came up with
legislation. They have been working on this subject for 20 years, not
five or 10 years, and the Prime Minister has embraced it at the

by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, is a really powerful one and it adds
to the criticisms, which I endorse, of the catch-all provisions that
have been added to the existing rules, which worked in the past but
have become unworkable because of the increased range of activities,
the addition of staff, travel and other costs, the reduction of
thresholds, and the cut in the spending cap. This is what makes what

we are left with a situation in which restrictions on coalition

reporting—seem aimed at anti-avoidance only in the belief that
10 groups will get together and campaign and they will all spend

Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, which supports our

because they will

campaigning, especially locally. For example, the RSPB works locally
with other groups on infrastructure projects that affect the natural
environment, such as an M4 relief road, when public reports or press
events may be used. This may well be caught because one party may be in
favour of a road and another party against it. Even if that is not the
purpose of its work, the RSPB risks being caught if its particular
objective chimes with—or is at variance with—one party,
even though the RSPB’s objectives are based on the interests of
birds rather than politics. It is particularly worried about how its
spending would count against every member of the coalition’s
spend and each member’s £9,750 limit would in a sense be
double- or treble-counted if each group had to declare it as if it was
its own. As the RSPB says, the combined effect of all the different
rules is likely to limit what it can
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000176">The Board

Campaign, which is made up of Sense About Science, English PEN and the

is spending more than the registration threshold, it may then be

responsibility for some of the spending of a smaller organisation. The
problem is that a smaller organisation may have decided to spend only
£1,000 on something over a year, but then something
happens—it gets another member of staff, or the car
breaks down and it has to hire a bus—and its expenditure
suddenly goes up over that year. It will be the bigger organisation,
the responsible body, which will suddenly have to answer for a
new range of expenditure that has not been agreed in

promising us its ideas by Report. This highlights the fact that not
only was this not subject to pre-legislative scrutiny but the

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, from almost every meeting
I took part in with charities or representatives of NGOs, I was
certainly aware that the issue of what we described as coalition or
co-ordinated planning was of considerable importance to them. That
said, it is worth reflecting that the Bill does not actually make any
changes, apart from the technical changes to take into account the
other activities. The basic architecture on expenditure by
organisations going towards a coalition plan was set down in
the 2000 Act. I am not quite sure whether there
was pre-legislative scrutiny before that particular architecture fell
into place. However, it is not the case that the law was put forward in
Part 2, as was said by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries.
That law is already there in
PPERA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000182">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:24:26"></hs_TimeCode>
has happened has perhaps been fortuitous. The Bill has brought activity
and greater focus, which have targeted minds on what is actually there.
I accept that there is more activity now, as I am sure would be said by
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter. Yet in fact, as the law stands at the
moment, if 10 groups each contribute £1,000 to the activities or
to the election materials covered under the present Act, they would
each be required to register. This is therefore an important issue. The
noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, made this point about the concern of smaller
organisations in a number of his contributions. I say to the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that we should remember to put this in the
context of what the controlled expenditure is. If we are talking about
the valuable and important work that is done in our prisons in terms of
rehabilitation, it does not readily strike me how that would be the
kind of expenditure envisaged, albeit that the groups concerned might
be engaged with other bodies which fall within the ambit of the Bill
and of what would lead to controlled expenditure. However, it is
important that we recognise that this issue has now been identified,

expenditure they incur as part of that coalition must count against
each third party’s individual spending limit. As my noble friend
Lady Tyler pointed out, that is a key anti-avoidance provision. If
total spending by a group of third parties acting as part of a common

parties accounting for aggregated coalition expenditure. Nevertheless,

commission. I think that the commission should be taken to task for not
identifying that this was a problem over 13 years of experience. It is
unfortunate that in that respect it did not recommend to the previous
Government and to Parliament that this needed to be looked at, whatever
future legislation was going to try and tackle it.</hs_para>

Both amendments introduce new clauses into the Bill. Amendment 170J
introduces a requirement on the Electoral Commission to publish
guidelines for the assistance of third parties to ensure that they
comply with the provisions of the Bill, when it is enacted. I
understand that it would be normal for the
commission to provide such guidance, but subsection (1) of
the proposed new clause requires publication to

many pieces of legislation where one might be able to prepare
guidelines in anticipation of enactment, the Bill has a number of
issues of uncertainty. There remains a considerable amount of
uncertainty about the final provisions of the Bill in view of the
extent of the opposition to different clauses and the commitment by the
Government—which is welcome—to come back on Report with
amendments. The Government’s response to the report from the
Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement is also awaited.
Until all of that is known it would not be sensible to embark on
preparing guidelines because one might ultimately be dealing with
different provisions. It would be a waste of resources to commence work
until the picture was much

proposed new clause thereafter allows a period of three months after
the publication of the guidance to enable recognised third parties to
put in place procedures necessary to ensure that they comply with the
Act’s provisions. It is clear from the discussion in Committee
that there will undoubtedly be a bureaucratic burden on third parties.
Once the guidelines are known, the procedures might well
involve the recruitment and training of staff. It will
certainly involve administrative procedures, including measures for
recording and monitoring expenditure on a constituency basis—if
the constituency provisions come in—and it will
involve procedures for making returns, including weekly ones, as
mentioned by my noble and right reverend friend Lord Harries of
Pentregarth.</hs_para>

recognise that by furthering this approach, one might well be
encroaching into the year before the election. Subsections (3) and (4)
of the proposed new clause are my attempt to address that difficulty.
They provide, in that eventuality, for the regulated period to be
reduced below the 365 days before the next election. Their effect is to
reduce the period and to reduce the maximum amount of allowable

proposed new clause are fair and reasonable. They will not prevent the
Bill, when enacted, having effect prior to the next election, if that
is the will of Parliament. However, I recognise, having regard to other
possible approaches, that the new clause will be unnecessary if the
relevant period is reduced to, say, six months, which other noble Lords
suggested. However, it is lodged in anticipation that the period will
remain at one

clause is in Amendment 170K. It would ensure that the
Government recognise—as I am sure that they do—the
significant additional burden that the Bill would impose upon the
Electoral Commission. This is reflected in the various new provisions,
requiring guidance, monitoring and enforcement, particularly if the
commission has to monitor and enforce contemporaneously the provisions
on constituency expenditure. I referred to my concerns about that when
opposing the Question that Clause 28 should stand part of the Bill, and
I do not intend to repeat them here.</hs_para>

concerns, I anticipate that if we are in the realms of monitoring
constituency expenditure and taking contemporaneous action, and
stopping campaign groups or whatever from doing particular things in
the course of an election, there will be a great increase in the work
of the courts in the form of judicial review. Some campaign groups will
just not accept the decision of the commission and will challenge its
action. Has provision been made for that eventuality by the Government

will be an added burden on the commission’s resources due to the
time constraints occasioned by the history of the Bill. Many noble
Lords expressed concern about this at Second Reading. Again, it is
unnecessary to repeat those concerns today. Suffice it to say that the
limited consultation and the short period of time available before the
general election, coupled with the 365-day relevant period, combine to
impose additional pressures on the commission’s staff to produce
guidelines that will be effective within a very short
timescale.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121859000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0002.htm#13121859000207">Of

pleasure to follow the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie. Amendment
175 picks up the early part of Amendment 170J and seeks, as a probing
amendment, to require the production of joint guidance between the
Electoral Commission and the Charity Commission. During all the debates
on Part 2 of the Bill, the underlying theme has been the practical
implications for individual charities, especially smaller ones, many of
which—as has been pointed out on several occasions—were
not yet aware of their responsibilities. As the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips, pointed out on Monday, the overwhelming proportion are run by
people of the utmost integrity. The challenge is how to do this so they
can discharge their responsibilities at minimum commensurate cost and

other is on non-party campaigners. That runs to another 15 or 20 pages,

tests: the purpose test and the publicity test. These form no part at
all of the CC9 guidance and the overall impression is of two ships

ensure the best possible guidance so that the voluntary and charitable
sectors understand their new obligations and do not unintentionally
fall foul of the law. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, I
think that small charities and voluntary organisations that do not
employ lawyers as a matter of course could well find themselves
unintentionally in breach of the law. As in so many things we do in

simple and straightforward amendment. It would reduce the regulatory
period from the current one year to six months. There are two reasons
for the amendment. The first is that a year is a very long time for
charities to be burdened with the regulation of electoral law. In the
debates today and on Monday, we have begun to see exactly how
burdensome that could be. It would be a huge relief to charities if
they could focus on what is required of them for election purposes only
in the last six months leading up to the
election<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:03:57"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Tyler (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the argument
does appear to be very simple. I wish it was so. I will
illustrate the complexity that could be caused by one or other of these
amendments. Amendment 170L would create a fourth regulatory period in
electoral law; there are already three. One would be of 12 months for
both non-party and national political party expenditure. One would be
of four months for candidates’ long campaign, introduced for the
2010 election by the PPE Act 2009. There would then be the traditional
four to six-month period post-Dissolution of the so-called
“short campaign”, which was imposed by the Representation
of the People Act 1983 but which originated from the Corrupt and
Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883. So there is a little more
complexity than both of the noble Lords who have already spoken
suggested.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000243">As
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, indicated, there are
of course implications for a number of other parts of the Bill. If
either of these amendments were to be passed, they would have an impact
on spending caps. It would surely be very odd if his
commission’s recommendations for the higher spending
limits—that is, £1.25 million in England—applied
over half the regulated period. This would make the proposed new limit
equivalent to £2.5 million if it had been over 12
months. There could then be an argument for no constituency limits.
This could mean an unlimited sum being spent in constituencies up to
four or six months before an election. I do not accept the argument
that nobody is interested in what is spent in the longer period leading
up to an election. It can be very influential, as those of us who have
fought elections know. After that period, a further £1.125
million could be spent in one constituency—a target
constituency, a marginal seat or a small number of
constituencies—which would 
<?notus-xml column=1352?>vastly outspend the candidates themselves. The
argument is very seductive. The two noble Lords who have spoken are
regularly seductive in this House and speak with the tongues of angels,
but I have to say that this particular case is not as simple as they
suggest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Deben (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am hoping to be seduced. There is
a kernel to this that is more important than the detailed argument we
have just heard. The kernel is that it might be more sensible to have a
shorter period in which this whole thing operates. If I may say so to
my noble friend, it is not a sensible argument to say,
“It’s awfully inconvenient to do this because all sorts
of other things might have to be reorganised”. I hope that the
Minister will take seriously the following argument. We now have a
system whereby we know when the next election and the election after
that will be. If you think about it in those terms, you realise that no
one is going get anything much under way at this point just before
Christmas. The real period will in any case be that from 1 January
onwards. That is what is going to

that there is so much unhappiness about this bit of the Bill and that
so many people are concerned—I have checked my Twitter feed and
seen how many people remain unconvinced by what the Government and the
Minister are saying—it might be sensible to think about making a
clear change, and saying to people, “Look, we have listened and
we can see that there is still a concern about the weight upon
organisations, and therefore we will at least think about the
possibility of integrating into the Bill a shorter period”. That
would of course mean that my noble friend’s concerns would have
to be looked at. After all, this is the Committee stage. One of the
things that you do in Committee is raise matters that do not actually

afraid, because they brought the Bill in so late. We must remember that
the Bill was

Summer Recess, had its Second Reading on the day the Commons returned,

the point of view of the organisations, how on earth are those that are

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, has proposed an amendment
that would reduce the length of the regulated period for third parties
from 365 days to six months. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has
tabled a similar amendment, reducing the regulated period to four
months under the banner of “keep it simple”, although as
my noble friend Lord Tyler has illustrated, it is perhaps not quite as
simple as it might appear on the
surface<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:15:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000254">I
am aware from the engagement in meetings that this is an issue that has
come up on a number of occasions and not least because, for the first
time, some bodies that might have been getting pretty close to being
regulated in 2010 but did not realise it have now realised that there
is something that they will have to address. I will explain by way of
background the different regulated periods that operate for different
elections. The regulated period for UK general elections is 365 days
and for devolved Administration elections and European parliamentary
elections it is four months. The reason why we have put these in is
that we believe that it is not unreasonable that third parties and
political parties should adhere to the same regulated period for an
election. This is because the campaigns relate to the same election. I
am sure, if one thinks about it for a moment, that it would be somewhat
unusual and unfair if third parties were allowed to incur unlimited
amounts of expenditure campaigning 
<?notus-xml column=1354?>for or against a party or candidates in a period
when the political parties themselves would be faced with a
limit on their spending. That is the principle that underlies why we
wish to keep the periods in

we have discussed earlier, particularly on whether the clause would
stand part—when we talked about expenditure by a third party,
which is ostensibly and is indeed intended to support a registered
political party—there could be a scenario where a short
third-party regulated period really detracted from the rules on the
political parties, as political parties could use these third parties
as expenditure vehicles for a considerable period of either six months
or eight months. I do not believe that this is the sort of situation
that we want to end up with. That said, believing that it would be
possible to have the relevant guidance in time before the regulated
period starts for the 2015 election, I recognise that there are issues;
my noble friend Lord Deben highlighted some of them that relate to the
first election under this. Of course there will be a review, which we
will come on to but the Government have already indicated that there
will be a review post-2015. I hear the points made that there are still
concerns with regard to the immediate prospect facing a number of
organisations. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, made reference to that

spirit of consideration but not promise, because the principle involved
here is to keep the times so that they march together. Not doing so

disregard that principle and I invite the noble and right reverend

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I am happy to explain
that. The very nature of the expenditure that will fall to be covered
by Part 2 will be expenditure that is very much geared towards an
election, the same election in which the political parties will be
fighting. It would seem rather odd if the political parties themselves
are restricted in what they can spend over a period of one year. If,
for example, we were to accept the amendment spoken to by the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for eight months of that year other third-party
bodies, some of whom would be endorsing quite unashamedly the policies
and perhaps the candidates of one of the political parties, would be
able to spend freely without any restriction at all while the political
parties themselves are campaigning with restrictions. That is why I
make the comparison because it would create a sense of unfairness and
imbalance if those who are actually fighting an election, those whose
heads are on the block on polling day, as it were, were under
restrictions but third parties did not have any such restrictions for a
substantial part of that

reporting requirements, and I shall speak also about the two clauses
included in the grouping. I think that the Government are sympathetic
to the idea that the regulatory burden, particularly on charities,
should be reduced if at all possible. The Electoral Commission has
noted that the current provision in the Bill appears to be onerous as
far as reporting procedures are concerned. At the moment, charities and
campaigning groups have to report every month, and every week during
the post-Dissolution period. Amendment 170N provides that those
organisations which register because they think that they will be above
the registration threshold, but do not in fact go above it, will simply
have to report that they have not spent above the limit. They would not
have to submit detailed accounts, they would just note the fact that
they had not spent above the limit. It is a simple way in which the
regulatory burden on them could be

situation becomes rather more pressing during an election campaign,
where a single report of a donation may require a series of weekly nil

to all charities and all non-party campaigners under the new regime. I

superfluous—indeed, they may be worse than superfluous, in that
a blizzard of nil returns may distract the Electoral Commission from
its regulatory role. Amendment 178 seeks to achieve a position where,

174 takes us back to the challenge from a couple of groups
ago about the reporting of coalition working, where groups and
charities collaborate to work on a particular issue. I referred a

earlier debate, every member of a coalition has to report the record of
all the members, even of expenditure for which they have no
responsibility. That of course is immensely time-consuming and
duplicative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000264">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:29:25"></hs_TimeCode>
will give the Committee a quick example. A group of charities may wish
to raise the issue, say, of the export of live animals. They establish
an agreement and a budget of £200,000. One large charity puts up
£150,000 and five smaller charities put up £10,000
each—all are therefore above the reporting requirement. The
consequence is quarterly reporting, and weekly reporting during the
general election, for all six organisations, which have to make the
return to the Electoral Commission. This surely cannot be a sensible
use of resources for any of the parties involved, not least the
Electoral Commission

174 would permit a coalition of charities to nominate a lead charity,
which will make the return on behalf of the group. My noble and learned
friend may fear a loophole being created. Indeed, in his
remarks when we were discussing coalition working an hour
ago, he hinted at this particular concern and fear. However, I am not
sure that he needs to be concerned, because the lead charity will have
to take the responsibility —and all that implies under electoral
law—for all the activities of all the members of the syndicate.
It is unlikely to take on the leadership role unless it is
satisfied that its fellow coalition members will behave properly and
legally. Amendments 173 and 174 are supported by the NCVO and have the
support, in principle, of the Electoral Commission. They are of course
also in tune with the Government’s general deregulatory approach
and policy. I hope the Government will study the amendments, which are
in a purely probing form at the moment, and perhaps come back with some
reaction on

examples in the Bill where the Government have suddenly decided that
they will do precisely the things that they said they will not do, for
very much better purposes, in a whole lot of other areas.
For example, we could do with a lot more regulation on environmental
matters to get things going, but every time one raises that, one is
told, “We don’t want more regulation”. However, in
this particular area, regulation appears to be not only implicit, and
explicit, but continuous and extensive.</hs_para>

about coalitions of organisations working and campaigning together. As
my noble and learned friend the Minister said when summing up that
debate, it is important to get the balance right between not creating
loopholes in the rules, or rules that can turn into avoidance measures
and things like that. But we must balance that with not just allowing
but recognising in many cases that it is a good thing for small and
medium-sized charities, in particular, to work together in
their important campaigning. That should not be made overly burdensome
or difficult for them. The amendment proposed by my noble friend Lord

the society vulnerable to possible criminal sanctions for any
campaigning it does on issues which arguably have a political
dimension. Without the ability to register, the Law Society may have to
cease such activity to avoid such sanctions.</hs_para>

freedom of expression, combined with Article 14, which covers
discrimination.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:44:36"></hs_TimeCode> these bodies
do not have the options available to other bodies to come under the

now, the Law Society has been able to live with the low level of
uncertainty as to its precise legal position. Two developments have
altered this. The first is the provisions and implications of the Bill
we are discussing today. The Electoral Commission noted in its briefing
of 22 October 2013
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121859000424" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000424">“The
combination of lower registration thresholds and spending limits, new
constituency limits, and the wider scope of regulated activity, is
likely to create a much higher level of allegations of breaches of the
rules by non-party campaigners than at previous
elections”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13121859000379" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000379">Further,
the detailed guidance on the width of controlled expenditure given by
the Electoral Commission at a 22 October briefing is new.
Whether it is right or wrong, it represents the regulatory enforcement
approach it proposes to take. The second issue is developments in
public policy—for example, the already referred to European
Convention on Human Rights—which have an increasingly political
dimension. They bring organisations such as the Law Society, which
represents a substantial body of membership, increasingly close to the
complex line between policy research and campaigning.</hs_parafo>

as it was with the earlier clauses. The regulatory burden under this

campaigning groups. The great list under subsection (3) includes
company directors, friendly societies, building societies and so on. At
the very least, someone will have to give some very clear
guidance—I presume that it will be the Electoral

clear, but a whole range of campaigning groups to which it may not be
clear who is the governing body or the accountable body among them.

further positive news. The Government acknowledge that, as 13 years
have now passed since PPERA was enacted, there may be other bodies
which should now be added to the list. My noble friend mentioned a
number of bodies, including the Law Society. Organisations incorporated
by royal charter are among them. The Government would like to consider
what other bodies should be added to the list of bodies which can
register with the Electoral Commission. The Government are committed to

entirely agree with the noble and right reverend Lord that it is
important in all that we do that we do not overburden organisations, be
they small or indeed large. Looking through the list, it is my
understanding that for companies the relevant participators would be
the company directors; for trade unions, it would be the trade union
officers; for building societies, it would 
<?notus-xml column=1363?>be the directors; for limited liability
partnerships, it would effectively be the partners; for friendly
societies, it would be the management committee; and for unincorporated
associations, it would be members or, if there are more than 15 of
them, the officers of the association. It is certainly not intended to
be an extensive list, but it is important to ensure that the activities
of third parties are transparent. We think that the change will assist
that, but, clearly, we do not want to burden people. Being a director
of a company myself and a partner, I know that one has always to put
down the names of the directors of the company or the partners, but,
certainly, one does not want in any way to make this a difficulty for
charities and non-party organisations. That is why these details are
included in Clause 31. I hope that, in these circumstances and with
that positive news, my noble friend will feel encouraged to withdraw
his amendment.</hs_para>

controversy over the funding of political parties. It would incentivise

few large donors and organisations stand accused of exercising undue
influence over the democratic process. We all know that while that may
be the case on occasion, more often than not it is not the case, but

has it not happened before? Why has my simple proposal not been
considered and implemented in law? To examine the reason for that we
have to go in the history of what has been a very difficult debate.
Over the past century there were repeated scandals involving political
donations. By 2000 the debate had become sufficiently heated to provoke
the Government 
<?notus-xml column=1365?>into introducing legislation in the form of the Political Parties,
Elections and Referendums Act, which has been referred to repeatedly
during proceedings on this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
that Act dealt with only part of the problem. Deficiencies in the
legislation surfaced around the 2005 general election when a series of
arguments broke out over the use of loans—or what were described
as loans—as a means of funding political campaigns. As a result,
the parties were driven into all-party discussions on reforms which,
predictably, broke down. That breakdown and the inevitable stalemate
that followed led to the 2007 review undertaken by Sir
Hayden Phillips. It was hoped that this review would lead us out of the
impasse but its report indicated only the nature of the problem and did
not provide a solution. However, the review paved the way for further
talks between the three main political parties, under Sir Hayden
Phillips himself. Again, the inevitable happened as the talks broke
down in October 2007. In May 2010, after aborted discussions and a
general election, a reference to the problem surfaced in the coalition
agreement:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121912000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121912000023">“We

coalition agreement was followed in July 2010 by the Committee on
Standards in Public Life, which re-energised the debate with its 2011
report. The report was accompanied by caveats in the appendices from
both Labour and Conservative party representatives. We were back on the
old merry-go-round with caps on contributions, trade union donations
and the usual differences and suspicions—what appeared to be
irresolvable problems. Two months later the Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee called for heads to be banged together
and a solution found to this intractable problem, which is so damaging
the political class. The committee, despairingly, called for a
resolution of the problem to help avoid further party
funding scandals. Not that that plea had much of an effect.
Within two months we had a further scandal, with the Cruddas affair: an
allegation that led to a libel action against the <I>Sunday Times</I>,

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, I was delighted to be able to put my name
to this amendment, which indeed has cross-party support. It would be
fair to say that the four Members of your Lordships’ House who
have put their names to the amendment have all had extensive
experience, long commitment and real concern about the maintenance of
our parliamentary democracy and its health. My noble friend Lord
Marland has also had considerable responsibilities in this field, and I
hope that he will be able to address your Lordships’ House in a
minute because he will have a particular dimension to
add<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:01:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the four of us are dangerous radicals, exactly, but we
have all of us given a great deal of thought to this issue and have a
common concern. I and my Liberal Democrat colleagues have long
recognised that a broad range of small donations is preferable to a
small number of large donations; that is where we come from.
Tax relief along the lines of gift aid would be a good way to embody
this principle in regulations about donations. As your
Lordships’ House is aware, we believe that those regulations
should also include a comprehensive donation cap on individual and
corporate donations; that is not for this evening’s debate but I
very much hope it will come in due course. With colleagues
in the other place, I launched a cross-party draft Bill earlier this
year, which would have made specific provision both for tax relief and
for a
cap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:02:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has the potential to move the debate forward. After so much
self-interest has thwarted progress so far, I welcome a further attempt
to put momentum behind this change. The amount of money that this would
cost is clearly limited in the noble Lord’s amendment, which
makes clear that the maximum tax relief for the first two years of
operation would be only £16 per taxpayer, and in later years a
figure of £96 or another figure set by the Secretary of State.
We do not have figures before us for the total cost
of such a measure, but we do know that there are ways to find this
money without increasing the overall cost to the taxpayer of political
parties. I think that it would be the common experience of Members of
your Lordships’ House that this is not exactly the best time to
be persuading our fellow citizens to spend more on political parties,
or even the political process.</hs_para>

advocated before that the freepost election addresses from which
candidates at UK and European parliamentary elections can send at the
cost of the Treasury—of the taxpayer—should be converted
into booklets of the kind used in the London mayoral 
<?notus-xml column=1367?>elections. It is a staggering fact that a saving of
something in the region of £50 million per Parliament could be
secured by doing this, and could be put into a tax relief measure of
the kind being suggested. Therefore there would be no necessary net
increase in taxpayer subsidy to the political parties or the political
process. Now that Royal Mail is privatised, it may be increasingly
attractive to taxpayers to divert some money away from their coffers
and profitability into this very simple way of improving how our
political system is funded.</hs_para>

experience as a former treasurer of the Conservative Party for three
and a half years. I may not be entirely supported by the Government on
this amendment but most politicians I know think that money grows on
trees when it comes to fundraising for a political party and have no
concept of how incredibly difficult this is whatever time of the
electoral cycle you are in. Working with former Prime Minister Blair, I
was one of the instigators of the Phillips report. I participated
keenly in that and was disappointed when it came to naught, largely
over the issue of trade union
donations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000304">I
approach the amendment by asking myself three questions. The first
question is: why do people join and participate in political parties?
The simple reason is that they have a keen interest in politics and
democracy. However, in my experience it is also—as the noble
Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, said—fostering a hobby in the same
way as you might join a museum society or any other club or society. It
is therefore quite reasonable that a donation to a political party
should be treated on the same basis. It also allows people to foster
political debate. We are the home of democracy and,
as the Prime Minister’s trade envoy, I have been proud to be
able to use this as a message throughout the world. Democracy is
created by political parties; political parties are created by the
individuals who work for them and fund them. Democracy is therefore
dependent on giving. New political parties like UKIP, for example,
would not have been able to start had a large number of people not
donated to it. That, in turn, fosters
democracy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000305">We
must also recognise that, as I said earlier, fundraising is incredibly
difficult. Very few people like doing it, are good at it or like to be
asked. Because funding is so 
<?notus-xml column=1368?>important to our political parties, it is also incumbent upon those of
us who are involved in politics to stop the continual denigration of
people and institutions for giving money to them. In my experience of
three and a half years as a treasurer there were very, very few people
who wanted something in return for giving money and most of them were
not treated with any respect. There are, of course, situations where
people want to persuade a Minister or shadow Minister of the benefits
of their ideas, but they will probably not take a blind bit of notice
unless the idea has reasonable resonance with their political approach.
It is incumbent on us to resist the temptation to criticise people who
give political donations or to show them up in a bad light for doing
so. It is they who allow us to promote
democracy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000306">The
next question I ask myself is: do we want to continue a mix of public
and private funding of political parties? Let us not kid ourselves:
political parties are funded by public money. There is something called
Short money which is £6.5 million a year given to all the
opposition parties. There is also the Cranborne money, which is given
to opposition parties to support their shadow Ministers in action,
which is public money, and a considerable amount. The future of
political-party funding should be that blend of public and private
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:09:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, the problem with Short money is that it goes only to opposition
parties, and believe you me, there are times when parties in government
suffer from a complete dearth of funding and therefore require
financial support, which at the moment they do not get. Therefore the
amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, is worthy
of
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:10:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000307">The
final question I ask myself is: do we want to encourage parties to
focus on increasing their membership and their small donations? Of
course, there is overwhelming support for that. We have to rebuild our
donor base of small donors and our membership, just to excite people
into the task of politics and support for politicians, which has,
sadly, been under attack and under
threat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:10:56"></hs_TimeCode>. Every
argument leads to a mixture of public and private funding. This is a
very good start on the road to trying to find the best route to doing
it, and so I have great pleasure in supporting the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:11:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:11:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000308" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000308"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Cormack" PimsId="5885" UID="13121859000546" xid="2099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000546">Lord
Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak briefly in support of my
three noble colleagues. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has done
a very good service to the House by tabling this amendment, and I hope
that there will be a sympathetic and encouraging response from the
Minister who
replies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:11:29"></hs_TimeCode>. I take
issue with just one point made by my noble friend Lord
Tyler. I would not like to see the booklet sent out
in place of the individual election addresses which candidates are able
to send out, one to each elector, at public expense. That would be a
further depersonalisation of our politics in this country. Every
candidate should be encouraged to send out an individual election
address which reflects that particular candidate and his or her
interests—that should continue. However, I agree with all that
my noble friend Lord Marland said about encouraging participation. It
is right for us to give that modest encouragement and assistance,
because, after all, it is capped—at a realistic and modest
level—and it would not transform politics in the short term. One

<?notus-xml column=1369?>of the problems we have in this country is the declining membership of
political parties. Nevertheless, that would be a move in the right
direction and it has my total
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:12:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is natural for us, as people who are involved in politics, to think
that it would be a good idea to subsidise politics in a way that other
activities are not subsidised, and for us to be keenly aware of the
difficulties we all have as members of political parties in raising
money for our political causes. However, our problems in doing that are
the same as those that other people have. We should
therefore think very deeply about appropriating for ourselves a
privilege that is not given to other people. Although this is a modest
proposal, and does not go as far as other proposals for state financing
of political parties, it would be naive of us to think that if we asked
the electorate to treat political parties as if they were charities,
they would not in return begin to expect political parties to behave as
if they were charities and ask us to do all sorts of things that
justify our claim that subsidising our activities is something of
public worth. Therefore, although I respect the intention behind this
amendment, and I understand why we all feel that our work is incredibly
important and therefore should be exempt from the normal taxation that
other people’s important work is subject to, we should be
careful before appropriating to ourselves that
privilege.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_18_PT_1/DCCCE257F3E9649A110413ECC7142426EEF2F3EF" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 18 December 2013">Wednesday,

that it is dangerous for parties to depend for their existence on a few
major donors, wherever those donors may come from. We therefore have to
find a way to replace those donors either with the state or by

the moment, there is a disconnect between the general public and
Parliament. There are a number of reasons for that but the noble Lord,
Lord Campbell-Savours, put his finger on it: a large proportion of that
disconnect is due to difficulties in the area of funding. Some reports
are blown up by the newspapers but the public is left with the
impression that everybody has their nose in the trough. Even when

offer a personal view on this. I am on the Lord Speaker’s
outreach panel, the members of which give talks in schools, mostly to
sixth forms, but sometimes to members of luncheon clubs and so on. It
is interesting to see the reaction of 17 and 18 year-olds to talks
about Parliament. After you have told them a bit about what
we do, you ask them what they think about Parliament and the subject of
money always comes up. It is not a question of one party or the other
but of a general “smell”. At the moment, we are not
passing the “smell” test as far as 17

problem, and that that is a problem. They have to explain how we can go
on with the present system without the poison constantly dripping down
into the system in which we live. It is rather like climate change. I
never understand why I am supposed to explain that it is dangerous to
put vast quantities of gases into the atmosphere. They should have to
explain 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>why it is safe to do so. That seems to me to be the right way round. I

I agree with all of the noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord

lance the boil, or whatever metaphor one wants to use. People have made
various suggestions, including about the cap and about other things
such as those that the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, talked about. It is
absolutely clear that we have to find a solution. I am sure that all of
us who are engaged in politics, and all of us who are here would agree,
that politics is a “noble activity”, as the noble Lord

we know that, and it will not always produce the policies that people

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, as we approach this
last group for debate I shall be as brief as I can. This amendment
inserts a new clause into the Bill and provides for the operation of
the Act to be subject to a review. Whatever one’s views on the
purpose of the Bill and whether it is sufficiently necessary,
proportionate and effective, whatever one’s views are on the
process of the Bill and whether it is too quick or perfectly adequate
or whatever one’s views are on the
implications of the Bill, one thing is certain: it
has proved controversial. If this were not so, I am sure that the
Government would not have agreed to the pause during the past few
weeks. As the NCVO said in its briefing on this particular part of the
Bill, three senior parliamentary committees have raised their concerns 
<?notus-xml column=1376?>about it: the Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee, the House of Lords Constitution Committee and the Joint
Committee on Human
Rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:37:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

our views and opinions are so far merely supposition. We have yet to
meet my noble friend Lord Tyler’s unintended consequences. This
probing amendment is designed to ensure that the operation of the Act,
in particular Part 2, is reviewed once we have had some real-life
experience on its operation. My amendment suggests a review within two
years of it coming into force. This will, I presume, mean a review
commencing in the spring of 2016—that is to say, about nine
months after the next general election, close enough that the lessons
learnt in that election will remain fresh, but not so close that those
lessons are distorted by the passions inevitably aroused during the
campaign

approach, which is supported by the NCVO, offers the Government the
opportunity to say to the doubters, “Let us see what happens in
the run-up to and during the general election in 2015, let us then have
a formal review and then Government, Parliament and the parties
affected, including the charity sector, can decide and lobby for
whatever changes need to be made”. I beg to

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak to
Amendments 181A, 181B and 181C, which all move in the same direction as
the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, on reviewing the Act. We made it clear
from the standpoint of the commission, from the word go, that our
recommendations, as a result of only a fixed five weeks of
consultation, were only provisional for the 2015 election and we were
very glad to learn from the Minister that he thinks that it should be
reviewed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000336" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000336">Amendment
181B, also in the names of the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, and the
noble Lords, Lord Cormack and Lord Ramsbotham, puts forward the
recommendation that the review should be undertaken within six months
of the next parliamentary election. Amendment 181C, also in the names
of the noble Baronesses, Lady Mallalieu and Lady Williams of Crosby,
provides that the review should be undertaken within one year. That
one-year recommendation is closely linked to Amendment 181A, which
provides a sunset clause so that the Act would cease to have effect on
31 May 2016, and therefore at the end of
Amendment 181C we say that the committee set up by the House
to review the Act should report on its conclusions and those should be
debated in both Houses before 31 May
2016. There is a clear timetable for this, and I hope that the
Government willaccept

upon the Government that there are issues here which are far more
difficult and complex than they first thought when this legislation was
put before the other place in July. We have seen this in particular in
relation to constituency working, in relation to
coalition working, and in relation to what is the actual heart of this,
which is the definition of controlled expenditure. These are major
issues that will need to be reviewed after the 2015

it is clear that the Government have approached this legislation from
the standpoint of how electoral law might be abused. It is the
contention of those who are heavily engaged in the democratic 
<?notus-xml column=1377?>process, charities and other campaigning groups,
that in trying to clamp down on potential abusers, they have severely
curtailed the legitimate activities of people who want to contribute
during an election year. The Electoral Commission has said that much of
the present Act would be a burden on charities and NGOs generally. When
the Minister goes away and thinks about what has been said today, I
hope very much that he will do all he can to give NGOs that want to
contribute to the democratic process much greater freedom and the
liberation to do so without fear of crossing registration thresholds
and so on, as would happen if the present Bill goes through unamended.
I hope that not only will he think about what has been said both today
and on Monday, but that he will support the idea of a sunset clause and
a review within a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:42:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Williams of Crosby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise briefly to
support what has been said by the noble and right reverend Lord and to
make two precise points. The first is that the original amendment
provided for a period of nine months, which is too short. As we know
from many experiences, there is a complexity about elections and
everything does not surface as quickly as that. It is sensible and
important, if we are to have a review, that it should take into account
all that has happened during an election—some of that will be
local and some national—and that it is allowed to take note of
all the propositions that have arisen. That is because a review that
comes too early is one that might well get it
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:43:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121859000340" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000340">My second point is the
importance of the sunset clause, as has been mentioned by the noble and
right reverend Lord. I am afraid that I am a little cynical about
government reviews. In my experience they do not always happen,
sometimes they happen with some very odd persons being involved in
them, and sometimes they just disappear into thin air. The great thing
about a sunset clause is that it concentrates the mind of Government
wonderfully. It is like a wicket in cricket. It makes it possible to
consider very carefully what is at stake. I therefore strongly support
the noble and right reverend Lord in calling for a sunset clause to be
linked to the review because the sunset clause makes it certain that
the review will happen and be taken seriously. The Government of the
day will then have to consider in detail, in the way that the noble and
right reverend Lord has asked for, many aspects of this very complex
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:44:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, we had no pre-legislative scrutiny and
many of us are unhappy about the way in which this Bill was produced. I
think that a sunset clause would set our minds at rest to a
considerable degree and there is, frankly, an unanswerable case for
having one. I sincerely hope that my noble and learned friend, who has
already been helpful and has indicated that he
accepts the need for review, and who gave us the five-week period of
grace—it was not enough but nevertheless it was appreciated
because it marked a recognition on the part of the Government that they
had not got it entirely right—can give us an assurance that
there will be a sunset clause. That, I think, would send us all off to
the Christmas festivities and the new year celebrations with a spring
in our heels.</hs_para>

Royall of Blaisdon:</Member></B> My Lords, I will briefly say that I am
in favour of both a review and the sunset clause. I also very much hope
that the noble and learned Lord has been listening
attentively—that is a stupid thing to say as I am sure he has
been—over the two Committee days that we have had on this really
important part of the Bill. Amendments have been put forward by all
sides of the House, notably by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries, but both the review and the sunset clause may well be too late
because some charities and NGOs may well have been silenced by
then—not necessarily by the legislation itself but by the fear
of the legislation and its consequences. This legislation needs time
and good guidance, as we discussed earlier today. It desperately needs
amendment and I am sure—at least I very much hope—that
the Government will come forward with the appropriate amendments,
including an amendment saying that there will be a
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:46:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000343"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Alderdice" PimsId="3622" UID="13121859000570" xid="1044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000570">Lord
Alderdice (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have
listened carefully to what has been said. One of the important
developments in your Lordships’ House over the past year or two
is that of post-legislative scrutiny. Noble Lords have focused on the
usual way of addressing such things, such as a sunset clause and a plea
for a government review—my noble friend expressed some
scepticism about government reviews and about who gets asked to do them
and so on—but Parliament now has it within its own hands. We
would do well to consider not so much depending on
government to produce a review at some stage down the line, or putting
in a sunset clause, but rather whether we should use post-legislative
scrutiny more regularly, after an appropriate time, whether that is two
years or otherwise. I say that because it is so easy for us to put
taking responsibility for something we ourselves feel strongly about on
to somebody else. It is now in our hands to conduct post-legislative
scrutiny<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:47:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000344" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000344"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Cormack" PimsId="5885" UID="13121859000571" xid="2099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000571">Lord

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I will very briefly say
that of course we need to be aware of the effects of any legislation
and that often these effects do not become clear
until after the legislation is in force. As far as Part 2 is concerned,
the Electoral Commission already has, under PPERA, the statutory
function of reporting on the conduct of elections. That report will
include how third-party campaigning is carried
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000346" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000346">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:48:13"></hs_TimeCode>
reassure your Lordships that we agree that the impact of the provisions
of Part 6 of PPERA, which would include, if it passes, the measures in
Part 2 of this Bill, should be subject to a review after the 2015 UK
parliamentary general election. The passage of the Bill has shown that
the provisions of PPERA are not necessarily as widely known as they
ought to be, and even less well understood. The 2015 election will
provide an opportunity to review the effectiveness of the provisions of
Part 6 of PPERA as enhanced by Part 2 of this Bill.</hs_para>

that recommendation. When the review is carried out, it is only right

reason I hesitate in agreeing to the sunset clause is that
Amendment 181C calls for the report to be debated
“before 31 May 2016”, whereas Amendment 181A

May 2016”. It is important that, if we have a review, it is a
proper one. If there are things that need to be done, there should be
an ample opportunity for Parliament to take steps and consider any
amendments that are required. That would not necessarily give a proper
opportunity for a full review and for Parliament to take any necessary
legislative steps. The spirit is that there should be a review. It
should be brought to Parliament. It is clear to all parties, regardless
of who is in government after 2015, that the will to have a review and
learn the lessons that any review might teach us is there. In these

Anelay of St Johns (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is customary at
this point of the year for the Chief Whips and the Convenor
to pay tribute on behalf of the whole House to the dedicated, patient
and courteous staff who have facilitated our work this year,
and whose efforts are sincerely appreciated by us all. The
adjournment is also an opportunity to record our particular thanks to
long-serving members of our staff, who have perhaps left us recently or
are about to leave the service of the
House.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121859000352" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000352">I begin with the name
especially well known to the scholarly among us, Isolde Victory, the
recently departed director of library services. I do hate the word
“departed”. It sounds as though she has gone not only
from here but even further afield; she is still very much active.
Isolde joined our House in October 1984 and became a Library clerk a
year later. In her 29 years of service, she brought her sharp intellect
to more than 4,000 pieces of individual research that covered issues as
varied as Lords reform, Alpine skiing and tractors, or, given those who
are here today, I might mischievously suggest the Recess itinerary for
many of my noble friends. Perhaps her most enduring piece of research
concerned delegated legislation, for which her briefing note is
considered to be the definitive reference material on that subject.
Isolde also took the lead in developing Library services. As the
Library’s first head of research services and then as its
director, she oversaw a significant period of expansion. In doing so,
she kept at heart the Library’s core purpose of providing
reference and research services to Members and she leaves a wonderful
legacy for her successors. In retirement, Isolde has already enjoyed a
family trip to Canada. To her other pursuits she will no doubt bring
the same thoughtfulness and, I understand, dry sense of humour that
characterised her time in our House.</hs_para>

also note the departure of Kathryn Colvin, who retired as clerk of the
Committee Office after seven years. Kathryn joined the Lords after a
career in the Diplomatic Service, which culminated in her appointment
as our first ever female ambassador to the Holy See. In that role, she
represented Her Majesty’s Government following the death of Pope
John Paul II and hosted a visit from the Prince of Wales. Her service
saw her recognised not only as a Commander of the Victorian Order but,
perhaps uniquely among the staff of this House, as an Officer of the
Légion d’honneur. Kathryn’s Lords career was
similarly devoted to foreign affairs in 
<?notus-xml column=1381?>her role as clerk to the EU Sub-Committee on
External Affairs. She brought her diplomatic ability and intellect to
bear on the fast-moving work of that committee, granting it levels of
access to the Foreign Office that were previously unknown, and guiding
it in the production of notable reports on relations with China and
Russia. Outside the House, she has played a leading role on the UK
national committee of UN Women, and I have no doubt that she will
continue to fly the flag for gender equality during her
retirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000354" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000354">Finally,
Anne Bannerton also retired from the House this year after 17 years of
service. Anne is perhaps best known for 14 years in the Peers’
Dining Room, first as a waitress and latterly as a wine steward. She
became a warm and familiar face to many. In all that time, my
experience was that she never lost her enthusiasm and diplomacy in
dealing with all manner of occurrences in the Peers’ Dining
Room. Perhaps Peers are not always quite as patient as they might be.
Anne was a very popular member of staff with colleagues and Members,
and her presence will be
missed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000355" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000355">I also
pay tribute to John Rogers, an attendant who served the House for 14
years. He first worked for the Law Lords as a senior clerical officer,
where he prepared legal bundles and provided administrative support on
what I am told was the notoriously hectic Law Lords’ Corridor.
Other colleagues may feel that it is hectic on every Corridor. After
the establishment of the Supreme Court, John wisely opted out of the
confines of Middlesex Guildhall and instead joined the corps of
attendants, where he worked in our Peers’ Lobby until his
retirement in February this year. He was a popular figure throughout
his time in the House. As with all other members of staff
who retire, we wish him a long and happy
retirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000356" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000356">All

I pay tribute to Mr James McWhinnie, who is clearly a very interesting
character with great joie de vivre. I am told that Mr McWhinnie asked
for a day off for a doctor’s appointment. Of course, his request
was granted. When he came in the following day, everyone asked him how
he got on, and he said, “Oh I’m absolutely fine, no
problems at all”. However, a number of weeks later his
colleagues from the RAF were looking through an RAF magazine and came
across a picture of Mr McWhinnie with a wide grin on his face at a top
table lunch, on the day he asked to go to the doctor. So I am glad that
he has other things in his life apart from the House of
Lords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121859000360" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-0003.htm#13121859000360">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T19:00:14"></hs_TimeCode>
the past number of years, a group of the doorkeepers go on what is
called a “jolly boys’ outing”. The outing takes
place over a weekend and they cruise the high seas. During the cruise,
Mr Edwards gives a lecture on whale watching, so it is not just a
drinking exercise. On one particular occasion Mr McWhinnie was at his
muster point by the bar when he reached out to lean against a chair.
However, he missed the chair, fell on the floor and, in falling,
managed to fuse all the electrics that operated the bar, including the
tills and, more importantly, the pumps to the barrels. I am told that
the chap who ran the bar was not too happy. I am sure that we will
greatly miss Mr McWhinnie, and I am glad that he did not cause that
havoc in this

pay tribute to Mary O’Keefe, who was a housekeeper. I pay
tribute to all the housekeepers, who do a fantastic job in the early
morning before we arrive. When we arrive every day, the House of Lords
looks splendid. Mary worked as a housekeeper for 10 years
and spent almost all her career in Old Palace Yard. She was highly
regarded by all the Members and the departments which occupied the
building. She ended her career in the Lords working in the Royal
Gallery and the Sovereign’s Entrance. Both these areas were kept
to her usual meticulous standards, and she will be missed by all those
who worked with her and by the House in

to Mr Paul Langridge, who joined the Corps of Attendants in April 1996
after a career in the London Fire Brigade. He rose rapidly through the
ranks, becoming a principal attendant in 2001 and then moving on to
become deputy staff superintendent in Black Rod’s department, in
charge of all the attendants. His career included some memorable
moments, not least when a Member collapsed here in
the Chamber. Paul attended and, using his first aid training and a
defibrillator, without doubt saved the Member’s life. Other
notable events were the lying in state of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth,
the Queen Mother, along with state visits by the Pope,
Barack Obama and many more during his 17 years of service to

Lords Library in March 2003 as an assistant librarian. Later, she
became technical services librarian, with responsibility for the
Library’s core systems and infrastructure—invisible but
vital for a modern library. One of her outstanding achievements and
legacies is the successful introduction of a new library management
system in 2011. She also played the key role in implementing the new

the Palace of Westminster. His tally of visits by heads of state is no
fewer than 18. The State Opening of Parliament in 2013 was his ninth.
Just as for all previous State Openings of Parliament, it was his task,

detail, and of course because of that the results were always flawless.

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a very simple
and brief amendment about service wives. Service wives without children
who accompany their husbands abroad have in the past relied on
receiving the 60% married women’s pension as a default.
Obviously the option for NI contributions through work does not easily
apply if you are abroad, and voluntary NICs become expensive if you are
there for a long period.</hs_para>

women’s dependency pension is going to disappear. The previous
Government recognised the particular difficulties of service wives when
in 2010 they introduced credits for spouses or partners accompanying
service personnel abroad, so the principle is rightly established.
Since then, there has been easement for JSA and ESA
entitlement.</hs_para>

if you are in your late 30s you may have a decade behind you with no NI
cover until the 2010 provisions kicked in. This amendment simply allows
backdated credits for, frankly, an arbitrary 10 years which, if he is
on a 22-year contract, should allow her sufficient cover, and later
sufficient time to make up the rest of her contributory years. I do not
know the numbers, and I do not know the cost. I hope the Minister will
help me out.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> may be a
better way to do it—for example, as with the reduced married
women’s stamp election, which is being turned into a 60%
dependency pension, which retains the service wife’s eligibility

years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000006">I
believe that the Government may have found a way to address the
problem—this was a hint I received from the Minister in the

it; and if it is not, this amendment, or something similar offered
by the Government, might do the job. We owe it under

Dean of Thornton-le-Fylde (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, some years ago
I was chair of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body and I saw the way that
wives were discriminated against. I remember one case. We went to
Belize, where the commanding officer had been offered promotion
conditional on his wife accompanying him. She was a very successful
lawyer in London and they had to make a decision. She decided to give
up her career. While she was abroad—a two-year
posting—she was unable to contribute to a private pension fund
because she was not doing recognised work. She was working as his
partner in Belize on behalf of the British people looking after Army
wives. She gave up her career and she lost the opportunity of a good
private pension here as she could not contribute because she was not
working in this country. She was also losing out at the end of her life
because she could not contribute to the state pension scheme either.
The changes made in 2010 helped, but this Bill will almost send us
backwards. The changes made by my Government in 2010 did not fully
resolve this issue. That is one
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000008">Among
the officer cadre in all three services you still find wives giving up
their job to accompanying their husband, and they get a very raw deal.
Until recently, other ranks would have gone to Germany for a two-year
posting, and they, too, would lose out. Under the Armed Forces covenant
and the updated report issued only this week by the noble Lord, Lord
Astor, it is taken into account that we should be looking after
families. I have no idea what it would cost and I cannot imagine that
it would cost an awful lot of money, but maybe the Minister can help
us. As my noble friend says, this may not be the way of dealing with
the problem, but somehow it has to be recognised that, in bringing in a
Bill that has cross-party support and in general terms is certainly
advantageous for most, if not all, women, here we have a group who will
continue to lose out, despite the changes that are being made. So it is
with a deal of pleasure that I support the amendment, and I hope that
the Minister will agree to go back and look at the issue. Perhaps he
will come up with something that may not use this wording but which
recognises the contribution that these women have to make—and,
indeed, by which they lose out when they help their husband’s
career, because the post requires accompaniment. If that solicitor,
going back those few years, had said, “No, I’m not giving
up my career”, the husband would have had to refuse that
promotion. There are parts of the Armed Forces where the divorce rate
is higher than normal. I am not suggesting that this is the only
reason, but I think that it is perhaps one of a whole number of
reasons, stress and overreach being another
couple<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:06:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McKenzie of Luton" PimsId="1827" UID="13121860000431" xid="1824" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000431">Lord
McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I speak briefly in
support of my noble friends and the thrust of this amendment. I should
like to ask one or two questions. As I understand it, there is
currently a class 1 credit going to people in this service category,
which 
<?notus-xml column=307?>helps to build up not only pensions but access to contributory benefits
such as JSA and ESA. In respect of the latter, there is also an
easement that was introduced in 2011 in respect of the first
contribution condition, because for contributory ESA and JSA you need
both to pay an amount in a certain period of time and to have
sufficient credit. My first question is whether that credit arrangement
is going to continue under the new regime and whether the easement will
be continued, because that is important,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000010">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:07:47"></hs_TimeCode>
course, the credit has to be claimed; it is not automatic. I wonder
whether we could do something to address that issue, because we have a
group of people here who would qualify only under certain clear
conditions, and one would have thought that arrangements for these
individuals could somehow be organised centrally, or perhaps by the
separate Armed Forces, so that the information goes in directly and
there is an automatic credit, rather than people having to claim. I
understand that the take-up is limited at the moment, with only 601
applications in 2012-13, or maybe in the previous year. That is not as
many as one might have expected. Perhaps we could also have
clarification as to who is treated as a member of the Armed Forces for
these purposes. I am not sure that the TA or reserves will be included
within
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:08:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000011">This
issue draws a wider question about crediting national insurance
contributions. My understanding, based on some helpful information from
the Bill team this morning, is that if, at the moment, you are in a
category of benefit or activity that gave rise to a class 1 credit,
that would continue post-April 2016. If you are receiving a class 3
benefit for a particular activity or being in a particular position,
that would become a class 3 contribution credit also, under the new
regime. So nothing has changed in that respect. These things are
important, because a class 3 contribution builds up entitlement only to
the state pension and bereavement benefits, not to contributory
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:09:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:09:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
This gives rise to the broader question of universal credit. At the
moment, if you are on JSA or ESA, you would get a class 1 credit. In
the world of universal credit, my understanding is that you would get a
class 3 credit, which means that you do not build up entitlement
thereby to contributory JSA and ESA, which sit outside universal
credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000012">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:09:39"></hs_TimeCode>

Browne of Ladyton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my
noble friend Lady Hollis for tabling the amendment, for the very reason
that it allows your Lordships’ Committee to engage in this

committed to end any disadvantage that armed service causes members of
the Armed Forces and their families—a group of people who have

July 2008, the Government set out to put flesh on the bones of that

Cross-Government Support to our Armed Forces, their Families and
Veterans</I>. In pursuit of the ambition of that document, the 
<?notus-xml column=308?>DWP announced and introduced on 6 April 2010 new rules that allow
spouses and civil partners accompanying service personnel serving

national insurance credits during such

certain circumstances, spouses and civil partners may get credits on
their national insurance contribution record for state benefit
purposes, and as my noble friend Lord McKenzie pointed out, that helps
protect their eligibility to a state pension and contribution-based
benefits. Application for the credit is made at the end of each
accompanied assignment outside the United Kingdom, but there are
complications about that. My noble friend is right to say that it has
to be claimed. I understood that the services had in place default
arrangements to ensure that everyone who could be entitled to make such
an application was advised fully of that. Can the Minister elucidate
the current
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:11:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000016">I
do not think that one need go into the complications that service
abroad generates for service families, but one can imagine that service
abroad may mean that the family is split up. For example, some of our
troops are based in Germany, or the families may be there but the
service member might be serving somewhere else overseas. All of these
complications are accommodated. Indeed, circumstances may arise where
there is a need to make an application part way through an assignment,
and provision is made in the regulations to facilitate that. There is
helpfully discretion—and the DWP is to be commended for
this—as to the time that an application can be made. It is
already provided for to accommodate the lifestyle of the armed services
community. Importantly, however, this improved benefit was not made

have already heard from my noble friend Lady Dean’s experience
of her engagement with the service community the sort of circumstances
that can lead to the need for this provision. At the heart of it, there
is a clear and good reason why we need this. Members of our Armed
Forces are commanded to work in overseas environments. If they stay in
the services, they have no choice where they work, and often they are
there for extended tours. Often their spouses and civil partners are
unable to accrue a full national insurance contribution record because
of that. Fairness demands that they not be disadvantaged by that
service in so far as is
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T12:13:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000018">When
my noble friend Lady Hollis introduced this amendment she described it
as simple, but it has become slightly more complicated in the debate. I
am not seeking to complicate it because it is a relatively simple
policy issue, although it may have complex consequences. She implied
that the trend would suffer regression as a consequence of
implementation of the Bill. My noble friend Lady Dean specifically said
that the Bill would have a consequence of regression in relation to the
position of service wives in particular. It is important for the
Minister to address that position. If it is indeed the case that the
direction of travel is being regressed as a consequence of the Bill,
that needs to be identified. I am sure that all parties, including the
coalition parties in the Government, would wish to deal with that
situation in the context of this

issue of costs I would simply observe that, interestingly, the
Government have created a special fund of £35 million from the
fines levied on the banks for attempting to manipulate LIBOR, created
for the MoD to use in supporting the covenant and the armed services
community with the explicit purpose that members of our Armed Forces

steps to shore up the contribution records of this group. In 2010,
arrangements were put in place to allow the spouses of Armed Forces
personnel to gain a national insurance credit for time spent
accompanying their spouse or civil partner on postings abroad. These
credits are awarded for tax years from 2010-11 and provide entitlement
to all contributory benefits, including the state pension. Their main
purpose was to provide access to contributory working-age benefits to
spouses and partners who might have difficulty in finding employment

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is about
the level of the full rate of the single state pension. As we know, the
Bill states that it will be specified in regulations and, as we know,
the Government propose an entitlement of about £144 in 2016. The
amendment would raise the level by about £40.
Although that is calculated by reference to 40 qualifying years under
the current system, it still represents only 80% of working age years
and an earnings level which will by then be about £15,000 per
annum. Only at that level would the single state pension make a genuine
improvement to the state pension. That would address the concerns of
those many millions of current employees with contracted-in careers who
will see their state benefit reduced under the current
proposals.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121860000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000049">As
I said at our previous sitting, I have had discussions with the
pensions officer of Unite, as a result of which I have tabled some
amendments, including this one. I am told that Unite policy is for the
restoration of an earnings-related pension to supplement a higher level
of basic state pension, as it is felt that that will provide a better
foundation for employees in company and private pensions. I explained
to the officer with whom I had discussions that the single state
pension is the model before us which we have to discuss today but, on
the other hand, it is believed that it has merit only if it is set at a
realistic level. The amendment before the Committee is intended at
least to produce a discussion about what a realistic level would be. I
am not alone in suggesting that we need to look at the realistic level,
because my noble friend Lord Whitty has tabled a similar amendment,
Amendment 17—a very well worded amendment, in
my view—which also proposes 40 qualifying years and requires a
realistic assessment of what the benefit should ultimately
be.</hs_para>

simplicity is not of itself the best objective. If the amount is set
too low, the middle earners will not buy in to the new system. Any
system that does not have a buy-in from the middle earners will, in the

to expand on what his right honourable friend the Pensions Minister was
able to tell the House of Commons about Clause 3. Despite the fact that

provisions of Clause 3 set out a mechanism for calculating the full

established, that does not actually set out in monetary terms the full
rate; and as much of Monday’s debate made clear, that is at the
root of some nervousness, not to say anxiety—or, on the other
side, a possibly optimistic expectation—on the part of future
pensioners, a state which, rightly, we anticipate will heighten as we
approach these provisions’ implementation

are concerned as to what the single rate will be, whether they will be
worse off as a consequence of change versus their expectations of the
continuation of the status quo, and whether the actual rate will keep
the new single-tier pension rate above the level of the pension credit
sufficiently for it to prove an incentive to save, which is the
relevance of my noble friend Lord McKenzie’s point, based on his
characteristically forensic examination of the paperwork that is before
us, and picking up this key point which instructed much of the debate
in the House of Commons on these matters: the degree to which a prime
objective of this policy—that is, to reduce in the longer term
dependence on means-testing—will in fact be achieved by the full

offering a rather dramatic understatement. It is not an elimination; it
is a change of 1%. As we established in the Committee on Monday, most
of the reduction in means-testing is related to the abolition of the
savings credit, which is removing access to something for people. If my
noble friend is right, he has hit on something quite extraordinary,
which is that despite the Government saying that the STP will be
pitched at a level above the means-tested level for the pension credit,
it is in fact, according to his modelling, pitched at a level that will
not lift anyone but the 1% who get it out of means-testing. Surely the

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> I thank all noble Lords who have
contributed to this debate, which I found extremely interesting. My
noble friend Lord Whitty was quite right that this amendment is in the
wrong place and should have been on Clause 3 rather than Clause 2.
However, it has enabled us to have a discussion about what the full
rate of the single state pension ought to be. A number of noble Lords
expressed a view that indicates that it is certainly worth considering,
although I am not surprised that the Minister’s argument relied
heavily on the cost if we got what we wanted, which is a great deal
more than I think most people contemplated.</hs_para>

so, there is a case for looking again at the level that is being paid,
because a lot of people will rely on this. They rely on the basic state
pension—they do now—and few of them will have savings or
access to a decent pension provided by an employer, although we hope
that the new arrangements with regard to automatic enrolment in the new
pension schemes will enable people to save. That needs to be looked at,
and we will have an opportunity to do so later in the passage of the
Bill. In the mean time, I thank all noble Lords for their contribution,
and I look forward to hearing what the Minister has to say,
particularly about the cost. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

employers’ national insurance if there were two or three such
jobs, secondly, that the women would not want to pay class 1
contributions and that, in any case, they were few in number, only
15,000, and they were passing through. We were next told that it was a
temporary problem for them and they had plenty of time to make up their

If we do not bring them into NI, they may well cost almost as much on
pension credit down the line. That keeps more people in the
means-tested legacy system, which we surely want to avoid. The second
argument run by the Minister in the other place was that this was a
temporary period of their lives. We simply do not know. The Minister is
guessing. Some, certainly, may become entitled to a credit or move
house into, say, the city of Norwich, and thus have a wider choice of
jobs, and as a result may be able to come into NI, but others are
stuck. Their patchwork life goes on for years because that is all that
is available. We do not have the

self-employed for more than 10 years. They include some of the poorest
self-employed. The women I have described likewise tell me that they

voluntary NICs but, frankly, at £13 a week that is not usually

through. At last, it is now very simple. HMRC—and the Minister
will know infinitely more about this than I do—is building
real-time information. Rightly, we are giving the new state pension to
all those who are self-employed: 4 million self-employed people will, I

she can, by choice, buy herself a pension for the current year and opt

Equally, we could, say, by regulations, agree that by working a certain
number of hours—say, 16 or even 20—she conforms to JSA
work search conditionality. She could, if necessary, discuss this with
Jobcentre Plus—I have no problem with that—so that she
meets the threshold. However, it would be absurd to say that to get an
NI contribution she has to stop working 20 hours a week in
real, convenient jobs and go and work in Poundland as part of an
internship to meet work search conditionality. She is already doing
20 hours a week in work that fits around her caring

want to make one final point. I have been describing older women,
family women and often rural women, but I ask noble Lords to look
around them. I think—it is only an estimate—that 5
million people are estimated to be on zero-hours contracts with
uncertain hours, largely in the service sector and usually on the
minimum wage. They work perhaps 10 hours one week and 20 the
next, and they cannot run a regular job, as we understand the phrase,
alongside it, as they always have to be available, so this involves
evening and weekend top-ups. It is a major and growing problem in my
view. Some may, over the year with one employer, come above the LEL.
How many, I do not know. If the Minister has figures, that would be
good. However, others on zero-hours contracts will not do
that.</hs_para>

flexible, low-paid, semi-casualised labour force—what is not to
like for them?—with staff patching together a living wage as
best they can around their zero-hours contracts. The price paid is in
tax credits from us. There is a burgeoning tax credit bill which,
despite the wildly erroneous statements of the Secretary of State, does
not come from those who do not get up in the morning but from the
working poor, many of whom are on these contracts, as the Minister and
this Committee know very well. That cost is paid by us in tax credits

gone on for far too long—that women who are doing their best for

iterative debates on the UK pension system in recent times certain
criteria key to the design of that system and appraising outcomes have
held constant. One of these has been that it must work for women. We
cannot wholeheartedly say yes to that, notwithstanding the reforms that
we have seen in the Bill. Clearly there is still room for improvement,
and two weaknesses are frequently referred to. First, the level of the
earnings trigger set for auto-enrolment is too high and excludes too
many part-time workers, mainly women. Secondly, women who undertake
mini-jobs—each of which delivers earnings below the lower
earnings limit of £5,668, the access point for the national
insurance system, but which if added together 
<?notus-xml column=323?>would put them above that level—do not have access to the state
pension system under the contributory system because there is no
provision for people with mini-jobs to aggregate their earnings in a
way that would allow them to enter the NI system.</hs_para>

to its essentials, a woman with two part-time jobs, earning £100
per week from each job, will not be accruing pension rights unless she
is covered by some alternative credit arrangement. Someone who may be
working fewer hours but earning £110 per week from one job would
accrue pension rights. However, £100 equals about 16 hours on
the national minimum wage, so if one was doing more than one mini-job,
one would be doing a lot more than 16 hours. Yet in the way that the
system operates, they are not allowed access to the NI
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000098">As my
noble friend Lady Hollis so clearly explained, this amendment would
allow women and men to aggregate income from two or more mini-jobs and
opt to have a year treated as a qualifying year for state pension
purposes, and to pay national insurance as though they were
self-employed. Having said that, I note from the Peers’ briefing
pack that the rate of national insurance payable by the self-employed
will be a matter for the Government to decide closer to implementation.
If the Minister is able to give us indications of the
Government’s thinking on that, which would go to the efficiency
of the solution, that would be helpful.</hs_para>

confirmed, the DWP analysis found in 2012-13 that 50,000
people—40,000 women and 10,000 men—had two jobs with a
combined income above the lower earnings limit, but were not accruing
qualifying years towards their pension. Those may be relatively modest
numbers—although the real figure may be higher, given that these
things are difficult to measure. However, fairness is not simply a
function of the number of people affected, because the disadvantage for
these people is very real. As my noble friend Lady Hollis pointed out,
the changes in the contemporary nature of the labour market may indeed
increase the incidence of what the noble Baroness refers to as a
“portfolio of mini-jobs”. We are increasingly seeing an
intensity of flexibility requirements within contracts when it comes to
the hours of work that employers want in any one week. Certainly,
therefore, we need an NI system and a state system able to reflect the
developments in the labour market so that it stays fair for people who

a real issue, because it is predominantly women who are affected; they

arrangements for many self-employed people who will now be able

the opportunity has not been taken to improve the position of those
with mini-jobs. Indeed, the current reforms can compound the
disadvantage some of those in mini-jobs face; I will come to that.

them from both pension systems, private and state. For many women, it
is an intensely irritating concept, when we still hear
Ministers—although I accept that I have not heard the noble Lord
use that argument—say that because they produce trivial incomes,
they do not matter and therefore the inefficiencies of the state system
to cater for them is not to be dwelt on. My noble friend and I want to

have had lower state pensions because the state system features in the
past entailed most women gaining pension income through their husband
or reflected assumptions about family structure that have ceased to be
valid. Quite rightly, reforms have focused on enabling the vast
majority of women in the future to accrue pension entitlements in their
own right. Secondly, the contributory state system had only partial
mechanisms to compensate for caring responsibilities and the accrual
profile had a number of cliff edges within it, which meant that women
who fell below particular earnings levels not only accrued less pension
but disproportionately less.</hs_para>

previous government reforms have addressed many of those weaknesses but
not the issue that is the focus of this amendment. Ironically, the
impact of the cliff edges, if you cannot get the earnings from one of
your many jobs to £5,668, is even greater now that the pension
system is designed to provide for women to accrue pensions in their own
right. In future, many women caught in that mini-job trap will no
longer be able to gain state pension entitlement through their
husband’s state pension entitlement, so they could be locked out
for two reasons. Women in mini-jobs are disadvantaged, and they may
become doubly disadvantaged, because they cannot build up entitlement
through their husbands nor access the NI system in their own right. I
am not arguing against women accruing benefits in their own right; I am
just pointing out what I suspect is an unintended consequence if we do
not address the position of people in mini-jobs—that they now
face a double
disadvantage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:20:38"></hs_TimeCode>. At

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> I hesitate to follow those two powerful
speeches, but I wanted to ask the Minister a question around RTI. It is
understood that, so long as an employer has a PAYE system, RTI requires
reporting of all earnings whether or not the individuals are earning
each week at a rate in excess of the LEL. That would not apply to an
employer where all employees were below the threshold and nobody was
issued with a tax code. We are now in a position whereby, at least in
theory, HMRC has within its system details of earnings per paid period
of each employee with each employer. Even if that is not the basis of a
calculation, it would at least provide a basis on which individual
claims might be verified. That seems a potential change that ought to
help with this important

that we all save while we are working so that when we retire we have

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, in engaging with this issue,
your Lordships’ Committee has had the benefit of comprehensive
speeches by my noble friend Lady Hollis and, despite her reluctance, my
noble friend Lady Drake. Between them they have 
<?notus-xml column=326?>demonstrated a level of adequacy on the detail of this which, for the

the interest of brevity I intend to ignore a substantial number of the
notes that I have before me and engage with just two issues in order to
focus the Minister’s mind on them. I shall make these two points
because we also have the benefit of the Government’s position.
It is summed up in one sentence, which is that addressing this issue by
combining hours in some way addresses a problem which is a perception
rather than a reality. That is not a direct quote, but it is what the
Pensions Minister said in the House of Commons. That argument relies on
all those elements that my noble friend Lady Hollis articulated. I have
a list of them here which is presented in a slightly different
way.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121860000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000112">At the
heart of them, there are two arguments. The first is that this is a
temporary phenomenon, often coming at the end of a working life, and as
one will get a pension for 35 years’ contributions over a
working life of about 50 years, the better option for most people is
not to pay national insurance. It was argued that at present many of
these people are not paying insurance and would not thank the
Government for requiring them to do so because no one volunteers to pay
tax. If that is true, it is a powerful
argument.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000113">The
other argument is that the Government’s estimate is that only in
the order of 50,000 people are in this position, that that number has
grown only slightly recently and that, in any event, one in five of
them may be on national insurance credits as a result of claiming
universal credit. If that is true, that is also a powerful argument. It
does not undermine all the arguments that my noble friends have made,
but it is
powerful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000114">I
want to address both arguments. Of course it is difficult to challenge
them because the data do not exist, but we all live in this world. My
sense is that large numbers of people working two or more low-earning
jobs, many of them on zero-hours contracts, is a phenomenon that is
growing throughout the country. That is my experience of living in the
United Kingdom and of travelling, because of where I live for parts of
the week, across two very distinct communities. I see it growing in
both communities that I have contact
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000115">In fact,
I believe that this is a strong and growing characteristic of the
modern UK labour market. It is at the heart of the flexibility that has
allowed the UK labour market to be able to maintain and grow jobs in
circumstances where one would intuitively have expected unemployment to
have increased significantly more because of recession. It is a part of
the flexibility of the labour market that, in a sense, we celebrate,
and spent a period trying to get other countries to follow.</hs_para>

is much greater, and I shall share this short anecdote because it is
instructive about how it is affecting people in the communities in
which we live. On my way home from our debates on Monday, I overheard a
conversation among three young people in a very quiet overground train.
I sometimes find it difficult to estimate age, but they were all in
their mid-20s. They were all coming back from employment with one
employer, which was a 
<?notus-xml column=327?>mini-job. From their conversation, it was clear that they had, by my
reckoning, seven jobs among them at least. Each of them had at least
three jobs. Most importantly, they had all had the benefit of a
tertiary level education. I could not guarantee that they were all
graduates, but at least two of them were, from what they said, and the
third also had the benefit of a tertiary level education. These were
not your traditional B&amp;Q employees at the end of their life. They
were well educated young people coming into a labour market where that
was the
expectation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:30:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:30:11"></hs_TimeCode>
fundamentally challenges the idea that this is a temporary phenomenon
and that it can be dismissed, as it has in the
past.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121860000415" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000415">1.30

point is about the assessment that there are about 50,000 people in
that situation. Again, because I do not have the data, I cannot address
that directly, but I can by analogy. We await the anticipated BIS
consultation on zero-hours contracts. The Minister will recollect that
in a debate about zero-hours contracts, it emerged that for the fourth
quarter of 2012, the ONS estimated that there were 250,000 people on
zero-hours contracts. However, a contemporaneous survey by the CIPD
estimated that about 1 million people were on such contracts and,
following that, the ONS conceded that the Labour Force Survey, which is
based on responses by individuals, more than likely understated the
number—to such an extent that the ONS has now announced that it
will change the way it collects its data from autumn 2013, reporting in
mid-2014,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121860000399" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000399">“so

there is an implication—not an acceptance, but an
implication—that the ONS Labour Force Survey may have
underestimated the number of people on zero-hours contracts in this
country by a factor of 300%. We will see if that is right when the
survey is published. Consequently, from my experience and the
experiences that have been shared—I am sure that the Minister
has also heard about how the labour market is working in the United
Kingdom—and from the unreliability of the best official
estimates of zero-hours contracts alone, I am moved to ask the Minister
just how robust are the figures being used to inform the
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:32:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13121860000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000118">I
ask the Minister a supplementary question, which he may not be able to
answer now. Given the significance of that development, as the Labour
Force Survey already canvasses for figures for zero-hours contracts, if
it does not canvass information about short-hours contracts, why not?
Can the ONS be asked to do so? Does the Minister accept that if the
50,000 figure is wrong and, as my noble friend suggests and as our
experience suggests, a much higher and growing number of people are
involved, that seriously undermines the stated policy of reducing
means-testing? If that is how people will have to live for their full
working life, that blows a hole in one of the fundamental objectives of
the policy, which we all
share<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Perhaps
we should engage with that at this stage. I do not suggest that any of
the answers suggested by my noble friend are easy or that the
Government should accept them; I am just saying that engaging with the
issue in a more informed way could be fundamental to the success of the
policy, with which we all agree.</hs_para>

discount rate of national insurance. That is a question I address to
the noble Baroness. It could be seen as quite unfair on someone who is
earning just over the threshold in one job and has to pay full national
insurance, whereas someone else just below might be
credited.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

There is a boundary, therefore, about what proportion of flexible
working is formally on the zero-hour contracts. Rather than speculate

Minister is relying essentially on universal credit. I see why he would
want to do that, but I am trying to do some back-of-the-envelope
calculations. Let us take a group of women and say that the system
comes into effect and is rolled out nationally in 2020. It may happen a
year earlier than that, but it is unlikely to be more than a year
earlier. Following the example of my noble friend Lord Browne, let us
say that people leaving school at 18, or college or university, are
going to a patchwork or portfolio life for much of the rest of their
lives, given the increasing dominance of labour market
flexibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:54:52"></hs_TimeCode>. I
calculate that when they come into the labour market, if at 2020 they
subsequently need 35 years, which they will get through some universal
credit arrangements—and thanks to my noble friend there is a big
question mark over that—that means that they will qualify for a
basic state pension in 2055. They therefore have to have been born in
1990 and are currently aged 23. Under the Minister’s own
figures, as far as I can tell, any young woman or man who is older than
that probably will not qualify under UC for a full pension by the time

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I cannot leave that unchallenged. People
will have inherited rights, including credits, before 2016. Clearly,
many of the examples quoted by the noble Baroness related to people who
had had children, so 12-plus years would be credited under the existing
system to be pulled forward into the system with the foundation amount,
building up beyond that. I also need to remind the noble Baroness that
the intention with the universal credit schedule that we have announced
is to bring in all people, certainly in the working population, by 2016
and 2017, with a group of ESA recipients left beyond that point for
very good reason, because we need to deal with them very carefully.
Therefore, under the timings that we 
<?notus-xml column=333?>have announced, the people about whom she is concerned would be brought
in very shortly after the introduction of the single-tier

do not believe that he is. It is very unlikely that the UC system will
be sufficiently stable to be rolled out to the entire working-age
population—the Government are not catching these people in their
labour statistics—before about 2019 or 2020. I would like to be
proved wrong but I very much doubt that I will be. Even somebody who
has had two children, which means that they will have had 14
years-worth of credit under the new rules, would still be stuck at
about 43 or 44 with no ability to add to those years if they came
within this category of having no single job that took them above the
LEL. Therefore, we wipe out people who are something like 20 years off
their pension life, and they will go into retirement with a fairly
trivial amount barely over the minimum qualifying amount. I do not
think that the Minister can rely on that.</hs_para>

way of bringing these people in. I promise the Minister that, if he

Government are about to reward about 4 million non-working wives with a
marriage tax allowance for their husband worth £3.85 a week,

taking away a £66 per week pension, also derived from
marriage—bingo for marriage—at a fraction of the cost of
the marriage tax allowance, from older women who have no time to
rebuild. The Government are giving to married women with working
husbands and taking away from married women who now face retirement
with no pension of their own. Husbands—younger
men—immediately benefit from a tax allowance transfer which has
come as a windfall, while older women lose support that they have been
promised all their lives. It is bizarre. Why not spend the first on the
second? It will pay for itself several times over and will be far more
useful and far more fair for, given their age and such short notice,
older women can do little or nothing to build a pension of their own
greater than the 60% that they would get as a derived right. That would

15 to bring you up to 65, and the 35 years’ NI record

women, I readily agree, have time to reshape their plans. They also
have appropriate childcare credits, not HRP, which required you to earn
actual NI years for it to come into play. Many may have undertaken
part-time work above the LEL and may have signed on for JSA, all of
this bringing entitlement to a pension of their own.

we replaced it with childcare credits. They did small jobs below the

Parliament’s policy intent is clear—see Roe v

shown that it was a decision that no reasonable person could have made.

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 23, which
is in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Browne, and to Amendment
12 in the name of my noble friend Lady Hollis, who has outlined the
basic issue at stake here. I need not repeat that. As we know, the
single-tier pension will be based solely on an individual’s
contribution or credit record. Everyone will get out depending on what
they put in; as they sow, so shall they reap. But we are concerned in
this group with people who chose to sow as a couple, expecting to reap
in like fashion, when from now on it will be every reaper for himself
or herself.</hs_para>

market participation rates and social structures mean that we recognise
that, in future, a system built on individual contributions is the
right way forward. This year, 75% of those retiring will have complete
contribution records of 30 years. It will be interesting to know what
happens when that moves up. However, it is obviously important that the
appropriate protections remain in place for those who have caring
responsibilities or childcare responsibilities and that adequate
information is put out. Subject to those caveats, we accept the
direction of travel.</hs_para>

concerned to understand fully the impact of this provision in the short
term on those who will lose entitlements derived from a
partner’s NI contribution record on which they may have done
their retirement planning. It is crucial, for the reasons that my noble
friend outlined, that the transitional arrangements are fair and seen
to be fair. We have had representations from groups working with older
people, particularly older women, highlighting a range of circumstances
in which women did not build up any entitlement. There are women who
were entitled to credits but did not bother to claim them as they were 
<?notus-xml column=338?>planning to piggyback off their husbands’ records and
there was no advantage in doing so. Then there were women
who worked part-time around caring commitments, as my noble friend
described here and in the last amendment. There were women who chose to
do voluntary work, knowing that their husband’s pension would
support them and who were often the pillars of their local community. I
see a lot of them in Durham, who helped to support their neighbours and
really were the backbone of the local

were couples, as my noble friend has touched on, who made the decision

wife—would not work in order to support her husband in his work.
We have heard about service personnel. I know vicars’ wives in
those circumstances. They did not work themselves but ran the vicarage
and supported their husbands in the expectation that his pension would
support them in due course. Then there were women who decided, when
they needed a bit of extra money, that it made more sense for the
husband to take overtime or extra shifts because it paid better than
they would be—and they would not, of course, have had the sort
of help with childcare in those days that women can expect now or going
forward.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121860000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000178">When

still the point raised by my noble friend Lady Hollis about the period

further on that but, obviously, one will listen keenly. The key thing
is that some of the people contacting organisations such as Age UK have
made representations that, if they had known what changes the
Government were planning, they might have made different decisions at
the time. The wives could have registered as unemployed, disabled or
carers. Will the Minister address the question of whether there is any
way to put these things back in retrospect and if there is not say how
else they can be

suspect that the Minister will respond that many of those in the
circumstances I have described will be able to benefit from pension
credit if they find that their income falls below the minimum
guaranteed level. Some will, but is that not simply to push them on to

Government’s response to the Select Committee said that by 2020
there could be up to 30,000 women in Great Britain whose entitlement
under the STP will be less than under the derived entitlement in the
current system. That figure was also used by the Minister at Second
Reading. However, modelling done by the DWP and published in a paper
given to Peers in briefing on this Bill suggests that by 2020 there
could be 80,000 people, half of them women, projected to receive less
in state pension—that is in the 2016-20 cohort, I
think—and that that would rise to a cumulative total to 2030 of
290,000. I am sure I am simply misreading these figures, but I would be

comparable figures for married women. Have the Government responded to
the Select Committee’s recommendation that they assess and
publish the cost of offering transitional protection to those women

apologise for the fact that I am going to speak at some length, but it
is important that I lay out the Government’s argument for
removing derived entitlement by reference to the criteria for judging
single tier as laid out by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, at Second

provision of a decent standard of living for all and, at the same time,
the encouragement of private saving through clarity of
outcome.</hs_para>

fairness means ensuring an adequate state pension for people who have
contributed to the system. That is why we are recycling the savings
from aspects of the current system being abolished, including derived
entitlement, to give a boost to individuals who have historically been
excluded from additional state pension, such as carers, the
self-employed and the low-paid. Indeed, around 650,000 women who reach
state pension age in the first 10 years of single tier will receive an

and affordability are also key qualities that the Opposition have made
it clear that they are looking for. Let me be absolutely clear that we
are ending derived entitlement from principle and not to save costs.
However, as we have been asked a number of times about this, and as
affordability is one of the criteria of interest to the Opposition in
judging single tier, I shall respond to the question raised by the

analysis shows that to continue running the basic pension derived
entitlement provisions for people reaching state pension age up to
2030-31, the cohorts targeted in these amendments, would cost around
£200 million per annum in the early 2030s, and those are just
the costs for Great Britain. We do not think that it would be possible
to restrict transitional protection to those ordinarily resident in the
UK, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, hoped. While it is difficult to
quantify the cost for those overseas, we think it likely that it would
cost about the same amount again as in the UK, meaning transitional
protection for the first 15 cohorts could have further costs peaking at
another £200 million a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:23:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:23:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000192"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" PimsId="996" UID="13121860000487" xid="1545" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000487">Baroness

briefed on that outside the Committee. The question of which types of
benefit are transportable around the EU and which you can justifiably
keep is immensely complicated. I think that the definition is that a
social support you can keep within an area but a pension tends to be
transportable. However, I can arrange a detailed legal session for the

may turn to the figures that the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, was
talking about. Some 290,000 people would be affected at some point up
to 2030, which represents less than 4% of those reaching state pension

concerning payments abroad is that it does not seem fair on our

is another virtue that the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, concentrated
on. If people are to save for their retirement or make sound decisions
on purchasing voluntary contributions, they need clarity of outcome.
Extending the derived entitlement provisions would run counter to the
goal of achieving simplicity of outcome for tens of millions of
today’s working-age people. At the moment, we are in the
position where we can tell people shortly after April 2016 what they
have, in the words of my colleague Steve Webb, banked to

key to being able to do that is to have a full rate of single tier that
people work towards and a base entitlement on an individual’s
own record. At the moment, we will crystallise people’s national
insurance record as at 2016, recognising past contributions, and we
will move on from there into the single-tier system. We can say,
“You’ve got this to date. If you get this many more

women exactly what they will be getting. The difference here is that it
is very hard to trace those people to tell them definitively what they
will be getting. That takes us back to today’s problem, which
is, when you phone up to ask what your pension is going to be in three
years’ time, we can give a guesstimate at best. That will remain
the case if it is open for lots of
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000204">Turning
to the aim of providing a decent standard of living, we already have an
underpin that guarantees pensioners living in Great Britain a minimum
amount of weekly income. I confirm the point made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Sherlock, that the very purpose of pension credit is to
provide support to people in Great Britain who, for whatever reason,
have not built up sufficient savings or pension entitlement through
their life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000205">If
the current system were to carry on, we project that by 2020, fewer
than 10% of people reaching pension age after 2016 would be on the
standard minimum guarantee. We have also looked at the group of people
who would, under the current system, have been claiming a basic state
pension on their spouse’s record—either at the point of
reaching state pension age or later, on bereavement. Even if the
current system carried on for ever, 40% of the people in that group
would be on guarantee credit. That group of people—this 40% of
all of our people losing out from the removal of derived
entitlement—will get their loss in state pension replaced pound
for pound with more guarantee credit. But there will be people not on
guarantee credit who experience a loss. If we look at the average
changes to household income as a result of removing derived
entitlement, we see that the median loss for households affected is
about £6 a week. The mean average is about £10 a week.
There will undoubtedly be examples where people do lose larger amounts,
but again, pension credit is there for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000206">I hope
that by now it is clear why we have not put in place transitional
arrangements and why we have no intention to undertake a review to this
effect. We have, however, put in place some protection, specifically to
ensure that women who had paid the reduced rate election within 35
years of pension age will get roughly what they thought they would
receive. Putting in place protection for these individuals is right:
they have clearly participated in the labour market and have
contributed. The difference between them and the wider group of people
who would have relied on derived entitlement is that those people made
an explicit deal with the
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000207">Furthermore,
to address the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, those
who have paid a reduced rate election are, crucially, easily
identifiable. The message of simplicity for the wider single-tier
population will not be affected, and the size of the group enables a
bespoke calculation. Were we to apply such blanket protection to
everyone, we would simply be awarding everyone with any history of work
or credits a 60% basic state pension and, later, a full basic state
pension; clearly the costs would become an issue 
<?notus-xml column=343?>and would not be tenable. We would ultimately be awarding people with
just one qualifying year a full basic state pension.</hs_para>

point about the married women’s pension, if their entitlement
under normal transitional rules would be higher, we will give them that
instead, but we are not looking at their husband’s record for
that, we will be assuming that they have a full record and award them a
pension accordingly. Indeed, we project that, with the vast majority of
couples involved, the husband will already have 35 qualifying years. It
may be possible for people who are long-term sick but not claiming
benefits to apply for credits for a past period. It is not essential
for a person to be receiving a benefit to qualify for credits for
periods of incapacity, but they would need to meet the entitlement
criteria for incapacity for work or limited capability for work each
day within the meaning of the legislation that applied at the relevant
time. Provided that medical evidence for the whole period can be
obtained, it may be possible to apply to a local Jobcentre Plus for
credits for past periods. Clearly, I cannot comment on people’s
success in that regard or otherwise, but I

years and wants to get 35, that is part of the issue that we discussed
at length at the last sitting. That individual should be able to
benefit from the transitional arrangements. I draw your
Lordships’ attention to the analysis in our recent ad hoc
publication, which shows that the equivalent of the married
person’s pension would be achievable even for the majority of
those reaching state pension age in the initial period to 2020 through
the purchase of voluntary contributions to cover years back to 2006, or
by working or engaging in an activity that earned credits between 2016

turn to the suggestion that we review the possibility of putting in
place transitional arrangements. Such a review would be unnecessary and
unhelpful. Noble Lords will agree that, in the interval between Royal
Assent and implementation of the new scheme, communications will be
crucial. A review at a time when we are preparing the implementation of
the new state pension system would create great uncertainty just when
we are being urged to ensure that we provide clarity. We had a

make the general point that one problem here is that we are moving from
the current system because it is too complicated for anyone to
understand. The risk of some of these arrangements is that we just

summary, we have had to make decisions about how we move over to the

labour market decisions made some time back. That is a discussion will

Minister’s references to women being eligible in certain
situations to claim pension credit precisely missed the point raised by
my noble friend. If someone is in a couple with a husband who has
acquired full contributory years, possibly with some minor additional
savings, they will be floated off pension credit, so they will not be

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak briefly on this
amendment. I was exceedingly brief last time, but since the Minister
did not feel any compulsion to do likewise, I shall take my time this
time round. The amendment again raises a particular question about
transitional protection. I will not revisit the substantive debate that
we have just had, but I want to highlight a couple of points. To do
that, I want to use a case study given to us by DWP
officials.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121860000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000226">In
this case, we have a couple who have been named Jack and Jill—a
slight lack of imagination, but better than the DEL and AMI beloved of
Treasury case studies. Jill reaches state pension age in 2020 and her
husband Jack reaches state pension age in 2018. Conveniently, they have
average life expectancy, so Jack survives until 2040 and Jill until
2044. In this case, Jill had 15 qualifying years of
contributions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000227">Under
the current system, Jill would get a married woman’s pension of
£64. Under the new system she would get £62. But the real
crunch comes when Jack sadly dies. At that point, Jill would receive
£113 a week under the current system. Under the new system she
would receive only £62 in single-tier pension. That is a huge
difference and a real worry to the real Jills of this world, and even
more so to those who outlive their husbands by more than two years. The
Minister may say that Jill can claim pension credit, but the DWP did
not tell me how much Jill has in the bank, so it may be that her
savings would preclude that. Even if they do not, I have reason to
believe that Jack always thought that his contributions would be enough
to ensure that Jill got a pension without having to turn to
means-tested benefits. I would be grateful if the Minister could
comment on Jack and Jill.</hs_para>

transitional protection in place and I want to be sure that I have
understood it properly. If I understand the rules correctly, if the
dependant—in other words the person seeking to benefit from the
derived entitlement—reaches state pension age before 6 April
2016, he or she would be entitled to derived and inherited state
pension as under the current system, but only based on the other
person’s national insurance contributions as paid up to 4 April
2016. If he reaches state pension age before April 2016 but she does
not then she gets no derived or inherited entitlement. In either case,
it is possible for the surviving partner to receive 50% of the
additional state pension accrued after 2002 and before April 2016, and
between 50% and 100% of the additional state pension accrued under
SERPS before 2002, depending on when the contributor reached or would
have reached state pension age. I would be grateful if the Minister
could confirm whether that is
correct.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000229">If it
is, perhaps the Minister could answer a different question. He spent a
lot of time in his response to the last amendment stressing the
simplicity of this case in order to respond to a concern that I had
made at Second Reading. I am flattered that he read it so carefully.
However, does the Minister think that Jack and Jill’s case or
the description that I have just outlined passes that simplicity test?
If I am right, will the Government then tell the Committee two other
things? First, what consultation have the Government done with the real
Jacks and Jills of this world and, secondly and more crucially, what
steps are the Government taking to identify and warn those couples who
are in this situation and may still be married, widowhood not yet
having broken in, what the impact of these changes will be so that they
can start to make provision as soon as

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I have already set out the
Government’s position on the issue of the ability of one
individual to derive a pension based on another’s national
insurance record. As the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, pointed out
somewhat bitterly, I did that at some length so I will try and be as
brief as she was in dealing with this. I appreciate that the noble

separately, so I want to address her specific concerns here.</hs_para>

individuals to receive a survivor’s state pension, often called
a widow’s pension, to which we have now turned. Let me outline
the different groups that this amendment concerns. These are, first,
those men and women who would otherwise have gained a married
woman’s pension and, secondly, those who would not have been
entitled to the married woman’s pension because they have more
than the equivalent of a 60% basic state pension in their own right but
less than 100%, so would otherwise have received a widow’s
pension. There will also be some who, regardless of whether they derive
any basic state pension, may have expected to inherit some additional
state pension.</hs_para>

transitional arrangements for that last group for inherited additional
state pension. This will mean that where a survivor is in a marriage 
<?notus-xml column=348?>or civil partnership with someone in the current system they will
inherit additional state pension, as now. For those where both parties
are in the single tier, the survivor will be able to inherit 50% of the
protected payment, where one exists. This is what Clause 7 and Schedule
3 achieve.</hs_para>

inherited additional state pension and the ability to derive a
widow’s pension will, however, mean that some people receive
less. In terms of how much those losses are, we estimate that the
figure will be about £8 per week in 2025. That is the median
figure and is made up mostly of people receiving less by way of
inherited additional state pension. This loss is also due to the fact
that people cannot carry on building up additional state pension after
2016, limiting the potentially inheritable amount.</hs_para>

three-quarters of people reaching state pension age in the first 10
years of single tier who would have inherited some additional state
pension under the current system will receive more single-tier state
pension over their lifetime than they would have in the current scheme.
This is because the gain from current system inheritance at the point
of bereavement—and, potentially, very late in
retirement—will be more than offset by the gains in state
pension as a result of the single-tier valuation and uprating
arrangements.</hs_para>

particular point feeds through into the issue of fairness. We are
giving less to some people but we are using those savings to fund
higher entitlements at state pension age for many people. Many people
will benefit when they are younger—and by that I mean
at the point of state pension age as opposed to
widowhood—and are more likely to spend the money than would be
the case towards the end of their
lives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000236">On the

with the help of my noble friends Lady Dean and Lady Turner, we
established pension-sharing on divorce. For many couples then, the
man’s pension, especially his occupational pension—and it
was usually his—was more valuable than the home, but it was not
regarded as a matrimonial asset. Even now, not enough solicitors, in my
view, seem to be fully aware of that, although couples will often
trade: she the house, he the pension.</hs_para>

couples, his additional state pension was a structured income that
could be shared to help her too. Therefore, at the point of
divorce—usually, perhaps, in the couple’s early
40s—she could substitute his NI record, so far accrued, which
might be 20 or 
<?notus-xml column=350?>25 years, for her own, and in addition they could have
attributed to her half his additional pension. As I understand it, in
the future she will be eligible to pension-share his SERPS or
S2P—that is, his additional pension acquired up to that
point—but not to substitute his basic NI contributions for her
pension if hers are also more favourable. She is on her own.</hs_para>

it is a matter of age. Younger divorced women, with or without
children, will have enough time, through either NI contributions or
child credits and, I hope, universal credit, to build their own
pension. However, older divorced women in their 50s do not have that
head space or do not always have that resilience; they may have been
looking after his elderly parents for him or have helped him, as we
learnt at the time, unpaid, to build his small, self-employed plumbing
or taxi-driving business, keeping the books and booking the jobs. When
looking at this in 1995, my friends and I found countless stories of
this exploitation where she sinks her labour into his work, he builds
up his pension—assuring her that it is for both of
them—and then, at quite a late age, she gets dumped, as the
phrase goes, for a younger model. I would be sorry to see history
repeat itself. We can avoid that by permitting a transitional period of
15 years. I beg to

tabled by the noble Baroness on the issue of derived entitlement
focuses on the impact upon divorcees and people whose civil
partnerships have been dissolved. Under the current system, divorcees
can—through a somewhat complex mechanism colloquially known as
“substitution”—use their former spouse’s or
civil partner’s contribution record to qualify for a full, or
enhanced, basic state pension. With the ability to derive a pension
ending for post-2016 pensioners, we accept that some divorcees may be
affected, and they are likely to be those divorced relatively late in
their working life. We estimate that these individuals could number
about 70,000 up to 2031.</hs_para>

situation of divorced women, it is likely that single individuals who
themselves have not achieved a record sufficient to build up a full

is considerably higher than the maximum a divorcee could derive from a

interests me is that, given that the impact analysis claims that the
Bill is determined to reduce means-testing, I have checked back in my
notes and in something like five out of the last six
amendments to which he has spoken the Minister has referred to
pension credit and top-up, thus re-importing back into the system
pension credit means-testing for cohorts of people that he could
perfectly well take out if he was willing to contemplate transitional
arrangements. He is getting rid of complexity for him and giving it
over to them, because they will be required to go through all the
stumbling blocks of pension credit and a reluctance to claim a
means-tested benefit, which we discussed at some length on Monday. His
position is harsh and unfair on all three amendments, particularly when
we take into account that the Government are willing to find money for
the married women’s tax allowance—which he still has not
addressed, after three amendments—but not on these amendments,
when older women are losing rights around which they have built their
lives. I beg leave to withdraw the

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> This amendment moves us into somewhat
gentler waters. The amendment calls for a strategy to improve take-up
of national insurance credits. It is by way of a probing amendment,
seeking clarity on what is planned to encourage greater take-up. In a
sense, it is a subset of the debate that we had on Monday about
communications in general, which we have touched on
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:07:10"></hs_TimeCode>. We had a
very thorough note from the Bill team, which confirms that the NI
crediting system is comprehensive but also highly complicated. There is
a low level of awareness of some credits, carer’s credits in
particular, the very aim of which is to protect state pension provision
for individuals who take time out of paid work due to caring
responsibilities. Of course, the issue especially affects
women.</hs_para>

importance of ensuring take-up of maximum credits is increased under
S2P because of the increase from 30 to 35 years in the number of years
required for a full state pension and the 10 years’ minimum
threshold. This is a reversal of the position whereby the reduction in
qualifying years from 44 and 39 to 30 meant that the gaps
were not so important. The increase in the number of years to 35 has in
part rebalanced that, although the value of credit in the new system
would be
higher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:08:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:06:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000259">We
are promised a review of the national insurance recording and operating
systems and an HMRC review of deficiency notices. Perhaps the Minister
will say a little more about that. There was reference to deficiency
notices being suspended for those due to retire on or after 6 April
2016, and the Minister might like to take the opportunity to clarify
that. Some awards of credits, of course, are automatic; some have to be
claimed, including class 3 credits for foster carers or kinship carers
and those caring but not receiving carer’s allowance, and class
1 credits for maternity, paternity or adoption pay, for
non-governmental sponsored training, jury service, for those wrongly
imprisoned and, as we discussed earlier, for Armed Forces spouses or
civil partners. There is also a new issue for those with high income
who would be excluded from claiming child
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:09:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000260">Our

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>We acknowledge
that those in receipt of universal credit will automatically get a
class 3 credit and that this would cover some of these circumstances.
However, universal credit will not be fully in place for a number of
years and, in any event, there will be some credits which will be
claimable. Crediting entitlements has come a long way in recent years,
and universal credit looks to improve the position further, but some
are still missing out and this needs to be
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000261" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0001.htm#13121860000261">I
will revert to one point that I touched upon earlier. As I understand
it, the credit for universal credit is a class 3 credit and therefore
is focused on pension and bereavement entitlements only. Given that
employment and support allowance, jobseeker’s allowance and
working tax credit are at the moment a class 1 credit—obviously
those benefits will be subsumed within universal credit—it seems
that we are worsening the position of some groups. I will be interested
in the Minister’s response. The purpose is to give the Minister
a chance to focus on those who have to claim where take-up is not as it
should be and to see what can be done. I beg to

ones that I have been able to identify, plus child benefit, which I had
not noted. Will the Minister tell us whether the Government’s
strategy will include elements targeted at those categories of person?
Within that, will they consider how they engage with direct routes,
rather than just generalised campaigns? My noble friend Lord Browne
mentioned that the Armed Forces look for ways to make sure that members
of the forces community can take up those credits. Will the Government
consider other routes to that—for example, through adoption
services or the ways in which the Government already communicate with
those in receipt of maternity, paternity, adoption or sick pay? Is the
department in discussions with other government departments about the
way to take this forward?</hs_para>

insurance credits to cover a wide variety of contingencies and
activities, as he acknowledged. They are generally available to people
who are unable to work and pay contributions. This could be because
they are unemployed, incapacitated or caring for others, but credits
are also available to cover a range of other circumstances—for

for men and 80% for women. Where a benefit is not in payment, an
application is required. The carer’s credit, for example, is
available to those caring for at least 20 hours a week and the most
recently introduced credit, often referred to as the

whether there would be individual strategies focused on those types of

that was just raised about not accessing the benefits through other

understand it, is that you cannot achieve them only by credits; there
has to be a payment arrangement as well to qualify. If the credit is
changed, that makes it potentially more difficult than it is at the

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, as the Minister will have
spotted, this is a device to continue the debate on the level of the
STP and the associated costs and savings in the Bill. The Bill assumes
that STP, but not any projected payments, will be uprated by not less
than earnings but the impact assessment is predicated on the triple
lock applying, with uprating by the higher of earnings, CPI or 2.5%.
Looking long term, these two bases of uprating produce materially
different results, as illustrated in annexe B to the impact
assessment.</hs_para>

these reforms will reduce the overall percentage of GDP going to
pensioner benefits. As we discussed briefly on Monday, by 2060 the
share of GDP, compared to the current position, would fall by 0.6% if
uprated by the triple lock but by 1.3% if uprating was just by
earnings. Over the long term, the cumulative effect of uprating by
earnings rather than the triple lock would lead to STP being 10% lower
than if uprated by earnings. This is not a small difference and
although the long term— 2060—may seem a long way away, it
is the scenario which those in the labour market today will face.
Annexe C shows projected expenditure in total support for pensioners at
various 
<?notus-xml column=357?>points over the period to 2060. It shows, in 2013-14 prices, that state
pensions in total will be £30 billion less than they would have
been under current arrangements. This is why we need to keep an eye on
how things are uprated.</hs_para>

from all this is that the Treasury has undoubtedly taken advantage of a
progressive proposal—the STP—to claw back support from
pensioners where it can. The figures just discussed do not, I think,
include amounts being withdrawn from the systems because of the
introduction of the minimum qualifying period, now confirmed at 10
years and saving some £650 million a year, nor the changes to
the rules on deferrals, with savings rising to something like
£300 million a year. We will obviously come on to debate those
in due course. We do not have clarity on the savings that may be made
from restrictions on passporting although, as we discussed earlier,
these may be limited. None of these figures take account of the
increases in national insurance which the Treasury will garner: some
£5 billion in 2016, £4.6 billion in 2020 and £3.7
billion by 2030, which are very significant sums.</hs_para>

Monday for the triple lock and we should acknowledge its significance.
However, my noble friend Lady Sherlock explained previously why our
priorities had to be elsewhere—to tackle the legacy of pensioner
poverty. Given the manner in which the Treasury has clawed back money
where it can, it is reasonable for us to at least ask about the
Government’s aspirations for the triple lock without, of course,
conceding the likelihood of them being in a position to implement those
aspirations. I beg to move.</hs_para>

might be reluctant to commit his Government—or indeed a future
Government, should one appear before too long—to a particular
level of uprating of any benefit. However, the device of my noble
friend Lord McKenzie is very interesting. I realise that the Government
are finding themselves under increasing pressure to agree to the triple
lock, but I suppose that to a degree they are caught in a trap of their
own devising, in that the more they trumpet the importance of a triple
lock, the more people will expect them to carry on being committed to
it. As we discussed on Monday, all the assumptions in the impact
assessment and the various illustrations with which we have been

2.5% uplift in April this year saw the basic state pension reach a
higher share of average earnings than at any time since 1992. Next

week higher than if it had been uprated by earnings alone in this

Government believe that, like the basic state pension, the single-tier
pension should be uprated by at least earnings to ensure that it
retains its value compared to wages, but there is flexibility in
legislation for above-earnings increases. I therefore reassure the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, that the triple lock could be used for the
uprating of the single-tier pension, as it has been in this Parliament
for the uprating of the basic state
pension.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000296">Clearly,
the noble Lord would not—and the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock,
was generous enough not to—expect me to commit future
Governments for the next 47 years. Looking back 47 years would take us
back to 1966. That was a long time ago. Was it the summer of love?
Perhaps that was 1967, but in any case it takes us back a long way.
Therefore, I do not think that one could commit any Government to
anything, and I am sure that there will be lots of different
Governments over the next 47 years. However, when you look at the
proportion of GDP taken up on the assumption of a triple lock, it is
possible that Governments will want to stick to it. The Office for
Budget Responsibility adjusts for the triple lock by applying a 0.3 of
a percentage point premium to the annual uprating of the basic state
pension over and above the earnings rate.</hs_para>

lock has insulated pensioners from periods when the inflation rate has
been relatively high, and has been particularly important in the
unusually uncertain economic climate that we have seen in recent years.
The Government do not want to constrain future Administrations by
placing a requirement to uprate by the triple lock in primary
legislation. It must be up to future Governments to decide, based on
their annual reviews, whether uprating above the minimum of earnings is
applied.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000298">In

24, and 41 to 43. We are now moving to a different implication of the
Bill. The strategic objective of the Bill to simplify the state pension
system is broadly recognised, but, of course, the state pension is only
part of the pension scheme. To some extent, the relatively low
expenditure on state pensions in this country compared with some others
is due to what was a very healthy occupational pension system covering
a significant proportion of the population, although by no means
everyone. Those occupational pension schemes will seriously be hit by
the Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000305">That

Second Reading, I have a longer historic interest in this, but not
quite as far back as 1966—I was at the cup final, by the way,
and have not had such a high point since. In the early 1970s, I was
instrumental in setting up an occupational pension service in my union,
now the GMB, to establish in the private sector schemes which covered
manual workers for the first time and to make improvements in public
sector schemes to allow, in particular, part-time women workers into
them for the first time. Those who were in their 30s and 40s at that
time retired on a pretty decent pension. As has been in the headlines
over the past few days, it is clear that those who retire in a few
years’ time—those who are in their 40s and 50s
now—will have less good pensions and a less good life in
retirement than their parents.</hs_para>

for the withdrawal of occupational pensions, particularly defined
benefit pensions in the private sector, and their dilution in the
public sector, including the recession, the fall of asset values and, I
would argue, the rather overrigorous way in which we judge the assets
of pension schemes. They have also been affected by this
Government’s activity, particularly the Public Service Pensions
Act, which had a direct effect on public sector pensions, and the very
significant indirect effect of this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000309">This
arises at various points in the Bill. Schedule 1 and Clause 4 deal with
the ending of contracting out. Aspects of this are covered in Clause
24, Schedule 13 and Schedule 14. The net result is that, as a result of
the withdrawal of the rebate arising from the ending of contracting
out, employees in such schemes on between £109 and £770 a
week—in other words, the vast majority—will have to
increase their contribution as employees by 1.4% and employers will
have to increase their contribution by 3.4%. In the case of the LGPS,
this means an increase for employers of £700 million
a year, plus £300 million for employees, or £25 per month
for the average employee member of the scheme. Equivalent levels will
arise in other public service schemes. It will be £0.9 million
for employers in the National Health Service, for
example.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000310">It
will have a very significant impact on the viability of these schemes.
It is a logical effect of the Bill, and there is a real dichotomy at
the heart of the Bill which by simplifying one part of the pension
system is undermining the other. There is no obvious solution. These
costs of £4.2 million in the public sector and £0.7
million per annum in the private sector will somehow have to be
compensated for, either by the Treasury—I assume that, as of
today, the Minister has no agreement to that, but one of my amendments
addresses that situation—or by those who are in charge of the
governance of such schemes. In the private 
<?notus-xml column=361?>sector, many such schemes have already been forced to reduce benefits,
and to some degree that has applied to the public sector as well. In
the public sector, it took a lot of negotiation between employers and
the unions to ensure that we are now in the process of implementing the
changes due to the Act earlier this
year.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:46:04"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

amendments are primarily in relation to public sector pensions. There
are a number of potential partial solutions to this. We could cushion
the impact by a clear commitment from the Treasury to compensate for
these schemes. The word on the grapevine is that some representatives
of workers in the Civil Service have been given the nod and wink by
officials in their departments that departmental budgets will be
adjusted to compensate for them. I find that difficult to believe in
the present climate, and no doubt the Minister can tell me whether that
is true and, if so, to any degree, how that applies to the rather
different circumstances of the local government settlement. My
Amendment 41 would give statutory provision for the Treasury to do just
that. Therefore, I hope that if those rumours are right, the Minister
will simply accept that, in which case, the rest of my amendments will
not be relevant, but they give the Government a partial
alternative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:47:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:47:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000313">Amendments
19 to 21 and Amendment 43 suggest that in relation to public service
pensions, we should delay implementation until 2018. That is not
because in the long run there will not be a problem but because we have
only just dealt with the last effects of government intervention in
this area under the Public Service Pensions Act. Indeed, the full
regulations in the Local Government Pension Scheme and, I think, the
other schemes are yet to be finally in place; in the case of the LGPS
and others, they will run from April 2014.  
<?notus-xml column=362?>Those settlements were very difficult to reach and were subsequently
endorsed by votes of the trade union members in those services. After
some bitter internal wrangling within the unions, ultimately the
members went along with it. My amendments would allow that settlement
to run for four years and, in the mean time, allow the employers and
unions within those schemes to look at what we need to do post-2018 to
change the position. In relation to the LGPS, the situation is slightly
more acute than in other schemes in that it is a fully funded scheme,
so there is not a lot of leeway for the governors of that scheme
compared to some other public service
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000314">It
is worth remembering that the Local Government Pension Scheme is not
simply about public service employers. Hundreds of other bodies
participate in the local government scheme as admitted members covering
a lot of those who were TUPEd over as a result of outsourcing, some
local charities that have become part of their local fund and some
bodies, such as the local museum or sports centre, whose full-time
employees have become members of the LGPS. So this is not just a
problem for public service employers; it is a problem for a whole range
of private sector employers, going from very small local charities to
companies such as Sodexo, which has contracting-out provisions from
local
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:49:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:49:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000315">The
public service basis of the scheme conceals a much more complicated
picture, which again takes
time<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> to sort
out. To engage all of those employers and their staff in this scheme
takes a lot longer than a few months. This is a fairly minimalist
request given the enormity of what is actually happening to these
schemes, but if we could have another couple of years over and above
what the Bill provides, it would allow four years between one
settlement and the other. This is really a modest amelioration of what
could be an extremely damaging effect on public service pension schemes
with an increase on individuals to opt out and an increase on those who
run the schemes to devalue those schemes in terms of their ultimate
benefits<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000316">The
amendments are not a complete solution and are probably not the only

one, but I see no sign of anyone near government thinking along these
lines. At the moment, we are on course to drive occupational pension
schemes for future generations out of the picture almost entirely in
the private sector and to a significantly greater extent in the public
sector as well, as a result of what, when the Government first came up

we have to ask ourselves is: what is a public sector pension scheme? I
am a recipient of the Local Government Pension Scheme, although I did
not work for local government, because I worked for a charity that was
a company limited by guarantee and a member of the Local Government
Pension Scheme. I transferred my teacher’s pension scheme to 
<?notus-xml column=364?>the local government scheme, as it was, but I have never been an
employee of local government. I was a councillor, but that was not a
time when councillors were entitled to retirement benefit.</hs_para>

therefore, could mean a scheme that has private sector people within
it. We need a definition of whether that is just one single member of a
scheme, because it can work the other way round for a private scheme.
Does a single member make it a public scheme, or does it mean a group
of members or which organisation came into it? The effect of having no,
or very little, room for manoeuvre in public sector pension schemes
means that there is going to be an effect on the employers, or those
public sector services, which we all cherish.</hs_para>

authorities is probably the most relevant. I took the opportunity to
try to work out, with some help, what might be the effect upon the
small Welsh council, because they are smaller than those in England. I
did choose not the one that I live in, but the one alongside it. The
extra cost on that Welsh council, if it simply had to meet the cost of
the production in NIC, would probably be a £33 rise in council
tax. If you took a council in the south-west of England—which
shall remain nameless, but is probably far west—you would see an
increase in its expenditure of £2 million that it would have to
find, simply in the first year of the new scheme. Of course, it is
possible to work out the impact on a specific council by doing the
figures—working out what is 3% of payroll or 3.4% adjusted. Not
all their employers are in the scheme, but you can work out what might
apply to each local authority in the land.</hs_para>

pension schemes can make adjustments through their investment policies;
but I think the noble Lord was probably right that not many public
sector pension schemes have the ability to match and manage this
change. Therefore I believe, quite sensibly, that it is important that
the Government use some of the tranche of money that they will have
available by not having to pay out national insurance contributions to
smooth over the process of changing from one to another. Over time,
pension schemes are able to make adjustments through their investment
policies. These are important
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121860000327" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-gc0002.htm#13121860000327">I have
a plea to make to the Government, and I hope that my noble friend can
help with this. I know that it is the Exchequer, and not the DWP, that
will make this decision. As the Government have made some forward
commitments in relation to this money and have forward-spent it in
advance, I think that it would be right for them to say now that they
are prepared to help these public sector schemes to smooth the
transition over the period in which they can make those adjustments in
order that we, the council tax residents and people who use public
services, will not have to pay more for those services in the immediate
future. These are crucial issues and I am grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, for raising them, but the Government are going to have to
make some effort to compensate the way in which these changes impact
upon the public services that we all cherish.</hs_para>

Flight (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments raise some issues

is that, whether it is a pay-as-you-go public sector scheme or a funded
public sector scheme, with the ending of contracted-out contributions,
the money that the schemes will no longer receive will go towards
financing part of the new state pension. Therefore, it has gone off to
one box for that purpose. So we are left with pay-as-you-go public
sector schemes and the impact that there is on them, and financed
public sector schemes, such as local government schemes. My
understanding is that, with pay-as-you-go public sector schemes, the
money is no longer going to come in from contracting out and therefore
the impact will be on the extent of cash-flow deficit going forward
relating to public sector schemes. I should be interested to know the

some discussion during the passage of the Public Service Pensions Bill
about the extent of the potential cash-flow deficit. Mr Michael Johnson

regard to contributory public sector schemes, such as local government

concerned with—it will automatically become the financial
liability of local government to make up the loss of the contracted-out

what it might mean for a particular local authority, what is the extent
of the aggregate cost to public sector schemes which are financed, and
what is the average proportion that local government schemes, in

expect the Minister to be able to answer those questions with figures
off the cuff, but it is desirable that they should be known and

be very substantial, implying either significant increases in local

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, I commend my noble
friend Lord Whitty and the noble Lord, Lord German, on trying to focus
on solutions to deal with what seems to be a major problem,
particularly in relation to local authorities. My noble friend Lord
Whitty said that the annual cost of losing the 3.4% rebate is in the
order of £700 million a year. Today, we had the local government
finance settlement, which reinforced what was announced in the spending
round: 
<?notus-xml column=366?>a further real terms cut of 2.3% in overall local government
expenditure. Sir Merrick Cockell, who is a Conservative and the
chairman of the Local Government Association, said that local
authorities will have lost one-third of their budget by 2015. He

Audit Commission last year found that 29% of councils showed some form
of financial stress. Council tax increases to cover this, even if they
were contemplated at the level that the noble Lord suggested, simply
are not on because of the need to have a referendum to go beyond a very
small increase. Do the Government see this as a new burden which

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am content to join in
commending my noble friend Lord Whitty and other noble Lords for
bringing and developing this argument. They will forgive me if I do not
join in the nostalgia for 1966. The removal of contracting out from
April 2016 has significant implications for all occupational pension
schemes. I shall make my speech short, given the time. It is bad enough
to be between somebody and their dinner; it is impossible to be between
somebody and Christmas.</hs_para>

significant are the figures quoted by the noble Lord, Lord German. I
did not immediately recognise them, but they are in the same ball park
as the figure, which I understand to be the Government’s figure,
which suggest in excess of £5 billion a year going to the
Treasury in extra NI contributions from 2016 when the new state pension
scheme begins. Because of the scale of public service pension schemes,
the lion’s share of that increase will come from them. It is far
from clear, in the complexity of the Bill, how the increased NI
contributions in the public sector can be met. Not surprisingly, those
who have responsibility for these schemes—bearing in mind that
they have just, in many cases, entered into agreements to reform
them—are seriously concerned about the impact these changes will
have on local authorities, health services, fire and rescue services
and policing.</hs_para>

Committee in the Commons, Oliver Colvile correctly also put the Armed
Forces Pension Scheme in the frame in the context of public service
pension schemes. If that is correct, if the Minister is minded to
accept Amendment 42, the definition of public service pension scheme
will include the Armed Forces, which will answer more clearly the
question asked by the noble Lord, Lord German, about what is a public
service pension scheme. Rightly, Oliver Colvile was concerned that the
defence budget should be spent on defending our country and should not
be directed back to the Treasury. If it encourages the Minister to
engage with this issue in a positive way, I promise not to tell noble
and gallant Members of your Lordships’ House that this issue may
impinge on that aspect of public policy. If he considers that, I will
keep it quiet in the mean time until we see whether we can make some

why it supports them, because, in the absence of an alternative from

include loss of services or increased council tax, for example, or, as
we are advised, the certainty that low-paid workers will leave the
schemes or that settlements, including the settlement of the public
service pension scheme, would have to be renegotiated. I am also told
by those who know that it will mean the renegotiation of a lot of

is not unreasonable in those circumstances to ask the Government how

commitments on protecting spending on health and education in this

The Minister has kicked a ticking time bomb down the road, effectively
saying that this threat to the future of occupational pension schemes,

the next Parliament and probably not then. Whoever is in power at that
point is going to have a problem. We have long relied on occupational
pension schemes to provide an assured income in retirement as part of
the terms and conditions of working within that particular public
sector or that particular company. If we are reneging on
that—and it is a reneging—then the Government of the day

I said, there may be other ways of dealing with this, or at least
cushioning it. Yes, there will always be winners and losers in the
short and long term, but it must surely be the Government’s

Consultation Stage 2: Draft Assisted Areas Map and Government’s
Response to Stage 1’. This consultation will establish the map
of areas in the UK in which regional aid will be available during the

expires on 30 June 2014; it will cover the period 1 July 2014 to 31
December 2020. The second stage consultation will be open from today

Area coverage permits the UK to provide additional investment to firms
in the designated Areas. It does not bring specific funding, instead
offering eligibility for certain forms of financial support. Other
forms of financial support are available inside and outside Assisted
Areas, including aid for research and development, to improve access to
venture capital and to support environmental projects. Additionally,
all areas of the UK will be eligible to apply for European Structural
and Investment (ESI) funds, particularly through the European Regional
Development Fund or the European Social Fund.</hs_para>

Commission’s guidelines, the draft Map published today
represents a thorough, evidence-based approach to allocating the
UK’s population coverage. We have proposed Assisted Areas based
on a combination of the potential to use regional aid to encourage
economic growth in localities through levering private sector
investment, as well as the economic need of the locality. A strong
principle underpinning the proposed Map is to use our coverage to focus
on areas that are able to use the flexibility provided. There are many
deprived parts of the UK that do not have the scale of industrial or
development sites necessary to exploit Assisted Area
status.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000008">The
Government is seeking to refresh the Map, not simply add coverage to
those places that already have it. Economic geography evolves along
with the rules which dictate coverage, and Assisted Area status does
not benefit every ward in the country that currently has designation
and could be economically beneficial to many wards that currently do
not. Local Enterprise Partnerships (LEPs) in England and Local
Authorities 
<?notus-xml column=142?>(LAs) in Scotland and Wales led in responding to Stage 1 of the
consultation, and 41 out of 49 of their returns sought increased
coverage. We have ensured that allocation is given to those areas where
it can make the most difference, and difficult decisions have had to be
made as to which areas are included on the draft Map. We now look
forward to receiving the responses which will help shape the final
Assisted Areas Map
2014-2020.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Statement"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13121850000605" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000605">Banking:

am today announcing capital funding to provide the extra places needed
for our growing population, and to implement the universal infant free
school meals entitlement. I am also pleased to publish Sebastian
James’s review of progress since his original 2011 report on
education capital. I am also announcing the government’s main

government’s overriding priority for capital investment is to
ensure every child has a place at school. Demographic pressures have
put strain on schools in many parts of the country. That is why we have
more than doubled funding for new places to 
<?notus-xml column=143?>£5 billion in this parliament. By May 2013, this
investment had already helped to create an additional
260,000 school places with more still to come.</hs_para>

further funding for new school places up to 2017. We are giving local
authorities longer-term allocations for new school places, which will
give them more certainty in their planning. We are targeting
funding more effectively, based on local needs, through using data we
have collected from local authorities about the size of schools and
forecast pupil projections. We are also analysing local authority
capital expenditure on new school places, so that there is greater
accountability and transparency around how they use these
funds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000017">The
major investment I am announcing today will enable local authorities to
make sure that there are enough school places for every child who needs
one in the years to come. The number of pupils in England is rising and
is set to continue to rise well into the next Parliament. Ensuring that
every child is able to attend a good or outstanding school in their
local area is at the heart of the government’s comprehensive
programme of reform of the school system. To achieve this we will
provide an additional £2.35 billion to support local authorities
to plan and create new school places that will be needed by 2017. This
is additional to the £5 billion that has been
allocated between 2011-15. Extending the allocations to a three year
period will allow local authorities to plan strategically for the
places they need. I have listened to the particular challenges faced by
London, and therefore the methodology used to allocate funding for
2015-17 takes into account the higher costs of building in the
capital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000018">I am
also announcing further details about capital investment in 2014-15 to
support universal free school meals for children in reception, Year 1
and Year 2 in state-funded schools. As part of the Autumn Statement the
Chancellor confirmed £150 million of capital funding for
improving school kitchen and dining facilities in order to offer every
infant school pupil a free nutritious school meal at lunchtime.
Universal free school meals for primary school pupils were a key
recommendation of the independent School Food Plan produced for the
department by Henry Dimbleby and John Vincent in July 2013. The aim is
to improve academic attainment and healthy eating, and save families
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000019">Turning
to revenue funding, the distribution of the Dedicated Schools Grant
(DSG) to local authorities will continue to be based on the current
“spend-plus” methodology for 2014-15, set out in three
spending blocks for each authority: an early years block, a schools
block and a high needs block. The underlying schools budget will be
kept at flat cash per pupil for 2014-15. To protect local authorities
with falling pupil numbers we will continue with arrangements to ensure
that no authority loses more than 2% of its budget in cash
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000020">Although
the overall schools budget will stay at the same level on a per pupil
basis before the addition of the Pupil Premium, the actual level of
each school’s individual budget will vary. To protect schools
from significant budget reductions, we will continue with a Minimum
Funding Guarantee that ensures that no 
<?notus-xml column=144?>school sees more than a 1.5% per pupil reduction in
2014-15 budgets (excluding sixth form funding) compared with 2013-14

am announcing 2014-15 revenue funding allocations to local authorities
to secure early learning places for two-year-olds from lower income
households. From 1 September 2013 early learning became a statutory
entitlement for around 20% of two-year-olds across England, which will
extend to 40% of two-year-olds from September 2014. To deliver this,
the government is today allocating £760 million to

2014-15.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000022">The
Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) announced on 10 December
2012, that all state funded schools in England will be withdrawn from
participating in the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme from April 2014. This
means that local authorities will no longer be required to administer
the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme on behalf of schools. A deduction of
£50.5 million will be made from the DSG for 2014-15 to
compensate the Exchequer for the loss of revenue resulting from local
authorities no longer needing to meet the costs of
purchasing carbon allowances for schools under the scheme. As schools
will no longer need to meet these requirements, they will be no worse
off as a result of this change.</hs_para>

Autumn Statement recognised that the local government sector has risen

Administration. Indeed, opinion polling suggests that satisfaction with

deficit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000068">The
Autumn Statement ensured that the local government budget is protected
next year so that councils can deliver a council tax freeze. Councils
now have more stability and certainty to plan budgets and move ahead
with transforming local services and ongoing efficiency. English local
government accounts for £1 of every £4 spent on public
services, and is expected to spend some £117 billion in 2013-14.
So the settlement that we are proposing recognises the responsibility
of local government to find sensible savings and make better use of its
resources. This settlement marks the second year of business rates
retention, and leaves councils with considerable total spending power,
with an overall reduction, excluding the Greater London Authority, for
next year of just 2.9 per cent. We expect the average spending power
per dwelling to be some £2,089.</hs_para>

We will be providing an Efficiency Support for Sparse Areas grant worth

continue to drive forward efficiencies in their area. This is an

increased the protection that the safety net will offer, so that no
council will face a loss of more than 6.9 per cent in their spending
power in 2014-15, a higher level of protection than we offered both
last year and the year before. We have achieved this by increasing the
amount we have made available to protect councils through the
Efficiency Support Grant, now worth some £9.4 million in
2014-15. But we will expect the councils in receipt of that funding
– in line with the efficiencies that we are asking all councils
to deliver – to improve services. It is unfair on the rest of
local government to expect them to subsidise other councils’
failure to modernise public services. In order to further facilitate
effective budget planning, we are also making available illustrative
figures for 2015-16, and we announced in June that we will be making

identified, there are areas where the police can continue to make
further savings without affecting the level of service to the public,

Davey MP) has made the following Written Ministerial
Statement.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=161?><hs_para UID="13121850000556" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000556">“The European
Commission has today announced its decision to open an investigation
into the State aid case for the proposed Hinkley Point C investment
contract. I welcome the investigation and the consultation that will
follow which will seek views to enable the Commission to make a legally
robust decision. Such investigations on the part of the European
Commission are a standard part of the process for interventions that
are novel and complex and the raising of doubts, questions or concerns
as part of this process is also to be expected. Indeed, this is what
happened on the Royal Mail, Property Tax on Telecommunications
Infrastructure and Nuclear Decommissioning Authority State aid cases,
all of which were subject to investigations by the Commission and all
of which were ultimately cleared by the Commission.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121850000557" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000557">The European
Commission’s decision represents another important step forward
in progression of the State aid case for Hinkley. Alongside Royal
Assent, today, of the Energy Bill and my Department’s
publication tomorrow of the Electricity Market Reform (EMR) Delivery
Plan and revised version of the Contracts for Difference (CfDs) terms,
this Opening Decision for Hinkley demonstrates excellent progress in
delivering the Government’s EMR Programme. Investment contracts,
such as those proposed for Hinkley, are in effect early CfDs and, like
CfDs, they are a market-orientated instrument designed to incentivise
investment in new low carbon generation whilst ensuring an appropriate
allocation of risks between generators and consumers. This investment
is needed at scale if the UK is to play its part in meeting the
EU’s common security and diversity of supply and decarbonisation
objectives, all at least cost to the consumer. EMR, taken together with
our other energy interventions, for example, in relation to energy
efficiency and the pursuit of interconnectors with other Member States,
will help ensure that the UK is able to make its fullest contribution
to achieving a single EU energy market.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121850000558" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000558">The UK’s
electricity market reforms are ground breaking, with much of Europe
following our progress with close interest. This is particularly so in
the case of CfDs. CfDs are necessary given the current market
failures and are an innovative intervention, with impacts on
competition and trade limited to the very minimum required to ensure
that security of supply and decarbonisation objectives can be achieved.
For example, as set out in the commercial agreement on key terms for
the proposed Hinkley Point C investment contract that I announced on
21st October this year, any contract awarded to EDF for Hinkley would
include in-built mechanisms to prevent overcompensation. These include
construction and refinancing gainshares and operating cost reviews
taking place at 15 and 25 years into the contract term.
Indeed, CfDs are less distortive and less generous to generators than
some other interventions, which have previously been approved by the
Commission.</hs_para>

provided a substantial amount of information and evidence to the
Commission to support its assessment of the Hinkley case and have been
discussing the case and EMR more generally with the Commission for the
past 18 months. I now look forward to considering the Opening Decision,
and continued  
<?notus-xml column=162?>close engagement with the Commission on Hinkley and other EMR related
state aid cases. The Hinkley investigation will include a public
consultation period during which third parties can provide views to the
Commission and there will of course be opportunity for the UK
Government to provide further evidence to the Commission on why the
agreement we have reached with EDF is consistent with State aid rules
under the European Treaty.</hs_para>

interested stakeholders to participate in the consultation. Investment
contracts and CfDs are a vital measure which the UK must implement in
order to achieve its energy objectives and I have no doubt that we will
be able to provide robust responses to any lines of inquiry which the
Commission sets out as part of its Opening Decision on
Hinkley.”</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Statement">

it will enable the Assembly to legislate about devolved taxes—a
Welsh tax on transactions involving interests in land (replacing stamp
duty land tax in Wales) and a Welsh tax on disposals to landfill
(replacing landfill tax in Wales); it establishes a mechanism by which
the Assembly can trigger a referendum in Wales on the question of
whether a part of income tax in Wales should be devolved; and, subject
to a vote in favour in a referendum, the Bill will enable the Assembly
to set a Welsh rate of income tax, in the same way as the Scottish rate
of income tax in
Scotland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121850000574" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218-wms0001.htm#13121850000574">These

sets out how we intend to implement important changes to elections to

its public dialogue in 2012 involve the transfer of the nuclear DNA to
an egg or embryo with healthy mitochondria that has had its own nuclear
DNA removed. The nuclear DNA, which shapes personal characteristics and
traits, is not therefore modified. However, as the aim is that children
born as a result of mitochondrial donation, and their offspring, would
be free of serious mitochondrial disease it would be a form of germline
modification or germline gene therapy, as respectively recognised by

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Freud) (Con):</Member> We have always been clear about
our plan for progressive roll out of Universal Credit from October 2013
in a careful and controlled way. To this end, I recently tabled a
Written Ministerial Statement on 5 December 2013 regarding the roll out
of Universal
Credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121851000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218w0001.htm#13121851000236">We
have always intended to take a staged approach. We started the
pathfinder early in April and began to expand the service from October.
That initial expansion will be completed, as planned, by the spring. We
are confident that this is the right approach for such a large and
complex change, and the Secretary of State has now set out our next
stage delivery
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121851000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131218w0001.htm#13121851000237">We will
