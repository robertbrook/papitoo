The decision to withhold the risk register was based on the principle
that Governments, together with their civil servants, need to be able
to consider all aspects of policy formation, including its risks, in
private. It remains our view that a full and candid assessment of risk

the House will be grateful to the Minister for reminding us of the

remind him that the Question is about what the Cabinet and the
Secretary of State decided should not be in the public domain. Is
there no shame or embarrassment on the part of the
Government, who have imposed, quite rightly, a duty of candour on the
NHS but who decline to practise that policy themselves by being candid
with the public, particularly with those of us who use the NHS? What
are the Government hiding? If it is nothing, they should publish the

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the risk register, as the noble Lord
knows, is simply a tool that records the risk assessment process and
the actions that need to be taken to mitigate those risks. However, to
be effective, the process has to be robust and consider all likely
implications—and indeed some that are not so likely—of a
proposed course of action. The candid recording of risks enables them
to be effectively managed. However, as the noble Lord knows, we have
gone as far as we can in publishing the areas of risk that are
contained within the risk register. I remind the noble Lord that in
2012 we published an extensive document that set out quite a lot of
detail. That document is still available on the department’s
website<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:11:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120452000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" PimsId="1076" UID="13120452000297" xid="1755" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000297">Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I refer noble Lords
to my health interests. To return to the Question asked by my noble
friend, is it not a fact that officials warned Ministers that they
would be introducing a shambolic reform of the health service? Those
officials, much-maligned by the noble Lord’s ministerial
colleagues, have been proved to be absolutely right. As we are all

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not accept the noble Lord’s
description of the transition, which has gone extremely smoothly. By
most measures the NHS is performing very well indeed. Waiting times are
low and stable, the number of people waiting more than 12
months has plummeted since 2010, hospital-acquired infections are at an
all-time recorded low, we have more doctors and healthcare
professionals in the system, and mixed-sex accommodation has been
reduced to minimal levels. That does not indicate to me that the
reforms have had a damaging effect—quite the

revenue and capital funding of £6,350 per pupil in
2012-13, compared to independent day schools, which received
£11,510. These figures cover pupils aged three to 19 years old,
as there is no available 
<?notus-xml column=232?>breakdown of either figure to cover the requested age range of 11 to 18
year-olds. We cannot provide data relating to 2013-14, as these are not
yet

McIntosh of Hudnall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for that unexpectedly helpful reply. We can accept from what he said
that there is clearly a significant difference between the amounts of
money being spent on children in maintained schools and those in
independent schools. The House has often heard the Minister extol the
virtues of the independent schools, and I acknowledge that there is a
lot to admire in the best of them, but would he acknowledge
that to use as he does the achievements of that privileged and
exclusive sector as a stick with which to beat maintained schools is
neither fair nor reasonable? Would he further agree that what parents
who can afford to pay are buying—and I speak with authority on
this matter—is not narrow focus on academic achievement,
important as that may be, but a broad curriculum that properly values,
for example, sport, music, drama and the humanities, the very subjects
now fighting to avoid marginalisation under the Government’s new
national curriculum

beat the state sector, but I personally find it quite shocking that 7%
of the population go to private schools yet they take more than half
the top jobs and more than 40% of the places in our top universities.
That is a level of social immobility that I am sure we are all

around, but I think our record on this is rather better than that of

replacing them with equivalent ones. We are very keen to see all new
schools have sports facilities. Where we are building schools in
confined spaces, which we often are, we have used artificial turf or
maybe sports facilities on the roof. We consistently now use games such

the northern franchise rolling stock is 24 years, and that of the
Merseyside rolling stock is 34 years. The northern franchise uses the
Pacer extensively. The Pacer is a bus body put on a freight chassis. It
is exceedingly uncomfortable, unsafe and by 2019, which is the terminal
date, it should meet the requirements of the Disability Discrimination

rolling stock. The Pacer does not currently meet the necessary
standards that all trains must meet by 2020. It will be for the owners
to decide whether to scrap them or to invest in extending their

Shutt of Greetland (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, is the noble Lord aware
that last Saturday a significant rugby league match took place in
Manchester, and that many people from the eastern side of the
Pennines—the Yorkshire side—were anxious to attend it?
Northern Rail ran two-coach trains across the Pennines. People were
either packed into those trains like sardines or they did not get on
them. Does the noble Lord believe that this shows the problem that we
have with rolling stock? When significant events take place, if train
operating companies cannot increase the number of carriages on trains

railways for the past five decades. This Government have embarked on an
unprecedented rail modernisation programme. Between 2014 and 2019, the
infrastructure operator Network Rail will spend more than
£38 billion on running and expanding our railways.
With regard to Manchester, new electric trains are being
delivered for the First TransPennine Express service from Manchester to

welcome one part of the Statement—the decision to abandon the
hare-brained scheme to levy tolls on the A14, which would have led to a

does the Minister agree that the A14 episode illustrates why
the Government are delivering so little real infrastructure as they
announce ever more grandiose targets and plans? The upgrade of the
A14—a vital growth corridor from the east coast ports to the
Midlands—was shovel-ready in 2010. One of the first acts of the
coalition Government was to cancel it, along with a string of other
major road schemes, the expansion of Heathrow and 715 school-building
schemes which were all ready to go.
Last<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> year,
Ministers tried to resuscitate the A14 as a toll road with magic money.
Now that scheme has collapsed, we are back to where we were in 2010,

my noble friend forensically brings us to the detail. It is quite true
that the Opposition’s plans for capital expenditure were lower
than this Government’s. Subsequently, we switched current spend
into capital spend in the Autumn Statements in 2011 and 2012, which
further exacerbated this side’s advantage on investment. On my
noble friend’s observation about offshore wind strike prices,
the purpose of today’s announcement was to give the industry
certainty in order to be able to get on with the building that we

clause calls for a broader range of better background checks to be
included as part of the licensing process. It amends the Firearms Act

mental illness provides a presumption against the acquisition of a

administering a firearms licence is much higher. Therefore, at present
the taxpayer is subsidising the firearms licensing system by an
estimated £18 million a year. Given the level of police cuts
across the country, that level of subsidy seems unfair. It is difficult
to understand why, at £50 for five years, the annual cost of a
firearms licence is barely a third of the cost of a fishing licence,

expensive? Why are the Government not going for full cost recovery when
they are committed to that general principle across the public sector,

recovery on tribunal fees; that will come up again. The Government

alcohol or drug misuse, those are exactly the sort of people who should

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased that we have had
this short debate on what is a very important issue. The new clause
proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, relates to two firearms
licensing issues which were discussed extensively during the passage of
the Bill in the House of Commons. As the noble Baroness has explained,
the first part of the proposed new clause seeks to create a presumption
that if an applicant for a firearm meets one of the stated criteria,
the police should not grant a licence. The stated criteria include
evidence of domestic violence, mental illness and drug or alcohol
abuse. While I share the anxiety of the noble Baroness about firearms
being possessed or accessed by unsuitable persons, the police already
have the ability to take these factors into account when assessing the
risk to public safety. I would also be concerned about including mental
illness as a presumption for a refusal. It would be wrong for us to
suggest that all forms of mental illness, even a past episode, should
prima facie disqualify a person from possessing a firearm.</hs_para>

are particular concerns about domestic violence and abuse.
In response to these, on 31 July, we published specific guidance on
this issue which provided greater detail on how the police should
handle such cases. In addition to that the revised full guidance,
published as recently as October—the noble Earl, Lord Lytton,
may not have seen that but it is available—specifies that the
police must take seriously non-convictions intelligence and information
when assessing a person’s suitability to possess firearms. It
also states that any incident of domestic violence or abuse which comes
to the attention of the police should result in a review of
the current suitability of the certificate holder. Decisions must be
made on a case-by-case basis, but the guidance is clear that evidence
of domestic violence will generally indicate that an application should
be refused or, if a certificate has already been issued, that the
certificate should be withdrawn. This new guidance is now being applied
by police

proposed new clause also seeks to introduce a requirement that the
police must follow any guidance issued by the Home Secretary when
assessing public 
<?notus-xml column=247?>safety. I understand that argument, but I consider that guidance needs
to remain just that. It is right that chief officers have the
discretion to assess applications for firearms in their local areas,
taking into account the merits of each case and the published guide.
Chief officers are ultimately responsible for public safety at a local
level. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, on this. The
Government have sought to make decision-making a local responsibility
wherever possible. I would not want to undermine

licensing, which will complement and cross-refer to our guidance. I
believe that this is the way forward. In order to assess standards,
HMIC has carried out a scoping exercise on how firearms licensing is
conducted in practice, and we will use the findings from the exercise

part of the proposed new clause, which seeks to introduce a legal
requirement for the Secretary of State to consult all chief police
officers before revising the licence fees so that they achieve full
cost recovery. Noble Lords should be reassured that consultation with
the police is integral to the fee-setting process and we fully accept
the need to consider the impact of licensing on police resources. That
is why a new online licensing system is being introduced, cutting the
administrative burden of a paper-based system. Primary legislation is
not required to make this happen. Until we have driven out the
inefficiencies in the current paper-based approach to the licensing
function, it would not be appropriate to raise the fees fourfold in
order to achieve a “one giant step” full cost recovery.
The current fees and licensing structure has remained the same for a
long time and—we all accept—needs to be reviewed. It is
extremely important that we achieve a balance between an efficient
system and a proper fee level. For this reason, we are considering what
level firearms licensing fees should be over the long term, once these
efficiencies have been made. I hope that, having demonstrated to the

these issues, she will be persuaded that further legislation

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I would
love to have been persuaded by the Minister, because the only reason we
brought this amendment forward is that the current system is not
working. If it were, there would be no need for such an amendment, so
it is clear that we are extremely concerned. I was interested in the
point raised by the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, on the case of Michael
Atherton; he said that existing legislation was adequate. I tell him
that there are a number of reasons why Mr Atherton should not have had
a firearms licence, perhaps most crucially his history of domestic
violence. The police wanted to refuse his application, but they were
given legal advice that they did not have the grounds to refuse. That
is part of the 
<?notus-xml column=248?>problem: it indicates the change in the law that is needed.
Discretion can be very difficult for police officers when
they are getting legal advice that, if they use that discretion, they
will be challenged in courts. That is one of the reasons we have
brought this forward. I understand the concerns on mental illness, and
I would never suggest for a moment that anybody who has had a mental
illness should not be able to hold a licence. I think, however, that
there should be a check on people who have had a mental illness who
could be a danger to themselves or others; where it is coupled with
domestic violence, for example, then there is a

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the Government remain
committed to strengthening the system of firearms control where
necessary in order to protect people from harm. We have identified two

response to a recommendation made by the Home Affairs Select Committee
in 2010. The committee recommended that persons with suspended
sentences should be prohibited from possessing firearms in the same way
as those who have served custodial sentences. The Government have
accepted that recommendation, and subsection (1) of the new clause will
ensure that the same prohibition applies to people who have suspended
sentences.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120452000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000122">A
person who has served a custodial sentence of between three months and
three years cannot possess a firearm for five years after the date of
their release. For the purposes of suspended sentences, this
prohibition will start from the second day after the date of sentence
rather than the date of release. This is because a person with a
suspended sentence will not be in custody from the date of sentence, so
the prohibition needs to begin almost immediately. We have said the
second day after the date of sentence so that, if the person does have
a firearm, they are not instantly in breach of the law upon receiving
their suspended sentence. In effect, they may have around 24 hours to
sell the firearm or transfer ownership of it to someone
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120452000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000123">I
should say, however, that this requirement on a person given a
suspended sentence immediately to divest themselves of any firearms is
subject to the transitional provision in subsection (3) of the new
clause. This provides that a person who has had a suspended sentence
imposed, and who holds a firearm or shotgun certificate on the day that
the new legislation comes into effect, will be able to continue to
possess their firearm or shotgun for the duration of that certificate.
This is to ensure that we are not placing any additional burden and
bureaucracy on the police by obliging them to go through their records
to find certificate holders who have suspended sentences. As I have
already said, this is purely a transitional arrangement; it will not
apply to anyone given a suspended sentence after

second change, made by subsection (2) of the new clause, will ensure
that prohibited persons are prevented from possessing antique firearms.
Currently a person with any criminal conviction would be able to
possess an antique firearm. Intelligence indicates that there is a
growing interest in antique firearms from criminal groups. This
amendment will ensure that persons convicted of a criminal offence and
sentenced to at least three months’ imprisonment, including a
suspended sentence, will be prohibited from possessing antique firearms

Rosser:</Member></B> We certainly support these amendments as they
address gaps in the legislation and will enable more effective and
comprehensive monitoring of firearms licensing. It is interesting to
note that the Government’s intention to close loopholes in
firearms licensing seems to stop at those on suspended sentences and at
tightening regulations on antiquities. Although we agree they are
important areas, the Government’s legislation, as we said on the
previous amendment, does not extend to other rather more serious areas
of activity or to preventing people obtaining a firearms licence. The
Government seem to be keen on addressing loopholes in certain aspects
of granting firearms licences but not, apparently, in
others.</hs_para>

briefly on this to thank the Government for including this clause in
the Bill. It will have the effect of ending the present ludicrous and
anomalous situation where British Transport Police officers can be
selected and trained in the use of firearms, but then have to apply
individually for firearms certificates, adding enormously to the
bureaucracy through which they have to go and delaying the recruitment
of trained officers to serve the British Transport Police. This is a
subject I raised first during scrutiny of the Police Reform and Social
Responsibility Bill in July 2011 and because nothing had happened by
the start of this Session, I introduced a Private Member’s Bill
which would have produced this effect. I am delighted to say that I got
a letter from the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, on 21 May saying that my
Private Member’s Bill was not necessary because the Government
were going to include this provision. Indeed, the words in this new
clause exactly follow the words I had in the Private Member’s
Bill, so this is my opportunity to say thank

In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:26:36"></hs_TimeCode> our
privileged position in this House, it is sometimes easy for us to be
divorced from the problems experienced daily by those on whom we rely
for basic goods and services, so I will give some statistics that the
union has provided. In 2012 alone, there were 120,000
violent attacks against retail staff throughout the United Kingdom; it
is a very widespread problem. The Association of Convenience Stores has
also expressed concern about this. In a briefing earlier today, it said
that in the past three months more than half of retailers reported
being victims of verbal or physical abuse during the course of their
work. These are ordinary working people, often earning the minimum wage
or little more, who are being attacked for simply doing their jobs and
upholding the law of the land.</hs_para>

for a moment the fact that 30%—nearly a third—of such
violent and abusive incidents occur, as I said earlier, when customers
are challenged on restricted items such as alcohol or cigarettes; that

The shopkeeper was left shaking and crying, with her hair on the

does the amendment do? It sets out to create a specific offence of

factors, and experience of prosecutions and sentencing shows that that
is often not enough to see justice done. In far too many instances,
because of the laws that currently govern assault in the workplace, the
police and the CPS seem to decide that it is just not worth prosecuting
people in those cases of common assault, as they will be fined perhaps
only £50 at the end of that long

guidelines. That, in turn, would make the range of penalties for
offenders higher, thus encouraging a higher number of prosecutions. It

Bradshaw (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I support what the noble Lord has
just said. I was moved to speak to the amendment having recently
watched the six films on Channel 4 about the staff on First Great
Western. It was brought to my attention—although I should have
known it—that there was a lady guard or train manager 
<?notus-xml column=254?>on a train going from Paddington to Swansea. She
went the whole way and was by herself. The train was invaded by drunks
at Paddington, Reading, Swindon, Bristol, Newport and Cardiff. They got
off at one place, another lot got on, and they got more and more drunk
as the train went on. She had no means of defending herself whatever; I
think it was only her good sense of humour that got her through. Other
films showed people manning ticket barriers by themselves and being
fearfully abused by people who were offering violence and that sort of
thing.</hs_para>

you to be a passenger—some people’s behaviour can be
quite awful. We expect public servants to take that. As the noble Lord,
Lord Foulkes, said, we sit here in comparative safety and peace, but I
know from my time on the police authority that going around big cities
on Friday and Saturday nights is an appalling position in which to be,
especially during the small hours. I suppose that policemen cannot be
offended by obscenities and threats of violence, but I am sure that

There should be an exemplary punishment. I am not in favour of shutting
a lot of people up in prison, but there is scope for very substantial
periods of community service. If they have to be served on Saturday and
Sunday—or, more particularly, on Sunday, clearing up the mess of

in people’s minds that if you assault somebody who is doing a

Coussins (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 56N. It would
be particularly helpful and appropriate for workers in the licensed
trade. I currently work with producer companies,
but declare an interest as a former chief executive of the Portman
Group, where 
<?notus-xml column=255?>I also worked with licensees in both the on-trade
and the off-trade. I am aware that vulnerability to assault is a live
and worrying issue among this group of people, who have already been
flagged up as a group for concern by the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes.
The public is not generally aware that this is one of
the issues of concern to people in the licensed trade,
because it does not get any attention or media coverage. On the
contrary, coverage about alcohol-related violence and anti-social
behaviour tends to portray licensees as the bad guys for serving
underage customers or drunks, or for provoking violence just by being
there. The truth is that only a very small proportion of licensees are
guilty of such offences as serving underage customers; the vast
majority are scrupulously and professionally operating
responsibility schemes such as proof of age ID to abide by the law and
do the right thing. Yet, all too often, they are the victims of a
backlash by violent customers for doing
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120452000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000149">The
noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, referred to the survey from the Association
of Convenience Stores, which was conducted only in August this
year—so it is very recent and up to date. That survey revealed
that 51% of retailers reported being a victim of verbal or physical
abuse in the previous three months during the course of their work.
When you match that up with the shopworkers’ union survey data,
which suggested that refusing to sell age-restricted goods such as
alcohol is a flashpoint for violence and abuse in 30% of cases, you can
see how important this new measure would be for the licensed trade. Of
course, it is not just a problem for the off-trade; the National
Pubwatch scheme reports that pub licensees and their bar staff, as well
as door staff, face a great deal of hostility when they are just doing
their jobs. Indeed, National Pubwatch recently ran a campaign called
“Court not Caution” to draw attention to the extent to
which assault against their members was often ignored or seen to be
dismissed by the police, who often seem to caution people for really
quite serious
incidents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:39:36"></hs_TimeCode>. This
is leading to an undesirable loss of confidence in the criminal justice
system. In one case a licensee had been smashed in the face with a
glass but the offender was simply cautioned—never mind a
£50 fine. The licensee subsequently suffered mental trauma and
had to leave the trade and her
livelihood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:39:58"></hs_TimeCode>. I

However, I fear the real mischief they and we might seek to address is
not the absence of suitable offences but the absence of action by,
perhaps, police, prosecutors and sentencers. There is a range of
assault offences already on the statute book that is more than adequate
to cover the challenges that noble Lords have raised, such as common
assault, assault occasioning actual bodily harm,
grievous bodily harm and aggravated assault if there is a racial

behind this amendment but it is such a broad category of workers,
across such a huge range of situations. Apart from the important
symbolism of saying, “Here is a new offence”, I fear it
would not add practically to improving the situation overall, and I say
that with hesitation. The example the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, gave of
a licensed worker having their hair pulled out is clearly at least an
assault occasioning actual, if not grievous, bodily harm. If there was
no action, it is a dire condemnation of the police involved in that
particular offence. I am very sympathetic to the motivation but the

travelling to far-flung parts of the United Kingdom and being subjected
to the sort of treatment he described. It is unacceptable. The
situation might be easier if the trains were policed by officers from
the British Transport Police—not armed officers; I spoke about
them a moment ago. Just the presence of British Transport Police on the
trains has a very significant effect. However, the force is not large
enough to be able to police all the trains so there has to be a measure
of self-restraint and adequate penalties for people who behave in an
unacceptable and violent way towards public servants doing their job

Indeed, I would be reluctant to add any new criminal offence to the

matter for sentencing guidelines, which I know are not under the
control of the Government given that we have a Sentencing Council? If
an offence has been committed in this context, a sentence can be

many of these assaults do not seem to be reported where they happen in
the course of people’s employment, which is what we are talking
about. The survey by USDAW, as I think my noble friend Lord Foulkes
mentioned, showed that 17% of retail staff who had suffered a physical
assault at work had not reported it as they believed that nothing would
be done. There is also a feeling among some employees that many cases
which are reported are not prosecuted, even where the assailants are

has been made to the separate offences of assaulting police officers in
the execution of their duty and, in Scotland only, assaulting emergency
service workers. The offence in Scotland in respect of emergency
service workers is defined by the Emergency Workers (Scotland) Act 2005
and is, I think, subject to a maximum of nine months in prison or a
fine of up to £10,000. Prosecutions using that Act have grown
year on year since its introduction. There were 324 prosecutions in
2010-11 and, in total, there have been just over 1,100 prosecutions
since the Act came into force, with the implementation of the Act
raising the profile of assaults on those who provide emergency

evidence indicates that if we had a separate offence in England and
Wales of assaulting public-facing workers—we are talking about
people in contact with the public in the course of their
employment—with tougher penalties than for common assault, that
would increase the likelihood of cases being prosecuted. It would
restore what is clearly waning confidence among many public-facing
workers that the judicial system will protect them, and it would act as
a deterrent, as preliminary evidence from Scotland shows that while the
number of prosecutions for assaulting emergency service workers has
gone up, the number of such incidents has declined. That suggests that
the message may be getting over, but I am afraid that attacking and
assaulting people in the course of their employment when they are
carrying out that role in direct contact with the public just will not
be accepted. There has to be a change in attitude towards assaults of
this kind, and I suggest that that can only properly be reflected in
making clear that the penalties will be higher than they would be for
other kinds of assaults.</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this debate. It is
very interesting that the speeches we have heard have all referred to
behaviour which the earlier parts of the Bill are designed to address.
Often, assaults arise from anti-social behaviour in the first instance.
It has been a very useful debate. The Government cannot support the
noble Lord’s amendment but perhaps I may explain why. It has
been discussed twice in the House of Commons, so it will not come as a
surprise to the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, that I am not in a position
to accept
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:54:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the view of noble Lords that assaults on people whose work brings them
into contact with the public are unacceptable. I assure your Lordships
that the Government take this matter very seriously. The speeches in
this debate reflect our equal concern at the large number of
assaults on people serving the public.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13120452000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000168">The Government entirely
agree that no one should be expected to face violence in the course of
their work, particularly when they are serving the public. We have a
wide range of people on whom we depend to deliver
services—nurses, teachers, police officers and firefighters, to
name a few. Assault is wrong and a crime, whoever the victim. Transport
workers and shop workers also form part of our essential
infrastructure, as do many others whose work brings them into contact
with the public. Staff of small shops may be particularly vulnerable
because they may need to stay open long hours to make a profit and may
operate with minimal staff. The noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, referred
to people who work in the retail drinks industry. It is vital that the
criminal justice system treats violence against these essential members
of society
adequately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:55:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120452000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000169">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:55:41"></hs_TimeCode>,
I do not believe that changes to the law, or a new specific offence,
are necessary to achieve that. The noble Lord, Lord Condon,
articulated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:55:55"></hs_TimeCode> that
view well. I do not consider the proposed changes would mean more
prosecutions or warrant the higher sentences which might follow. For
example, I think that noble Lords would accept that if someone is
assaulted in their own home and must live with the sense of fear and
anxiety that that may cause, that, too, warrants a stiffer sentence.
Nor do we believe that a higher sentence would necessarily have a
deterrent effect. The evidence on that point is decidedly mixed. There
is already a range of offences having general application which
criminalise violent behaviour, and which would already apply in the
context envisaged by this new clause. Further offences would only
complicate the law and make prosecution more complex rather than make
it more straightforward. I reiterate: assault is wrong, whoever the
victim.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120452000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120452000170">All
cases referred to the Crown Prosecution Service by the police are
considered under the Code for Crown Prosecutors. Under the code,
prosecutors must first be satisfied that there is sufficient evidence
to provide a 
<?notus-xml column=260?>realistic prospect of conviction, which I think we all understand. In
every case where there is sufficient evidence to justify a prosecution,
prosecutors must go on to consider whether a prosecution is required in
the public interest, which, again, we would understand. However, the

mention has been made by my noble friend Lady Hamwee of the sentencing
guidelines, which specify that where an assault is committed against
someone providing a service to the public, whether in the public or

has made clear in its guidance that that phrase includes
those who work in shops and the wider retail business sector, which

reflects the concerns of noble Lords on this

major cities and some of the more affluent suburbs. A further report

There has yet to be any significant legal challenge to their

prosecute sellers under consumer protection legislation have failed. To
evade prosecution through the Medicines Act 1968, the legal highs are

56NA is based on the existing Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act
1985, which prevents the sale of glues and butane to minors. That law
has been successful over some years in reducing the number of deaths
from volatile substances. Under the provisions in the amendment, a
court would issue a civil order against a particular shop, listing the
products identified by trading standards officers which appeared to be
psychoactive, synthetic and intoxicating, and prohibiting their supply.
The amendment specifically excludes medicines, alcohol and tobacco. Any

or retailer would be a criminal

The sale of dangerous substances in an everyday retail environment has
the effect of normalising their use. It encourages
experimentation among minors and exposes more vulnerable people to
powerful psychoactive substances. The problem with legal highs is that
people wrongly believe that, because they are legal, they must be safe,
and having the substances so openly available only reinforces that
impression. The reality is that the number of head shops is growing
inexorably and nothing appears to be currently in place to prevent that
continuing —hence the proposed new clause that we are now
debating, which will help to check the substantial increase in the
number of shops selling these substances and help to cease the trade in

commend the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, and the noble Lord, Lord
Rosser, for tabling it. We need government and, indeed, all political
parties to get together to try to create a safer world for our young
people while new psychoactive substances are so readily available to
them. The amendment has merit on two grounds: first, it seeks to remove
these substances from the shop window, as one might put it, which has
to be helpful; and secondly, a feature of the amendment is that it
focuses exclusively on suppliers and does not seek to criminalise the
users of these substances. Those are two important points in favour of
the amendment.</hs_para>

aware of some of the potential problems with the amendment. My only
qualification for speaking today is that I chaired the APPG inquiry
into new psychoactive substances, which received evidence from all the
major governmental and non-governmental organisations involved in this

really understand the implications of policies and perhaps their
ineffectuality. As a result of that work, I have a number of

first is the absence of proportionality or logic in the proposal. We
have to accept, albeit reluctantly, that a sizeable proportion of young
people will use drugs that may harm them. Our aim must surely be to
reduce the incidence of addiction to any dangerous drug and,
in particular, to reduce addiction to the most dangerous drugs, whether
legal or illegal. We also need to reduce as far as possible the risk of
a young person having a single dose of a substance that can cause death
or serious injury.</hs_para>

face reality. We will not stamp out drug use through bans and
punishment. Our only hope is to create a rational system which makes
abundantly clear to our young people those substances that are
seriously dangerous, those that cause medium harm and those with
short-term and relatively mild ill effects. We have not even begun to
go down the road of proportionality in our drugs policy and,
unfortunately, this amendment does not adopt this essential principle.
Some other countries have done so, with impressive results, and even

to a different issue, I find myself in agreement with the Home Office

actually making decisions—if I had my way —on

and quite different concern is that if this amendment were passed it

have those supporting the amendment considered its cost implications?
Trading standards representatives who gave evidence to our APPG on Drug

psychoactive substances are real and perilous. My noble friend Lord
Rosser mentioned the number of recorded deaths. It is simple for an
organic chemist to synthesise a new psychoactive substance to mimic the
effect of a substance that has been banned. We understand that, across
Europe, about 250 new psychoactive substances have been introduced in
recent years. The Angelus Foundation, which originally proposed the new
clause, has counted at least 250 head shops offering to provide such
substances on the shopping streets of this country. There are other
outlets, as has been mentioned, all of which succeed at the moment in
evading existing
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T17:23:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120459000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0001.htm#13120459000004">It
follows that the buyers of those substances have no information about
the composition, toxicity or purity of what they are buying. It is not
only from the head shops that those substances can be obtained.
Increasingly, they are being bought over the internet. Social
networking spreads the news of the arrival of a new substance, and it
is not at all uncommon for party invitations, distributed through
social networking, to contain links to the suppliers of such
substances.</hs_para>

great respect for the Angelus Foundation, and of course for my noble

out of business, but my worry is that it would drive the people who are
purchasing these substances into the arms of nastier
criminals—into the danger and squalor of engaging 
<?notus-xml column=267?>with gang-related street dealers in car parks and alleyways. If they are
not already using the internet, and I suspect that most of
them will be, it will of course drive them into its seductions and
dangers, perhaps particularly those of the dark web. The European
Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction reported in
its 2013 annual statement that it has identified 693 different internet
outlets offering new psychoactive substances for sales. Actually, what
I think will happen is that the internet will drive the head shops out

Angelus Foundation has been candid that its purpose in proposing this
new clause is to ban the sale of new psychoactive substances but all
the evidence from 50 years of prohibition is that banning substances
does not stop trafficking in drugs or people using drugs. In
fact, it drives innovation; as one avenue is closed, another is opened.
Prohibition has been an engine of crime. It has been counterproductive

are also civil liberties implications in this proposed new clause.
Since an earlier version was debated in another place, it has been
revised to require a lower standard of proof. The proposition is now
that if a court is satisfied merely on the balance of probabilities,
and not beyond reasonable doubt, it may make an order against a head
shop listing products which appear to trading standards officers to be
psychoactive and synthetic, and to have been bought for the purpose of
intoxication. If the proprietor is unable to demonstrate that that is
not the case, he will be liable to a prison sentence of six months or a
level 5 fine. It is inconceivable that in this country we should
legislate to imprison people because it appears to an official of the
state that such and such is the case and the accused is unable to
disprove the allegation. We have not seen legislation like this since
the days of the Warsaw Pact in eastern Europe. It would be wrong for us

not know what these new psychoactive substances are, so how would the
court establish the balance of probabilities? Would it be on the basis
of guesswork or on the say-so of a trading standards officer? Justice,
like policy, ought to be based on evidence. One of the great

what should we do? I believe that the most promising approach to this
very serious problem has been developed in New Zealand. In 2011, the
New Zealand Law Commission made recommendations on how to deal with new
psychoactive substances. It took the view that universal prohibition
would be unacceptable on cultural grounds and inconsistent with the
principles of a free society, as well as being impractical. It
recommended that a would-be supplier of a new psychoactive substance
should have the opportunity, paying for scientific research, to show
that the substance would be of limited harm and to seek the approval of
a regulatory body to introduce it to the

2012, the New Zealand Health Minister, Peter Dunne, accepted the

driven to conclude that the way to protect our young people and our
society as a whole from the dangers of new psychoactive substances is
to legalise and regulate them: not the most dangerous of them, but a
range of them. This is less dangerous than persisting with a policy of
prohibition. The reality is that people are going to get hold of these
substances; young people will always experiment, always take risks and
always challenge authority. These drugs are dangerous, and it is for
that very reason that they ought to be regulated. If a
limited range of psychoactive substances—the safer
ones—were legally available, with their purity controlled and
with trustworthy advice as to their usage, people would be less
attracted to taking risks with harder drugs or with unknown, new
psychoactive substances. There would be less incentive for producers

the education department seems to be so largely disengaged from the
whole issue of drugs. It lays minimal obligations on schools in respect
of drugs education. It shrugs its institutional shoulders in saying
that it does not monitor the programmes or resources used by schools in
drugs education. We need to do very much better in schools, but the
reality is that people who want to understand these drugs will go to
websites such as the excellent one created by the Angelus Foundation,
whynotfindout.org, or others created by people who are experienced in
this field and want to protect people from the harms that drugs may

Paddick (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, to explain the background to the
comments that I am about to make, as most noble Lords will know I was a
police officer for over 30 years and have seen things from the
enforcement side. However, a few months ago a former partner of mine in
his early 40s, to whom I was still very close, took an overdose of an
illegal drug and died. Hopefully, noble Lords will realise that I am
not biased one way or the other on this issue, bearing in mind recent

noble Lord, Lord Rosser. However, I have to agree with the noble Lord,
Lord Howarth of Newport, the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, and my noble
friend Lady Hamwee that this is not the way to reduce harm. My
professional experience has taught me that young people in
particular—though, as I say, my former partner was not
particularly young, but then everything is relative—take no
account of whether or not a drug is illegal, particularly bearing in
mind the discredit that has been cast on the system of drug
classification, where very harmful drugs are in a lower category and
far less harmful drugs are in a higher one. They certainly do not pay
any attention to what class any illegal drug might be. As far as I see
it, the evidence that cannabis use has been reducing, for example, is
the result of information in the media about potential harmful medical
effects of cannabis. That is what has really had an effect on
people’s attitude towards that drug, not whether or not it is
illegal or indeed what class of illegality it is

is a very difficult issue to deal with. As we know, particularly with
regard to legislating, all that the manufacturers do is slightly alter
the compound whenever a drug is made illegal, as previous speakers have
said. Clearly we need to allow our young people to know exactly what
the effects of these sorts of substances are and try to persuade them
not to take them, bearing in mind that most young people pay no
attention to whether or not they are illegal. We should therefore put

to the successful prosecution of a legal high supplier. It is also
similar to the legislative proposals adopted in Ireland and Poland.
Similar new clauses were tabled by the Opposition in the House of
Commons and Jeremy Browne, who was then the Minister responsible for
drugs policy, set out the Government’s approach to new
psychoactive substances. He also referred to the Home Office’s

schools provide drug education only once a year or less. As far as the
national curriculum goes, they are required to provide some sort of
drug education within the science curriculum, but that is just about
it. PHSE has only a toehold in school education. This is not the right
way to help young people develop the resilience and capacity to take

I assure him that communication across government on this is very
vigorous. I am sure he will agree that schools are not the only place
where you can communicate with young people. We live in an age where
there may be other less formal ways of conveying this message. I think
the Government are right to see issues such as this also in those
terms. I hope he will understand that our strategy is multifaceted; it
is not just the single point that he made. The legal high trade is very
resilient. It is inventive. There is no silver bullet for dealing with

psychoactive substances and to learn from other countries in that
regard—the noble Lord referred to New Zealand, for
example—and that is what we are doing. However, even though this
area is a cause for concern, caution needs to be exercised before we
take any further steps. The possible unintended consequences need to be
fully understood. That is why I think that the speeches of my noble

Thornton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords,
Amendment 56NC, in the names of my noble friends, makes
tobacco proxy purchasing an offence, punishable by a maximum
£5,000 fine—the same penalty as for alcohol. It is
illegal across the UK to sell tobacco products to anyone
under the age of 18. However, it is not an offence for someone to buy
tobacco products on behalf of a minor. We believe that that is a
significant loophole in our system. Proxy purchasing of alcohol is
already illegal across the UK, but that is not the case with tobacco
products. That is why we want this to be remedied. Getting someone else
to buy on their behalf is one of the chief ways in which young people
access tobacco products. Trading Standards has estimated that nearly
half, or 46% of underage smokers, regularly get their tobacco from a
proxy purchaser. Given the Government’s latest extremely welcome
U-turn on plain packaging, I should have thought that the Minister, on
behalf of the Government, would be seeking to deal with this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T18:00:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T18:00:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120470000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000082">6

Northern Ireland Executive are currently supporting an amendment that
would ban it there, too. This would leave England and Wales as the only
places in the UK where it is still legal. A law to ban proxy purchasing

in my intervention at this stage to support my noble friend’s
amendment. However, my support comes with a heavy health warning about
effective surveillance and enforcement. As president of the Trading
Standards Institute, I am aware of this significant problem. As so many
thousands of young 
<?notus-xml column=276?>people experience their first steps down the road to smoking addiction,
as my noble friend said, it is through that means that that addiction

move to tackle proxy sales of tobacco would get the full support of the
trading standards profession, but proper enforcement and adequate
surveillance is a great concern to it. A recent study of proxy sales of
tobacco found that there was a strong desire from business
representatives—and my noble friend referred to this—to
see legislation implemented. The Robinson and Amos study of 2010 of
young people’s sources of cigarettes and attempts to circumvent
underage sales laws concluded that, while there was indeed a problem,
more detailed research was needed before further action was taken. It
was suggested that regular national smoking surveys should include
questions that could capture more accurately the nature and extent of
proxy purchases. I feel that this is somewhat cautious, given what we
know from a number of surveys about the danger that young people are
placed in by this activity. However, I would appreciate the
Minister’s views on the suggestion of a more consistent way in
which to survey the

the Demos think tank report that was out last week, called <I>Sobering
Up</I>, studied the very real issue of underage access to alcohol and
street drinking, and involved working with Kent trading standards
officers, the read-across to tobacco is obvious. Even with legislation,
enforcement is the key. The report recommended tackling the growing
problem of proxy purchasing through greater community policing of the
offence and tougher punishments for those caught. Of course, we are
aware that there is an offence of proxy sales of tobacco in Scotland,
with fixed penalty notices for both the purchase of tobacco by a young
person under the age of 18 years and, separately, for the proxy
purchase of tobacco on behalf of a person under 18 years. In Scotland,
from April 2011, for the purchase of tobacco by a person under 18, the
fixed penalty is £50 and the penalty on prosecution is up to a
£200 fine. Also from April 2011, proxy purchases carry a fixed

research have the Government carried out into the effect of this new

us have anecdotal evidence, we are now two years down the road from the
introduction of this Scottish legislation, and I think that noble Lords
who want to support this amendment would agree that government has the
provision and means to come up with far more structured evidence. I
know that the Scottish legislation is still embedding itself; the
Scottish Government’s request is for a softly-softly approach to
be taken, especially with the introduction at the same time of the
display and vending machines ban this year. But the aim, certainly, of
trading standards in Scotland is to work in partnership with retailers
to increase compliance with the new law. I am grateful to Veronica

enforcement is extremely challenging given the massive reductions in
staff and budgetary allocations that trading standards departments have
faced in the past three years up and down the country. We have heard

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank both noble
Baronesses who have spoken on this issue. I was slightly surprised to
see this amendment as it is something that perhaps has been, and no
doubt will be, considered in debates on the Children and Families Bill.
There was also last Thursday’s Urgent Question, but that was
more specific on the issue of standardised tobacco packaging, which I

and in the wider House can all agree that it is wrong for people to buy
tobacco on behalf of children and young people; that was a point well
made by the noble Baroness, Lady Thornton. We totally acknowledge that
smoking is an addiction which unfortunately begins largely in childhood
and adolescence, with peer pressure, friends or whatever encouraging
people to take it up. Almost two-thirds of current and ex-smokers in
England say that they started smoking regularly before the age of
18.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120470000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000013">Part of
our comprehensive tobacco control plan for England, which was published
in 2011, was therefore focused on reducing the numbers of young people
taking up smoking. The plan also includes a national ambition to reduce
smoking among young people in England to less than 12% by 2015. As a
result of decades of tobacco control, rates of smoking among young
people have reduced considerably to around 10%, according to the most
recent figures. I am sure that we have all noticed the practice of
reducing smoking and prohibiting it in places such as restaurants. 
<?notus-xml column=278?>I remember as a child seeing smoking on trains and
undergrounds, which we would be appalled by in this modern age.

the take-up of smoking by young people continues to be a problem. It is
estimated that more than 300,000 young people under the age of 16 in
England try smoking for the first time each year. Reducing access to
tobacco by children and young people remains a high priority for the
Government and we are determined to reduce further the smoking rates
among young people.</hs_para>

tobacco, we know that the majority of retailers are law-abiding and
conscientious in how they conduct their sales. I acknowledge the
important role they play in ensuring that legitimate tobacco products
are sold in accordance with the law, including by being rigorous in
refusing sales to young people under the age of 18. I realise that this
can be difficult and I understand why some noble Lords and some
retailers feel that it should be an offence to buy tobacco on behalf of
under-18s. However, as the noble Baroness, Lady Crawley, said, we need
to consider carefully whether creating a new offence of proxy
purchasing is the right way forward at this time.</hs_para>

to children and young people is not a straightforward issue. A new
offence of proxy purchasing would not necessarily tackle the wider
problem of the supply of cigarettes because children and young people
get them from a range of sources, not just from retailers. For example,
many children and young people who smoke obtain their cigarettes from
their parents or other members of the family—it is tragic but it
does happen—or from friends or people they may socialise with
who are over the age of 18. Buying single cigarettes in the school
playground happens in certain parts of the country. A proxy purchasing
offence would do nothing to stop these
issues.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120470000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000083">6.15

need to look at the practicalities of enforcing a proxy purchasing
offence. Enforcement of most tobacco control legislation, including the
current law on the age of sale, is—as the noble Baroness, Lady
Crawley, pointed out—the responsibility of local authority
trading standards officers. On the previous amendment my noble friend
Lady Hamwee asked whether the Government have been speaking to the
Trading Standards Institute. The Trading Standards Institute is broadly
supportive of any measures to limit access to tobacco by young people.
However, it has also told us that the experience of enforcing the proxy
purchasing offence for alcohol suggests that it would be difficult for
a similar offence for tobacco to be applied effectively. Enforcement
would be resource-intensive for local authorities, particularly because
of the burden of proof that would be required for a successful
prosecution.</hs_para>

considerable pressures on local authority trading standards officers
and it can be difficult to prove the offence of proxy purchasing.
Effective enforcement requires surveillance of shopper and retailer
behaviour and is time-consuming. However, when this issue was debated
recently in the other place, my colleague the Minister for Public
Health, Jane Ellison, said—and I repeat that
offer—that she would be happy 
<?notus-xml column=279?>to hear the views, as she said, of Members, and I am
sure of all noble Lords, about the local authorities they are dealing

Lords that the Government are not complacent about smoking by young
people. I will give some examples of the actions we are taking. Since
April 2012, supermarkets can no longer have permanently open displays
of tobacco products; and in April 2015 this will apply in all shops and
anywhere else selling tobacco to the public. Tobacco can no longer be
sold from vending machines in England. This has removed an easily
accessible source of underage sales. It was estimated that in England
about 35 million cigarettes were being sold to people under the age of
18 every year from vending machines. We also continue to run
hard-hitting marketing campaigns, including Stoptober. In June and July
2013, we ran a television-led marketing campaign to encourage smokers
to protect their families, particularly their children, from
second-hand smoke by not smoking in the home or family car.
Since January, we have distributed more than half a million
Quit Kits—our local stop smoking services are among the best in
the world. Smokers trying to quit do better if they use these kits. To
discourage smoking, we have some of the highest priced
tobacco in Europe and will carry on reviewing our tax policy in this
regard. Of course, we fully support the smoke-free legislation passed
in the Health Act 2006, which is proving to be both popular and
effective in reducing smoking-related
illnesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120470000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000020">The
noble Baronesses, Lady Thornton and Lady Crawley, both referred to
Scotland. A proxy purchasing offence has been in place there since
2011. I assure noble Lords that we are keeping a close eye on how this
is being implemented. It is one of a number of changes made as Scotland
brought in its registration scheme for tobacco retailers. The Scottish
Government, who we have talked to about this issue, say they do not
currently hold any information about the numbers of convictions or, as
yet, any evaluation of the effectiveness of the new offences. As I
said, however, this is an open and live dialogue. The noble Baroness,
Lady Crawley, also talked about resources. She is right to raise this
issue, but it is very much a matter for local authorities to decide
what resources they wish to put into enforcing trading

while the Government want to take all appropriate action to ensure that
cigarettes do not reach those under the age of 18, we remain to be
convinced that a new offence of proxy purchasing is, in itself, the
answer to stopping smoking by children and young people. This issue is
driven primarily by the effectiveness of enforcement. Having
illustrated some of the initiatives we are taking, and restated that we
wish to hear about the experiences and ideas on how this matter can be

am aware of the budgetary challenges faced by local authorities,
irrespective of which Administration is in control centrally, and they
need to establish priorities. The noble Baroness made an important
point about enforcement. If this were to be made an offence, we would
need to consider how it would be enforced. Even if a local authority
took it upon itself to increase its number of trading standards
officers to enforce this measure, it would be very difficult to do so
given all the retail outlets that would need to be monitored. It is
important to see what happens in other parts of the country,
particularly in Scotland. We have an open door on this issue. If local

Thornton:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his reply and I
particularly thank my noble friend Lady Crawley for her contribution.
As the Minister is a fairly recent newcomer to tobacco issues and I am
not, I gently say to him that all the initiatives he mentioned were
introduced by the previous Labour Government in the teeth of great
opposition from the Benches opposite, if not from those to the left. We
are pleased that those initiatives are being carried through, including
the introduction of plain packaging—there is absolutely no doubt
about that at all. However, the arguments that the Minister has
deployed on proxy purchasing are the same ones that the Conservatives
have deployed in all the discussions we have had about tobacco
regulation over the many years that I have dealt with the issue. It was
argued that because one initiative would not solve the whole problem it
should not be introduced. We know that making it an offence to proxy
purchase tobacco products on behalf of children is not the complete
answer—of course it is not—just as we know that plain
packaging is not the complete answer, and just as we know that covering
up tobacco products in supermarkets is not the complete answer. We know
that the provision we are discussing is not the complete answer.
However, that does not mean that it is not important to consider
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T18:24:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120470000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000025">I
am pleased that the Minister said that the door was open on this issue.
Perhaps I may push at that door a little and say that if this amendment
is not acceptable to the Government, perhaps they need to consider
taking a power to introduce an offence of proxy purchasing at the next
stage of the Bill, which can then be implemented in due course. That
might resolve this problem. I hope the Government will think about that
between now and the next stage of the Bill. I beg leave to withdraw the

ability of the police to fight crime depends, for the most part, on the
skills and abilities of the brave men and women who serve as police
officers and police staff. As I glance around the House, I
note several noble Lords who can speak with great experience and
expertise of that area. The threats police officers and police staff
must deal with on a daily basis are significant. Neither the Government
nor the police can afford to neglect training and development. To do so
jeopardises the safety of all our
communities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120470000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000028">The
arrangements this Government inherited were insufficient. Although the
National Police Improvement Agency had responsibility for police
training, its remit was too broad and its work too complex for it to
deliver effectively for the police and the public. Given the severity
of the threat the police and public face, the Government believe that a
more focused set of arrangements are required. Part of those
requirements involves the creation of the professional body for the
police—the College of
Policing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120470000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000029">The
College of Policing’s mission will be to support the fight
against crime and protect the public by ensuring professionalism at all
levels in policing. It will do this through delivery in five core areas
of responsibility. Those areas include: setting standards of
professional practice; accrediting training providers and setting
learning and development outcomes; identifying, developing and
promoting good practice based on evidence; supporting police forces and
other organisations to work together to protect the public and prevent
crime; and identifying, developing and promoting ethics, values and
standards of
integrity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120470000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000030">The
Government intend that the creation of the college should cement the
status of the police as a profession. As a profession, the police will
need to take greater responsibility for setting standards.
Too often, those standards have been led by government. Clause 110
changes this balance. The clause provides that in future regulations
regarding rank, qualifications for appointment and promotion, service
on probation and personal records for police officers and special
constables will be prepared by the college. The college will also
prepare regulations relating to training for police officers and
qualifications for deployment to particular roles. Finally, if the

reason be wrong. This final power of veto may be used where the
regulations as drafted are flawed, insufficiently clear or do not

inspectors. As with the provisions relating to the standards that the
college will set, this provision will continue to remain in place even
if the college succeeds in its aim of gaining a royal charter. This
amendment would ensure that there was proper ministerial and
parliamentary oversight of the college’s charging framework. It
would also ensure that the college was able to develop commercially so
that it could thrive as the independent professional body for the
police.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120470000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120470000040">For

During debate on an earlier amendment, the noble Baroness referred to
the fact that she has been in your Lordships’ House far longer
than I have, and I am sure she can relate to the fact that no
regulations have been made in relation to training since Section 97 of
the 2001 Act came into force and that the existing regulations under

administrative matters are more akin to regulations on pay and

receive an enhanced level of parliamentary scrutiny, when regulations
made under the same powers on matters of at least equal significance,
such as police pay, do not. The negative procedure has

maintain those uniform arrangements going forward. That does not of
course mean that we cannot rule out the possibility that the
regulations might need to be made quickly. Therefore, the affirmative
resolution procedure would make that more difficult. Typically, that
would occur in response to some unforeseen emergency, a change to our

Ahmad of Wimbledon</B><B>:</B></Member> I take it that my noble
friend’s comments primarily were probing. Clause 115 provides
the basis of information-sharing agreements between individuals and the
College of Policing. In order for the college to fulfil its objectives
it will need, from time to time, to have access to certain information.
This information could cover a range of issues, including information
about data in support of its work on the effectiveness of policing
practice, data to inform the standards it sets for police officers and
staff, and information that will help it produce the standards of
ethics and values for the police. For example, as part of the
college’s work to develop standards and ethics for the police,
it may need information from the IPCC about its investigations and some
of the lessons it has learned from the conduct of police officers. This
information will be general and it should not be necessary for the IPCC
to share information that would enable the college or its staff to
identify individual police officers. I hope that noble Lords agree that
it is important for the IPCC and other public authorities to have a
clear legal power to share this valuable information with the
college<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T18:46:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lords will be aware that public authorities can act only within the
scope of the powers given to them by legislation. It is therefore
necessary for them to have clear statutory powers to share information.
This clause will ensure that every organisation that would not
otherwise have the power to disclose information to the college has a
power to do so. However, it does not absolve those organisations, or
the college, from their legal duties in relation to the sharing of
information, which was a particular issue that I raised
vis-à-vis the Data Protection Act. The Data Protection Act
provisions on the processing of personal data, the right to privacy
under the European Convention on Human Rights and the common-law duty
of confidentiality are not affected by this clause.</hs_para>

enabling power ensures that organisations which may wish to share
information with the college are able to do so. We have not specified
those organisations 
<?notus-xml column=287?>or the information that they may need to share in
the Bill. We want the college, working together with the police, to
determine how it can best deliver its objectives. That should include
allowing it the freedom to identify the organisations with which it
will work and how it wants those organisations to support its delivery.
This clause will enable the college to do so successfully. In that
explanation, I hope that I have addressed the questions raised by my
noble friend and, if she is satisfied, that noble Lords will agree that
the clause stands part of the

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for
the opportunity to address this important safety mechanism in the
functioning of the Police Remuneration Review Body. The provisions that
my noble friend’s amendment would delete from the Bill are
intended to be used in only two instances. The first is if a matter is
so urgent there is not enough time for the Secretary of State or the
Northern Ireland Minister of Justice to consult the review body, which
is of course not in constant session. To illustrate that,
the Government have in mind a time of national emergency—for
instance, ongoing, widespread rioting, or co-ordinated terrorist
attacks across the country, or even, because we must always plan for
every eventuality, at a time of war. There might be, for example, an
alternative process for arranging officers’ shift patterns, or
officers might be called to take on special duties that we could not
foresee but which might be critical to the national response to an
emergency, and for which we would want them, rightly, to be
compensated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120475000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120475000004">Secondly,
the provisions that my noble friend has drawn to our
attention are intended to be used in situations where it would be
unnecessary to consult the review body on a matter. For example, if a
minor drafting error in the regulations needed to be
corrected it would be inefficient and unnecessary to have to
consult the Police Remuneration Review Body before correcting the
error. Similarly, if there was an uncontroversial change to employment
law that did not automatically apply to police officers by virtue of
their unique employment status, of which noble Lords will be
aware, we would want to amend regulations to reflect this change in the
law without reference to the review
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120475000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120475000005">We added
this power specifically in response to comments by policing partners,
including the Police Federation and the Police Superintendents’
Association, that they would be concerned that not being able to make
police regulations without reference to the body, in certain
circumstances, could actually make the system more cumbersome. We
believe that this provision addresses that concern.</hs_para>

should conclude my comments on this proposed amendment by noting that
in all cases, regardless of whether the review body is consulted or
not, a draft of the proposed changes must be supplied to all interested
parties before any changes are made, and this includes the opportunity
for interested parties to make any representations. Therefore, neither
the Secretary of State nor the Northern Ireland Minister of Justice
would ever make changes to police officer remuneration in a vacuum, and
would always have the input of representatives of police officers and
those responsible for maintaining police forces. I hope in the light of

the event of a national emergency—I believe that
“national emergency” is being used in a rather

needed for the circumstances referred to by my noble friend. That is no

56QZF addresses the problem of the number of IPCC investigators who are
former or seconded police officers. This practice leaves the IPCC open
to the charge that, even for the most serious complaints, it is
actually the police investigating the police. The amendment would limit
to just 25% the proportion of IPCC investigators who come from a police
background. It would also prohibit the appointment of any former police
officer to the important post of director of investigations of the
IPCC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:00:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

annual report for 2011/12 reported that all of its senior
investigators, plus half of its deputy senior investigators
and one-third of its investigators, are former police officers or
police civilians. For the investigation staff as a whole, the
proportion coming from a police background was reported to be 43%.
Furthermore, the IPCC’s current director of investigations is a
former Metropolitan Police commander. This is a very significant post
which requires absolute independence. I acknowledge that these former
police officers bring valuable experience and skills to the job but,
unfortunately, they also compromise the IPCC’s

that are to be given to the IPCC should enable the recruitment of new
investigators from different disciplines outside policing. While the
IPCC might need the skills of former police officers in the short term,
the need to employ them should be greatly reduced in the

one-quarter of IPCC investigating staff should have a police background
and that it should be led by a director of investigations who does not
have such a background. The amendment sets a deadline of 1 January

56QZG is intended to maintain the drive for independence in the IPCC by
improving its reporting requirements. The Police Reform Act 2002
already requires the IPCC to make an annual report to the Home
Secretary on the carrying out of its functions during the year. The
amendment would require the IPCC to also report to Parliament on moves
to strengthen its independence. This would include the volume of
independent investigations carried out, the number of investigators
employed who have not served in the police, any other work to
strengthen the IPCC’s 
<?notus-xml column=291?>independence and any changes to its responsibilities

to transfer officers from police forces into the IPCC but to give them

strongly for a fully independent and well resourced police
investigation process. I have maintained that position since my

particular, is too prescriptive in the timescale available and that the
notion of having 75% of investigators with a non-police background by
January 2017 might, perversely, have the reverse effect of its
intention. If it is a prescriptive requirement to get to that point, it
may be tempting to employ people as investigators who are not
adequately trained or have the right background to investigate these
most serious and complex allegations. While admiring the intentions
behind these amendments, I have concerns about the practicality of the

noble Lords in support of my noble friend Lady Doocey and the noble
Lord, Lord Harris, of Haringey. As I said earlier, 30 years’
experience in the Metropolitan Police left me wondering whether the
Independent Police Complaints Commission was truly independent. We have
seen recent cases where the IPCC has not only apparently not been
particularly independent but has not understood when a case is serious.
It was only after officers had given evidence to the Home Affairs
Select Committee about the meeting between the former Chief Whip and
Police Federation officers that the IPCC decided that the case was
serious enough to take on as an independent investigation rather than
referring it back to the police to investigate
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:11:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120487000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120487000013">Another

has been made on all sides of the Committee for reinforcing the
IPCC’s degree of independence is extremely important, not just
for the reputation of the IPCC itself but for the overall reputation of
the whole police service, which, as we all know today, is questionable.
It is sad to say but, for those of us who rate the police service very
highly and have a great respect for it, its reputation for integrity is
not as great as we would like it to be. There would be support from
within the service for a greater sense of independence between the IPCC

my comments to those of my noble friends Lord Condon and Lord Blair and
the noble Lord, Lord Paddick. Obviously, the Independent Police
Complaints Commission should be independent, and noble Lords may be
aware of the views of the commission that I chaired recently on the
combination of the inspectorate and the Independent Police Complaints
Commission itself. Putting that aside, it was fascinating to take
evidence from the head of the IPCC, Anne Owers, and to see her recently
for a couple of hours to talk about issues and realise how
underresourced she is. Credit must be given to the Government that they
have recognised
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120487000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120487000021">Along<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:19:53"></hs_TimeCode>
with my noble friends Lord Condon and Lord Blair, and my old colleague,
the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, I just call for a little caution. Having
led inquiries in difficult places such as Northern Ireland for 15 to 20
years, I know that you need the experience and the expertise. The noble
Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, is absolutely right that the IPCC has to
be seen to be independent, but let us gradually work towards that. To
train people up to the required level takes an awful lot of experience.
In addition, this is not just about training but about having your feet
on the ground, understanding how the systems work, building up a team
and delivering something that is useful to the police service and, more
importantly, to the complainant. Noble Lords should make no mistake
about it: the IPCC needs support, needs resources and needs reforming.
It has a massive job to do and I would not like to see it have the rug
drawn from underneath its feet in terms of experience and
delivery.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_04_PT_1/C951CC30F85A4B3FC7D26A9D8507872FC72A4659" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 December 2013">Wednesday,

the IPCC to carry out “the majority of investigations”,
the amendment does not specify the nature of those investigations. My
noble friend Lady Doocey talked about serious investigations and that

some complaints made against the police are best dealt with at local
level. We will still have the police investigating the police at a
local level; for example, where it is a matter of service levels or a
lack of civility. But I think we can all see that with the more serious
investigations the IPCC must independently be in a position to
investigate those matters.</hs_para>

office of constable in the United Kingdom would seem to provide a
stronger guarantee of independence. However, I question how the

dismiss someone who currently performs this function effectively and

most important is the way in which all IPCC staff work and their
commitment to the values and culture of the organisation. I am sure

to Amendment 56QZG, I can see that for the Home Secretary to receive
annual figures on the proportion of staff from non-police backgrounds,
and the number and nature of their investigations, would provide a
degree of detail and certainty as to operational conditions within the
IPCC. However, the commission already has a statutory duty to report to
the Home Secretary on the carrying out of its functions each year. It
already publishes details of the organisation and its investigations in
its annual report and in annual statistics. I can see no benefit from
prescribing the content of the annual reports in the way that the

Lords contributing to this debate on a subject which is of the utmost

deep concern originated when I was working as a nurse, implementing an
immunisation programme in a remote desert area in Sudan in the 1980s. I
will never forget my horror when I first saw FGM—the extent of
mutilation and the unbelievable legacy of the remaining tiny aperture
with complications of utmost severity for micturition, menstruation,
sexual intercourse, risks of haemorrhage, increased risks to mother and
baby during childbirth, depression, post-traumatic stress and other
mental health problems. I will never forget the screams of young girls
in the village when they were taken into the bush at night to undergo
the excruciating cutting, often with a rusty knife or broken glass,
with thorns for
sutures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120487000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120487000044">Together

was profoundly shocked to learn that FGM has continued unabated, with
an estimated 100 million to 140 million girls and women

currently at risk of undergoing FGM each year in

requires early identification of baby girls, especially those born to
mothers who have undergone FGM, as high-risk cases; their referral by
health professionals as a child-safeguarding obligation to social care;
and a follow-up plan to include education, counselling and support for
parents. Sadly, the joined-up work needed to track such girls at risk
is not happening. Except for emergency one-off cases where a girl is
identified as being at risk of imminent FGM, referrals to social
services are often dropped as they are deemed not to meet the threshold
for assessment, and a care plan is not put into place.</hs_para>

the education system. Most FGM occurs during a girl’s time at
primary school. Teachers are expected to play a key role in protecting
children from abuse, as they are able to detect warning signs and
pupils may turn to them before contacting the police or social
services. But in a recent YouGov survey for the NSPCC, 83% of the 1,000
teachers surveyed said they had not been given any training about FGM.
Education about FGM should also be a compulsory element of personal,
social, health and economic education, starting with primary-age
children, because girls at risk need to be aware of the danger before
they reach the most vulnerable age, which is between eight and 14 years
old, to enable them to seek help, protection and prevention. FGM is a
form of brutal child abuse and a crime, but the police cannot build a
case for prosecution if they are not informed and there is currently
widespread failure to refer.</hs_para>

crucial issue of support for survivors. As the number of people from
countries where FGM is practised increases in the UK, there is an
urgent need for policies to ensure access to support services and
referral protocols between health, social care and other key services.
This requires mandatory training and reporting requirements as well as
a fundamental change of attitudes towards so-called cultural
sensitivity and multiculturalism. There are far too many deeply
disturbing cases where victims who have looked for help have been
refused protection and support because of respect for local cultural
traditions. We surely should never have allowed tenets of
multiculturalism to take precedence over the law of the land,
especially when the cultural practices being condoned are manifestly
forms of torture, permanent injury and child abuse. We must move beyond
this distorted priority and reassert the fundamental principle that
culture cannot take precedence over the law of our land.</hs_para>

FGM have not been referred to social services or the police for
follow-up action. I also asked what Her Majesty’s Government are
doing to ensure that robust information-sharing protocols are developed
between health, social care and education agencies and the police so
that appropriate actions can be taken to support victims and
bring perpetrators to account. The Minister responded that on
Monday—I believe it was Monday this week—the
Health Minister, Jane Ellison, would be meeting healthcare

Hodgson of Abinger (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the
noble Baroness on having introduced this debate on FGM because this is
a taboo subject, especially in the countries where it is practised. We
have already heard about the terrible impacts of FGM and how widespread
the practice is. It is truly shocking that still today in Djibouti,
Egypt, Guinea, Somalia, Sudan and Sierra Leone, more than 90% of women
have been through some form of FGM. Many countries already have laws
prohibiting FGM; it is a criminal offence in 15 of the 28 African
states where FGM is prevalent, although there are few prosecutions. But
where it is deeply embedded in the culture, laws alone have proved
insufficient to stop it.</hs_para>

ending FGM, through both teaching girls their rights and educating the
general communities about the dangers of this abhorrent practice. 
<?notus-xml column=301?>I would like to give two short examples. First,
three years ago I visited a women’s group in Abou Mosalem, just
outside Cairo, where we talked about FGM. These women explained that
they were worried that if their daughters were not done, they might be
rejected by their husbands on their wedding night. Then they
would be returned and would for ever be an unmarriageable burden on
their families, who could not afford to feed them. Some of these women
had attended an informative meeting on FGM and changed their minds. It
had made some of them decide not to have their daughters
circumcised.</hs_para>

I visited Komarbai village in Sierra Leone to see a project that was
being run with the whole community by Plan UK. In Sierra Leone, it is
often the father who will decide when a girl needs to undergo
initiation. In many of their communities, it is a big disgrace for a
girl to have sex without having gone through the initiation. Sometimes,
families will even demand that a girl is circumcised to marry into
their family. Through role-play at this village meeting, it was shown
that the process not only could be lethal for girls but was illegal.
When questioned afterwards, the chief and elders said that they were
now not so sure it was a good idea.</hs_para>

countries, the custom of FGM is deeply rooted but these visits show
that it is possible to shift that culture. However, it will take time
and needs a combination of the right laws and sensitive community
education, which I hope that DfID will support, because to truly cease
this practice, the communities themselves must embrace change and not
just have it foisted on them from the global

Rendell of Babergh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, female genital
mutilation has been perpetrated on girls since ancient times. The first
known instance of it was seen on an Egyptian mummy dating from 200 BC.
The UN has recognised FGM as torture and in calling for its elimination
describes it as cruel, inhumane and degrading to women. The first law
criminalising FGM in the United Kingdom was passed in 1985, the second
18 years later. However, there have been no prosecutions to date, while
prosecutions in France, for instance, are numerous. Since the passing
of a law against FGM in Kuria East, in central Africa, eight people are
awaiting prosecution and two are serving three years’
imprisonment for employing a circumciser to mutilate their 13 year-old
daughter.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13120491000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120491000003">A
key barrier to FGM prevention, according to the recently published
joint statement by the Intercollegiate Group, <I>T</I><I>ackling FGM in
the UK</I>, is the failure of professionals to respond when presented
with a child who may be at risk of FGM. Such children include a girl
born to a woman who has undergone FGM and any female child whose elder
sister has undergone FGM; she must be considered as at immediate risk.
Girls living in the woman’s or child’s household should
also be considered at risk. FGM is child abuse. It causes pain,
haemorrhage, difficulty in urinating, complications in menstruation,
considerable problems in sexual intercourse and childbirth, and can
bring about fistula and, sometimes, death. We have a large number of
child protection systems in the UK, particularly 
<?notus-xml column=302?>focused on FGM, but the systematic screening of girls through annual
physical examinations, as is carried out in France, is seen here as too
intrusive. Does the Minister agree with the findings of the joint
statement that where there is a suspicion that a girl has undergone
FGM, assessments and medicals are helpful and examinations should not
be seen as abusive? Is she aware that, as part of a whole health
assessment, the standing committee of the Royal College of Paediatrics
and Child Health, children and their parents do not find such
examinations

the associations and groups that make assessments of numbers come up

underestimate. Knowing who and how many have suffered this abuse,
however, is only half the battle. School teachers, GPs, midwives and

leaders within communities on one side. Therefore, will the Minister

communities here, we are targeting religious leaders—and, in
particular, men who have influence in forming opinion in communities
within which this practice
occurs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>? If we do

passion. I thank my noble friend Lady Cox for securing this debate
today. She is quite right to focus on the key issue: what are we doing,
apart from legislation, to stop this horrible, horrific procedure being
carried out in the United Kingdom? Through the work I do with a
charity, mostly in Africa, I have seen the results in many of these
women. I work with a charity that trains doctors and nurses in Africa
to help women who have obstetric fistula. There are 2 million such
women. FGM contributes to these women having difficulty in labour and
the resulting fistulas. It also contributes to them having a higher
incidence of postpartum haemorrhage and to them dying because of it.
FGM, therefore, does not just cause horrific suffering: it causes
death<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

legislation, or are they ignorant of it, or both? The fact that there
have been no prosecutions must make them feel safe. I know that my own

passionately about this—will indicate some new policy measures
from the Government to help stop this. Everybody who has spoken and
will speak today, and others who have spoken previously in recent weeks

Parekh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a privilege to follow my
noble friend Lord Patel. I begin by congratulating the noble Baroness,
Lady Cox, on securing this debate. In the three minutes that I have at
my disposal, I want to make five very quick points. First, I think that
prosecution has to be far more vigorous than it has been. In order that
that can happen, we 
<?notus-xml column=304?>need to do two things: medical professionals and care workers ought to
be more forthcoming in providing evidence; and the Crown Prosecution
Service should restructure its criteria of proof and
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:57:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

only limited resources and energy, we should concentrate on those
groups where this is far more prevalent, rather than talk about all
ethnic minorities or all Muslims or whatever. For example, in Somalia,
it is 98% prevalent; among the Egyptians, it is about 91%; it is 74%
among Ethiopians; but when you come to Ghana or Uganda, it is barely
1%. It is important to select groups and concentrate on
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:57:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120491000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120491000015">Thirdly,
we should be increasing awareness of the consequences of female genital
mutilation, not that women do not know. After all, many of those who
perpetrate this have already suffered: they know the consequences. I
have in mind the young girls within the family—trying to educate
them on what this involves, and getting them to put pressure on their
own parents and peers and others within their own communities. In
dealing with many ugly practices, getting young people to organise and
mobilise in this way is generally very
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:58:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120491000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120491000016">Fourthly,
we must find some way of de-legitimising this practice in the eyes of
those who engage in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:58:33"></hs_TimeCode>. They engage
in it not because they want to harm their children; they know it is
bad. They do it not just under social pressure—they do it
because they think they are doing what is right. They think it is right
because they think that it disciplines them in sexuality and so on. We
need to involve religious leaders and cultural leaders, and get them to
convince the people involved that this is not the way that the practice
can ever be justified. Here it is important to talk in idioms that
people can understand, rather than talk about human rights and why
women are being deprived of sexual pleasure. That is not the language
in which you can communicate with people who do not place much value
either on human rights or on sexual pleasure. One has to talk in terms
of idioms and arguments which make sense to these
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T19:52:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

important to bear in mind that we are not objecting to female genital
mutilation per se. Whenever I have talked to these women, they have
said that they know that some nuns undergo the practice voluntarily.
They know that some adult African women have undergone the practice
voluntarily after the birth of their first child in order to convince
themselves that they are mothers and not children. They also know that,
for all kinds of reasons, every year 200 to 300 adult women undergo it
in our own society for all kinds of reasons. It is therefore important
to bear in mind that we are objecting to this practice because it
involves small children, and we ought not to lose sight of that
particular
focus.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13120491000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120491000033"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T20:00:15"></hs_TimeCode></I>8

my experience has gone on in Parliament. I came into Parliament in 1997
with a lot of women parliamentarians, and I quickly joined
the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population Development and
Reproductive Health. Of course there was the 1985 Act that prohibited
FGM—everyone knows about that—but by the year 2000 that
all-party group had produced a report on female genital mutilation,
which is still up on the group’s website. Following that report,
Christine McCafferty MP, the chair of the group at the time, took a
10-minute rule Bill through Parliament to prevent FGM from being
perpetrated on girls taken out of the country. It was illegal within
the country but we wanted to ensure that girls could not be taken out
in the school holidays. This was followed by Ann Clwyd—supported
in the House of 
<?notus-xml column=306?>Commons, I may say, by me—introducing an
amendment to the 1985 Act, and in 2003 Royal Assent was given to making
FGM illegal if girls were taken out of the country to have it

it has taken 10 years to get the broader media and parliamentarians
interested and, as we have heard, no prosecutions of
individuals have taken place in that time, the main reason being that
although, for example, 63 cases were reported between November 2009 and
November 2011, no individual would give evidence. Girls stay loyal to
their families. The noble Baroness, Lady Rendell, has to be

it, as did many social workers, doctors, teachers and NGOs.
He got together a huge collegiate group of people who were concerned
about this practice. After several meetings, there is now a

the time available, I want to add two things. First, to my
eternal shame, I was shocked to discover, early in my time as First
Minister of Scotland, that female genital mutilation was happening in a
country that I thought I knew very well but clearly did not know as a
whole. It was drawn to my attention by Khadija Coll of the African and
Caribbean Network in Glasgow, who has been a relentless campaigner in
Scotland on this issue since.</hs_para>

legislated eventually, passing new legislation in 2005. I make a plea
again today that we ensure that the approach taken to this issue in the
United Kingdom is indeed taken across the United Kingdom. There is a
danger that the United Kingdom is seen as a soft touch in Europe on
this issue, but there also now a danger within the UK that Scotland is
seen as a soft touch. It is vital that we have a cohesive
approach to this among the different jurisdictions
and secure a prosecution wherever it is possible in the UK as a start
towards further prosecutions in the future.</hs_para>

to make arises from a very interesting meeting that took place in the
House last Monday evening when a representative of the Crown
Prosecution Service said that one of the reasons that there is a
problem with prosecutions in the UK is that the legislation covers only
British nationals. I want to make two points about that. First, if it
is the case, we need to address it quickly. There would be widespread
support in this House and in the other place for any amendments that
were required. Secondly, even if that is the case, it is not a reason
not to prosecute. If I had taken my daughter at the age of eight or
nine to a neighbour’s house to have her tongue and fingers cut
off, I would have been prosecuted. Even if there are problems with the
existing FGM legislation, there is no justification for allowing it to
continue without prosecutions, given the raft of other legislation
available to prosecuting authorities on violence, child
abuse, child protection and so on. I make a plea to the
Government to take up the suggestions made by other speakers,
particularly the noble Baronesses who spoke earlier in the debate, and
to ensure that the Crown Prosecution Service sees this for what it is.

very well in this country. Looking at children’s private parts
is a very tricky subject, but in France, they expect people who come
there to behave like the French. The noble Lord, Lord McConnell, made a
very good point that even if we do not go as far as
examination—and I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Howe, about

cannot overstate that there are no medical reasons for FGM. There are
no religious reasons in the Bible, the Koran or any holy scripture that

Government’s point that this is a very tricky area to deal with.
However, we have to deal with it. There have to be prosecutions.
Reading all the papers that have been assembled, mainly by government
agencies, I am struck by the fact that they feel there is a lack of
leadership and joined-up thinking. For example,
even those cases that come to the attention of the professionals are
not being reported as well as they might be. There are initiatives

girls’ bodies is not only a human rights violation, it is also,
in the UK, child abuse. It has been illegal in the UK since 1985, and
since 2003 Britons have been able to be prosecuted for acts of FGM
abroad, but it is still practised. The report, <I>Tackling FGM</I><I>

66,000 women in England and Wales have undergone female genital
mutilation and that more than 24,000 girls under 15 are at

FGM being classed as a serious criminal offence in the UK, there have
been no prosecutions. In the recent Channel 4 programme “The
Cruel Cut”, you must weep with the girl who at seven returned
from being taken overseas during school holidays to be cut. When she
returned, she confided in her teacher, who ignored her cry for help.
That child was doubly betrayed by the adults who should have been
protecting her, and no action was taken against her parents. We should
be ashamed in the UK that thousands of girls in danger of genital
mutilation are being failed by our education, health and justice
systems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120492000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120492000012">While

Health Minister, Jane Ellison, to conduct yet another inquiry into FGM?
I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Tonge: we know what the problem
is. What new information is there to be found after the reports that
have been done, including that by the Royal College of Nursing? If it

men who would quickly get involved in any scuffles that were going on
in the nightclub, or outside it, and who escalated the incident more
often than not. Eventually, the police felt that they needed to do
something about this and proposed that they trained the doorkeepers.

history of this goes way back. The police service has had
grave concerns over the past 10 to 15 years about rogue

very much into the criminal arena of behaviour. It surely makes sense

House and talks about the responsibility not just of individuals but of
companies. Large companies in this country have a responsibility. They
do a very good and important job in the private security industry. It
makes sense for these companies to be held accountable as an identity

highly negligent actions of their

important—and my noble friend Lady Harris of Richmond
talked about it—is training. It is something I know a little
about, having borne that responsibility for some time. It is essential

important issue. I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Henig, for
presenting these amendments—not that I am going to accept
them—as the SIA is one of my departmental responsibilities
within the Home Office. She mentioned commitments that I made last year
at the annual general meeting of the SIA. I made similar commitments by

its chairman. We also appreciate the points made by the
noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, on the importance of
business licensing for the development of the industry. We are at one
in that aim and we have not been idle on this issue. There has been a
public consultation on the process and we have published the
Government’s response to it. As the noble Baroness
may know, we do not need primary legislation —we do not need to
put anything in the Bill—to introduce business licensing. It
would be introduced by secondary legislation and would cover issues
such as door supervision, security guarding, cash and valuables in
transit, close protection, CCTV and public surveillance, and key
holding—the traditional areas. However, noble Lords will be
aware that one of the consequences of the Leveson report is that
private investigators should also come within the ambit of the
regulatory body—the SIA. Therefore, there is a lot to do. I

to the amendments. Amendment 56QA seeks to link the application of the
complaints and misconduct framework overseen by the IPCC to
SIA-regulated businesses. As the noble Lord, Lord Stevens, said, the
police work with the private sector on many different aspects of their
work, many of which are outside the security industry and, as such, it
was never the intention that the provisions of the Private Security
Industry Act would apply. I shall describe the sorts of thing that I am
talking about. These include, for example, call handlers in police
control rooms or inquiry office staff. In addition, forensic science
work, which is, of course, integral to the police service, is regulated
by the forensic science regulator, and would be
excluded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120492000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120492000050">T<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T20:53:25"></hs_TimeCode>he
intention behind Clause 121 is to ensure that the oversight of
complaints and conduct matters by the IPCC extends to all private
contractors, subcontractors and their employees carrying out functions
for the police where those functions have been traditionally carried
out by police officers and police staff, so that where there has been a
move towards the civilianisation of police functions, these should be
covered. Police forces are increasingly entering into contracts with
private sector organisations—I come from Lincolnshire, a county
which probably pioneered that—many of which fall outside the
SIA-regulated regime, but which should, none the less, be subject to
investigation by the IPCC for wrongdoing. I think that the public would
rightly expect this to be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120492000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0002.htm#13120492000051">Amendment

I agree with the intention behind the amendment, I believe that we can
achieve all this through other, more workable means. I say that because
the Government plan to amend this clause in recognition of similar
concerns raised by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform
Committee—namely, that the 
<?notus-xml column=317?>power to specify descriptions of those who might in
future facilitate the transit through the UK of persons being
extradited from and to another country is cast in wide terms. The
committee felt that this should be seen in the context of the powers of
authorised officers, which include the power to detain persons in
custody, and therefore that the delegated power should either be
circumscribed in the Bill or subject to the affirmative

have listened to the views of the committee and, in response, have

categories of persons able to undertake escort duties will be those

undertake this escort role is Border Force officials. Whoever is
empowered to carry out the role will be subject to the extradition
codes of practice, which are based on the equivalent PACE provisions. I
hope that the noble Baroness will be reassured that there will be
proper oversight and scrutiny of those who undertake quasi-police

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, these government amendments
implement the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee in relation to Clause 126. They ensure that there is
parliamentary scrutiny of any decisions to designate countries, police
forces and ranks under that clause. It is entirely appropriate, given
its role, that the College of Policing should play a central part in
the designation process, so the clause continues to require the Home
Secretary to act only after receiving its recommendation. It will
remain up to the Home Secretary whether she implements the
college’s designations. However, by putting the designations in
secondary legislation subject 
<?notus-xml column=319?>to the negative resolution procedure, we are
ensuring that there is an appropriate opportunity for Parliament to
consider them. I commend these amendments to the

the attention of the House to my registered interests in relation to

Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller. The noble Baroness is not able to be
in your Lordships’ House today and has asked me to present her
apologies for that. However, I am in a position to say that she remains
in firm support of this amendment. Amendment 105 is not affected by,
nor affects in any specific terms, the other amendments in this group
put forward by the Minister. It is not an amendment to Clause 126 but
is about Clause 126. It is actually an addition to the Bill’s
last clause, Clause 160—the enactment clause—and can be
found at the end of today’s Marshalled List. I am grateful to
the Minister for his part in arranging to have it debated now as it is
related not to the whole Bill, nor even to the enactment of the whole

amendment is triggered by concerns about how the opening of senior UK

deeply concerned with UK national security and intelligence. It

it is pertinent to note that no UK officer has ever been considered to

comes to the point. There are similar posts in the UK. There are senior
police officers intricately involved in the security and intelligence

against, in principle, the notion of exceptional overseas candidates
leading police forces in the UK. Like my noble friend Lord Blair, I am
merely seeking to explore the additional challenges and hurdles of
appointing an overseas candidate to one of the posts mentioned in the
amendment. In particular, I would like to explore the challenges of
appointing an American citizen to the post of commissioner. Without
overpersonalising it, I believe we got reasonably close to an attempt

an unequivocal duty, first and foremost, to the laws, constitution and

the Cabinet Office briefing room with the Prime Minister and heads of

the United States of America might have subtle, or even significant,
policy differences and interests at that time. In the recent past, for
example, extraordinary rendition, Irish terrorism and mega-data
collection have all led to subtle or significant differences between
our country’s policy approach and that of the United States of
America, one of our oldest allies. There are additional challenges
which are not insurmountable but it is important to place on record
that these issues must be taken account of at some stage when the Prime
Minister and Home Secretary of the day get close to appointing an

Elystan-Morgan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that it will come
as no surprise to the Minister that I take exactly the same view as
that put forward with so much restraint and moderation by the three
noble Lords who have spoken. I considered the appointment of police and
crime commissioners a tremendous mistake on the part of the Government
and the Opposition. Both parties, I think for the best reasons in the
world, believed that there had to be some supervision of the police
force that would satisfy certain doubts and fears rampant among the
public at the time. I believe with all my heart and conviction that
they were wrong. It was wrong to consider that a commissar—for
that is really what a commissioner is—could be introduced into a
force that has a structure of disciplined hierarchy without defeating
the very basic element of discipline in that force. You could not do it
in the armed services unless it happened to be the Red Army or the army
of the People’s Republic of China. You would not think of doing
it in the armed services. It has the effect of eating like acid into
the morale of the police—we have already seen very many
instances of how the life of a chief constable can be made absolutely
impossible by a commissioner, and we will see
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13120492000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0003.htm#13120492000079">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T21:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>
am no prophet or son of a prophet but I am sure that as time runs on
and the period of a commissioner’s tenure comes towards its end,
where that person gave huge promises and undertakings as a candidate
that have not been delivered, he will turn round and say, “This
is all due to the chief constable. This man”—or this
woman—“has to be removed”. I cannot imagine
anything that would eat into the morale of the police service in a more
destructive way than that. If my noble friends had proposed cancelling
the powers in Clause 126, I would have supported them. I would support
anything that diminishes the authority of a commissioner and, for that
reason, I support this

say, with great humility, that my attitude has everything to do with
what I conceive a police service to be. I had the very high

James Callaghan would say very often, “Do you know what the
police service is, as far as I am concerned? It is a case of citizens
in uniform”. The powers that the ordinary constable has 
<?notus-xml column=323?>today have been increased over the past 45 years but they are still
moderate in relation to the general powers and responsibilities that
the ordinary citizen has. The powers of arrest are not immensely

Lordships may not be surprised that the first example of that
disdain—forgetting about the “f” word being used
by a senior member of the Government in a disgraceful incident at the
gates of Downing Street—was the Police Reform and Social
Responsibility Bill, which made provision for the election, at enormous
cost, of so-called police and crime commissioners. The noble Lord, Lord
Elystan-Morgan, referred to those persons as commissars. It was
intended that those individuals would hold the chief constable to
account and have the power to dismiss the chief officer and appoint
someone of their choice—even someone of his political
party—as the chief constable. Shades of the situation in Nazi
Germany in the early 1930s, when traditional policing had to give way
to political chief officer appointments. We know how that progressed.

inconsiderable salaries. Although no less than 65% of those polled did
not want the system and only 15% did, the Government took no notice of

Paddick (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, as the other ex-police officer in
the House this evening, it would be remiss of me not to add my comments
to those of other noble Lords. I fully support the amendment tabled by
the noble Lords, Lord Blair of Boughton and Lord Condon. I believe the
arguments they have made to be powerful and compelling. I do not think
that the noble Lord, Lord Stevens of Kirkwhelpington, spoke for long
enough to have that accolade but we obviously agree as well. I also
agree with a lot of what the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, said but as a
member of a party which is part of the coalition Government, perhaps I
should not go as far as he has done.</hs_para>

colleagues, who say that they have no argument in principle with Clause
126 and the appointment of foreign nationals to senior police posts, in
that it would be hypocritical as some UK police chiefs have taken posts
in foreign forces, never having applied for such a post I do not feel
myself to be hypocritical if I go against that principle. My argument
is about the culture of policing. As in many professions and
businesses, there is a major division between workers and bosses. It is
even more marked in the police service than in other professions. That
may be because rank and file officers perform shift-work—they go
out at night and are on the streets—whereas we senior officers
are comfortable in our offices and work more reasonable
hours.</hs_para>

there is a divide, particularly between Association of Chief Police
Officers’ ranks and those of the federation. However, the one
thing that binds us together is that we all, without exception,
performed the role of a patrol officer—a constable on the
beat—at some stage. We could honestly say when we were ACPO
officers that we knew and understood what those officers were facing,
at least to some extent. If a foreign officer was appointed, I do not
know whether they would have that credibility with rank and file
officers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1312051000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0003.htm#1312051000004">The
second issue is the uniqueness of police leadership. Almost uniquely,
police officers perform the overwhelming majority of their duties
without any direct supervision. Their leaders are almost never directly
present when those officers are out on the street. Police
officers therefore have to have far more credibility than other leaders
in the eyes of their subordinates, if those subordinates are to follow
the instructions of their leaders. While it may not be
impossible, it would be very difficult for a foreign national who has
not served as a patrol officer, or a bobby on the beat, in the
UK—a country with a unique tradition of being almost exclusively
unarmed and which has a tradition of policing by consent—to have
credibility in the eyes of rank and file officers. We therefore need to
think very carefully about appointing foreign nationals as police
chiefs in this country, notwithstanding what message that sends to the
excellent police leaders who we have in this country as it
is<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government. The value of the amendment is that it counters the
suspicion that some may have that these considerations are not in the
mind of the Government. It also has a disciplinary effect, because the
exercise that is being proposed here will, of course, be carried out in
advance of any of these appointments being made. It will help to focus
the mind and lay on the table the considerations which one would assume

one thinks of the acceptability of the appointment through the entire

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, I will resist the
temptation to go beyond the amendment that we are principally
discussing, Amendment 105. We acknowledge that the Government appear to
have a strong wish to bring personnel into the police from
overseas, but there is an obvious concern that has been
powerfully expressed tonight over the implications for the
security responsibilities of the posts mentioned in
Amendment 105 and their access to the highest classification
of intelligence. The question has been powerfully raised of whether it
is appropriate that the positions indicated in Amendment 105
should be held by a non-UK national on national security grounds. The
strength of the amendment, as the noble Lord, Lord Hope, has indicated,
is that it does not say no, but it requires that written advice be
sought from the Intelligence and Security Committee as to whether there
are any considerations of national security and intelligence that would
need to be examined in relation to the appointment of a non-UK national
to the posts mentioned in the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T21:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>.

police and crime commissioners, and they are not really the subject of
this amendment or this debate. With the greatest respect, I have to say
that I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Imbert, on the views of this
Government about policing. There is no way in which any member of the
Government that I know holds the police in disdain, and there is no
sense that the Bill is in any way about getting at the police, as the

In the case of posts that have responsibility for counterterrorism

posts mentioned in the amendment, though, only the post of the
Metropolitan Police Commissioner would be affected by the proposals in
Clause 126. All the others are not mentioned in this clause or indeed
relevant to it. Clause 126, as the noble Lord says, removes the
requirement for an applicant to have served as a constable in the UK
before being appointed as a chief constable or as the
commissioner—where they have certain alternative relevant
experience, which is important to emphasise as well. I have to say that
there is no requirement under law to have served as a constable in the
UK before being appointed as a deputy or assistant
commissioner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T21:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>.

not done so up to now; why should we start? The Home Secretary has the
ability to impose nationality requirements for the commissioner post if
necessary, as indeed she did when the post was last advertised.
Similarly, the Home Secretary can also impose this requirement when
appointing the deputy commissioner and the director-general of the
National Crime Agency. It is for the Commissioner of the Metropolitan

However, it would be more appropriate for the Home Secretary to take
advice from whom she thinks relevant when she is in the position to
make these appointments, so that it is current and pertinent to the
role being recruited at that time. However, I reassure noble Lords
that, whatever nationality restrictions are imposed, no appointment
would be made by this or any future Home Secretary that would put
national security at risk. We would always expect the successful

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, child sexual
exploitation is an abhorrent crime and we are determined to stamp it
out. In the past, all too often these crimes were largely hidden, but
now child sexual exploitation is rightly centre stage as an issue that
we must tackle. We are strengthening the system of civil orders used to
manage the risk of sexual offences through Part 9 of the Bill, which
noble Lords have already considered in Committee. The provisions in
this group of government amendments provide an additional power to
tackle the problem from a different angle. They will make it harder for
child sex offenders to be able to use the anonymity of hotels and
similar venues to commit offences against young people and children. A
number of recent high-profile cases, such as in those in Oxford and
Keighley, have shown that offenders have used the cover of hotels and
bed-and-breakfast accommodation to commit sexual offences against
children. By introducing these new powers, we will help the police to
tackle child sexual exploitation where there are reasonable suspicions
that offending has taken place or will take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T21:51:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312051000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0003.htm#1312051000022">Already,
police forces are actively tackling this issue, as evidenced by the
increasing number of cases that the police are bringing before the
courts and the significant sentences being handed down to perpetrators.
In addition, on a national level, we have strengthened the response to
this issue through the inclusion of child sexual exploitation within
our strategy to combat organised crime. The newly established National
Crime Agency is strengthening the UK’s capability to combat
child abuse online with some 4,000 specialist officers. We have also
set up a Home Office-led national group through which agencies are
working together to better identify those at risk and create a more
victim-focused culture within the police, health and children’s
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T21:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
Whether exploitation is happening now or has happened in the past, we
will continue to ensure that victims are not left to suffer in silence
and that those who exploit them are rightly brought to
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T21:52:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

support the police in their efforts to vigorously pursue perpetrators
of this despicable crime. Targeted new powers of the kind that we are
proposing will provide additional help to law enforcement agencies by
allowing the police to obtain information about guests staying at
hotels, guest houses and B&amp;Bs where they suspect sexual
exploitation could be taking place. If there is a reasonable suspicion
that premises are being used for child exploitation, a police officer
of at least inspector rank may issue a notice to the owner, operator or
manager. That person would then be required to provide the
police with information over a specified period of up to six months
about guests who check in on and after the date on which the notice
takes effect. This could include information such as the
name, age, address and relationship of guests, which would be used for
vital intelligence and
evidence-gathering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T21:53:46"></hs_TimeCode>.

this new power is taken seriously and can be enforced. That is why it
will be an offence for a person served with a notice to fail to comply,
and they will be subject to a maximum penalty of a level 4 fine,

An offence will not have been committed if the person has a reasonable
excuse for failing to comply or if reasonable steps were taken to
obtain or verify the required information, and an appeal against the
notice can be made in a magistrates’ court. The intention of the
new power is to create a proportionate and targeted tool that will be
used in an intelligence-led way to help prevent abuse, and I commend

is but just want to clarify it—that it will apply only in
relation to this particular kind of offence? One can think of
situations in which a hotel was used by individuals to perpetrate other
forms of quite serious crimes. Child sexual exploitation is obviously
very much at the top end, but a hotel could be used to enact or plan
other forms of crime. Do the Government intend that this provision will
apply over a wider field than child sexual exploitation, which
obviously we all accept is a very serious

amendments are designed to improve the use of DNA and fingerprints in
criminal investigations. I shall begin with Amendment 56YD, which
allows the retaking of DNA and fingerprints if an investigation is
restarted. At present, the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 allows
DNA sampling and fingerprinting of an arrested or charged person only
once in an investigation. If the police or the Crown Prosecution
Service decide not to proceed against an accused person, that
person’s DNA and fingerprints must be deleted, unless they have
previously been convicted, or charged with a qualifying offence. If the
investigation is later restarted, there is no power to retake the DNA
and fingerprints.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T22:02:29"></hs_TimeCode> CPS has now
introduced a new procedure, the victims’ right to review, under
which a decision not to proceed may be reviewed and the case restarted.
If DNA and fingerprints have already been taken and destroyed, there is
currently no power to take them again if the case is restarted.
Amendment 56YD provides for such a
power.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312051000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0003.htm#1312051000040">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T22:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>
56YE ensures that the retention of a person’s DNA is determined
by considering their entire criminal history. If a conviction in that
history would allow retention, it is important that a DNA profile can
be retained, regardless of whether the arrest in connection with which
the profile was obtained was itself followed by a conviction. This is
important because, normally, when a person has had a DNA sample taken
on a first arrest, DNA is not taken on any later arrests, because that
would incur unnecessary costs to obtain the same profile. However,
without this amendment, there is a danger that the DNA from the first
arrest would be deleted from the database if there was no causal link
between the taking of DNA on a first arrest and a conviction obtained
following a later arrest. Amendment 56YE makes the position clear,
thereby ensuring that a DNA profile can be retained indefinitely
whenever someone has a previous conviction or caution for a recordable
offence, irrespective of the fact that they were not proceeded against
for the offence in respect of which the DNA sample was
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T22:03:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312051000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0003.htm#1312051000041">Finally,
Amendment 97 to Schedule 9 to the Bill is consequential on amendment
56YD and amends Schedule 2A to PACE, which allows the police
to require people to attend at a police station for the
purposes of having their fingerprints or DNA taken. It duly applies the
existing time limits for imposing such a requirement 
<?notus-xml column=336?>to the new provisions that I have described. Under
existing legislation, if a person is arrested or charged then released

scenario involving retaking, putting a time limit of six months from

is a classic case of legislating in haste and repenting at leisure,
because the problems that these amendments seek to address were
highlighted by the Opposition when the Government originally
legislated. We pointed out that the Government should have taken the
greatest possible steps they could in acknowledging the legal
requirements set down under European court judgments to maintain the
retention of DNA so that it could be used to define and catch criminals
who had committed crimes or could potentially commit further crimes.
This was argued during the passage of the Protection of Freedoms Act,
and the argument was not accepted at the time by the Government. Now,
not untypically in an era of rapid U-turns, they have made a U-turn,
although it has taken some time. It is clearly right that the
Government should act in this way. It is notable that on this occasion
they are not following the practice of the Conservative Party in making
sure that their records are consigned to history rather than being kept
available. That is welcome, although perhaps we may see a U-turn in
that respect as well.</hs_para>

far as this legislation is concerned, there is still an issue around
the retention of information. The Minister referred to the fact that
samples would have to be taken within six months. I do not understand
the rationale for that. DNA samples can be taken and kept for long
after the event. I recently read an interesting history book called
<I>The Isles</I><I> </I>in which DNA samples were taken from a cave in
Cheddar Gorge from remains going back some thousands of years. Yet with
those DNA samples they managed to trace somebody living in the 21st
century in that area. These things can last. Crime is not just a
short-term matter—I understand that an estimated 20,000 to
23,000 people could have committed crimes within a span of six
years—so I do not understand the rationale for the six-month
period. While we welcome the progress made so far, perhaps we could
have an explanation of why six months is being insisted on rather than
a longer period. My honourable friends in another place were suggesting
that a period of six years would be appropriate. After all, we are
talking here about potentially serious crimes; we would not be
bothering with DNA samples if we were not. There is no rationale, in my
judgment, for the period the Government have

months has been regarded as the reasonable limit in legislation passed
by this Government as well as the previous one. The noble Lord
mentioned the Protection of Freedoms Act, namely that the DNA of a
person who has not committed any offence should not be retained
indefinitely. He used that as a premise for saying perhaps that the
Government are U-turning. This is not a U-turn. I always regard these

made an offence, which 
<?notus-xml column=338?>led to the Government accepting the point. However, there now appears to
be a need to monitor the implementation of the new law and the progress
of training provisions for the police. This is why we have tabled this
amendment, which asks the Home Secretary to carry out a review of
progress and implementation of the provisions used by the police to
address
stalking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312051000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0003.htm#1312051000048">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T22:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>
have called for national standards on police training for domestic and
sexual violence, including stalking. Victims repeatedly
say—fairly or unfairly—that police officers do not
understand stalking and are not aware of the new laws and, as such, are
reluctant to intervene. Police information notices—often
referred to, perhaps wrongly, as harassment warnings—are
apparently sometimes being handed out rather as a matter of course in
stalking cases to victims and the alleged perpetrators alike, which
certainly victims regard—again, rightly or wrongly—as a
failure properly to investigate the
complaints.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312051000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131204-0003.htm#1312051000049">As
I understand it, the
number<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T22:11:18"></hs_TimeCode> of
arrests in the first six months of stalking being an offence was just
over 300. This is in marked contrast to the situation in Scotland. In
the 30 months since its law was introduced, it had just over 1,400
detections recorded, and, of those, just under 1,050 had commenced
prosecution. Of that figure of just under 1,050, 450 had resulted in
convictions and 315 still await prosecution. This suggests that the
figures for England and Wales are well below expectations taking into
account the massive difference in population with Scotland, which has
only approximately one-tenth of the population of England and Wales.
Therefore, these figures are surprising and do not appear to reflect
the seriousness of

material that has apparently been received by the National Stalking

understanding the nature of the new laws, the need to consider all
stalking behaviour when victims complain and the serious nature of this
criminal stalking behaviour. Even though the Government have made
stalking an offence, which obviously is major progress, this alone is
not enough to make it work. Given some of the evidence that is now
coming to light, there appears to be a case that a review is needed on
the implementation of the provisions used by the police to address

endorse the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, but wish to add
two or three more. In addition to the worry about the numbers of
arrests and charges, the geographical data are also very patchy. There
have been 133 arrests in the Met area but none in Gloucestershire.
Lancashire has had 36 arrests, there have been 20 in the Thames Valley,
14 in Suffolk, 12 in Bedfordshire but just two in Merseyside. These
disparities are also reflected in the actual charge rates, should the
issue progress to that. What these data seem to be saying is that some
forces have trained and prepared their officers for the new offence but
others have not. 
<?notus-xml column=339?>When the stalking clauses were discussed during the passage of the then
Protection of Freedoms Bill, there was cross-party agreement that there
would not be real change in stalking offences until the culture not
just in the police but in the criminal justice system changed and they
understood the new law and how to implement it. It is good news that
the College of Policing will cover this training in the future, but can
the Minister say where and how much training has been undertaken in the

stalkers are charged appropriately? It is not good enough to say that

Today I am announcing the Government’s intention to propose an

amendment will place a new legal duty on local authorities to support
every care leaver who wants  to stay with their former foster
parents until their 21st birthday (“staying

care leavers to stay with their former foster carers will allow them to
leave stable and secure homes when they are ready and able to make the
transition to independence. It will also help them enter adult life

agreements operate. It has always been the Government’s
intention that those reforms should apply to all areas of civil
litigation, including personal injury compensation. Those reforms came

subject to Royal Assent. Under the Bill, introduced into Parliament in
May 2013 by the Department for Work and Pensions, victims of

event advised countries that were unable to formally participate to
instead feed information/points/views through Civil Society groups that
were attending the Review. Officials from the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office therefore engaged with Womankind, who were sending a
representative, and provided information on how the UK is implementing
UN resolutions on Women,
