caste discrimination. However, we are aware that legislating on the
basis of limited evidence carries a serious risk of unintended
consequences, and we need to get the detail of the legislation right.
My noble friend has been a huge campaigner on this issue. I can assure
him that the Government are committed to it, but it is important to
ensure that the consultation on what that legislation would look like
is completed, as well as making sure that the relevant groups that 
<?notus-xml column=1018?>would be affected are fully brought into the process. He will be aware,
of course, of the report of the National Institute of Economic and
Social Research, published in December 2010, which unfortunately proved

Thornton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, to return the Minister to the
Question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, the paving
legislation on caste discrimination was agreed by this House in 2010.
There was an overwhelming majority in the House in favour of including
caste discrimination in our legislation not that long ago but it looks
like that will not be implemented until after the next general
election. The United Nations High Commissioner has asked for strong and
swift implementation of the legislation. Can the Minister say whether
that is compatible with her statement and the fact that it will now
have taken more than five years to implement if the Government stick to
their current

consultation will be held around February and March next year. That
will be followed by some targeted sector-specific engagement with
groups that 
<?notus-xml column=1019?>need familiarisation with the new legislation, including certain
employers, public authorities and the judiciary. It is anticipated that
the legislation will come into force in October 2015, but I am quite

freedom of religion and belief is one of the six priorities for the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Indeed, it is a personal priority of
mine and something into which we have put additional resources and
energy since my appointment at the Foreign Office. We are dealing with
this matter on a number of levels through both the Human Rights
Commission and our support for Resolution 16/18, which determined,
among other things, tolerance towards minority religions. We have also
instigated and chair a political track to this process. The first
meeting was held at the beginning of this year and the second at the UN
General Assembly in New York in September. We are proposing that a

following the debate in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, some

responding. I did in fact sign the letter on Saturday so I know it is
on its way to him. It may be on his desk this morning. In relation to
funding, the noble Lord will be aware that as well as making our
contribution to the UN general budget, which is about 5%, we make
voluntary contributions to OHCHR of about £2.5 million a year.
On top of that we make additional voluntary contributions, which can be
anything between £2.5 million and £4 million. We were the
seventh largest donor to the office during 2012. The 2013 figures have
not yet been published but I assure the noble Lord that we are
incredibly aware of the pressures on OHCHR in terms of its funding and
that we do feel that it should be properly resourced. However, that
does not stop us from making quite strong representations for better
budget management. We are asking OCHCR to do more but we also think
that it should do more with the money that it
has.</hs_para>

the principles that apply to good mental health care apply equally to

mental health is to be maintained in this country. Perhaps I might
press my noble friend a little further than the noble Lord, Lord Crisp,
did. Have there been discussions between the Department of Health and
DfID about DfID espousing parity of esteem for physical and mental
health in its proposals, and have there been discussions with other
government departments, such as the FCO, about the increasing abuse of
mental health and psychiatry facilities for political prisoners in

political prisoners. On his main point of principle about parity of
esteem, that principle—which essentially works to ensure that
mental health has equal priority with physical health—is central
to government-funded mental health programmes overseas; in particular,
DfID funds programmes that promote the rights of people with mental
health disorders to ensure that their needs are equally met. We
recently invested £2 million for an additional three

that the amount of money withheld from JSA in sanctions in 2009-10 was
£11 million. Only halfway 
<?notus-xml column=1024?>through 2012-13, it was £60 million. If it carried on at that
rate, that would constitute a tenfold increase. Anyone who has ever

unit and there has been a reply to a letter from the Deputy Prime
Minister but, unfortunately, as yet, there has not been a reply from
the leader of the Opposition’s office? Perhaps noble Lords
opposite will use their good offices to elicit a response. Has he also
seen in the Deloitte report, to which he referred, the projection that
the likely 6% annual increase in international visitor spend

That puts the figure at 9.9% of GDP. That is up there with some of the
major industries in this country, such as
financial services. There is a real need to put tourism at
the heart of this country’s growth agenda. There are a couple of
caveats in the Deloitte report. One is the need to encourage SMEs to
get much more comfortable with the digital economy and to concentrate
on emerging markets. Is there not a case for BIS, together with DCMS,
to develop a programme specifically focused on encouraging

absolutely strikes the right note. Tourism is at the heart of much of
the UK economy. If you look at the countryside, there are
constituencies where a very significant proportion of jobs are involved
in tourism. It needs to be taken extremely seriously indeed. The other
point is that whether the apprenticeships are in large organisations or
smaller ones, there are great opportunities for young people coming
into this industry. I take the point about SMEs. BIS is working
extremely hard on apprenticeships. We very much hope that tourism will

first point, it was very interesting to see in the list of those who
went with the Prime Minister to China the number from the creative
industries and tourism and heritage sectors. It is a very important
part of why lots of people want to come to this country. It is why
Britain is fourth in terms of culture and tourism on the Anholt brands

approach of the new Prime Minister would be. Would he take as much
interest as the previous Prime Minister had when they got devolution
back? They would still want some help and some tender loving care, but
not nannying—no one is saying that at all. People are prepared

all those groups I have just mentioned, one way or another, are

paramount that the needs of that legislation are watched like a hawk by

promotion of equality of opportunity between persons of different

to this and people campaign about it. I do not know how a charity or

situation we have here at Westminster. The political parties virtually
own the departments; they are carved up in the process following the
election. I am not complaining about that, but the point is that the
campaigning groups, charities and NGOs in Northern Ireland do a
different kind of work, in the main, from what they do in England,
Scotland and Wales. There is obviously a crossover in how they work
with the elderly, the disabled and other things, but there are unique
factors in Northern Ireland. Groups were set up during direct rule in
order to get action because the politicians were not there. It was not
appropriate for direct rule Ministers 
<?notus-xml column=1030?>to deal with it, flying in and out a couple of times a week as we were,
but as far as the groups were concerned, there was no political
structure. Groups were set up to deal with issues. Many of those groups
still exist. The last thing they need to be forced to do, as this
legislation almost invites them to do, is to align themselves with a
political party during the election; notwithstanding, as I have said,
the fact that the parties in power in Westminster do not stand for
election in Northern

I have said, I cannot make a massively detailed case—I am not an
expert—but I know enough and am concerned enough
about the issues drawn out in the commission report to ask the
Government to think seriously about them. There would be no
complaints from Wales, England and Scotland because the
political structure in Northern Ireland is utterly different and it is
a very young democracy. The power-sharing Executive must be made to
work. The unspoken rule from Westminster to the Northern Ireland
politicians is, “You’re never getting direct
rule again; you have to sort this out yourselves”. We need to
nurture cross-divide working and not put barriers or hurdles in its
way. Part 2 of the Bill has the potential to do that and I hope that
the Government will think seriously before they make further progress.

fledgling Northern Ireland Assembly climb many mountains during its

Executive have had the support and engagement of the many charities and
community groups working in Northern Ireland. Before the signing of the
Good Friday agreement, charities and community groups played their part
in holding the front line. My standing here today and being in the
position of talking to you is very much a symbol of that, as I was part

moment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:20:59"></hs_TimeCode>. We were
ordinary people, working on the ground, campaigning for a better, more
productive and ultimately more peaceful Northern Ireland, and I believe
that all of us together played our own small part in helping to bring
about huge changes. Often very difficult work is still being carried
out today by the different charities and voluntary groups; I could give
noble Lords many examples of victims’ and children’s
issues, equality issues and issues about the aged, but I am not going

is not easy, and democracy is not easy, and I would urge that in
Northern Ireland many charities and community groups allow vital spaces

platforms, I believe that these campaigning groups, referred to by my
noble friend Lord Rooker, have enabled voices to be heard. A lot of the
time, it may not be what our politicians have wanted to hear, but that
is yet another reason why the work is so important. By listening,
supporting and highlighting the voices of groups that might not
otherwise feel connected in any way to the governing of the society in
which they live, these organisations continue to play a vital role.

I have already said, this amendment highlights the special
circumstances of Northern Ireland—a Northern Ireland governed by
a statutory power-sharing Executive based upon the Good Friday

to many issues around that. The work of charities and community groups
helped to lay the foundations on which the Good Friday agreement was
built. I could give noble Lords many examples of all the charities with
which I am involved, but I shall give an example of the one in which I
am most deeply involved—the work that is done by the Integrated
Education Fund. We do things in two ways. First, as campaign chairman,
I know that we fundraise to enable schools to be opened to educate
children and young people of all faiths and no faith to sit together
side by side every day and to learn together. Secondly, we lobby our
elected politicians to try to bring about policy change in our
education system to lead to a shared future, which 90% or 95% of the
people in Northern Ireland crave. No integrated school has ever been
established by the system; it has always been established by parents
who want to see this change. That work was crucial then and remains

noble friend Lord Rooker talked about equality legislation
in Northern Ireland. Again, the overwhelming message we received was
that Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998 is not
producing gender equality in Northern Ireland; in the name of gender
neutrality, women are being disadvantaged. Again, these are issues
around which campaigning has taken place. As well as the
implications for Northern Ireland—I hope that the
Minister will take heed of my noble friend’s warnings in that
regard—this issue also illustrates an important point made by
the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement, which I
congratulate on producing a first-class, useful report in no time at
all. One of the issues to which it draws attention is the failure of
the Government to provide a detailed equalities impact assessment. This
is very relevant to the Northern Ireland situation where, as I say,
women’s voices in particular could be silenced. The report says
that the commission is not aware that any progress being made in this
regard during the pause—that is, with regard to an equalities
impact assessment. Therefore, I would be very grateful if, as well as
referring specifically to the point about Northern Ireland, the
Minister will advise your Lordships’ House whether any progress

chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in another place
from 2005 to 2010 and saw at close hand the establishment of the
power-sharing Executive. Two things struck me: first, it was
remarkable—indeed, unique—and, secondly, it was fragile,
as events of the past weeks have reminded us. We must do nothing that
may, even inadvertently, damage what has been achieved—something
to which successive Prime Ministers have contributed. Without Sir John

Blair would have been able to bring about the Good Friday agreement. I

O'Neill of Bengarve (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with the
points that other speakers have raised, but I support the amendment for
a further reason, which is that the politics of Northern Ireland differ
from those of the rest of the United Kingdom. Noble Lords may say that
that reason is more apparent in Part 1 of the Bill, which deals with
political parties and lobbying. However, we should remember that the
parties that campaign in Northern Ireland may also receive funding from
individuals and organisations in the Republic of Ireland. The Republic
is reasonably generous in giving citizenship to those who are not
domiciled there. That line of thought should suggest to Ministers that
there are additional reasons for ensuring that the civil society
organisations and charities that have made such a profound difference
in Northern Ireland can continue to do their
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:34:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121611000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000091"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Horam" PimsId="1019" UID="13121611000366" xid="2184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000366">Lord

burden of the point of the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, which I take very
seriously, is that civic society plays a special role in Northern
Ireland because of the nature of the political settlement there. The
solution he proposes, which is to exempt Northern Ireland entirely from
the provisions of the Bill, is only one possible solution to the
problems. Another solution was put forward by the commission chaired by
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, which goes into the
issue in some detail. The noble and right reverend Lord points out that
if the registration levels were raised, and if the costs of security
and safety were exempted from regulation, that would be another way of
dealing with this issue, rather than exempting them from the Bill as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:35:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:35:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the other remarks made by the previous speaker, the noble Baroness was
quite right to say that, in relation to donations, for example, which
have played a very important part in the political tragedy, if you
like, of Northern Ireland, delegated powers under another Bill allow
the Secretary of State to bring in provisions as he thinks fit and as
his judgment suggests is wise. That is a third alternative to exempting
Northern Ireland entirely from the provisions of the Bill. It would be
rather stark to do that, given that—I am sure the noble Lord,
Lord Rooker, would agree—in essence we are trying to normalise
the situation in Northern Ireland as we go along. Therefore, we could
give it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:36:39"></hs_TimeCode> special

Mulheir, is the chief executive of Lumos, a children’s charity.
She came back with some truly powerful evidence from those from whom
she had heard, and made more than one visit. Some of her work was done
before Second Reading in this House, and some subsequently. I
understand that latterly one of the Ministers—I believe it was
Tom Brake, but I shall be corrected if I am wrong—went over on
one occasion and took some evidence, but that was of course after the

organisations’ participation in the democratic process over
there is one of the key components of the peace 
<?notus-xml column=1036?>process. The engagement of young people in campaigning, and
the close co-operation with all-party groups, was viewed by
virtually everyone as a way of strengthening the possibility of lasting
peace in Northern Ireland and a real alternative to a return to

commission’s view at the end of the day related both to the
limits—the registration limit and the spending

of course to the way in which coalitions work. One of the most powerful
examples of how unintended consequences can occur with a Bill such as
this—and I cannot believe that the Government wanted to produce
this result—was the example given in the commission report about
the Human Rights Consortium in Northern Ireland, a group of 180 small
organisations from right across the political divide. It would be hard
to think of a more disparate group. It got together to campaign for a
Bill of rights. Under the Bill as currently drafted, that coalition
would have fallen foul of the registration threshold, the spending
limits and, in some areas, the constituency limits. It would have been
wholly impossible for that group to get together, knowing that it would
face the regulatory burdens of the Bill, with a criminal sanction at
the end of it. I cannot believe that an organisation such as that,
which was working hard and involved people who had never spoken to one
another sitting down and campaigning together, is something that the
Government would wish to destroy. That, in effect, would be the result

the right course is, as my noble friend Lord Rooker suggested, to take

important of all—it is one of the commission’s

together in a rush since July, as this Bill has been. If that cannot be
done before the Bill leaves this House, it will have to be done after

seeking evidence from across the UK and by formulating proposals and

highlighted how remiss the Government have been in failing to do any of
that. We are told that today is to be an extension of the consultation.
However, our constitutional role in this House is to scrutinise the
Government and revise their proposals. Committee stage should enable
noble Lords to debate government proposals and then to table the
necessary amendments for Report. Instead, we are being treated as a
focus group for the Government to gauge how little they can get away
with changing. I therefore ask the noble and learned Lord to give us a
cast-iron assurance that, at the latest, we will see any government
amendments which might be forthcoming after Committee by the Tuesday
when the House returns following the Christmas Recess. That means that
the amendments would have to be tabled on the Monday and published on

government, because civil society, NGOs and charities all know that if
they want a change of policy they will have to convince whoever is in

Campaigning groups have made numerous suggestions about changes that
might be made to the legislation, many of which are reflected in the
amendments that have been tabled. We have been considering these
suggestions carefully. I do not accept that this House is a focus

the year it might be easier to do so, but as the Committee will be
aware, quite frankly it can be difficult at this time of year to make
sure that all the people concerned are in the right place. However, I
take the important point that those who have taken a particular
interest in this Bill are given proper notice of the amendments that
the Government are to propose before the House comes to debate the Bill
at Report

area where we have heard consistently that more clarity is needed is
over the guidance as to which activity might or might not be caught by
the electoral test, and I may be able to say something about that in
the course of replying to the specific points raised by the amendment
moved by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker. The Government believe that it is
essential that campaigners have clarity on how they are to comply with
the third-party regulatory regime. The Electoral Commission has a power
to produce guidance for third parties campaigning in elections, and
indeed has exercised that power in previous elections. Campaigners
require clear guidance to support them and help them understand the
revised regime, and I am reassured that the commission recognises this
too. It makes clear in its briefing notes that it is committed to
working with the United Kingdom’s charity regulators to produce
clear and reliable guidance that will help charities to understand how
to comply with both electoral law and charity law, and I say that
without pre-empting subsequent debates that we will have on charities.
Also, I would say that the sooner this guidance can be produced in
draft, the better. As a Government we are open to working across the
House and with the electoral 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>and charity commissions to give campaigners the guidance they need. It
may be that we will hear in these debates in Committee how best the
commissions can support campaigners in a thorough and timely
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:57:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

and campaigners have also expressed fears that low-level campaigning
and expenditure will be regulated as a result of this Bill, and that
small organisations will face a disproportionate reporting and
compliance burden. Our belief is that there should be greater clarity
about who is campaigning for the electoral success of parties or
candidates, but we do not want small campaigners to be dissuaded from
taking part by the fear of having onerous burdens placed upon them.
Therefore in line with the commitment made by my noble friend Lord
Wallace of Saltaire to the House on 5 November, the Government will
bring forward on Report amendments to increase the registration
thresholds in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:57:51"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
have said, we will listen to the debates today, but the Government

as a preliminary, the Government are committed to bringing more
transparency to campaigning by third parties before the 2015 general
election, but having listened to the views of campaigners over recent
weeks, I seek to reassure noble Lords that we agree with those who
think that the provisions of Part 2 should be subject to review after
the 2015 UK parliamentary general election. That election will provide
the earliest opportunity to understand the effectiveness of the
provisions of Part 2. The Government therefore commit to laying this
review before Parliament, and an amendment to this effect will be
introduced at Report stage. As I have said, beyond that I do not wish
to pre-empt the debates today and on Wednesday. Of course, the
Government wish to hear views from across the House on the amendments
which have been tabled, and I hope that these points and a short
statement will assure your Lordships that while the Government are
absolutely committed to the increased transparency that Part 2 will
bring, we have been listening and will continue to listen to those who

turn now specifically to the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord
Rooker. As we have heard, it would exclude Northern Ireland from the
provisions contained in Part 2. That exemption would stand for as long
as there is a statutory Executive based on the Good Friday agreement,
which is in place. I readily accept that there is a different political
structure in Northern Ireland, where different parties compete for
elections, than is the situation in Great Britain. It is clear that
there is a particular situation in Northern Ireland and it is important
that the legislation should take account of

the importance of civil society, not just across the United Kingdom but

Deputy Leader of the House of Commons, my right honourable friend Tom

went to Belfast recently to meet with some of the groups in Northern

Nothing could be further away from falling within the trigger for

a similar vein, the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, mentioned the Good

promote a Bill of Rights in Northern Ireland. As I understand it, the
consortium is a well established campaigner for an inclusive Bill of
Rights for Northern Ireland, which has charitable status and a wide and
diverse membership. It has been advocating for a broader set of
provisions to be included in a Bill of Rights. However, that advocacy

election of one party or candidate. Based on that position, the
activities of the Human Rights Consortium would be regulated by this
Bill only if it were to encourage people to vote for a political party
or to support particular candidates in a future election. So far as I
am aware, the Human Rights Consortium does not support particular
parties or candidates. Its purpose is to pursue a policy aim and
provided the organisation does not campaign for or against
the electoral success of a political party it is not the

overlooking my scribbled note. As part of the impact assessment at the
time the Bill was published, we said that 30 third parties were
recognised by the Electoral Commission for the 2010 general election
and that there were no robust equalities data covering these
groups. However, we did not believe that these proposals would have an
adverse equalities impact because of the wide range of groups that were
registered. There is nothing to suggest that there was a preponderance
of gender equality organisations. We therefore do not believe there is
particular impact in that
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121611000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000137">In

final point is on the issue of using this debate as consultation. I
have just had the privilege of chairing a Joint Committee on the draft
deregulation Bill. I cannot say much; we will publish on Wednesday.
However, when Ministers came to see us, they said our pre-legislative
scrutiny was part of the consultation. We did not accept that. The
Government cannot use Parliament as a consultation sounding board when
they are going to come back to Parliament and say, “This is what
we have decided; vote for it. And by the way, your consultation fits
this process”. There is something wrong with the logic of the
situation for legislators. It is fine for Government to listen to our
voices and concerns in the normal way but in no way should any
Government say, “We have consulted on this and we had these
meetings in Parliament. Now we want Parliament to follow the
consultation we had”. That has to be wrong. It is fine to
consult with interest groups, parliamentarians and outside, but not
with Parliament prior to legislating through Parliament where the
Executive have a majority. There is something wrong with that. For a
start, it cannot be in the textbooks on good governance. The Government
can listen to what we have said, by all means, but then they must come
back and show that they have listened. I genuinely believe that the
noble and learned Lord will do that. I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13121611000403" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000403">Amendment

expenditure requires two elements. The first is that the activity
resulting in the expenditure must be within the definition of what is
controlled. Secondly, the expenditure must reasonably be regarded as
intended to promote the electoral success of one or more registered
parties or candidates within certain categories. Section 85 of the 2000
Act is restrictive in its scope. It confines controlled expenditure to
the production or publication of election material made available to
the public or sections of the public. In that situation it would be
relatively easy to assess objectively whether the intention of the
published material was to promote the electoral success of individuals
or registered parties. However, Clause 26(2) of the Bill extends the
meaning and scope of controlled expenditure by expanding the activities
from the mere production and publication of election material to
include the various activities listed in Part 1 of new Schedule 8A to
the 2000 Act added by Clause 26(2)(a) and Schedule 3. These activities
include market research, public meetings, rallies and media

organisations with a legitimate interest in the democratic process
indulge in such activities at different times. For example, charities
and others may be involved in campaigns throughout the year,
highlighting the plight of those in our society who are poor, homeless
or otherwise disadvantaged, including the disabled. These campaigns
might intensify at Christmas and throughout the winter months when the
consequences of having no shelter or hot food are more acute. At other
times, they may concentrate on the inability of the poorer members of
society to afford heat, light or other basic essentials. These
activities are not associated with elections and they are not confined
to the year immediately preceding an election.</hs_para>

campaign to make poverty history in our society might suggest various
solutions directed at unemployment, the level of wages and benefits,
the price of energy or other measures. It might involve organising
public rallies and media events. If such a campaign started before the

could be incurred with impunity, but one might expect such a campaign

cost of the administrative burden imposed by the Act of having systems

consequences would apply to local campaign groups concerned about a
local issue, such as the threatened closure of their hospital, the
route of HS2

local campaign group, or the charity, as the case may be, could spend
money without fear of contravening the rules about controlled
expenditure, but what if—and this is a point that was raised on
the previous amendment—a candidate with such policies emerged
after the start of the regulated period or an existing candidate
adopted them in the course of his campaign? The intention of the
campaign by the local group or charity would not have altered, but the
organisers would risk prosecution if after that time they continued to
incur expenditure without complying with the provisions about
controlled expenditure, the reason for that risk being that it might be
argued that a subsidiary intention of the campaign was to procure the
electoral success of the candidate who had adopted it, even if he or
she were not mentioned. While such an intention may not be the aim of
the organisers of the campaign, and might not even be in their
contemplation, it may be a consequence of their campaign. In that
situation, if an objective evaluation of the case resulted in the
conclusion that such an outcome could reasonably be regarded as a
subsidiary intention of the campaign, the consequence would be a

number of charities. Much has been said about the role of charities in
respect of lobbying activities 
<?notus-xml column=1049?>and a number of reassuring comments have been made during early stages
of this Bill. However, I am particularly concerned about the activities
of all-party groups within Parliament. Many of these groups are in the
medical research field and are serviced and provided with financial,
secretarial and other support by charities. They
are dependent on this to a considerable extent.
Of course, one would say at once that if they are all-party
groups and their membership includes Members of the Commons
and of this House from all parties, surely they cannot be construed as
lobbying in search of electoral success. That is an entirely reasonable
conclusion to draw. However, there is always a possibility that a
particular all-party group may be so dominated by members of one
political party that its attitude to an approaching election could
change quite significantly.</hs_para>

written evidence and held public meetings to which a number of
witnesses were called. The Muscular Dystrophy Campaign covered the
costs, including the expenses of those giving evidence. We discovered
in that inquiry that boys with the most severe form, Duchenne muscular
dystrophy, who, when I started work in that field in 1950, were dying,
often grossly deformed, in their teens, were now, with greatly improved
care, living into their 30s and some even into their 40s in places such
as Newcastle, Oxford, Queens Square in London, Oswestry and a number of
other centres, with wonderful rehabilitation and respiratory
support.</hs_para>

that inquiry demonstrated that in the south-west many of them were
still dying in their teens. That was also true in the north-west. When
we produced this report, which went to all the major health bodies
across the country, and it went to the South West Strategic Health
Authority, the executive director, Sir Ian Carruthers, was so shocked
that it immediately put another £1 million into care for
patients with muscular dystrophy and other neuromuscular diseases in
that area. Mike Farrar, then the chief executive of the North West
Strategic Health Authority, said that anything Ian Carruthers could do,
it could do better, so it put money into those services in that

was clearly lobbying with a view to improving services and influencing
the activity of health service organisations. There are number of
people working on that and many other charities to do with things like
stroke, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson’s disease, and another
inquiry into Parkinson’s disease has just been conducted,
demonstrating a similar unevenness of standards of care across the
country. The question is whether the all-party groups serviced by these
charities are at risk under the Bill. It is crucial that we have an
answer from the Minister about this. Many of the charities which
service the all-party groups have expressed serious concern that their
activities might be adversely influenced by the provisions of the

not spoken at Second Reading, I will beg for just a couple of minutes
to put one point to the Minister. These are the most critical of the
amendments. They convey the fundamental problem, which is that while
the Bill and its predecessor are trying to regulate electioneering,
they are actually hitting a whole range of legitimate charitable
activities. The Government may not even guess at the damage that will
be caused by this, all the way up to the review—which is of
course

have spent nearly 40 years working with aid organisations, personally
assisting in the development of advocacy. It is a vital part of their
work, bringing issues of poverty reduction to the attention of the
public during an election campaign. Mr Brake told MPs that charities
would not be caught by controlled expenditure. I am not sure that the
Government yet appreciate that with national, European and local
elections, and possibly referendums, all at different times, the Bill
will or could hurt charities throughout the five-year period, not just
leading up to the election—although we are going to discuss that

the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, demonstrated, there are grey
areas everywhere in the Bill, even if we accept the Government’s
undertakings in the Commons on definition. I have much sympathy with
the Liberal Amendment 160, which is coming up and attempts to exclude
charities altogether; however, it may already be too late for that, as
they are already regulated under PPERA and the Charities Act. The
amendment should attract the Minister, since it makes the point that if
the campaign is not specifically related to a manifesto or proposed
legislation, it should not be counted at all. It will be difficult
enough making the calculation, but at least the Minister should see the
point of the amendment. It is much narrower than subsequent amendments
and should be easier for him to
accept<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:33:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

smaller charities, there is a myth that Clauses 26 and 27 would not
have an impact on them. As we know from coalitions, there is a close
relationship between the larger charities, such as Oxfam and Christian
Aid, and the many smaller ones which they themselves have sponsored.
However, these may now be more independent and in some cases have grown
much larger. So the smaller, specialist agencies are often concerned
with single issues such as appropriate technology, fair trade,
anti-slavery or other aspects of human rights in Burma, Tibet or
Sudan.</hs_para>

of the issues are highly political. The noble Lord, Lord Walton,
mentioned all-party groups; there are many active all-party groups on
specific subjects. These might well be brought to the attention of
campaigning politicians. At the same time, the size of these charities,
while in some cases bringing them over the proposed threshold—I
welcome the Minister’s assurances about the threshold—is
not sufficient to 
<?notus-xml column=1051?>justify the added expense and work involved in what I call selective

point about counting volunteers has already been made. It is often the
smaller charities that depend on volunteers, especially in times of
emergencies. We have also heard about coalitions. In spite of what the

This is only to the good as we look at the Bill in detail. I also thank
the Government for the large amount of activity which has taken place.
For example, my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire has met something
like 40 representatives of separate organisations to discuss their
concerns about the Bill, and we had a letter this weekend from my noble
and learned friend Lord Wallace of Tankerness making it absolutely
clear that the Government are in listening mode. I hope that noble
Lords will not get too tied up in whether this is consultation or not.
The fact is that we are scrutinising legislation and that the
Government are listening to that scrutiny. We do not always get that in

discussion is still taking place within coalition circles, within the

doing, which is to seek a consensus on the Bill that will achieve the

perfect answer, at least to a very satisfactory means of scrutinising
the Bill, by putting forward a number of positive suggestions. I
understand that the commission has said that it would like us to take
its slate as a package. In practice, as the noble Baroness said, if we
come up with something successful at the end of this process, we will
end up with a series of compromises, as we always do, but the Bill will
not be any the worse for

this from the point of view of campaigning groups and charities and of
civil society. That is the purpose for which the commission was set up.
But I hope that it will be recognised that that made the consultation
that the commission carried out, and is still carrying out, incredibly
valuable as it is, one-sided in one respect—that is, that people
involved in fighting the elections, candidates and political parties,
were not part of the consultation. When we scrutinise this legislation,
we must find the right balance between protecting the interests not

dangers that this legislation rightly sets out to prevent and challenge
are, first, that at national level we do not see our national politics
taken over by the super-PAC-type organisations that we see in the
United States, and by what has been described as “big bucks from
big boys”—usually boys, but perhaps sometimes girls as
well. In other words, we should not allow money to dominate. That money
is inevitably from large corporate interests, most if not all of them
on the right. We should not allow them to take over politics in this
country as has happened to a worrying degree across the
Atlantic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:41:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, we should not allow people to buy particular
constituencies simply by throwing a large amount of money at
them—far more than the candidates themselves are allowed to
spend under the regulations. Those are issues that we will come to
later, but that is the basic aim of Part 2, as I understand it. It is
very important that we balance that against all the concerns and the

Assemblies—and proposals being actively put forward by local
government, government agencies and so on. In other words, the normal

159D is another probing amendment, more probing than the previous one.
It would exempt from controlled expenditure rules any campaigning that

that amendment, and concerns with it, but there is a question as to how
far the expenditure controlled by third-party organisations should
relate specifically to the functions of the body that is being elected

trying to do in this House. The first is what I mentioned when asking
for the pause, saying that the request was not a wrecking but a saving
motion. It was saving the Government from themselves and from wrecking
the voluntary sector. That is hugely important. We must make absolutely
certain that the voluntary sector can continue—that is, the
non-party bit—and it must be maintained. Secondly, there is the
package of recommendations which I hope will be accepted. We are
looking no further than the 2015 election, because the third and key
part of this package would seem to be the post-election review, based
on what has been learned. Bearing in mind that everyone is keen that
the process should be transparent, I think that what eventually comes
out should be based on careful examination of what happens during a
natural event, rather than the presumption that this or that might
happen, when we know that many of the measures in the Bill have nothing

confusion and to deal with a lack of clarity and the excessive

160B and 160C deal with two discrete issues that have come up time and
again in my discussions with a large number of organisations, and have
been a feature of our debate this afternoon. They do not attempt to
rewrite the basic definition, which the Electoral Commission has
advised is not susceptible to constructive alteration. The benefit of
that definition, as it stands, is that it has 13 years of practical
experience attached to it and it is an objective test—namely,
“What would a reasonable person think someone is doing?”,
not “What did that person think they were doing when they did
it?”. The latter would be much more subjective. We can never be
sure of someone’s intentions but we can come to some conclusions
about what a reasonable person would think those intentions were. The
amendments seek to make these things clearer
still.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121611000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000186">Amendment
160B sets out the principle that the endorsement of a campaign by a
candidate does not imply that the campaign concerned necessarily
supports the candidate. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie,
referred to a similar situation. This is a very worrying misconception
about the Bill and is much featured in the case studies reported to us:
that is, the notion that the endorsement of a campaign by a candidate
can be construed as that candidate receiving support from that
campaign. The more one thinks about that, the more illogical it is, but
it is clearly a perception and, as is so often the case, a perception
can be even more influential than
reality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121611000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000187">I
recall regularly speaking of the good work done by community groups in
my former constituency. If, by so doing, I could have won the implied
support of those groups, it would have been wonderful. If everything
that I supported had automatically reciprocated that support, I would
have got an even bigger majority than I did, but, of course, that was
simply not the case. The policy objectives of non-party organisations
will often receive flattering praise from a candidate, but the feeling
may not be mutual. That is precisely the grey area that the noble Earl,
Lord Sandwich, referred to just now. It is not absolutely clear in the
Bill that it is not reciprocal. We deserve to try to make sure for
everybody’s benefit that the Bill is so improved that we know
precisely where we are. That needs clarity. I hope that Members of your
Lordships’ House will accept that our amendment is intended to
do precisely that—to clarify the

160C gives an opportunity for the Minister to address some other
matters that are ambiguous under the PPERA 2000 definition of non-party
campaigning; that is, the extent to which the remotest praise for a
candidate by a campaign can be said to be “promoting or
procuring” his or her electoral success, or that of their party.
In particular, we have all seen in the past—indeed, I think I
prepared them when I was not a Member of either House—the
score-cards of different parties’ positioning on different
policies. These assess the policies of various parties against the
policies of that particular organisation. Again, it may seem to us
within the political system that it is perfectly logical that it does
not automatically mean that you are seeking to procure or promote the
election of a candidate, but we need clarity for everyone outside that
that is the 
<?notus-xml column=1056?>case. People are not normally involved in the political process. It is
not absolutely clear at present whether this activity would or would
not be regarded as promoting or procuring the electoral success
of’ the party or candidate that comes out best in that
score-card assessment. Again, a little more clarity would be extremely
helpful. Even if we were forced back on to the 2000 Act,
rather than producing this new Bill, we would be wanting to deal with
that particular problem as a matter of
urgency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121611000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000189">A
remote suggestion that a candidate has done something right by, say, an
organisation congratulating that candidate at a press conference for
adopting a particular policy, is a grey area in precisely the terms
that have already been referred to in this afternoon’s debate.
It is important that we should make sure as soon as possible that this
amendment could provide an opportunity to clarify the situation once
and for all. The Electoral Commission advice is that a non-party
organisation could not be accused retrospectively of “promoting
or procuring the electoral success” of a candidate or party,
just because that party or candidate had adopted some of the positions
of the organisation. The House, however, is entitled to ask the
Minister this afternoon to give that position his very clear attention

as it would seem to be intended in the

he also shed some light on the position after a candidate or party
announces its support for a policy, which is supported by a non-party

massive increase in the scale of the organisation’s campaigning
clearly as a result of promoting the candidate who is supporting their
view, then it would not reasonably be regarded as campaigning for that
candidate simply by virtue of doing what it had been doing all along.

clarity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121611000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121611000191">Some

recommendation is that this is one of the areas that is to be
considered by the review, which the Minister has assured us will take
place after the 2015 election. Certainly if the definition of the noble

have added my name in a personal capacity to the two amendments of the

pretty obvious and I shall not repeat the reasons he gave. However,
perhaps I may anticipate, rather too boldly, the response that the
Government are likely to make: that these kinds of issues can be dealt
with in guidance. However, the strong message that we picked up from
charities and campaigning groups was that they would like to see far
more clarity in the legislation itself—exactly what the noble
Lord, Lord Tyler, was calling for. These are just the areas in which
clarity in the law is essential. For instance, as regards score-cards,
mentioned by the noble Lord, members of the commission and charities
generally picked up two conflicting messages from two different
Ministers in the other place. One seemed to suggest that score-cards
were perfectly allowable and would not be caught by the Bill; the other
seemed to suggest precisely the opposite—and we have that on
record. If two Ministers in the other place who are meant to be
supporting the Bill are actually sending out different messages, this
highlights the need for something to be stated as clearly as possible
in the

organisations that have been to see Ministers, expressed their
concerns, and been told repeatedly, “You have absolutely nothing
to worry about; you would not be caught by any of this”. It is a

that it would not then be caught, because it is not promoting or
procuring 
<?notus-xml column=1059?>the electoral success of one or more particular registered parties.

invite one party: does that then mean that it is caught

echo the concerns expressed by a number of noble Lords about the Bill
and support the thrust of their amendments, which aim to make this bad
Bill a little less bad. I also want to argue that Clause 26 should not
stand part of the Bill. As has been said, the Government paused, but
not for long enough and, more seriously, they then did nothing. There
was no consultation—which as we have just heard is about more
than just listening—because whatever they heard they made no
changes. Even today, after all that, we have only the promise of a
review about whether the Bill is fit for purpose after we have had an
election with it, and the promise of a revision of the thresholds, but
without the all-important figures before us. The Government’s
inaction is in stark contrast to the NCVO and the Harries commission,

NCVO heard from 140 of its members and engaged with MPs, civil society

thought, it listened and responded. The Government, by contrast,
refused a proper committee to take evidence but then failed to use the
time to produce their own amendments. They have failed to ask for
written evidence and they have failed to produce a report of what they

have still failed to believe the warnings of chill, uncertainty and

College of Nursing, which says that the Bill will restrict the
activities of organisations 
<?notus-xml column=1061?>that seek legitimately to influence public policy in the run-up to an
election. Indeed, the nurses say that if they are curtailed from
raising concerns, this may pose a risk to standards of care in the NHS.
Not only did the Government not heed these warnings, they have sought
to dismiss them by asking others, not themselves, to change their view
of the Bill. It is really no good the Minister today, or indeed Mr
Brake, telling these groups that they need not worry if their own

Government were forced to apply the brakes to this Bill to avoid defeat
in your Lordships’ House on 5 November, but instead
of using that pause to think again, they left the Bill unamended, with
its chilling effect on democracy. I am sure that that is not what the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, expected when he withdrew his Motion for a
longer pause. He said that he hoped the Minister would exercise
flexibility, and that if, when the consultation gets under way, it
cannot be done in time, consideration should be given to pushing the
Committee days further back to enable proper examination. Today, the
noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has used the word
“disappointed”. It is not delay we seek, unless perhaps
to the Report stage if we are not to agree the amendments in advance.

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> I do not think that any one clause
quite does that, but it is interesting if that is the noble
Lord’s interpretation. Assuming that we take the
Government’s intention as genuine—we can perhaps agree
that this should just be about transparency—our view is that the
extension of the scope has the unintended consequence of extending it
from purely publications to an enormous range of other activities and
things such as staff costs, transport and hire of halls. That
fundamentally alters the position, which is what we are questioning. Is
the effect of the Bill the same as the
intent—transparency—or is the 
<?notus-xml column=1063?>effect the chilling one that every charity and community group is
telling us about?
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:23:05"></hs_TimeCode> feels like
watching the Army march, with one young soldier out of line and his
mother saying, “My son is marching properly but everyone else is
out of step”. It seems that everyone who is commenting on the
Bill has worries about the effect—except, of course, the
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121624000002">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:24:31"></hs_TimeCode>

backwards rather than forwards, the NUS-Lib Dem antics over tuition
fees would have been permissible? My reading is that they would not
have been, that the NUS would have been caught had it spent too much. I
have the feeling—and the NUS shares the figures on
this—that, including events, press campaign tools, photographs,
travel and related staff costs, the photos of those various Lib Dem
candidates pledging not to increase tuition fees would have been caught
by these rules, therefore requiring the NUS to register and account for
all its costs. The interesting question is whether that would be the
case.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:24:38"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121624000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="13121624000102" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0001.htm#13121624000102">Lord
Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> I wonder what the noble Baroness is

PPERA, is completely different from non-party expenditure, which is
what we are debating in Part 2 of the Bill. I want to give the noble

by candidates seeking election is clearly

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> The NUS and other student groups
have raised an interesting question about work done in the year before
an election. Can the noble and learned Lord assure the student
groups—and it is the Bangor student union that has been writing
to noble Lords—that they can continue to campaign? The fact that
student groups are concerned is another example of the uncertainty
about this issue. It is not just charities: other groups would also
need to be concerned that expenditure on a campaign like tuition
fees—or the Stop the War coalition, which we knew rather a lot
about—early on before a general election could fall within this.
If a political party adopted what another group had been campaigning on
and that became a big issue at an election—I recall that the
Iraq war was such an issue—then the work done maybe 12 months
before the election would be caught by this provision. If we understand
it correctly—and this is why a stand part debate is absolutely
right for this bit—this clause would have the effect of
expanding the scope of the Bill to bring into account the cost, in that
12 months, of activities like rallies, marches, hire of transport,
stewarding and all those sorts of things.</hs_para>

to raise on this clause is the administrative burden brought in by the
addition of these types of activities; they are separate from
publications, which are relatively easy to account for. It is
interesting that another part of the Government is doing a lot about
getting rid of red tape at the moment. Last month, this House agreed a
statutory instrument 
<?notus-xml column=1064?>allowing small companies to no longer do full accounts if they do not
exceed two of either: gross assets of over one-third of a million
pounds, a turnover of over two-thirds of a million pounds or an average
of 10 employees. That will not apply to charities, which are
excluded, but it will exempt other small groups from having to do full
accounts. However, those exact same groups, having been relieved by BIS
from all that red tape, will, because of the extended activities
related to the items included in this clause, have to go through an
enormous, complicated, bureaucratic form-filling process.</hs_para>

activities. If it is an activity which would pass the threshold and be
seen as intended to promote or procure an electoral advantage for a

a common slip of the tongue. Indeed, the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter,

expenditure comes within the regulation, not whether it is ruled out.
However, let us imagine that during a UK general election the Scottish
Parliament is considering a Bill that is highly controversial in
Scotland and that is being promoted by the present SNP Scottish
Government but opposed by everybody else. If organisations in Scotland

Registration is a threat to many of these organisations. They do not

The noble Baroness raises a point that was at the core of the points
made by my noble friend Lord Tyler about when there is a change in a
particular policy. This brings us to an important issue about what
should be in the Bill and what should be left to guidance. This point
was also made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, who asked
about groups changing their policy position in the middle of the

misrepresented the point. What happens if the group maintains its
campaign and one party suddenly comes on board and, presumably, one
party breaks rank and retreats? The Electoral Commission’s
guidance is clear that if a party or candidate subsequently adopts a
campaigning organisation’s policy, it will not be caught unless
the campaigning organisation draws attention to the fact or increases
its campaigning as a result. In addition, a group must be reasonably
regarded as intending to procure electoral success. If at the time a
party or candidate does not have a policy on the subject of the
organisation’s campaign, it is very difficult to see how it
could be seen to be promoting that candidate or the party. Indeed, it
would seem to be impossible to objectively argue that a policy campaign
by a third party could be intended to favour a party or candidates if
those parties’ or candidates’ views on the policy were
unknown at the
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000044">A
question was also asked about the scorecard count. A third party
setting out a scorecard 11 months before an election could reasonably

promoting the electoral success of a party or candidate.</hs_para>

It is a matter for the Welsh Government. However, we must always be

2 of the Bill regulates more closely the spending during election
campaigns by those who are not standing and are not registered as a
political party. It also reduces the number of spending limits by
non-political parties and registered third parties. Organisations must
comply with “controlled expenditure” limits for that
organisation. This is defined as the expenditure associated with the
production of material made available to the public at large. The Welsh
Language Commissioner is concerned that the cost of translating
election material falls within this definition and I tend to agree with
her. The Bill makes no provision to reduce or offset the cost of such
translation in relation to the Welsh language and could therefore
adversely affect the present situation. Reduced expenditure as proposed
in the Bill would adversely affect the provision of bilingual election
material in Wales. It is possible to envisage a situation where some
non-political parties and third parties chose not to issue bilingual
election material for fear of reaching or exceeding the threshold.
Hence, I need an assurance that the proposed spending limits should
take account of the additional costs that come with providing election
material in Wales. My amendment is drafted to seek to ensure that the
limit in the Bill on expenditure shall not include costs incurred by
the translation of those materials to Welsh or to English as the case
may be. I beg to

and campaigning organisations accept that a wider range of activities
needs to be taken into account. It is part of their wider conviction
that charities should be regulated and be transparent. There is
absolutely no problem about that. As Amendment 165B points
out, there are real difficulties about including staff time in
expenditure that counts as a qualifying expense. There is the
difficulty of separating staff time used on campaigns generally from
that which is directed specifically towards elections, particularly if
this is to take place during a whole year—the regulatory burden
on charities would be quite disproportionate. The Royal Society for the
Protection of Birds says in the

the activities that count towards controlled expenditure would require
significant new reporting procedures, including time sheets to account
for staff time connected with campaigns and systems for recording
spending in regional offices. This would siphon money away from

is also important to note that the Electoral Commission, though its
long-term view is that staff time should be included both for
third-party organisations and political parties—for which at the
moment it is not included—says quite clearly in its latest
briefing that such are the difficulties of including this that it
should not be included before the 2015 campaign. That is a very clear
and strong recommendation.</hs_para>

the proposed new section in Amendment 165B concerns translation. We
firmly support what the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of
Aberavon, has said. The cost of translation from Welsh to English and
English to Welsh should not be included. Our amendment goes slightly
wider than simply translation because it would also include things such
as Braille. The Electoral Commission also supports this although it
says that production costs should not be included. I do not think the
Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement would agree with
that because the production costs are also extra as a result of the
translations. It is not just the job of hiring a translator but also
the costs of printing the extra pages in
Welsh.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000059">Proposed
new subsection (1)(c) concerns safety and security. This is obviously
one of the concerns that arose from Northern Ireland. At the moment our
amendment refers to safety and security for meetings. The Electoral
Commission has very valuably added that “rallies” should
be included here and I think the Commission on Civil Society and
Democratic Engagement would certainly support that. Proposed new
subsection (1)(d) refers to documents making 
<?notus-xml column=1075?>material available for people who are either physically or in any other
way disabled. That, again, is an extra expense which should not be
counted as part of the qualifying expenses. I hope that the Government
will also bring forward an amendment to ensure that extra expenses by
disabled groups—for instance, to get them to meetings, which can
amount to quite a lot—would be included in subsection (1)(c) of
the proposed new clause, which obviously concerns the safety of
disabled people at meetings and rallies.</hs_para>

“supporters” is defined rather narrowly in terms of
donations. Of course, the modern understanding of
“supporters” over all sorts of different media is much
wider than that. The commission believes that it has a way of solving
that by reference to the Data Protection Act, whereby those who have
given consent to be contacted by the organisation, in accordance with
the Data Protection Act, should count as “supporters”. We
hope very much that the Government will look sympathetically at that as

Morris of Aberavon, but one can take the matter slightly further. The
issue is whether the translation of certain documents from Welsh into
English or English into Welsh should be regarded as relevant
expenditure under Clause 26. The next issue is whether the position of
the Welsh language is so

with that general declaration, which must be one of the most drastic
and impudent in legislation, was an attack upon the Welsh language.
Nothing would count in so far as the validity of documents in court was
concerned unless they were in the English tongue. There have been many
amendments to that; one was the Welsh Courts Act 1942, which dealt with
the minor matter of the right of witnesses and parties to speak the
Welsh language in a Welsh court. The main Act, referred to by the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Morris, was the Welsh Language Act 1967, which
brought about the principle, which one cannot overstress, of equal
validity. That meant that anything that was done in Welsh was of equal
validity as if it had been done in English. That would be the case, for
example, for a will, a conveyance, a lease, an instrument of transfer,
a deed of settlement or anything of that nature. Where it dealt with an
official form, there was a machinery set up to produce such forms with
that automatic
validity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:16:40"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
amendment is not conceded, I submit that one would be undermining that
principle of equal validity. It is a small, narrow and confined matter,
but one of absolute
principle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000069">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:17:02"></hs_TimeCode>
have dwelt on these historical background features also for this
reason. I regard the noble and learned Lord as a person of considerable
reason and good will. Even in this season of good will, however, it may
well be that he will be mildly tempted to say, “Ah well, much as
we appreciate the position of the Welsh language and admire its
situation—one of the oldest living languages in Europe, spoken
for at least 1,500 years and probably more—we do not think this
necessary, nor that we should do it. We are afraid that a whole Babel
of other languages will be brought into consideration at the same time,
and there will be people from all parts of the world using different
languages in our British community saying, ‘Let us have the same
position as the Welsh language’”. If that argument were
advanced—and it may be that I do the noble and learned Lord no
justice whatever—it would be utterly spurious. The position of
the Welsh language is defined in statute by the Acts I have mentioned,
those of 1942, 1967 and the Welsh Language Act 1993. That last was
brought about by the initiative of our late colleague Lord Roberts of
Conwy, a splendid statesman of a man; we miss him very much. Those
three Acts put the Welsh language in a wholly unique
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:18:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Wigley (PC):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to pursue the theme
that has been running for the past few minutes, and to give support to
the amendment in the name of the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries. As the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, said, it is a poignant
moment for the Welsh language, in that the late Lord Roberts of Conwy
is no longer with us. He played a major part in the 1993 Act and many
other aspects of the Welsh language gaining status. Of course, the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, and the noble Lord,
Lord Elystan-Morgan, played roles as government Ministers when the 1967
Act was passed. That Act changed the status of the Welsh language
fundamentally, bringing in the concept of equal validity. However, for
equal validity to work, it presumed that the individual could have
access to both languages. The corollary to this was the development of
the availability of forms and information in Wales through the medium
of Welsh as well as English in order to respond to that principle and
put flesh around
it<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000071">Over
the past 40 or 50 years, there has been tremendous acceptance of Wales
as a bilingual community. Campaigning organisations in the voluntary as
well as the governmental sector have come to recognise the need, in
order to allow citizens to have their full rights with regard to the
language, to pursue, as far as is practical, a bilingual policy.
Official bilingualism is what makes personal and private equal validity
a meaningful concept. Some organisations may feel the additional costs
that inevitably go along with publishing things in two languages to be
a burden. Some organisations may, frankly, be glad of an excuse not to
do it. If that were the case, it would be a step backwards—a
step that might start unwinding the consensus that has been achieved
with considerable difficulty and after a lot of campaigning across the
political sectors. I therefore urge the Minister to give serious
consideration to the principles behind this amendment and to agree, if
assurances regarding the fears that have been expressed cannot be given
now, that at least some thought will be given between now and Report to
how these can be
accommodated<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000072">The
principle of access to information is equally valid for disabled
people. I have campaigned very long and hard for many years to make
sure that disabled people get the information that they need. Very
often, that means providing an approach in individual circumstances,
sometimes in group circumstances, as opposed to providing generality.
One does not generally see Braille going to every household in case an
individual might need it. One might argue that it should, but it is not
generally the case. However, with the Welsh language, there is a
general approach; both arguments are valid, but valid in slightly
different ways and in slightly different circumstances. I hope that the

Mallalieu (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendments in my
name and that of the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, to
which he has spoken so fully. I have one or two points to add. First,
on staff costs, I respectfully suggest that one has to remember that as
the regulated activities are going to 
<?notus-xml column=1078?>be expanded, it is inevitable that the staff costs associated with them
will grow. How those activities are to be expanded is another matter,
but we all agree that there are matters that should now be included
that have not been up to now. The growth in staff costs is a further
reason for increasing the threshold of spending, not just from the
level in the Bill, but from the existing PPERA level, in order to give
a fair
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:23:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000074">Secondly,
on translation, I slightly hesitate to raise this matter, but it is
sometimes necessary to communicate with communities that do not have
English as their first language. Although there has been special
pleading on behalf of Wales, which I totally accept and endorse, there
may well be other communities for which that may be a legitimate
expense in certain circumstances. It may be necessary to communicate,
perhaps in Urdu, in relation to a particular campaign. I submit that,
in order to enable a campaign to communicate, translation is something
that the Minister ought to have uppermost in his mind. It is also right
to say that safety and security, which the commission looked at,
relates not just to Northern Ireland—although particularly so
there—but also to those who steward meetings and so on. That is
an expense that is very often essential and ought not to be included in
regulated
expenditure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:24:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000075">It
also seems wrong to proceed with part of the recommendation of the
Electoral Commission about staff costs and leave the other part behind.
I have in mind the review of the Electoral Commission back in June,
which suggested that rules should be widened to include staff costs for
political parties. The Bill, of course, does not deal with the
political parties, but it seems wrong to advance one and not the other.
There should be parity between non-government organisations and
political parties in respect of declared expenditure. The Electoral
Commission accepted that, so far as political parties were concerned,
the matter would be difficult, not straightforward, and would require
more consideration because it was so complex. In making the
same recommendation for non-party campaigning, it again said that it
was complex, potentially controversial, which it certainly is, and
needed further
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:25:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121624000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121624000076">It
seems that there is no real urgency about the question of staff costs
being included for the 2015 election. I may be wrong. A spectre was
raised by the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, and I have also heard it from
Ministers: what about the as yet unidentified ogre who comes out of the
woodwork carrying bags of money to throw into an election campaign,
perhaps in a particular area, and to distort the democratic process?
What about the US-style zillionaires, of which, I have to say, there is
no sign in this country? This scenario seems unlikely because we have
rather different rules for television advertising and so on. However,
if such people really are lurking, ready to come in and try to buy the
electoral process here, surely it is for the Government to produce an
amendment to the Bill that deals with that situation, rather than
simply taking a big stick and thrashing all around, hitting smaller
charities and organisations as well. I ask the Minister to agree that,
at this stage, it is not really important to include staff costs for
the 2015 election, given that we are going to have a review which
should take in political parties as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:27:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_16_PT_1/BAD558E180D10B21CBD3764A2C668CF2917E2384" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 December 2013">Monday,

objectives. I am very sympathetic to those which have already been

Amendments 160J, 165A and 165D. These all result directly from

group deals with Schedule 3 and how particular activities might be
excluded from the list of those which come under controlled
expenditure. There is a principle in current electoral law that
communication with one’s own members is not “election
material”, and therefore it is excluded from the sort of
controls and transparency that is being looked at here. However,
membership is becoming—sadly, many of us feel—an almost
outmoded concept. Organisations do not need members in order to have
clear, regular supporters. Many prefer to seek funding through periodic
contributions rather than through the straitjacket of an annual
membership subscription. The concept may well have been more
appropriate, more formidable and more general at the time of the 2000
Act, but it is surely disappearing rather quickly now. It is in that
context that I believe there should be some degree of flexibility in
relation to Schedule

is particularly in the nature of a non-party campaign that you can be
on board on one issue, but not on another. You simply lend your support
as you see fit from time to time, but you are still a committed
supporter of that organisation or campaign. This idea of a committed
supporter is one which the Electoral Commission itself has recognised,
so it seems sensible that the Bill should pick that up and define it
more clearly. Our Amendment 160J does just that. It defines a committed
supporter as someone who has made a donation, or who in the past 12
months has either communicated directly with the organisation or
expressly consented to receive the organisation’s
communications.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121629000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000004">The
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and his colleagues, have
tried to deal with that problem in their Amendment 165B—so we
are on the same track. My difficulty with their amendment is that it
sets a very low bar for becoming a committed supporter. Anyone who uses
e-mail knows how much correspondence we all get from people to whom we
have given permission under the Data Protection Act for contact to be
made. It is very easy—too easy—to give that consent. So I
am afraid that the Data Protection Act is, in this context,
insubstantial and
insufficient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:30:12"></hs_TimeCode>.
Our amendment sets the bar a little higher, so that a supporter is not
just the passive recipient over decades of many quickly deleted

active participation and active support rather than just a reactive
response. These activities would count toward making someone a
committed supporter of the organisation under our amendment. Simply
receiving the e-mail and ignoring it would not make you a supporter,
just as receiving a cold call from a salesperson and not buying their 
<?notus-xml column=1080?>product does not make you a customer of the salesperson’s
company. We think this is a fair level at which to draw the bar for who
counts as a supporter, since otherwise communications to millions of
quite passive non-supporters could be excluded from counting as
election material. That would not be transparency, and we do not think
it would be right. Our amendment provides a fairer, more effective and

165A deals with the staff issue, which is a matter of considerable
concern to organisations large and small. The Electoral Commission
supports counting staff costs for political parties’ election
expenses, as the noble Baroness said. That is something to which
another Parliament will doubtless return—I hope very soon. Our
amendment again seeks a balance on this issue. We do not think a
blanket exemption on all staff costs is right, because staff costs can
be very important. They already have to be recorded by non-party
organisations for the production and distribution of election material,
and rightly so, for the simple reason that they could otherwise
directly employ people to run around constituencies delivering
leaflets, and it would not count against the expenses limits. Likewise,
we think it right to include staff costs for paid canvassers. If
someone employs people to canvass on their behalf, in an attempt to
promote or procure electoral success, that is surely significant and
should be recorded—it should be transparent. However, we do not
believe that it makes sense to include the internal staff costs
associated with booking a venue for a press conference or rally, or
travel time to attend it, for example—a few half hours in the
day, or whatever it might be, which would not normally be recorded,
particularly by smaller organisations. These are things of a kind that
are very unlikely to matter in the end to the likely electoral outcome,
but they add a level of bureaucracy that a lot of organisations would
regret. Charities would not like to pay yet more administrative costs
against the main purpose of their charitable enterprise. All of us

is unnecessary to ask organisations to try to account for a half hour
here or there spent booking a room, by someone whose annual salary is
perhaps £30,000 and who is paid all the rest of the year for

exclude staff costs from the activities relating to press conferences,
public meetings and transport. We believe that this would remove

directly employed and full time should be included in election
expenses; that would be something that it would want to press. But one
accepts that in the context that we are now talking about, in the short
time before the next general election, sorting all this out would be
very difficult and would pose huge problems for many charities, which
may have very large staffs. Most associations that fight general
elections have extremely small staffs—almost no full-time staff,
in many cases—and exist entirely on volunteers. We tend to
forget that. I am not speaking on the Electoral Commission’s
behalf, as I keep stressing, but that is something that it has wisely
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121629000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000013">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>

by paid staff; you either exempt them as a block or you include them.
In the case of the next general election, as it says in the briefing

establish whether a membership organisation which has more than one

example, whether the BMA which holds multiple conferences annually for
its members, would fall within the annual conferences exemption. Quite
apart from our annual general meeting, there are also annual
conferences for all the different specialty sections, such as general
practitioners, consultants, junior doctors, public health doctors, and
so on. Could the Minister clarify whether expenditure associated with

reasonable to expect that this could be addressed in guidance to follow
from the Electoral Commission, an assurance from the Government about
their intention on the scope of the exemption would be welcome. It
would be helpful to know what would occur if such an annual conference
attracted a great deal of public interest. Would it then become a
public meeting that should be captured under the Bill? A members-only
conference with a public element could happen in a number of ways, for
example by inviting comment on health issues, the attendance of
observers, or providing access to the conference via a webcast or
through the media. I raised this question at Second Reading and I would

that contacting people, charities and other campaigning organisations

expenditure”. I wish to make two main points. First, as my noble
friend Lord Tyler said, these days, membership of charities and other
campaigning organisations is generally not defined by an annual
subscription. It might have much more to do with following the
organisation on social media, actively agreeing to receive e-mails or
some other way of actively engaging with the organisation concerned.
Certainly, my experience of the organisations for which I have worked,
and which I continue to support, perhaps in connection with children
and families or campaigning for older people, is that you might feel
very strongly indeed about a particular issue, perhaps to do with
health, a specific disability or housing, and therefore lend your
support to it. Indeed, you might be very actively engaged with it from
time to time but do not necessarily support every activity and issue
that the organisation concerned is involved in. However, you should
still count as a very committed supporter of the relevant
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:59:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121629000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000031">Although
there are other amendments in this group, and Amendment 165B clearly
also tries to get the right definition of “committed

right place in terms of having to have some sort of active engagement
with an organisation rather than simply being a passive recipient of
e-mails, for reasons we have already heard. Amendment 160J would

want to make only one point. Even the heroic efforts of the civil

because it seems to me that our views on the Bill could be very
different if we are looking at something that will do up until the next

will need to be incorporated in some way because they could make a real
difference in terms of promoting or procuring electoral success.

Morgan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I did not intend to speak in this
debate but I wish to comment briefly in support of the amendment moved
by my noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon, which was
supported by the noble Lords, Lord Elystan-Morgan and Lord Wigley. It
seems to me that if that amendment is not accepted, the consequence
would be both unfair and illogical. It would be unfair because the
Welsh language would be regarded as a burden and an additional incubus
on an organisation rather than as something that ought to happen
naturally, and which was sanctioned by the law in 1967 and 1993. It
would also be illogical because it would run counter to what has
happened over many decades in civil society in Wales and elsewhere such
as local government, the social services and, in my own experience, in
higher education. When I was vice-chancellor of the University of
Wales, which is now almost defunct, significant procedures were in
place for translating papers into Welsh and back into English and
facilities for simultaneous translation. These were a natural part of
our working processes in the university and, importantly, did not
impose an extra charge. They did not take money away, as it were, from
education, teaching or
research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121629000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000035">This
brief debate has shown that constitutional law and legal proceedings
have often lagged behind what is happening in civil society or,
frankly, have lagged behind common sense. I was struck by that when I
listened to the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan. He
referred to the Act of Union of 1536, which was an almost totalitarian
measure intended 
<?notus-xml column=1087?>to extinguish the Welsh language for public purposes. However, it was
nullified by other developments in Wales at that time, not in the legal
or political spheres but particularly by developments in religion. The
most important phenomenon of that century was the translation of the
Bible into Welsh by Bishop Morgan, although I am afraid that I cannot
claim him as an ancestor. That seems to be a way in which civil society
has civilised and nullified the effect of constitutional law, and I
hope that it will do so
again.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_16_PT_1/09DCE60F9C970BC8FBAE5BD0FA6A1CEB93B98BF6" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 December 2013">Monday,

Horam, that it is not unusual for this House to take a number of
amendments together, I point out that the Electoral Commission
emphasised that we have to consider the cumulative impact of a number
of different parts of this legislation. This was also a point
emphasised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights, so it is not

simply want to highlight very briefly a few of the points covered by
them. The first is the question of access to information for disabled

only equitable that that is taken into

second point, which we have not talked about as much, is the question
of public meetings. The NCVO in its latest briefing picked this up,
referring to the report of the Joint Committee on Human

legislation on the human right to freedom of association. That is very
important. The NCVO refers to a number of organisations having flagged
this up, particularly with regard to disability, welfare and social
security reform issues. The concern is about the high cost associated
with organising a rally of some form and the subsequent impact this
would have on campaigning activity through the rest of a regulated

final point is on the question of the definition of

amendment joins so many others in seeking to preserve the freedoms of
not-for-profit organisations seeking to influence government and

public meetings where expenses include costs in connection with the
attendance of persons at the event, the hire of premises and provision
of goods, services and facilities. So this is about all costs

first is the case of the Countryside Alliance’s opposition to
the hunting ban in 2001 and 2005—an example that is known to a
number of your Lordships. In the run-up to the 2001 and 2005 general
elections, the alliance mobilised its supporters and the general public
against the hunting ban—activities which in total required a
pretty high level of expenditure, including demonstrations and rallies
against the hunting ban, press conferences to promote the event,
transport costs for those attending the events, and producing and
distributing leaflets to promote the events. The Countryside Alliance
is not linked to any one political party. However, because the issue of
hunting can be seen as highly partisan, with the hunting ban more 
<?notus-xml column=1089?>associated with the Labour Party, all the costs incurred in these events
would have counted towards the alliance’s expenditure. Had the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 been amended as
the Bill proposes at the time the hunting Bill made its way through
Parliament, the ability of organisations such as the alliance to oppose
the proposed ban and organise marches and rallies would have been
severely

in the run up to the Copenhagen climate change summit in 2009 and the
UK general election in 2010, the organisations in the Stop Climate
Chaos coalition worked on a range of events, including outdoor rallies;
the Wave, a march through London attended by 50,000 supporters; and
schools’ conferences held with schools from across England to
talk about climate change, with MPs invited to a panel debate. Under
the new rules proposed by the Bill, even if lower spending limits are
not pursued, it is likely that the various activities carried out by
the coalition would have exceeded the maximum amount allowed, forcing
the coalition to stop its

and finally, the Women’s Institute’s Great Food Debate
involved a programme of work on food security and was launched at an
event in York in December 2012 with a report on food security. The
event was free, open to the public and included a panel at which the
Environment Secretary, Owen Paterson MP, gave a keynote speech. Members
of the WI and members of the public attended the launch and debate,
with another in Cardiff the following month. The Great Food Debate is
designed to explore the concept of pressure on the food system and
provide an opportunity to engage with the public. The National
Federation of Women’s Institutes encourages WIs all over the
country to replicate its national work by hosting their own local and
regional Great Food Debates. All this generated significant media
coverage, including local and regional coverage. The Great Food Debate

addition, the Environment Secretary used the platform as an opportunity
to call for further consideration by the public of GM and

12 months before one of the elections covered by it, the related costs
would take the National Federation of Women’s Institutes over
the registration threshold, with all the consequences that that would
imply. All local WIs and federations would have to register as
third-party campaigners with the Electoral Commission because the NFWI
would have spent more than the registration threshold in creating the

for a giving such a thorough explanation of why the Government need to
take away Schedule 3 and think again. The many increases in activities
that count towards qualifying expenses in this part of the Bill account
for a great deal of its unworkability, and for the concerns and fears
that have been raised in civil society. My noble friend Lady Lister
rightly spoke of the cumulative effect of the various measures in the

people’s views of

Minister, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, said that
volunteers would not be covered in the Bill, but that is not enough. It
is clear that the main problem with Schedule 3 is the inclusion of
staff costs as a qualifying expense. Political parties are not subject
to this requirement and it is therefore unclear why the Government
believe that charities and NGOs should be. It is worth looking at the
original document from the Electoral Commission that the Government
claim as the inspiration for some of the Bill. It said, as regards
counting the staff time of political
parties:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121629000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000150">“Bringing
directly employed staff costs within the scope of the spending controls

this is the case for political parties, the same would apply to
charities and NGOs. Indeed, they have presented a great deal of
evidence about the burden that would be placed on them. Amnesty
International has pointed out that during an election period it
produces manifestos on human rights, organises hustings, undertakes
pledge-card activity and co-ordinates media activities. These
activities could mean that the new spending thresholds would be met,
and therefore staff time would have to meet new reporting requirements
that would seriously draw on resources—a reminder that with this
Bill it is often the new provisions taken together that would work to
stifle democratic expression. That is what the larger organisations
fear. The smaller ones, however, would struggle to an even greater
extent to meet the onerous reporting
requirements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121629000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000054">The
NCVO has presented a case study that amply demonstrates this. If, for
instance, a small disability charity campaigning on welfare reform
employs an additional member of staff to run local campaigns in the
run-up to the election, the charity must account 
<?notus-xml column=1091?>for the person’s time and monitor which activities undertaken by
local groups could amount to controlled expenditure. Even if a simple
approach were taken by looking at a yearly salary, this could
immediately bring the organisation over the threshold—for
example, one public affairs officer on £30,000 per year. Surely
the Government, who talk so often and so loudly about reducing red
tape, are not prepared to place such a regulatory burden on charities.
The noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, cited the example of
the RSPB, which contends that the impact assessment prepared for Part 2
understates the extent to which it will mean that charities and NGOs
will have to spend money on administration rather than on their core
work. The RSPB
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121629000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000152">“This

staff costs are not the only additional requirement. The noble Lord,
Lord Tyler, also raised the important point that charities
understandably are mindful of staffing costs. Fortunately, noble Lords
have in many of the amendments in this group presented the Government
with options that they can use to remove the increased burden that the
Bill presents. We heard many compelling instances and speeches, not
least the preceding one made by the noble Lord, Lord Best, citing the
case made by the excellent NCVO. The case of the Countryside Alliance
and the hunting ban is instructive, and I hope that the Minister will
answer that specific point. The noble Lord, Lord Best, was also right
to point out that it is the media that put a political perspective into
many of the campaigns. I am not entirely sure how one can provide for
that in the

names of my noble and learned friend Lord Morris and the noble Lord,
Lord Elystan-Morgan, takes the critical step of excluding from campaign
expenditure translation into Welsh or English. As my noble and learned
friend said, English and Welsh should have equal validity, which should
not be jeopardised by the Bill. Noble Lords have spoken of Lord Roberts
of Conwy, who did so much for the Welsh language. I have to say that
were he here this evening, I have no doubt that he would support the
amendment. As my noble and learned friend pointed out, the Bill as
drafted could mean that an organisation might choose not to publish its
campaign material in Welsh in order not to breach the spending limits.

3 inserts a new Schedule 8A into the PPERA Act 2000. That new schedule
expands the activities on which expenditure by a recognised third party
will be controlled expenditure. Under existing legislation, only
expenditure on election material made available to the public is
controlled expenditure. This is retained as an activity that counts
towards controlled expenditure within this Bill. However, the new
schedule extends the range of activities that are qualifying expenses
for the purposes of controlled expenditure. These include: market
research involving the public or canvassing; public rallies and other
public events, excluding annual conferences; press conferences or other
organised media events; and transport.</hs_para>

159G in the name of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of
Aberavon. This would amend Clause 26 so that costs incurred by third
parties translating materials from English to Welsh or Welsh
to English would be excluded. I am very conscious of the Welsh Language
Act 1993, and, as I was reflecting on the debate today, I considered
precisely what my late friend Lord Roberts of Conwy would
have thought about these matters. He was such a well

interestingly, that under that Act—which
places<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:23:27"></hs_TimeCode> an
obligation on public bodies—political parties, candidates and
third parties do not fall under the definition of a public body.
Therefore, there is no legal obligation to translate election materials
from English to Welsh or Welsh to English. However, having said that,
the Government believe that the Welsh Language Act 1993 includes an
obligation to treat Welsh and English on an equal basis and that there
is a strong and compelling case for translation costs to be excluded.
The noble Lords, Lord Elystan-Morgan, Lord Wigley and Lord Morgan, made
that very clear as well, with references to 1,500 years of language and
the Act of Union, so the Government will consider how this exclusion
would operate and will want to return to this important issue on

also want to raise the issue of committed supporters. Amendment 160J,
in the name of my noble friend Lord Tyler, amends Schedule 3 so that
costs associated with sending material to committed supporters would be
excluded from the calculation of cost-controlled expenditure. The costs
of sending material to members or certain supporters are already
excluded, as PPERA and the Bill make clear. The material or activity
must be available or open to the public, which for these purposes would
not include those members or supporters. As the existing Electoral
Commission guidance makes clear, the exact nature of a committed
supporter will vary between organisations, but could include regular
donors by direct debit, people with an annual subscription or people
who are actively involved in a third
party.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121629000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#13121629000067">However,
this amendment goes very much further than that: it defines committed

In the Government’s view, this would greatly, and unacceptably,
widen the exclusion. At present, the Electoral Commission does not
consider people to be committed supporters if they have simply signed
up to a social networking site or tools, or to appear on mailing lists

that the Electoral Commission guidance is the correct approach to

course, the Government also acknowledge that in discussion with third

guidance is of vital importance. The Electoral Commission is aware of

She said it was a probing amendment, but it would remove election

PPERA Act 2000 stems from a report from the Committee on Standards in
Public Life. Both that report and Parliament, through the passing of

Under the Act, recognised third parties incur controlled expenditure

items such as leaflets, unsolicited mail to electors, and manifestos.
It does not include factual policy documents aimed at

turn to an example of this, which is push polling. It is a marketing
technique in which an individual or organisation attempts to influence
or alter the view of respondents under the guise of conducting a poll.
Many push polls are negative attacks on candidates. They may ask
questions such as, “If you knew that candidate X was being
investigated for corruption, would you be more likely to vote for him,
or less likely?” The question does not state that any
investigation has taken place, so it is not a lie, but it puts in the
respondent’s mind the idea that candidate X may be corrupt. Push
polling is an effective way of maligning an opponent. I sense that this

the Commission on Civil Society and Democratic Engagement. The noble
and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, raised Northern
Ireland in particular, so the Government will consider this issue
carefully and return to the matter on

been tabled on staff, translation, accessibility, and security and
safety costs. My noble friend Lord Tyler,
speaking to his Amendment 165A, talked about whether the
costs associated with staff directly employed by the third party would
be excluded from the calculation of costs for controlled expenditure on
transport, press conferences, organised media events, and public
rallies and events. Staff costs would be included for electoral
materials, canvassing and market research.</hs_para>

further amendment from the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries,
concerns the costs associated with staffing for the provision of
materials in translation or in an accessible form for those with
physical or learning disabilities, safety and security measures, and
communications with third parties, with committed supporters being
excluded. The PPERA Act 2000 has always required third parties to
account for staff costs, a point made specifically by my noble friend
Lord Tyler. The Bill, while extending the range of activities that may
incur controlled expenditure, retains the need for staff costs to be
excluded. I know that concern has been expressed by third parties
regarding staff costs and by your Lordships today: first, that third 
<?notus-xml column=1098?>parties have to account for these costs while political parties do not;
and, secondly, to the difficulties for third parties in calculating
staff time. On the issue of third parties having to account for these
costs while political parties do not, noble Lords will be aware that
when Parliament passed the PPERA Act, it was felt to be transparent and
proportionate for a third party to account for staff time. This was on
the basis that a third party undertakes activities rather than
political campaigning where the third party enters into political
campaigning to procure the success of a candidate or party. There was a
feeling then that spending on these purposes should be
transparent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:43:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government acknowledge that there are genuine concerns regarding the
issue of the calculation of staff costs. It is important that a balance
is struck between transparency and proportionate reporting
requirements. In terms of excluding the costs associated with
translating materials, making materials more accessible to those with
physical or learning difficulties—the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hollins, specifically raised
this issue, and rightly so—the Commission on Civil Society and
Democratic Engagement covered these points in an extremely valid way.
The Government support ensuring that materials are accessible to all
electors and they have received representations related to translating
materials. We have heard from campaigners, and some very important
points have been made about Northern Ireland, particularly by the noble
Baroness, Lady Mallalieu. I want to confirm again that the Government
will be considering these issues carefully in the light of
today’s debate and we will return to them on

acknowledge that in discussion with third parties from community groups

order-making powers and a number of amendments which have been tabled
in this regard. The Electoral Commission’s regulatory review,
published in June 2013, made it clear that the PPERA Act does not
provide the flexibility to update the rules on non-party campaigning
through secondary legislation. This is in contrast with the list of
items defined as controlled expenditure for political parties, which
can be amended through secondary legislation. The Government support
the recommendation of the Electoral Commission, and provision has been
provided in the Bill. The order-making power, as with other similar
powers in PPERA, will apply either after consultation with the
Electoral Commission or to give effect to a recommendation of the
commission. Parliament will be able to scrutinise and debate any order
that is put forward in the usual way. The order-making power is subject
to the affirmative resolution procedure. Such a power allows the
regulatory framework to respond to changes in campaign activities and
methods of campaigning. This flexibility would be greatly reduced and
the regulatory regime could be undermined if such changes could be made
only through primary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:46:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point of clarification. In responding to the questions about
the Countryside Alliance and the hunting Bill, I
think the noble Lord talked about being very careful not to promote the
electoral prospects of a party. However, Clause 26 talks
about “prejudicing” the electoral prospects of
other parties or candidates. That relates to the Countryside Alliance
and the ban on hunting, but I would also cite the example of
the demonstrations held against the Iraq war. They could have been seen
to be prejudicial to the electoral prospects of a
certain party, in that case my own. I would be grateful if the noble
Lord could clarify that either this evening or on a future occasion,
because it is a terribly important point.</hs_para>

Wyn Roberts was mentioned, to say that he was a great and
distinguished Member of this House and a friend to many noble Lords, in
my case long before he became a Member of Parliament. His long tenure
in the Welsh Office is reflected in part—and only in
part—by the 1993 Act, to which I have referred and which will
always be his memorial in Wales. However, my case of course goes
further back than that, to the 1967 Act on the Welsh language,
introduced by Cledwyn Hughes. Furthermore, even the 1942 Act, referred
to by my noble friend Lord Elystan-Morgan, dealt specifically with the

the requirement for annual validation and checking on the

with the banks themselves. The PCBS

serious harm to the bank or to markets … It should be the
responsibility of banks, using methods that best fit their
organisation, to maintain a certification system, and it should be the
responsibility of regulators—using periodic checks—to
ensure that they do. Just to be clear, it should certainly not be the

friend Lord Eatwell. We are in but, we hope, moving towards the end of
the worst financial crisis in most of our lifetimes. We will not agree
on the reasons for this crisis, as we have proved when we
have touched on it over the past several months. However, I think all
noble Lords agree that some part of it related to the
regulation and structure of the banking sector. We have had several
White Papers on this subject and the Vickers report. We have had two
financial Bills, of which this is the second. Half way through this
process, there was a discontinuity when the LIBOR scandal changed the
mood and grounds of the debate. We all hoped it was a
one-off, just as we hoped RBS and Northern Rock were
one-offs, but from that scandal onwards unease about the
sector has continued to grow. Other
banks—HSBC and the Co-op—were involved in mis-selling,
but what really hit me was the latest report on the Lloyds Bank 
<?notus-xml column=1104?>issue, which brought out how deep mis-selling has gone in these
organisations. The FCA press release

a Lloyds TSB adviser on a mid-level salary, not hitting 90% of their
target over a period of 9 months could see their base annual
salary drop from £33,706 to £25,927; and if they
were demoted by two levels their base pay would drop to
£18,189—almost a 50% salary cut. In the worst example

House. We are left with professional standards and it is on these that
we want to emphasise our differences. I wish the process had not ended

points about the amendment which are subtly, but importantly,

amendment calls for a licensing regime. For 10 years, I carried in my
pocket—actually it was a little too bulky for that, so I carried
it in my briefcase—a licence to fly an aircraft and carry
passengers. At one point in my career I was privileged to carry up to
400 passengers, so society imposed on me the requirement to have a
licence. We were very serious about that licence, the validity of which
cost three days a year to maintain. You had a simple, clear concept of
what a licence was. It is therefore important that the word
“licence” should be used. In the rest of industry, such
as the railway 
<?notus-xml column=1105?>industry, from which I come, the concept of licensing is growing in
strength. It is a good idea and we should call this a licensing

big area. My view over 40 years in the City has been that
the main cause of this trouble has been that an oligopoly was allowed
to develop. If one looks at economic history, wherever there have been
cartels and oligopolies, there has always been bad practice. One reason
that the oligopoly got worse is that there was a mistaken view back in
the 1980s after the failure of Johnson Matthey that led to the doctrine
that the lender of last resort only stood behind banks that were too
big to fail. That led to a shrinkage of the number of banks. Many,
because they were not deemed to be covered by the lender-of-last-resort
doctrine, were closed down.</hs_para>

extensive discussions and correspondence with the late Sir Eddie George
on just that issue back in the early 1990s. What was allowed to happen
was a moral hazard. The oligopoly was there with its ticket that it had
lender-of-last-resort support and it took the view, “Make money
in any way you like and pay the fines”—they were a
natural cost of business if you were in breach. That led to a complete
deterioration of the standards of integrity in the banking system. That

turning round integrity. Punishing those that basically act immorally
is quite an important ingredient, but above all we need to get sound
management into banks. Maybe the regulator has some role in helping

integrity. How far down does the regulator go if he is responsible for

ongoing campaign for small banks and more
diversity—not that I dissent from it, but it is
consistent. What I have more trouble with is the concept of competence
and integrity in the banking system, and the idea that somehow we
should more readily trust the banks than the regulator. The banks have
not got much of a record over the past three or four years in terms of
either competence or, frankly, integrity. There is virtually no major
bank that has not shown some errors in terms of integrity or shown some
failure in competence or ripped off customers through mis-selling. The
poor FSA might not have done brilliantly, but it did investigate these
areas and produce perfectly sensible reports. As far as one can see,
the FCA has got off to a good start. It is producing good and competent
reports. I want to express my belief that the regulator is doing, and
will continue to do, a good
job.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#1312173000014">The

some drawing back from that. My own experience in the airline industry
is that the regulator creates the framework and checks the

that the spreading of annual testing and so on goes into the companies
in a trusting framework. There are ways of doing it without having
thousands of inspectors around. Our general thrust is in the right
direction. However, I get a sense from what

160 is very short and innocuous, but it is of significance in terms of
its impact on the Bill in that it would remove charities from the scope
of the Bill and the 2000 Act. Like everybody else, I must declare
interests, which are largely to be found in the register, but I should
add that I have been for 40 years a charity lawyer—if that does
not sound a contradiction in terms—and have great sympathy with
all those trying to get their head around the relationship here between
charity law and electoral law because it is far from

to the work of the Library staff, I got an insight into the debates
when the 2000 Act was legislated. It is fair to say that charities got
short shrift. In fact, during the passage of the 2000 Act, the
awareness in the Chamber was pretty extraordinary and at no point did a
clear statement on the impact on charities find its way into print. I
am sure your Lordships will also have noticed that the vast majority of
charities are as amazed as anyone that they have ever been part of the

with the vast bulk of it. I happen not to agree with recommendation 11
which is that charities should not be exempt from regulation. To make
my point and because it is germane: recommendation 11 is preceded by
three statements. The first—in favour of my amendment so to
speak—is that the commission heard evidence from charities of
the “disproportionate regulatory burden” on them
registering as third parties. That burden is at the heart of my wish to
see charities removed from this Bill and the 2000

of the Act and this Bill, the authors of the Harries commission report

differ. Charity law and electoral law are in all essentials the same.
Being bound by charity law rather than electoral law is not a soft
touch. Indeed, some charities have made the point that they are afraid
of not being part of the Bill—and therefore under the aegis of
the Electoral Commission—because they fear that if left to the
devices of the Charity Commission alone things might get rather more
brutal than they already
are.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="1312173000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#1312173000019">The

that if charities were not part of the Bill, they would not be able as
they currently are to campaign with non-charities. Again, that is
completely misconceived. The position of charities vis-à-vis
joint campaigning—coalition campaigning, if you want to call it
that—will not be affected significantly; in fact, I could not
put my finger on any single difference between being outside and inside
the Bill. I repeat: charity law on its own is very severe and, as I
shall explain, very similar to electoral law on this
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:00:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:04:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

I had a word with the noble Lord, Lord Best, so he knows that I am
going to mention this—a wonderful example of the
misunderstanding generated by the Bill is the comments made by the
noble Lord just before supper on the food campaign of the National
Federation of Women’s Institutes. The NFWI is a charity; I acted
for it for 20 years. The gist of the noble Lord’s remarks was
that under the Bill, the NFWI would be in real trouble in running a
campaign such as it has. Again, that is a complete misunderstanding. If
charities remain in the Bill, the NFWI will be able to do in future
exactly as in the past. The fact that we have a great deal of confusion
around this aspect of the Bill is perhaps no surprise: the law is
difficult and obscure. Indeed, one reason why I want charities right
out of the Bill is to avoid the double confusion and complexity that
will ensue if they remain within it, because they will then be subject
to two completely separate branches of law: electoral law and charity
law. Although, as I have said, they are very similar in essentials, you
can none the less be quite certain, especially given the brouhaha
surrounding the Bill, that all charities of any size will be extremely
cautious<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:02:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

because the boards of charities are volunteer boards, and if they step
outside the confines of charity law, the consequences can be
disastrous. It does not make any difference if it is a charity in

of charity funds. It is very rare that the Charity Commission requires
charity trustees to put their hands in their pockets, but that is the
position. That is why this chilling effect, to which not much reference
has been made tonight but which is generally accepted, is now running
around the charity sector: the chill of concern that charities will be
caught by the Bill in a highly complex, bureaucratic web which will
curtail their activities come an election—indeed, come one year

pretending that this does not have a severe and real effect. We have
had it from a hundred lips tonight and outside this place. The Harries
commission has had it. I have had it from the many charities and
charitable organisations to which I have talked. The Government have
had it. The charity sector is very worried. You can be absolutely
certain that those charities which have paid staff—which is of
course only about 5% of them, about a third of a million in this
country—will be required to check with their lawyers and to make
sure that every step of an election campaign is consonant with the
provisions of this complex legislation. The waste of fees and time, the
bureaucracy, the demoralisation, the diversion of philanthropic effort
into playing safe in what is—I am sorry to keep repeating the
word—a ludicrously complicated piece of legislation—most
legislation is these days, and this is no different—adds up to a
very worrying situation. In so far as there is reference in the

claim is that the inclusion of charities is wholly unnecessary because,
first, charity law is strong and clear; it is a 500 year-old branch of
law—only the Anglophone countries have a separate branch of
charity law. Secondly, as I have said, the Charity Commission holds the
sector to account as a very competent, long-standing regulator with
good, solid legal skills. The commission produces guidance, as many
noble Lords will know, on politics and campaigning and produces a
supplement about campaigning during election time. That came out a
couple of years ago, it will be updated in time for the next election
and that guidance alone came to roughly 40
pages<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Charity Commission expects the sector to pay close attention to it and,
by golly, it does. As a lawyer in the field—there are not many
of us—I can tell you that we are constantly being asked by
charities, “Is this all right?”, “Is that all
right?” and “What does clause 27 of the CC9 guidance
mean?”</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0002.htm#1312173000024">The<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
courts are extremely protective of charity law. There is no branch of
English law that has the attention of the courts in quite the way that
charity law does. Again, it is common knowledge that charities cannot
have political purposes. It is as simple as that: no political
purposes. Secondly, although they can engage in campaigning and
politics, under CC9, they cannot engage in partisan campaigning and
politicking—that is verboten, out. Many references have been
made to the hazy line between what is in and what is out, between what
is okay and what is not okay. I totally sympathise with that—it
happens to have kept me in a reasonable living for 40 years, so I must
not complain too much—but, seriously, there is no way of
avoiding 
<?notus-xml column=1111?>it. With the sort of issues that the wording of any legal rule will

have a situation here where we have regulation, we have regulators and
there have been no complaints that I have been able to lay hands on, so
to speak, concerning charities at the last election. It seems to me to
be bizarre that here we are, unless we watch it, about to shackle the
most highly regulated sector in our society, which is the only sector
that exists within the constraints as to purposes that the Charity
Commission lays down. Do not forget that charities have to behave and
be exclusively for the public benefit. No charity can do anything that
is not exclusively for the public benefit as defined by charity law. It
seems not just unnecessary but almost perverse to shackle this sector,
of all sectors, with two regulators when those in the NGO world that
are not charities have only one regulator. The NGO world that is not
charitable can have any purpose it likes, as long as they are not in
breach of the law of the land, and can adopt any means it likes to
pursue those purposes, as long as it does not involve criminality, and
yet that branch of the NGO jungle, if we want to call it that, has a
single regulator while the regulated and highly specific charity sector
is to have two regulators, with all that that will mean in terms of
demoralisation, expense, confusion, muddle and the rest. I hope that,

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> I think that the concern may relate
to a misnomer, which is that a non-charitable NGO that wants to escape
the limitations of the Bill could simply form a charity which, if
charities are taken out of the Bill, would be able to do all sorts of
things that it could not do as a non-charity within the Bill. There is
a very simple answer to that. A charity may be the brainchild of, and
have come into existence through the efforts of, a non-charitable
NGO—and there are a number of non-charitable NGOs, such as
Amnesty International, which have brought into being a charitable arm
that does things that can properly be done by a charity and which is
therefore more tax efficient to have done through a charity, because of
the tax provisions attaching to charities. A number of non-charitable
NGOs have a related charity—perhaps even the Countryside
Commission has. Many of them do it. But the misunderstanding comes in
this element. Some people think that because Amnesty and the
Countryside Commission took the initiative in creating a charity, they
can control it and tell the trustees to do their bidding, what to do
and when to do it. But they cannot. It is a fierce rule of charity
trusteeship that the trustees of any charity do not and cannot take
their orders from any outside body, even one that is in that sort of
relationship<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:14:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:13:58"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:14:21"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000031">To
take another example, where I, as an individual, set up a charity with

a fierce and fundamental provision of charity law, precisely to protect

the matters that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has just raised. The
commission came to the view that there should be no exemption for
charities and that was based squarely on the evidence that we heard. As
everyone else is doing so, perhaps I should make a full declaration of
my involvement with various campaigning organisations. I am president
of the Countryside Alliance and president of the Horse Trust; one is a
charity and one is not. I am a member of the National Trust, the RSPCA
and the Humane Slaughter Association and I am a

Bill’s progress—of the Stop HS2 campaign. There may be
others, but I cannot, at the moment, remember

Mallalieu:</Member></B> I was not referring to the Charity Commission;
I was referring to commission of the noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries. I am afraid this had led to some confusion. I noticed
someone else fell into the same error. If I did, I apologise. Except
for those who have put their names to the 
<?notus-xml column=1113?>amendment on the Marshalled List—and no doubt there will be
others who will speak—I am not aware of anyone among those to
whom we have already spoken, who shares the view of the noble Lord,
Lord Phillips. Not one of the charities which came and gave evidence
before us asked for there to be an exemption. Nor, as far as I am
aware, does the Electoral Commission suggest that it is a good idea. I
am not certain about the view of the Charity Commission, but my
understanding is that it does not seek it either. As I understand it,
this is because it is generally felt that transparency in the way
people campaign during elections should run right across the board, for
charitable and non-charitable campaigners. The spending limits, which
are a key difference, should be the same across the board. No charity
asked to be exempt, but we did hear evidence from some which felt that,
if they were exempted, some charities would bring others into
disrepute, and that it was a possible route for
avoidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:17:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Phillips, is predicated, I think, on a belief that the
guidance given by the Charity Commission at present works
well—and he knows a great deal more about charity law than I do.
That was not entirely my understanding of the evidence that we heard,
and there has been concern that it has not always been rigorously
enforced in this area. It is, perhaps, not surprising, given the number
of registered charities. I think there are something like 130,000; he
will know the figure better than I do. Indeed, there have been a number
of public complaints about charities and how they have campaigned
recently. It was for that reason particularly that I drew attention to
my involvement with the Countryside
Alliance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:18:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there must be equality across the board, not only with obvious
transparency, but with the way in which people are permitted to
campaign. If the situation were—as the noble Lord, Lord
Phillips, would wish it—that non-charities continued to be
regulated under the Bill as amended and charities were removed, there
could be two organisations campaigning on precisely the same issue, but
bound in different ways by different forms of regulation. There could
be an argument during an election period, for example on hunting, which
has already raised its head a number of times in this debate. This
would have the Countryside Alliance as a non-charity, restricted in a
variety of ways, required probably to register as a result of whatever
the new limits might be, to observe strict spending limits, and with no
regulatory burden. Whereas the League Against Cruel Sports, which is a
charity, would have no spending limits and would not have to put in the
sort of rather onerous reports that are required otherwise. This is a
cross-party issue which is seen by some as being politicised. There may
well be
complaints<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:21:12"></hs_TimeCode> about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000037">My noble
friend Lord Gardiner—I call him my noble friend even though he
sits opposite because he is from the “barricades”
days—has tried to reassure us that the Countryside Alliance
would not be caught by this measure. However, I am not so sure. We wait
for that matter to be tested or, I hope, clarified as the Bill
progresses. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, says that it is wrong for
one body to be doubly regulated, but he is overlooking the fact that
charities are in a privileged position in many ways. They have a great
many advantages 
<?notus-xml column=1114?>and it is right that they should be regulated not just during election
periods but all the time so that they do not infringe the rules. As I
say, whether that is enforced is a matter of considerable controversy.
Surely the Bill is about the transparency of those engaged in
campaigning at election times. It is not a Bill about
charities—that is something quite separate. There should be a
level playing field and the public should be entitled to know what is
being spent and by whom, whether the body in question is a charity or
not. Therefore, although I have enormous sympathy with what the noble
Lord says, and I share his concern that charities are very worried
about the Bill, so are NGOs, and for precisely the same
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:21:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Phillips of Sudbury" PimsId="181" UID="1312173000157" xid="1827" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000157">Lord

Mallalieu:</Member></B> The noble Lord is correct on the face of it
but, in reality, when one looks at some of the forms of campaigning
that have taken place in recent years, it is very difficult to discern
a difference between the two. The two organisations to which I referred
earlier are a case in point. If the charity
guidance—CC9—and the appendix to which the noble Lord
referred were enforced rigorously, and the Charity Commission had the
means to do that, perhaps I would take a different view. However, given
that the Charity Commission cannot possibly have a handle on 130,000

there should be one rule that applies to

Williams of Crosby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, my name is also added

thank the Government for permitting a consultation period. I quite
agree that it is not as long as it should be, but it is worth

one that I think will be helpful to us as we work our way through

the Bill is largely concerned with amending the 2000 Act, which means
that it is incredibly complicated. It keeps referring back to earlier
legislation when it might have been better to make a clean break and
have a completely new Bill. That is by the way and we have what we
have, but I think it is one of the reasons why two issues have emerged
very clearly in this debate—I speak as I see. First, virtually
every amendment—amendment after amendment—has sought to
exempt various bodies from the controls on the amount of expenditure
that is incurred. Virtually every one of the many amendments that we
have discussed 
<?notus-xml column=1115?>has sought to eliminate or take out something or other. They have all
been negative amendments and have attempted to detract from the
Bill’s impact on charities. That is not a desirable way of
looking at a Bill. What it adds up to is that this is a Bill which has
overwhelmingly caused such concern, worry and anxiety that it cannot
stand as it is without huge amendment, or possibly a complete rewriting
of Part 2. I favour the
second<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:24:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000043">The
other thing that emerges very clearly from this is that the
Ministers—I greatly respect their patience and their attempts to
deal with the issues—have turned effectively into a sort of CAB.
Everybody who gets up says, “Does this apply to me, or to this,
or to the other thing?”. That is not a very happy way of
demonstrating how clear and transparent the Bill is. It is a very happy
way of demonstrating that it is neither clear nor transparent. This
again means that there has to be a major look at how to reconstruct
this part of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000044">I
add one other thing. I say this in some criticism of the commission,
which has been so widely praised, quite rightly, in this House. The
commission has not taken sufficient cognisance of—I refer back
to the brief speech made by my noble friend Lord Greaves—the
impact of certain kinds of expenditure on campaigning, not least major
expenditure on campaigning, on the whole issue of the cleanliness and
transparency of politics

have blissfully walked past substantial evidence to show that, without
some form of serious regulation of charities, but also of NGOs, there
is a tendency for politics to become increasingly corrupted by the flow
of money. The noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, for whose intelligence I
have the greatest respect, unwisely referred to the likelihood of some
monster coming out of the jungle who would be a billionaire. There are
many monsters who are billionaires coming out of the jungle. I know
that because I taught the subject of elective

United States has effectively been taken over at the federal level by
more and more major expenditure. For example, expenditure on
congressional elections in real terms has gone up two and a half times
since 1998. In the latest election cycle, in 2012, no less than $3.5
billion was spent on electing Congressmen and Senators to their
elective seats. To take another example; it costs today, on the latest
explanation we have, $1.5 million to elect a Congressman.
Congressional districts are of course larger than parliamentary
constituencies—let us say three or four times larger. However,
when you compare the £12,000, which is still the British limit
that can be spent within a constituency once an election has been
declared, with $1.5 million, even if you take real values and all the
rest of it into account, you are looking at a vast increase in the
expenditure on how you can get legislation through Congress. A great
deal of it is quite directly and precisely related to politics in its
most raw sense, including the money that comes out of the so-called
501(c)4 regulations of the Internal Revenue Service—the tax
system—which now allows specifically non-profit third parties to
put money into election support and political payments. Let us not
forget that the legislation picks out non-profit, picks out non-party
and picks 
<?notus-xml column=1116?>out bodies with claims that they are pushing a charitable end, or in
some cases a public service end. The outcome is quite simply that this
particular element in public expenditure in the United States has risen
from $9 million two years ago in 2010 to $457 million in
2012. That is an increase of the order of something like 45 times. Why?
The regulations that applied to restriction on public expenditure of
this kind by non-profit organisations were effectively allowed to lapse
with the result of the so-called Citizens United Supreme Court decision
of 2010, whereby corporations and unions were both allowed to come into
that structure and give whatever they liked with no limit for political
campaigns.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000047">What

Senators are millionaires or richer because, effectively, the ordinary

to raise to stand any chance of getting elected is now so extreme. I
will not go on but the figures are terrifying. The estimated spending
for the next presidential election in 2016 is around $6
billion at the federal level only. What one is seeing is a great

mentioned by my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury. There is a real
question regarding the need for separate regimes for charities and
NGOs—I do not agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, on
this point—because they are different creatures, working in
different ways with different regulations. There is no reason why they
should be treated in exactly the same way. I cannot see the argument
for that and there is always a danger if you are not restricted by the
Charity Commission rules that you will push over the envelope. One can
to some extent argue that the envelope in one or two cases has been
pushed beyond where it should have gone. I am thinking not only of the
famous Taunton case but of the position of people who, for example,
stand entirely on the basis of a campaign to keep a hospital

probably the single strongest pillar we have to prevent corruption and
money running politics in this country. I say to the
commission—I beg it, actually—to look more seriously at
that issue. If you remove constituency limits, you remove one of the
most effective, although not very strong, measures we have to keep
politics clean. I urge the commission to go look again and come up with

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble
Baroness has given us a sobering picture of the future of US political
funding. Before that, we heard from my noble friend Lord Phillips, who,
as ever, is a passionate advocate and has a lifetime of experience in
charity law. He and I have had many debates on this issue. One
therefore has to listen with care to his explanation and how he places
his case, particularly when it is supported by some experienced and
heavyweight voices from the Liberal Democrat
Benches<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:33:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312173000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000052">However, I hope that he
will forgive me if I say that I am not convinced—at least, not
yet convinced—that charities should be exempted from the Bill. I
accept the seductive simplicity of his argument, but I think that it is
based on an ideal world that I fear no longer exists, if it ever did.
In part, the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, put her finger on it when
she said that charities have a special status in the eyes of the
public. They get it not just because of tax but because the charity
number is seen to be something that carries with it a stamp of quality,
and therefore charities have something that is not granted to people
who do not go through the Charity Commission hoop.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312173000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000053">I see two major
challenges to what the noble Lord proposed. One is the role of the
Charity Commission itself, first of all at an operational level. We
have said that there are 160,000 registered charities and there are
probably another 160,000 unregistered charities: that is a third of a
million charities. The noble Lord made reference to this in his opening
remarks. The commission therefore faces a huge operational challenge
just to deal with basic charity law, and to hold charities to account
in the most basic way. When he says that the Charity Commission has
very rarely asked trustees to put their hands in their pockets, I
accept that. Is that because nothing is going wrong or because the
commission does not know what is going wrong? That is one of the issues
we have to
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:35:33"></hs_TimeCode>; so
there is an operational
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:35:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312173000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000054">Then there is a
strategic challenge to the commission. The commission is an
organisation that is under a huge strain. Some noble Lords will have
seen the National Audit Office’s report, which had some
disobliging things to say about the way the Charity Commission
operated. It faces considerable problems in respect of the public
benefit test, the aftermath of the independent schools test and the
Plymouth Brethren case, which is 
<?notus-xml column=1118?>now before it. It has had problems with links to Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs, the Cup Trust and other tax-avoidance measures. It
has also had a 40% cut in its budget. I ask my noble friend
whether it is a practical proposition to ask the commission to take on
another huge area and start to drill down on 335,000 charities to find
out whether they are complying in a way that is, as the noble Baroness
said, fair across the
piece<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:36:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1312173000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000055">The noble Lord might say
to me, “Of course it should have additional resources”.
If it were an ideal world, that might be possible, but it is hard to
argue that the Government should devote additional resources to
providing the Charity Commission with the ability to enforce electoral
law when the Electoral Commission already specialises in it and is up
to date with all the arrangements of the way that matters are
proceeding—as opposed to the Charity Commission, for which it
would be one of about 10 major tasks it would have to carry
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:37:12"></hs_TimeCode>. That is my
concern about the way the structure would work in real
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:37:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000056">My
second concern is really the point made by the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Hardie: the nitty-gritty point of the loophole. I fear that it
will attract those who wish to push the envelope. The noble Baroness,
Lady Williams of Crosby, said that she thought the envelope was being
pushed—and I am sure it is. In my review of charities, Members
of the other place said to me, “Some charities are really
getting into what we are doing as Members of Parliament”. There
is a sort of concern that charities are doing things that get very
close to the role of a Member of Parliament in representing his or her
constituents. This amendment will open the way to the more adventurous
and to the outliers who choose to become charities, because it will be
seen as a way to minimise the regulatory burden and to evade some of
the issues that we have just been discussing as part of this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:38:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000057">It
is the outliers who will most likely damage the sector’s
reputation. The sector has historically had a very high reputation with
the public, but this reputation is not immutable. We think now of the
Cup Trust, as I mentioned. That has undoubtedly made members of the
public consider charities and their role. We subsequently had a very
public row about the payment of chief executives and senior staff of
charities, and how that is commensurate with charitable status. I am
not making any comment upon it; I am saying that the charitable sector
has considerable challenges to answer if it is not to see some leeching
away of the enormously strong public reputation it has historically
enjoyed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000058">If we
were to accept the noble Lord’s amendment—seductively
simple and attractive though it is—we would run the risk of
putting a burden on the Charity Commission that it will not be able to
fulfil, and giving it tasks that it will find very difficult. The
result could be that we will have difficulties, problems and issues
with the public that, after the next general elections and elections
thereafter, will be seen to rebound on the charity sector. We need to
make sure that does not
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:39:38"></hs_TimeCode>, because,
as the noble Lord said, it is such a precious jewel in our crown. It
provides a way for so many of our fellow citizens to put something
back, to create something and to connect with their fellow 
<?notus-xml column=1119?>members of society. It would be a tragedy to lose that. That is why I
fear I cannot support the noble Lord’s amendment
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:40:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000059"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Harries of Pentregarth" PimsId="5112" UID="1312173000161" xid="1957" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000161">Lord
Harries of Pentregarth (CB):</Member></B> The commission did not
support taking charities out, for the reasons put so fluently and
eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu. I will not add to
what she said, but I want to respond briefly to points made by the

Phillips.</hs_para>

and I do not doubt for a moment what is happening in America. But we
have not yet been presented with any real evidence that it is happening
in England. The precautionary principle is quite right: we have to

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> I absolutely agree that it is
right to take precautionary steps, but I am sure that the noble
Baroness would also agree that we must ensure that they are not
disproportionate. The main complaint at the moment by charities and
other campaigning groups is that this legislation is grossly
disproportionate in the way that it bears upon them—I see the
noble Baroness nodding her
head<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:41:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000063">I
also have the utmost respect for the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, who is
the leading charity lawyer in the country. But I have to agree with the
points made by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson. Perhaps I can approach the
argument from another way. I carefully read CC9, which is the Charity
Commission guidance. I also read the additional guidance that it
provides for election campaigns. It makes it quite clear that charities
are allowed to politically campaign. That is absolutely crystal clear.
But as the noble Lord made abundantly clear, it is not always easy to
draw a distinction between political campaigning in general and
political campaigning that might be interpreted as supporting a
particular party.</hs_para>

noble Lord drew his hand across and said that there was a kind of hazy
line. Does that not lead to the conclusion that the noble Lord, Lord
Hodgson, made: namely, that if charities were taken out, they would
have to have their own separate regime, employ extra staff, and keep in
day-by-day contact with the Electoral Commission to make sure that
their guidance agreed with the guidance of the commission? Would that
not be a waste of resources?
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:43:20"></hs_TimeCode> charities are
in fact in the same position as other groups, would it not be better
for them all to be under the same regime?</hs_para>

absolutely agree that there is a major difference and that charities
cannot have political campaigning as their prime purpose. That is
absolutely right. If the suggestion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Hardie, about the definition of political expenses were accepted, of
course charities could come out—but as long as they are allowed
to politically campaign, that campaigning could be interpreted as
supporting a political party or
candidate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:43:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:43:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000066"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Phillips of Sudbury" PimsId="181" UID="1312173000164" xid="1827" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000164">Lord

that the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has tabled this amendment from the

that charities themselves are not asking to be exempted. Surely that
must count for something. The noble Lord said that charities are

overwhelming majority of those I have been speaking to, and indeed know
of because perforce I know a vast number of charities, want exemption.
Perhaps I can take as examples the Charities Aid Foundation which only
has charities as members or the Directory of Social Change which only
has charities as members as compared with, say, the NCVO, which has
both. The organisations I have mentioned are keen for charities to be
exempt for all the reasons I have tried to explain. The impression must

was running a charity myself, but I cannot support his amendment. I,

by how many of them are opposed to this amendment and have not taken
any comfort from his faith in the Charity Commission doing the

have spoken to have been opposed to the idea of exemption for personal
reasons. For example, the Save Lewisham Hospital Campaign would not
have wanted to go through the process of registering as a charity to
gain exemption. Those involved were too busy with their campaign. I
have spoken to other charities which point out that coalitions are
often formed across sectors so that they make up coalitions not only of
charities but of social enterprises and, indeed, of commercial
organisations. I certainly have had experience of that in my
campaigning background. What we have to remember is that the NGO
sector, whatever it is, is increasingly diverse. We are constantly
coming across different forms of NGO-type organisations. There is a
great potential for confusion among the public and supporters. We
should focus on the activity being undertaken, not on the type of
organisation undertaking
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:49:17"></hs_TimeCode>. I understand

noble Lord, Lord Phillips, himself said that it is complex, there is a
great deal of bureaucracy and there will be a diversion of
philanthropic effort. It puts a disproportionate burden on

Reading for the same sort of reasons as the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler,

passing, I have to say that I have the impression that the charity
sector does not speak with one voice on this and does not have a
monolithic view. Some charities want an exemption while some do not. In
those circumstances,

as the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has made clear, charities are already
regulated up to the hilt as regards political campaigning and not
engaging in it. The noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, has suggested that,
because of their special status, which gives them a peculiar
responsibility to be beyond reproach, charities should be subject to
the regulation which this legislation proposes. However, it seems to me
that the validation kitemark, as you might call it, which charity
regulation provides is precisely the reason not to load charities with
additional regulatory burdens. What would be the point of conferring
this special status on charities and then saying that it does not
actually count for
anything<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000078">Secondly,
along with everyone else, I pay my tribute to my noble and right
reverend friend Lord Harries and to his Commission on Civil Society and
Democratic Engagement, which, as everybody has said, has done such
sterling work on the Bill, which will be of great assistance to the
House. However, I was not entirely convinced by its argument for not
exempting charities. The argument seemed to be that charities should
not have an exemption because other people should have one as
well—but in that case, it would not be an exemption. The case
for charities having an exemption is that they are in a class of their
own. As I say, if everybody is to have the exemption, it ceases to be
an exemption; if others feel they should have the benefit of charitable
exemption, the answer is surely for them to seek to register as a
charity. Concerns have apparently also been expressed that an exemption
for charities could increase the prospects of a successful challenge to
the PPERA rules on freedom of expression grounds, since it will make it
more difficult to argue that the restrictions imposed on others by the
rules are necessary and proportionate. If that is the case, so be it,
and a good thing too. In saying that I am in favour of the charities
having exemption, I am in no sense against the
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000079">The
commission chaired by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries,
is concerned about the impact of the Bill on the reputation of and
trust in charities and the extra regulatory costs they will face in
order to campaign for their charitable objectives, but it does not
recommend an exemption. I am afraid that I draw the opposite
conclusion. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, raised the point that non-charitable
campaigners might seek to set up charitable vehicles as a means of
avoidance. However, that is surely not a genuine concern because if
they set up a charity they would immediately become subject to the
controls imposed by charity law. They would not be able to smuggle
through, under cover of a charity, things they would not be permitted
to do under charity law. There would be no point in setting up a
charitable vehicle to get round the Act. Given the strictness of
charity law and regulation, it would be completely
self-defeating.</hs_para>

can contribute to this debate is from my experience when I was more
active within RNIB than I am now. I was chairman for nine years and in
various senior trustee capacities before that, so I have a good deal of
experience with a leading campaigning charity. This experience tells me
that the desire to impose stricter controls on charities to restrict
the scope of party political campaigning is completely misconceived. At
election time, we are concerned to promote our views to the parties,
not to promote the views of the parties to anyone else. As often as
not, we are simply asking the parties about their views, not promoting
those views. If I have understood him correctly, the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Wallace, said in an earlier debate that this kind of
activity would not be caught by the legislation. However, proving that
their activities were exempt would tie the charities up in bureaucracy.
The noble Lord, Lord Tyler, has shown us this with his graph showing
the correlation between bureaucracy and transparency. The noble Lord,
Lord Phillips, also made this clear when he described the increased
regulatory burden to which charities would become subject as a result
of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000081">The

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very glad that I held back and
listened to another contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Low of
Dalston, who said many of the things that I would like to have been
able to say but could not have done with the same level of experience.
There are two points which I would like to add or
underline.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000083">First,
there seems to be a view in the House this evening, expressed by the
noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, that it would, somehow or other, be
unfair to exempt the charities because the other organisations would
then be more carefully controlled than the charities. That is the whole
point: the charities are already very, very carefully controlled in
what they can and cannot do in the public space before, during and at
election time. As the noble Lord, Lord Low, has said, it may be that
CC9 and the further additional requirements of the Charity Commission
are not totally adequate but they are certainly very much more so than
they were previously. They are certainly more adequate than the
guidance that was given to the charities at the time of the passage of
PPERA. I am very sorry to see that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, has
left his place, because he was the main author, I think he would
probably claim, of that Act. Therefore, its inadequacies, which have
been drawn to our attention throughout today—and, I have to say,
have been drawn to my attention in the large number of meetings I have
held—relate very much to the inadequacy of the treatment of
charities, which are already so firmly circumscribed in what they can
and cannot
do.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1312173000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000143">10

Members of the House have said that they have not received any

not know that they would all want me to mention their names, but the
Royal British Legion, for example, is very sympathetic to the point of
trying to simplify the regulations that it has to live under, so that
there is no longer, as it were, double jeopardy of two quite different
sets of regulation. Other, smaller charities have made the same point
to us. What I think they are saying, large and small, is that they
really would accept exemption as the simplest solution to the perceived
weaknesses of PPERA and to the inevitable complex strengthening of its
provisions in the current Bill.</hs_para>

want to pick up a point the noble Lord made earlier. He has
huge knowledge of the charitable world. He has given a lot

seemed to suggest earlier that somehow or other
the Charity Commission was not up to the job: it was not in a position,
not able, not capable and it did not have the resources to police CC9
and the subsequent advice. That is a very serious charge. If it is his
view that the Charity Commission simply is not capable of doing this
job, then I admit that the case put by my noble friend Lord Phillips of
Sudbury may be rather weaker than I anticipated. I do not think the
noble Lord was saying that, but perhaps he would like to clarify that
point. If he was saying that, I understand that there is a real doubt
about whether the commission is up to the task it has set itself. In my
experience of charities and of the previous advice that was given to
charities, I thought it was well up to the task and there have been

Advocate-General for Scotland (Lord Wallace of Tankerness)
(LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord Phillips of
Sudbury for introducing this debate, which has been very interesting.
Different views have been expressed. The noble Lord, Lord Low, said
that charities do not speak with one voice on this matter, and that
confirms my experience from having engaged with charities, admittedly
not as extensively as my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire. I have
heard different views expressed about whether there should be an
exemption for charities. Therefore, it is important that the arguments
that have been put forward on both sides are given proper examination.
My noble friend’s amendment would amend Clause 26 so that
charities were excluded from the regulatory regime governing controlled
expenditure for third parties. At present, under charity law, charities
are organisations which must be established for charitable purposes
only and which are for the public benefit. An organisation will not be
charitable if—as my noble friend pointed out—it engages
in partisan political
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000105">Campaigning
and political activity can be legitimate and valuable activities for
charities to undertake. However, they must be undertaken by a charity
only in the context of supporting the delivery of its charitable
purposes. As we have heard, the Charity Commission produces
comprehensive guidance—CC9—for charities on campaigning
and political activity. However, the Charity Commission also
acknowledges that there may be circumstances in which charities may
legitimately operate within the regulatory regime established by PPERA
2000, even if their campaigns remain within the rules on party
political activities by
charities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000106">When
the Bill was in the other place, the Electoral Commission highlighted a
situation in its briefing. If a charity distributes material to the
public that highlights the views of candidates from different parties
on issues related to the charity’s objectives, this may in some 
<?notus-xml column=1128?>circumstances reasonably be regarded as intended to promote the election
of those candidates and, as such, would require compliance with the
rules in PPERA. That echoes our earlier debate about when what would
not be registrable becomes registrable. In such cases, Parliament
decided through the passing of the 2000 Act that such
activity should be regulated as it could potentially influence electors
during an election. Indeed, Parliament chose then—as indeed we
replicate in this Bill after amendment in the other place—to go

some of the arguments against difficult. The noble Baroness, Lady
Pitkeathley—who is now in the Chair, so am I allowed to say
this?—in a point picked up by my noble friend Lord Tyler, seemed
to suggest that the limits on charities would be much more flexible.
They would not be as tight as they would be on non-charity third party
participants. Indeed, I think that was reflected in the opening
comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, when she seemed to
suggest all the things that Beatrice Webb could have done if she had
registered herself as a charity and that none of these things would
have been available had she not been a charity.</hs_para>

Phillips said, charities are not allowed to engage in partisan politics

well aware of the limitations. Sometimes I got the impression during
the debate that we were comparing a free for all—if you
registered as a charity—with the registration and regulation of
controlled expenditure that would apply to third parties that are not
charities under the provisions of this Bill. I do not think that is a
proper comparison. That is why I think there is a genuine dilemma, as

Lord Harries. The Government should be cautious about taking as
significant a step as exempting charities from the regulatory regime.
We would want to see more evidence and would pray for reassurance that
this would not create a loophole. There are issues about—and
this is an unfortunate expression that has been used in some
discussions I have had—a “sliver” of activity,
which could take charities which are abiding by charity law 
<?notus-xml column=1129?>into an area which would nevertheless be regulated under the PPERA
regime. I would want to be satisfied that it would not lead to
avoidance, although I certainly hear the strong arguments asking
whether there is any point in setting up a charitable arm which is
going to be restricted by charity law. However, it is clearly an issue.

Although charities could have their activities restricted because of

transparency. Transparency is an important issue, which I would ask my

first is to take up the point my noble friend made at the end of his
speech, concerning the role of the Charity Commission. My noble friend
Lord Hodgson 
<?notus-xml column=1130?>spoke very forcibly about the disparity between the theory of charity
law and the actuality of oversight. I accept that, and there is no
shadow of doubt in my mind but that if my amendment is accepted on
Report, it must and can only be on the basis that the Charity
Commission will do a more thorough job than it currently does. I fully
accept that, but I am hopeful that that is something which would be
very much in the Government’s mind, because if we take a third
of a million charities out of the regulatory oversight of the Electoral
Commission, we can make major savings, part of which can be deployed in
beefing up the Charity Commission’s
efforts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1312173000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-0003.htm#1312173000118">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:28:44"></hs_TimeCode>

in this sector, so to speak, for 40 years—in my
experience there is astonishingly little abuse of charity law. There is
an astonishingly high level of public trust as well, and there is a
deep revulsion in the sector of trying to play games with it, let alone
corrupting it. I emphasise, however, that that does not take away from

at the whole picture and the substance of what a charity does and if a
charity pretended not to be engaged in partisan pursuits but actually
was—by, for example, putting its effort only into constituencies
where the candidate that it wanted to win was holding a view that it

Perhaps we can talk about this outside the Chamber, because this is not

saying, and I will assert it without equivocation, is that the law is
clear. I say that it is clear, but the law is there and it is well used

the single-tier pension. Current pensioners should also benefit from
the single tier. A number of options are available to achieve this. For

Flight (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I have encountered more upset in
relation to this aspect of the Bill than what I would hope was support
at having a state pension above the level of income support. Quite
simply, we are talking about individuals who have paid their national
insurance, who are too old to benefit from the 2016 changes, whose
pensions are less than that, and who feel somewhat aggrieved that many
people who have not paid their national insurance will qualify for the
increased pension after 2016 when they will not. I appreciate that it
is all about money, but I wonder whether a full calculation has been
done of the net real costs of putting everyone who is entitled to a
pension on to the new arrangement in 2016; I suppose that is unless
they have qualifications that exceed that. However, I can only think
that there would be a significant net-off in terms of other welfare
payments if people’s pensions were slightly
larger<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:36:03"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
a fundamentally good piece of legislation on which there is relatively
cross-party support. However, I slightly warn the Government that this
issue—that those who are too old to benefit from the 2016

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to ask a
simple question that relates to one of the hopes that some of us had a
year or so back. The greatest proportion of those claiming pension
credit tend to be elderly widows—when the husband died, the
pension died with him—over the age of 80 or 85. I fully
understand that to bring all pensions on to this would be a big-ticket
item for any Government to contemplate; that is not in doubt, as the
previous speaker mentioned. However, what if we were to introduce the
pension not just for people reaching pension age  in 2016 but
for those over 85, and then for the next decade bring the 85s down by a
year, with the 65s going up a year, as they will? They would meet in
about a decade for men, perhaps slightly later for women. In about a
decade or so, virtually all pensions 
<?notus-xml column=199?>would be covered on an incremental
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:37:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
not been able to cost that. I was told, teasingly by the Minister in
the other place, that he thought it would probably cost half a billion
pounds, but whether that was per year or in total was not made clear to
me. Have there been any thoughts about how we might progressively
increase the
coverage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T15:37:49"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121617000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121617000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Stoneham of Droxford" PimsId="5915" UID="13121617000073" xid="2125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121617000073">Lord
Stoneham of Droxford (LD):</Member></B> I would like to make three
points. I hope that there will be cross-party support but, if we are
now saying that the higher pension should apply to everybody, clearly
we need to know the cost. I have to ask the question: why did Labour
not do this in its 13 years if it does not cost money? The point has to
be made. Resentment could build up among those who see younger people
coming forward on larger pensions. We know that there is a problem with
women in the 1951 to 1953 age group. We have to understand exactly how
much this is going to cost. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, is
absolutely right: it is not necessary for this legislation, but in the
future obviously we should look—as the country can afford
it—at how we can phase in for various groups of pensioners the
higher rate and get rid of means-testing for them. We need to know
about the money but we also have to be realistic. You have to start
somewhere on this higher-rate pension, and where the Government have
tried in difficult circumstances to start is the best that can be done
at the moment,<I> </I>I think. Obviously we should look at the future
at some stage, once we are aware of the cost and how we can afford
it.</hs_para>

capacity of the system to deliver sensibly some of these significant
changes. In the first place, the Green Paper suggested that we should
be looking at this by 2017. That has been brought forward; there are
obvious advantages to that but it has caused some people to raise
questions with me. Some of that is informed by the current controversy
about the efficacy of the systems for universal credit, which are of
course of a different order in terms of the IT systems. It also has to
be acknowledged that the Pension Service has a very good record of
implementing some of this stuff; when pension credit came in, it was
done in a way that got very high marks from the National Audit Office,
as I recall. So it may be that everything is going to be fine, but if
the national insurance records are not all clean data then we could be
facing some serious difficulties in  delivering the payment of
pensions on time. There are other operational matters that I
am sure are concerning people at Longbenton in Newcastle, as
they should be.</hs_para>

indicated at Second Reading, when Labour came to office in 1997 we
inherited unacceptably high levels of pensioner poverty and took to
addressing it in a range of ways—through the minimum income
guarantee, by pegging pensions to earnings, by introducing the very
pension savings credit that is shortly to bite the dust, by bringing
low earners and carers into the second state pension and also,
crucially, by reducing the number of years of national insurance
contributions needed for a full state pension. It was 44 years for men

1 is a landmark in the history of British state pensions. It creates a
single state pension in place of the current two-tier system. It marks
a return to the simplicity that Beveridge had in mind in 1942 and a

for children down there to 10%. The DWP publishes annually the
households below average income report, a national statistic which
provides a full analysis of the levels of relative and absolute poverty
for pensioners, and pensioner material deprivation. In addition, in
order to look at the impact of the Government’s pension reforms
as a whole, the Government published a framework for the analysis of
future pension incomes in September 2013, which provides an overview of
projected future retirement incomes.</hs_para>

question from my noble friend Lord Kirkwood, who asked for reassurance
on the delivery plans for the single-tier state pension. As noble Lords
are all aware, it will be introduced from 6 April 2016. The
single-tier programme was set up in 
<?notus-xml column=204?>early 2012 to undertake early feasibility work and test deliverability
of the policy as it was being developed. It is a DWP programme, with
changes being delivered by the DWP and HMRC.</hs_para>

delivering by April 2016 for several reasons. First, there is broad
consensus on the main principles of the reform, which provides a
helpful basis to plan for implementation. The main development of
systems will commence once the Bill gets Royal Assent, at which point
the key legislation will be settled. This will ease the challenge of
developing systems while policy is likely to change.</hs_para>

change needed to deliver single tier is to reform the way we calculate
state pension, based on an individual’s national insurance
contributions. We have long-standing experience of using national
insurance contribution records held on HMRC systems to calculate
pensions. Single tier is just a variant of that process. We will,
however, aim to use this opportunity to make improvements to the way
that we deliver our services.</hs_para>

departments have the capacity to deliver the programme, have a good
recent track record of making major changes to pensions calculations to
tight timescales and have successfully delivered previous pension
reform changes. The programme will use a process of phased development
of systems and processes to minimise any risks to delivery of single
tier. Both the DWP and HMRC will use existing staff who have expertise
in dealing with NICs and pensions to deliver these reforms. HMRC also
has experience of managing the end of contracting out for defined
contribution schemes in 2012. This will stand it in good stead for
introducing the changes for defined benefit schemes.</hs_para>

users and interested parties in a very practical way, helping us to
test each stage of developments to make sure that they work to provide
an accessible and easy-to-use service. The new systems will be tested
in advance of April 2016, through the advance claims process.
Additionally, we are building in contingency to ensure that the
existing telephony channel can be used, just in case the digital
solution does not work on day
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121617000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121617000048">A clear
governance structure exists to manage the implementation. A DWP
programme board, on which HMRC sits, is in place to oversee delivery of
single-tier pension and delivery teams have been set up in both
departments. Both departments believe that delivery of the single-tier
reform is challenging but doable. The main change needed to deliver
single tier is to reform the way we calculate state pension and that
remains the focus of the programme. We do, however, need to take this
opportunity to move to a more efficient and customer-focused business
delivery that meets the government commitment to deliver more services
digitally. To achieve this, the programme team is working closely with
the Cabinet Office. The department is also building its capability in
developing digital services through the appointment of a
director-general with introduction of single tier as a digital service
as his primary
responsibility.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121617000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121617000049">To
conclude, I agree that reducing pensioner poverty is crucial. The steps
already taken by this Government will help to do so and the measures in

that pension credit works. I have got a little bit more information.
The cost of £10 billion is to get everyone on to single tier,
and that is the cost to get all current pensioners to the illustrative
£144 per week. I can confirm that cost is £10 billion per
annum. This is a figure taken at 2016 and clearly that would reduce
over time. The other issue that we discussed as we went through this

does the Minister expect savings credit to no longer exist because the

since they came to power, the Government have frozen the maximum level

that many older pensioners who would not otherwise qualify will qualify

off if they are not covered in the  £10 billion to see
what the actual net extra cost is. If,  in that exercise, the

the moment, many poorer men who have dropped out of the labour market
between 60 and 65 are able to draw full pension credit on equal terms,
ages and rates with women who are getting the BSP plus pension credit.
In the same way—and this is, of course, part of the European
directive on equality—men could get a winter fuel payment or a
bus pass at the same age as women, which was at women’s BSP age,
from 60 on, not at their own retirement age. The same rule applies to
pension

when women’s BSP age was 60, men could draw pension credit to
top up their IS for five years before becoming eligible for their own
BSP at 65. When women’s BSP age rose to 62, men could draw
pension credit from 62 until their retirement age—there are no
cliff edges for them. They are now effectively getting an income the
same as the BSP and the same as women at age
63<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:13:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121622000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121622000009">Currently
167,000 men between 60 and 65 draw pension credit. That tops up their
income support of nearly £70 to the standard pension credit
figure of nearly £140. It doubles it. Incidentally, a higher
number of men between the ages of 60 and 65 draw pension credit than
the number of men between 75 and 79. To put it another way, just under
a fifth of all men who draw pension credit—although some, of
course, may be in couples—draw it before their state pension
age. That is great for them. However, unlike women, when they reach 65,
after 5 April 2016, they move smoothly on to the new and more generous
state
pension.<I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:15:03"></hs_TimeCode></I>
We did not hear a word of this down the other end but, in other words,
men have had a double protection: pension credit on women’s
terms, followed by the new state pension on men’s terms. Not
only were they not disadvantaged by being male, they were actively
protected and, to that degree, favoured.</hs_para>

thought it odd that the Minister did not choose to mention that in the
other place. Instead, he spent most of his speech comparing this cohort
of women with those women younger than them and those women older than
them, to his satisfaction. He may well be right, statistically.
However, he did not compare them with men, which was the whole point of
the discussion, after all. Again, it is curious. By contrast women face
a delayed retirement age, with of course no access to pension credit
before it, but will then not be able to move on to the new pension when
they reach retirement. You can understand why they feel they have been
discriminated against—because, compared to men of the same age,
they

Minister may remind us of the cost of this amendment—some
£150 million to £200 million, we were told down the other
end. I remind him that, as the pension age rises for women until it
reaches 65, thousands of men will each year drop out of the
pension-credit-receiving cohort—they run alongside the
women’s increasing pension age—until, by 2018, no man or
woman will receive pension credit until they are 65, and then only if
they fail to qualify for the new state pension. In 2009-10, 235,000 men
aged 60 to 64 claimed pension credit, giving them effectively the same
income as a woman on BSP. By May 2013, there were 167,000
men—that is today’s figure—a drop of almost
70,000, because women’s pension age had risen by 18 months. The
savings from that drop in men no longer claiming pension credit would
go a long way to meeting the cost of this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:16:46"></hs_TimeCode>. I do
not have enough stats to do a proper calculation; I have tried, but I
can only guesstimate: for every year of the BSP age raised for women,
the Government make—I think—up to £175 million of
savings from men who drop out of the eligible cohort for pension
credit. Obviously those savings will end when women equalise at 65, but
in the meanwhile those savings could be  set against the
putative cost of a lower figure—some £150
million—for this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:17:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that those savings are not available as they have already been built
into HMRC forecasts. He may not use that argument at all—I do
not know—but, if he does, why would he accept that? HMRC has
already claimed for itself all the savings from the rise of
women’s state pension age, and all the £5.5 billion
coming from the NIC changes. If it now claims the pension credit cohort
savings from men as well, the pattern seems to be that all savings go
to HMRC, so by definition there is never any money available to correct
even quite honest anomalies or
injustices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:18:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

applies only to women ordinarily resident in the UK. The Minister will
know that there is well established case law on “ordinarily
resident”, “habitually resident” and the like.
This should ensure that the money does not flow to overseas women with
little or no connection to this country, which the Minister in the
other place was so anxious to avoid. Steve Webb moved amendments in the
other place to that effect on bereavement benefits in July, so it is
clearly appropriate to add this new

not accept the Government’s argument. This cohort of women is
not gaining a lower pension but for two years longer compared to men,
which in government eyes sort of evens things out. On the contrary, the
pension credit rules have given protection to men—no cliff
edges—which is now effectively denied to women. As that
protection for men falls away as women’s pension age rises, it
offers savings which, so far as I can tell, would substantially finance
this amendment. That is fair, realistic and affordable; I hope that the

deal of correspondence on this issue, as I am sure other noble Lords
have, from individual campaigners and organisations concerned about the
position of women born between April 1951 and April 1953, and my noble
friend Lady Hollis has set out a range of concerns about their
position. The headline concern that has been raised most often with me
posits the position of a pair of male and female twins, born on the
same date in that window, who are treated differently. The man will get
the new single-tier pension and the woman will not, even if both have
worked for 35 years or more or even if both of them are still working,
with the woman having deferred her 
<?notus-xml column=211?>pension. My noble friend made the important point that unemployed men
are treated effectively as if they are retired and get the equivalent
to the amount that the woman would receive in pension.
Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:22:12"></hs_TimeCode> women are
caught in the equalisation of the pension age. They say that they do
not object to the equalisation but they feel that they have lost out in
comparison with other women because, unlike women born before April
1951, they could not retire at 60 on a full pension. Those born after
April 1953 get the full STP at the age of 63—that is, up to one
year and 10 months earlier than men born after April 1953.</hs_para>

noble friend Lady Donaghy gave a moving account of the life courses of
many women of that age and the extent to which the way they are treated

finally decide, it is important that Parliament and the Government

acknowledge that a line must be drawn somewhere but there are some
questions to which I have not yet had satisfactory answers. First, as
my noble friend Lady Hollis noted, there is the position of men born
between 1951 and 1953 who are unemployed and get treated as if they
were pensioners. Currently, a man in that situation who cannot claim
the state pension, where a woman of the same age would, can get pension
credit. Will the Minister confirm that that is the case? If so, the
question has been raised with me as to whether these women have a claim
in law on equality grounds and, if so, what that would mean. It might
be helpful if the Minister could tell us whether the Government have
sought legal advice on this matter and, if so, have they been assured
that their position is safe? I assume that they were or the Minister
would not have felt able to sign the habitual statement at the start of
the process, but it would be helpful to clarify that.</hs_para>

second big issue was the impact on this particular cohort of women.
From having read the proceedings in another place, I think that the
Government’s case is this: there are always cliff edges; there
are always winners and losers and these are just the unlucky ones;
these women will already be pensioners and some will have been able to
draw their pension before 2016; they can always exercise the right to
defer drawing down their pension and get a 10% uplift each year, which
would effectively bring them up to the STP level by 2016; and only
70,000 of those 700,000 women born between 1951 and 1953 will be worse
off, and the median loss will be only £6 a week.</hs_para>

campaigners to that case is this: some people will lose more than
£6 a week, but even £6 a week is a lot of money,
especially for 25 years. They are getting their pension
earlier, but over their lifetime they will be disadvantaged. I would be
grateful if the Minister could confirm that that was the case and, if
so, when the break-even point comes, since they could be expected to
live for a further 10 to 15 years and in some cases many more, we
hope.</hs_para>

the campaigners say that most women spend most of their working lives
expecting to retire at 60, so this is a shock to them. Finally, they
point out that not many people can afford to defer taking their
pensions. The figures that were supplied to us by the department
suggest that only 0.9 million people in Great Britain get an increment
as a result of deferral, as against 10.8 million who do not. I think
that the figure in total was 1.2 million. If that is the case,
inevitably it is a minority activity. Effectively, therefore, the right
to defer your retirement date is a bit like the right to shop in
Harrods: we can all do it but we cannot all afford to do it, so I am
not sure that that totally answers the
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:25:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121622000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121622000024">That
leaves us with some unanswered questions which I invite the Minister to
address. First, there seems to be agreement that 70,000 women from this
cohort will lose out. I do not yet understand the Government’s
case for saying that they are so confident that the other 630,000 will
be better off remaining in the current arrangements. The Government
claimed in the other place that most women would be better off under
STP. In the Committee there, the Pensions Minister said that, in the
first few years, 700,000 women would be better off on STP by
an average £9 a week. The impact assessment says that, as a
result of the STP valuation, around 650,000 women who reach state
pension age in the first 10 years after implementation will get an
average £8 more in state pension in 2013-14 earnings
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:26:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121622000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121622000025">The
question then is this: how is the cohort of women born from 1953 to
1960, to whom those figures refer, so different from those born from
1951 to 1953? In other words, if the people who just get in will be
better off in the new system, why would the people who just miss out be
worse off? I hope that the Minister can explain to me the reason for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:26:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121622000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121622000026">I
want to drill down into this. The only reasons that I can think of come
in the form of questions. First, the Government say that 30,000 people
will lose from the derived entitlements post 2016. Can the Minister
tell us how many of this cohort—that is those 1951 to 1953
women—would have derived entitlements? If not, perhaps he would
smile upon our Amendment 4A. Secondly, some divorced couples
with pension-splitting arrangements might be worse off under STP. Does
the Minister know how many of those are within that 630,000? Thirdly,
do most of those women have 30 years’ national
insurance credits? Is that a factor? How many of them would have enough
to get access to a full single-tier pension? Fourthly, how many of
those women are better off as a result of their getting pension savings
credit? What might happen in the future given the direction of travel
on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:27:51"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121622000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121622000027">My
final question is about the costings. In Committee in another place,
the Minister suggested that the costs for bringing this group into the
system would be an initial £150 million a year, peaking at
£300 million, and cumulatively costing about £4 billion.
I am not an economist so I am not disputing the figures, but I do not
understand them. If only 70,000 women are worse off and by a mean
£6 a week, I make that—admittedly, using my
calculator—£21 million a year. Even if they live for 25
years after retirement, I cannot get that 
<?notus-xml column=213?>above half a billion pounds. I am not suggesting that that is a small
sum, nor offering to spend it; I am just trying to understand why I am
so far out from the costings given by the Minister in the other
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:28:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I

course, there are a lot of unanswered questions, but they work both
ways. How can the Government say with any authority how much it will

example, there is no minimum qualifying period under the old system,

The existing pension system allows additional payments under savings

Those on the existing pension scheme are allowed derived and inherited

said on Second Reading, this is a case of swings and roundabouts,

the reason why women born between April 1951 and April 1953 will not be
in receipt of single-tier pension is because they will already be
eligible for pension under the old system—the argument that the
noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, put forward. Women will be able to claim
pension under the old system for between two and four years longer than

<?notus-xml column=214?>men of equivalent age who are not unemployed. For those men, that could
amount to between £13,000 and £26,000 in basic pension

that does not help those women in that cohort who have 35 years’

place, yes, there is the ability to buy additional national insurance
contributions for those who fall short of the 30-year requirement or
for people to defer receipt of their state pension until after 2016, in

everything into account, the DWP estimates that 90% of the women born
between April 1951 and April 1953 would be better off under the
existing system of pension and other benefits but, because of the
complexity, it is difficult to understand how that figure has been
arrived at and it would be good to receive some clarification from the
Minister as to where those numbers come from, to reassure us that that

still leaves some women in that cohort who will be worse off than men

said that, even for those women, whatever they will receive under the
existing system, as a result of the Liberal Democrats in the coalition
Government and the triple lock, will be more in basic state pension
than they would have planned for under the previous Labour Government.
Although they may not be in the 10%, according to the DWP figures, who
will be disadvantaged, they will still be receiving more in basic state
pension as a result of the triple lock than they would have anticipated
receiving previously. We are not talking about taking money away from

still be inequalities in the existing system because of the historic
situation with women in the workplace taking time off as primary carers

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments centre on the group of
women who will receive a state pension under the existing system, while
men born on the same day as them may be eligible for a single-tier
pension. We recognise that people are concerned about this issue and we
have already reviewed the position of this group of women. Having
looked at the numbers, our analysis shows that about 90% of the women
in this group will receive more in state pension and other benefits
over the course of their retirement than a man born on the same day as
them with the same national 
<?notus-xml column=216?>insurance record who will be getting a single-tier pension. To be
specific, this comparison excludes pension credit but includes savings
credit.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121627000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000002">The
reason is that those women reach state pension age between two and four
years before their theoretical twin brothers. Indeed, almost half the
group are already drawing their state pension and, on average, will
have drawn up to £26,000 before their male twins have begun to
draw their pensions. I am excluding from that the unemployed group to
which the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, drew our attention. This group
of women were not affected by the Pension Act 2011 pension age changes;
their state pension age was set back in 1995. We are increasing pension
age to maintain sustainability and fairness between the generations.
These interactions with pension credit are inevitable consequences of
introducing single tier at a time of unequal pension ages. We do not
want to wait until late 2018, when pension ages will have equalised,
before introducing single
tier.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000003">In
addition, being a single-tier pensioner, especially in the early years,
does not necessarily mean people receiving a full single-tier pension.
Under the current system, the median average entitlement for the women
in this group is projected to be £125 per week. A similar
valuation based on single-tier rules results in a figure of £131
per week—a difference of £6. These are median averages;
about half the group would see no change in their entitlement at all.
To pick up the point made by my noble friend Lord Paddick, these women
have benefited from the triple lock. Basic state pension will be
£8 higher per week in 2014-15 than if their pensions had been
uprated by earnings since the start of this Parliament. Almost half
these women already drawing their state pension are benefiting from the
triple
lock.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000004">It is
often assumed that the new system will simply be more generous than the
current system but, as the Committee will be aware, and as we will
discuss in depth later, that is not necessarily the case. We will put
in place a minimum qualifying period and close access to the savings
credit. We will also reduce the deferral increment rates and cease the
ability to derive pension from a spouse’s record. Many people
will gain from single tier but there are those who will receive less,
compared to the current rules. In response to the questions on costings
from the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, we assume that these women
could choose the system that is better for them, although that is not
necessarily an easy choice. However, that is the basis on which we have
got to those particular costings.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> I will have to write with that estimate. There is
every way of doing these estimates that one can imagine. That brings me
to the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, and the
noble Lord, Lord Browne, which is to review how many women in this
cohort are projected to derive a pension 
<?notus-xml column=217?>based on their spouse’s record. We have published a paper on
derived entitlement, which covers the projected outcomes for people as
a result of removing these provisions. As one may expect, individuals
reaching pension age in the few years before April 2016 will have
similar national insurance records to those reaching pension age in the
few years after April 2016. As such, we can assume that the proportion
of women in the cohort under question retiring under the current system
who benefit from derived entitlement is broadly similar to the
proportion of women reaching pension age just after 2016 who may be
disadvantaged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" PimsId="996" UID="13121627000062" xid="1545" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000062">Baroness

Second Reading, the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, recognised that a
line had to be drawn somewhere, but she asked the House to think
carefully about whether it is right that twins of different genders
should find themselves in different positions. Equally, one could ask
whether it would be fair for people who reach state pension age on the
same day—for example, the 65 year-old man and the 61
year-old woman—to be in different positions. The noble Baroness,
Lady Sherlock, is absolutely right that a line has to be drawn. We have
been clear and consistent that only people reaching pension age after
the new system is implemented may receive a single-tier
pension.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121627000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000010">The
noble Baroness asked whether these women would lose out. It is not a
question of this particular cohort losing out; they simply will not
receive a single-tier pension, just like everyone else reaching pension
age before 2016. The Government have not changed these women’s
state pension age and so there has not been a change in the pension
that these women were expecting. Regarding the leading question on
discrimination raised by the noble Baroness, I can confirm that any
difference in treatment is as a result of the legislation providing for
the change in pension age, which is not in this Bill, and we are
satisfied that there is no breach of Article 14 of the ECHR on grounds
of sex. This is justifiable in helping to pursue legitimate aims and
achieving them in a timely way to achieve an equality of state pension
outcomes between men and women
generally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Sherlock" PimsId="5776" UID="13121627000064" xid="2050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000064">Baroness

is pension sharing in future only of the additional state pension,
whereas of course at the moment anyone divorced can also take on the
existing NI record—the basic state pension—of their
former spouse if it is more favourable than their own. There are two

certainly in the paper and all the rest of it, are so clear as to what
people can expect. That is very
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000022">To
the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, I say that the point that I was trying to
make is not that all men were in the same position as all women between
the ages of 60 and 65. However, essentially, of men who chose to take
early retirement only about 2% or 3% chose to go on to JSA or
incapacity benefit in that period. The others went on to IS and were
topped up by PC. Those men who chose to take early retirement were
effectively retiring at the same age as women. That may, to a degree,
have been forced on them by unemployment, but they had a choice. They
could have gone on to JSA but, perfectly sensibly, they chose not to do
so. Instead they went into effectively a pension regime, originally
from the age of 60, which was when the age for women was the
same.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121627000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000023">Of
course, other men, who were in work, carried on building up their
pension until age 65, primarily because those between 60 and 65 on PCs
still carried on adding to their NI years, as I recall. However, those
other men were able to build up their additional pension and thus
protect it as they went through—essentially, SERPS. Women of
that age would have had little, if any, entitlement to SERPS. They
would have had entitlement—as will younger women—to S2P,
primarily because of the extension of the credits that apply to them,
particularly for childcare. Those were introduced quite late, so those
women will not, for the most part, have had access to an additional
state pension. Men who continue to work to 65, as most of them
will—the noble Lord is right on that—will continue to
build up that additional pension, which will be protected after they
are 65.</hs_para>

Government are taking a swings and roundabouts approach on this. I
think that 167,000—originally 235,000 in 2009-10, and before
that a higher figure—had the choice of the same pension as
women, age for age. Women have had no such choice. That is why they
face cliff edges in a way that men do not. The problem for us has been
about cliff edges. The point that I was trying to push was that men did
not face any cliff edges. Whatever their age when they retired after
60, they could have a smooth pension level that was the same as women,
then they progressed quite nicely at 65; if that happens after 5 April
2016, they will move on to the new pension. Women have no such choice.
If they tick their pension, the same as the men, at 63 the shutters
come down and they can never move that next step on to the new state
pension, which men could in their situation. Women have a cliff edge,
while men have a nice smooth path down to paddling in the sea. That is
what I was primarily concerned
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000025">The
problem comes as we recognise that we should try to equalise the state
pension age at the same time as the Government are introducing the new
state pension. I recognise the difficulty. When I started work on this
I took pretty much the Minister’s line—that this was on
the one hand or on the other—but the more I worked on pension
credit, the more I saw the number of people claiming it and how
substantial their numbers were. Not 5,000 or 10,000 but a fifth of all
men claiming pension credit claim it before they are 65. That means, in
terms of savings and the rest of it, that many of them will have gone
on to claim that after 65 under the old system. Given that substantial
number, it is worth emphasising that women have had a double hit and
men have had a smooth transition throughout. Whatever the Minister may
argue—and I understand his stats—if you hold up the
gender filter to this issue, you can see exactly, as my noble friend
said in her speech, why women, rightly, feel hard done by. They are
faced with a cliff edge and have no way of ameliorating it, unlike men
have had over the past few years—in some cases the past five
years—of their working-age
lives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000026">However,

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a gentle,
probing amendment designed to give some respite to the Minister and to
explore further the details of what is planned about the nature and
extent of the communication strategy envisaged for the introduction of
the single-tier state pension. The noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, touched
on this, as did the Minister in responding to the first group of
amendments.</hs_para>

have been provided with a certain amount of information in the various
briefing packs and we have had the opportunity to peruse the
overarching strategy for communicating the reforms, which has been made
available in the Library. I take this opportunity to commend the Bill
team. We do not want to heap too much praise on them, as this is just
the start of our proceedings, but I think that we have had some
genuinely good information packs, which have helped. The problem with
good information packs, of course, is that they generate additional
queries, so forgive me if I pursue some of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:01:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000029">One
objective of the strategy is, rightly, to inform people about the
impact of the reforms on their individual circumstances and the actions
that they may take to improve them. That aspect is of particular
relevance to the amendment. It seems to me that the state pension
statement is to be the key way in which this communication is
delivered, so the Minister may wish to comment on the statutory
underpinning of such statements, if it exists, and on whether this
might be
improved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:02:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000030">Although
the amendment focuses on STP, it does not negate the need to
communicate to those who retire before 6 April 2016, especially in
relation to the extended arrangements for paying voluntary NICs and the
new class 3A NICs to improve state second pensions. I ask the Minister
specifically what is planned in this regard. I suppose, given our
earlier debates, that the key communication issue for those who retire
before 6 April 2016 is why they are in a separate category, although I
do not want to revisit the debate that we have just had.</hs_para>

that are particularly in need of information are those who are entitled
to a state pension at the transitional rate. If they are to be
encouraged to make rational savings decisions, such information as
their foundation amount, any protected payments, the rebate derived
amount where appropriate or any derived and inherited entitlement is
key. Individuals should be made aware of how the revaluation of the
various components is to work and they will need to be alerted to their
potentially not meeting the minimum qualifying period, having fewer
than 35 qualifying years, as well as not being able to add further to
their STP.</hs_para>

is understood that this information is still to flow via state pension
statements, but following implementation of the STP it is not planned
to make it proactively available, either as soon as the NIC information
is available up to 5 April 2016 or otherwise. A post-implementation
statement will be provided on demand and digitally but not otherwise,

therefore arise. Can the Minister clarify precisely what is to happen
between Royal Assent and in advance of implementation so far as state
pension statements are concerned? Will these be made available
proactively or will individuals have to ask for them? It is understood
why a digital service is to be developed for
post-implementation—that is to be welcomed—but there will
be some for whom the digital approach will be difficult. That is surely
the experience of universal credit. What other support will be
available to these people? There is clearly some merit in being able to
take stock of one’s state pension provision as close to 6 April
2016 as possible, so can the Minister say how long it is expected to be
before the 2015-16 national insurance data will generally be available
at individual level? How long does it take for that to filter through
to the records?</hs_para>

more complex situations, how quickly is it envisaged that individuals
will be informed of all their pension components, including the
rebate-derived amounts, after 6 April 2016? What, if any, capacity will
there be in the system for individuals to query, challenge or even
appeal the details that they receive? We are told that there is not the
capacity in the system to provide full details to everyone
proactively—like the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, I think that
there is a measure of concern about that. Just what is the capacity to
provide such details for those who would likely be entitled to a state
pension at the transitional rate? We are told that,
post-implementation, state pension statements are to be provided on
demand. Those who are clued up and digitally savvy will cope, but what
monitoring will be undertaken to see what is happening to those who are
not? What particular communication strategies are to be focused on the
self-employed, who will be brought more fully into the system than

the components of the calculation will generally be more
straightforward for those who grow up entirely in the new system, they
will still need information so that they can be reassured on their
likely level of state pension income and the desirability of saving. Of

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to comment very
briefly. I declare an interest, which I know is relevant to this
amendment, as a board member of the Pensions Advisory Service. TPAS has
recently completed a survey of just under 1,000 women on their pensions
which makes the point absolutely for my noble friend’s request
for an information and communication strategy to go out to prospective
pensioners and pensioners. Of that 1,000 women, 36% did not know when
their state pension would be paid; 74% did not know how much they would
receive; 57% did not know whether there was a shortfall in their NI
record; 25% do not know that the age is likely to change again; 54%
have made no changes to their 
<?notus-xml column=223?>retirement plans; 27% wonder whether they will have to work longer; and
76% do not expect to be financially comfortable in retirement. I have
before me a lot of quotes, some of which I may choose to use later on.
Those figures suggest how wilfully uninformed far too many women are
about what will happen to them over the next couple of years. That
evidence from a TPAS sample substantiates my noble friend’s
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:08:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121627000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000037"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord German" PimsId="5765" UID="13121627000076" xid="2039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121627000076">Lord

receiving my state pension statement. It was a bit of a shock, because
I always thought that I was so young that I would never receive one,
but it did happen.</hs_para>

Just today, we have heard that we have now reached 2 million people

they have got into it. We have 3,500 employers. I welcome the British

relates to something which happened to me last Friday. I was doing
Lords outreach with two schools and the pension question came up. I do
not know whether it had been planted by a teacher in advance but it
came up. It is quite clear that when these matters are scrutinised,
young people are beginning to realise that if we do not put those
matters right they, too, will be having to pay more. I always save for
my grandchildren, who are enthusiastic to hear that they will be paying
to sustain me into older life—but, of course, I am not a
recipient of the new single-tier pension. However, when we talk about
this issue I wonder whether we should also try to include in it
education from a younger age, so that when people receive any financial
education within their school life, they can understand that pensions
are not a matter for tomorrow or for when you are retiring; they are a
matter for the day on which you start to pay and earn. This is a
probing amendment but it is very important that, along with other
measures which are going on, pensions are seen as an issue for all from

Greengross:</Member></B> My amendment is about a public education
programme, which is necessary as so many people are in the same
position, as has been outlined in noble Lords’ statements.
Amendment 30 seeks to ensure that individuals are made aware of both
their responsibilities and expected outcomes here; for example, in
terms of state pension contribution years and amounts, and what
outcomes they can expect and when. Given longer life expectancy and 
<?notus-xml column=224?>extended working patterns, it is not unreasonable to increase the number
of national insurance contributory years from 30 to 35. People who have
contributed for less than 35 years but for at least the minimum
qualifying period of seven to 10 years are going to receive a
proportion of the pension. However, it is absolutely critical that this
change is clearly communicated to all individuals so that they can
ensure that any years outside of work—for example, because of
ill health or caring responsibilities—are counted as years of
contribution and so that they can make appropriate private pension
arrangements, should they wish to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question of information. The Government have stressed at different
stages of the Bill the move to reduce the complexity of the state
pension to make sure that people understand their likely entitlement
and are therefore incentivised to save enough to complement the support
that they can expect from the state. This came up a lot when the Work
and Pensions Select Committee looked into the matter.

There are a couple of specific questions which I should be grateful if
the Minister would answer. One is the obvious one, which is to be
precise about at what point and in what form someone could expect to be
contacted to have explained to them the nature of their entitlement. Do
the Government propose to contact people who had previously requested a
pension statement to tell them that it may no longer be accurate or
that the basis on which it was calculated may no longer apply? At what

financial education in the school curriculum and increasing young
people’s financial capability is an issue of importance to this
Government and apposite to the point raised by my noble friend Lord
German. In July 2013, the Department for Education published a national
curriculum framework with increased focus on financial literacy in both
the mathematics and citizenship curricula. This will be taught in
schools from September 2014. In 2012, we established the Money Advice
Service to help people manage their money more effectively and better
understand financial products, including pensions. The Money Advice
Service is one of our key partners in providing information to
individuals who are being automatically enrolled into workplace
pensions. The department has also played an active role in developing
the Money Advice Service’s new financial capability strategy to
help tackle the knowledge gaps which can inhibit individuals from
saving in
pensions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000004">We

turn specifically to the state pension reforms in the Bill. We are
committed to taking action to help people to understand the reforms
that we are making and what it will mean for them. As noble Lords know,
the current state pension system is fiendishly complicated. In a 2012
survey, in response to a simple true/false question, only one-third of
people agreed that it was true that the Government provided a second
state pension related to previous earnings. The noble Baroness, Lady
Hollis, noted its complexity and gave lots of saddening statistics.
That is precisely why we are reforming the system to make it—in
principle—comprehensive to as many people as possible. We are
tackling this systemic problem by creating a simpler state pension so
that everyone can know both what counts towards their state pension and
how much they can expect to receive. However, we recognise that the
benefits of this simpler system can be realised only if we communicate
the changes effectively to the

turn to the noble Lord‘s amendment about the timely provision of
individualised state pension information. The Department for Work and

the unhappier I get. The people who most need the information are those
who least know that they need to know it—they do not know what
they do not know. For me, that was the clear result from the TPAS
survey: they did not know that changes were happening and they did not
know when they were going to retire or how much they were going to get,
and they had not done anything about it because they did not know what
to do. That is the first problem: that those who request it—the
Minister’s 600,000 a year—are those who are probably more
alert to pension issues and more capable of responding in that
way.</hs_para>

second point if we are going to do this digitally is that we are
talking about a group, particularly women, who may very well not have
access to any such digital back-up at all. My housing association is
already seeing issues with this in spades regarding the universal

requests and, secondly, if we propose to do this digitally, those who
most need help will not get it and they will be the ones who suffer an

Freud:</Member></B> Well, my Lords, I can just take you through our
plans in this area so let me continue to do that. For those who cannot
get digital information, we will ensure that they can still get the
information they need. Our statements will give individuals their
up-to-date state pension position, including their foundation amount,
based on their national insurance record to that point. Where
appropriate, the statement will tell them how many further national
insurance qualifying years they need to reach the full amount of
single-tier pension. As noble Lords will appreciate, it takes a few
months at the end of every tax year to ensure full consolidation of
national insurance records. However, as now, people will still be able
to get a statement based on their contributions up to the previous tax
year, and we will update our statements to reflect people’s full
record for their pre-2016 years as soon as the relevant data are in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000016">PAYE
records are now mainly electronic but we are working on an assumption
that records on account should be ready by October 2016 for the April
introduction. As for the timetable for sending out statements, we can
give people accurate information on their single-tier position when all
their contribution and credits to that point are recorded on their
national insurance record. From Royal Assent, we will include simple
information about single tier, including the relevance of this estimate
in terms of working out their single-tier foundation amount. From
implementation in April 2016, our intention is to provide an on-demand,
largely digital, statement service.</hs_para>

that where it is required people can get a detailed breakdown of the
calculation. For people who are unable to access digital media, we will
ensure that they receive the support they require in a non-digital way
and we will work that up. To revert to the point on the implied
question of issuing everyone with a statement, the issuance of a large
number of unprompted statements—potentially millions of
statements—would be expensive in terms of IT costs, production
costs, postage and staff. Our evaluation of previous unprompted
statement exercises show that there has been little, if any, benefit,

answer to the question about the capacity of the department to respond
to queries if there are more than the current 600,000 requested

of a bit of a flood of inquiries at least at the start when people seek

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> Perhaps I may give the noble Lord
another example, and this will apply to other amendments later on. You
begin to get an increasing degree of ill health among some people at
the age of 50. Women are now very often entitled to a carer’s
credit, which, as the Minister will know, is much less heavy in its
requirements than the carer’s allowance. However, the take-up is
very low. Most people do not know about it at all and it is very hard
to claim it retrospectively. Only when the Minister says to people at,
say, the age of 50, “You’ve got this but the following
credits may be available to you under certain circumstances”,
will we know whether women, as they approach 63, 64 or 65, have built
up an NI record on their own. The Government cannot be passive about
this; they have to provide appropriate information to allow people to
know both what they need and what they can do about it. It seems that
the Minister is basically responding to those who already know that
there is an issue and not to those who do not but
should.</hs_para>

think that any noble Lord in this Room will be under any illusion that
we are not utterly determined to drive forward a transformation in both
working-age and pension-age systems. One of the guiding principles for
both those is simplicity so that people can understand what they are
entitled to and there is an automatic process where you do not have to
do so much work. It is an example of the kind of chaos that we have at
the moment that people do not understand what their entitlement is. I
am equally conscious of the figures in universal credit, where you have
a clean working-age benefit. Two-thirds of the uplift of more than
£2 billion per year that we are able to put through
to people is due to giving them benefits that they do not currently
claim. I do not think that there is any difference. Clearly,
simplification and transformation are right at the heart of the

be possible to go to the previous year’s statement on the normal

what life would be like under STP or would it just be on the old basis?
I accept entirely the Government’s intent to communicate
effectively on this. It would be crazy to develop a policy like this
and then let it fall because there had been inadequate communication,
so there is not a challenge on the Government’s intent here.

credit costs. I pressed the Minister, but he did not give me an
answer—I would be very happy for him to write me—about
the annual savings from each cohort of men falling out of pension

amendment proposes a 2% head space between the new state pension and
what someone would get on pension credit. Obviously, it is a probing
amendment, a peg to explore what the future level of the state pension
vis-à-vis pension credit will be, and to give us information
about some of the winners and losers on the income analysis, on which I
am sure that my noble friends will be pressing the Minister.</hs_para>

particular, I want to focus on the issue of means-testing. As far as we
know, eventually only something like 3% of the means-testing in the
system will drop out as a result of the proposed
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:47:08"></hs_TimeCode>. One of
the great virtues of the new proposed pension was that by bringing
together the BSB, S2P and pension credit, it was to leapfrog some
means-testing. As my noble friend Lady Sherlock said, we had to use
means-tested pension credit when we came into government because
pensioner poverty for the bottom third was so acute and the number was
so large that we could not financially manage a sufficient flat-rate
rise for all. So we targeted our resources, and the policy worked.
However, as my noble friend Lady Turner will remember, although we
pushed the policy through, it was not without insistent, noisy and
continuous haranguing from the late, splendid Barbara Castle, who used
to sit right behind me, muttering very loudly to Muriel as I would
reach some fancy point in policy, “What’s she trying to
say now? What’s she trying to say now?”, to the great
amusement and glee of those on the opposition

policy removed hundreds of thousands of people from poverty, so
pensioners are now less likely than any other group to come within that
category of poverty. However, it came at a price. As we know,
means-testing is disliked, especially by older people and, no, it is
not the same as giving your income details to HMRC for tax purposes. It
is highly expensive to administer and open to error—I will not
say fraud—for this
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000042">Above
all, as the Minister rightly and sympathetically identified in his
previous answer to my noble friend Lord McKenzie, those entitled to
pension credit, such 
<?notus-xml column=233?>as the self-employed unsure of their income or elderly widows whose
husbands’ pensions have died with them and who have never
handled the financial pension arrangements between them, do not always
claim. Unlike lone parents, who are savvy and feisty about their
benefits—well, usually—and have very high claim rates,
pensioners do not. For example, fewer than half of those entitled to
savings credit claim it. In the past, fewer than two-thirds of those
entitled to council tax benefit claimed.</hs_para>

studies were undertaken into why, and I congratulate the DWP on its
fascinating in-house research published last year by Maplethorpe et al
on whether we could get a significant increase in the take-up of
pension credit if pensions were made to the department’s random
sample of 2,000 entitled non-recipients automatically and a further
2,000 ENRs who were followed through by DWP visitors. That was an
imaginative and welcome piece of
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000044">It
is a pity that the results were, for everyone I think, really rather
disappointing. The money was welcomed at the point but after the trial
period of three months DWP had added only about 10% to the number
claiming pension credit, which was useful but not a breakthrough, when
pensioners were required to submit their own forms—in other
words, take the initiative in a means-testing pension credit. As the
research identifies, it is about stigma and difficulty with the forms,
but also we have long found that if a pensioner had applied in the past
for another means-tested benefit—HB, for example—and been
refused, they thought they were ineligible for any other means-tested
benefit so did not apply. If a friend or member of their family had
been refused after applying, they assumed that the case applied to them
too.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121639000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000045">Many of
them felt that the money they got at the end of a lengthy process was
too little to be worth it. They may be right because although the
savings credit mean figure is something like a loss of about £34
a week, the median is infinitely lower because it is skewed by a few
very high numbers at the end. However, pensioners worried—this
is partly the result of some of the problems with tax
credits—that if they were wrongly paid they might face having to
repay money that they subsequently could not afford. Nor are they clear
about income and savings rules; some pensioners with £5,000
tucked away for funeral costs think that that disqualifies them. A few
thought that as they could manage without pension credit, although they
were entitled, it was morally wrong to claim it.</hs_para>

builds on two previous pieces of research that the DWP has done over
the past 15 years on pension credit that I am aware of,
suggested to me that means-tested benefits are almost inherently
troubled by the failure of a substantial number of pensioners to claim,
and that the new state pension is absolutely the right way to go for
the future. It has to be on an automated basis. Whatever may happen to
other means-tested benefits, we hope that at least pensioners’
basic income in the new state pension will be safely delivered and in
full. However, means-testing will continue for the 25% of future
pensioners who are not owner-occupiers but who are on housing benefit
in the rented sector, or for those with incomplete NI 
<?notus-xml column=234?>records. The reduction in means-testing is mainly because the new
pension incorporates the means-tested guaranteed credit while
abolishing the means-tested savings credit. That is actually why the
numbers fall.</hs_para>

if the new pension is to reduce means-testing, as we hope it will
do—though at the moment the statistics do not suggest by as much
as some of us had hoped—it must, to use the phrase, put clear
blue water between it and the new pension. At the moment, the
difference between what a pensioner would get under the three tiers of
state pension, possibly some additional pension and pension credit
under the new state pension, could be less than £1 a week,
although the triple lock for the pension, unlike the earnings link for
pension credit, should widen that gap over time if the triple lock
remains. Age UK has provided figures showing that means-testing will
have fallen by just 3% by 2014 from what it would have been as a result
of this. However, as my amendment suggests, 2% would provide a rounder
figure—a £3 gap, I guess.</hs_para>

each path that a person registering for the new pension will take, and
the winners and losers as a result, so that we can work further on

was not necessary to put that in the legislation. I do not think that

other pensioners, mainly women, are no better off than they would

Drake (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall take advantage of the
helpful peg of this amendment moved by my noble friend Lady Hollis. I
completely accept that moving more rapidly to a flat-rate pension will
bring losers and gainers. However, we need to have some confidence
about the initial value of the single-tier pension and how its value
will be maintained over time, in order to have confidence about the
assessments of gainers and losers.</hs_para>

statistics that we have are based on the assumption of triple-lock
uprating, which is far from assured over time. We know that the
single-tier pension has to produce a series of outcomes: it has to be
above the guarantee credit to address the disincentive to save; it has
to be set at a level which reduces reliance on means-tested benefits;
and it has to provide a firm foundation for private saving. However,
whether it achieves those intentions depends in part on the starting
value of the single tier and how its value moves over
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:55:41"></hs_TimeCode>. The White
Paper therefore suggested that a single-tier pension should be worth
£144 in 2012-13 earnings terms, but the extent to which the
single-tier pension figure is to be set above the pension guarantee
credit is very unclear.</hs_para>

the time of the White Paper’s publication in January 2013, the
illustrative £144 was only £1.30 higher than the
guarantee credit—less than 1%—which was lower than the
figure in the Green Paper, when the £140 illustrative figure was
£7.40 above the guarantee credit, which is nearly 6% higher. In
2013-14 earnings terms, £144 would be worth
£146.30—just 90p above the guaranteed credit of
£145.40<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:56:45"></hs_TimeCode>.
We therefore have a lack of confidence about what the level of the
single-tier pension will be at its introduction, what its uprating is
likely to be over time and what its relationship with the guarantee
credit is likely to

significantly different if the triple lock were not applied. I also
note that, when it comes to assessing gainers and losers, the notional
figures include the previously contracted-out individuals. In one of
the very helpful briefing sessions that we have been afforded, I asked
whether we could see the notional figures for gainers and losers,
excluding those contracted out at April 2016, in the hope that we could
get a clearer picture of winners and losers. I was particularly

shall make a point almost as an aside, but do so because it is
something that I will probably come back to in a later debate. If
private sector employees are going to meet the high national insurance
contribution 
<?notus-xml column=236?>costs of both the employee and the employer through lower private
pension benefit accrual, then what we are seeing is a transfer to the
state system of pre-funded private saving rather than an actual gain
for the individual. I accept that it is transferring a liability to the
state and will reflect in the level of state pension that an individual
gets but, in motive terms, I think that for some individuals overall it
will not necessarily be seen as a gain.

the question of the level at which the single-tier pension will be set
at introduction. Both she and my noble friend Lady Drake have drawn
attention to the rather dusty view taken by different bodies of the
Government’s refusal to do
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000059">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:02:21"></hs_TimeCode>
Work and Pensions Select Committee was very clear about the fundamental
importance of the principle that the STP should be set above the level
of pension credit. That is primarily about means-testing, and I was
grateful to my noble friend Lady Hollis for making the point that,
contrary to what one would think from some of the headline messages,
the percentage-point reduction in means-testing is really very small,
being somewhere between 2% and 3%. That is not very surprising. One of
the notes that we were given explaining means-testing and single tier
confirmed what I think a number of us had expected, which is that,
while there is a small reduction in the number of pensioner
households claiming guarantee credit—pension credit—a
considerable part of the reduction in means-testing on pension credit
relates to those who would have received savings credit.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>It has always
been very easy to reduce the number of people involved in
means-testing: just make benefits less generous or take them away
faster. You simply reduce the level at which you can get them. Taking a
benefit away from people may reduce means-testing; it is not in itself
an achievement. More interesting is what the combined effect
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000060">The
Government’s response to the Select Committee was to confirm
that it was indeed a principle of the STP that it should be set above
the standard minimum guarantee and would be thus set, and that
Parliament would be able to debate it as the regulations would be
affirmative. However, as my noble friend Lady Drake said, the Delegated
Powers Committee pointed out that this is the first time that this is
being set not in primary legislation but simply in regulations which
cannot be amended. I confess that this is not an area of
expertise—along with many things that I talk about—but I
presume that the reason for this is that, when Parliament is debating
the introduction of a new system, it is impossible to understand the
implications for anybody involved unless one knows the level at which
it will be
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:04:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000061">I
spent the entire weekend, apart from a brief outing to the marvellous
Durham Johnston Christmas concert, going through all the details trying
to understand 
<?notus-xml column=237?>the impact on different people of all these changes. They are all
predicated on the assumption that this will be set at £144. If
that assumption proves to be untrue, or indeed if the triple lock
proves not to be the case, then I have no idea what the impact will be
or who the winners and losers will be, and all our debates today and in
the many joyous weeks that we have to look forward to will be rather
academic. Can the Minister be tempted to give us some level of clarity,
at least about what the minimum level might be, in order that we can
understand better the assumptions that the Government are making? I
raised this question at Second Reading and, I have to say, got a rather

central principle that these reforms represent is that the full amount

means-tested support for a single person. This provides a clear
foundation for both private saving and automatic enrolment, and it
builds on the broad cross-party consensus that has characterised the
debate that there has been on pension reform: people need to save more,
and to do that they need to know what they are going to get. The
reforms are therefore not so much about spending more or less money on
future pensioners but about restructuring the system to provide clarity

principle. The start rate that we will fix will need to be set closer

this is being done by affirmative resolution as opposed to in the Bill,
as is the existing position. The different approach was flagged up by
the DPRRC, 
<?notus-xml column=238?>although, interestingly, it did not recommend that we changed our
legislative approach. That approach is consistent with recent
legislation, such as establishing both the ESA and universal credit,

out to noble Lords that where a couple both receive the full amount of

more under the new system than the couples’ rate of the standard

basic level of means-tested support would mean that we could not
guarantee that the reforms would be cost-neutral. With these reforms,

clearly the answer is yes, in part. However, that money is being used

and it allows us to provide the single tier in a cost-neutral package,
while simplifying the system. Although there is no Baroness Castle to
barrack us from in front or behind, or wherever she did it, it clearly
makes sense to go to a system that is less—or as

understand our need for clarity on some of these issues—whether
it is net or gross; mean, median or average and so on—because
they completely reshape the statistical base on which some of us are
trying to base some of our contributions. The Minister is patient in
taking our comments on this point, but we really need to know and we
have not always had the statistics in ways that have allowed us to read
across in a straightforward and simple form. This is not the fault of
the Box; it is simply because that is the way in which, classically,
statistics have been collected.</hs_para>

Minister says that the whole of this project has to be cost-neutral.
Yes, to an extent, but of course it is cost-neutral within a growing
demographic population. When he talks about it being cost-neutral, I am
never sure how much he is looking at the rise in life expectancy and so
on and therefore at the number of claimants coming through,
particularly for the post-war bulge. After all, the GDP figures show a
drop for this group in going to pensions of something like
8.9%—I think I am right; I am doing this from memory—or
about 8.23%. That is a significant drop in projected GDP going to a
cohort that will actually have increased in number. When the Government
say that this has to be cost-neutral, therefore, it seems to me that in
practice, unless I have misunderstood the Minister, that could be
achieved only by allowing the real value of the new state pension to
fall simultaneously with the real value of pension credit. Perhaps he
might like to write to us to confirm whether that is the case. However,
as I have said, I do not understand why he cannot respond to what seems
to be an entirely appropriate piece of analysis that was recommended by
the Select Committee. Perhaps he could write to us and explain why it

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 7 is
another probing amendment so that we understand the buyback rules. By
virtue of the Bill raising the number of qualifying years from 30 to
35, there will be some people, mostly women, who will come to
retirement age with an incomplete NI record. I should emphasise here
that in terms of buyback I am not talking about class 3A—the new
proposals for the additional pension. Some of those missing basic years
may have occurred before 2016; some may occur afterwards. It is crucial
that we help people to have a complete record, otherwise many will need
topping up by pension
credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000089">Buyback,
as members of the Committee will know, comes through making class 3
contributions—what we call voluntary NICs. They cost around
£13 a week, which is about £700 for the purchase of one
year, and add £3 to £4 to your pension, for life, so that
you get a payback within three to four years. That is a return of more
than 25% on your capital, so it is a very good deal if the arrangements
stay the same. Obviously, the class 3A proposals are meant to be
actuarially neutral, so I imagine that they will not be as attractive.
You can buy those extra years in the year that you are missing a class
1 contribution—husbands have sometimes bought them for their
stay-at-home wives and rich kids have sometimes had their parents buy
them for them—or you can revisit the record of your NI
contributions close to retirement and see how many more you need to get
a full state pension. If you can afford to, you can then buy back
contributions for the missing years.</hs_para>

allowed to buy back your missing years either as you went along, so
that they were current, or to buy back the last six years, especially
at retirement. If you had missed a year, say 15 years before, it meant
that you could not retrospectively cover it by buyback. That was
changed after 2006 so that you could buy back any six years. That was
particularly useful to women who might have taken a year or three off,
say 10 years before, when they accompanied their husband to his new job
in a new 
<?notus-xml column=242?>city or because her working life had, for a couple of years, been
interrupted by caring responsibilities for which she could not then
have been credited.</hs_para>

Government have said, as I understand it, that up until April 2023 you
can buy back missing years to 2006, which is good news. I have some
questions. First,
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:28:56"></hs_TimeCode> that happen
if you have already retired? In other words, could someone retiring in
2021 decide to buy back additional missing years? Or must, as in the
past, that purchase take place within a year of retirement? Secondly,
are you limited in the number of years you can retrospectively purchase
to, say, six years within those 16, or could you in theory purchase up
to 16 years at or after retirement—for example, if
you are lucky enough to have a legacy, or
something<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:25:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000092">Thirdly,
are you still able to purchase up to six missing years in any years
before 2006, or has that now been wiped out? That is key. Those were
the years for which women particularly suffered before the credit
system was made more generous. I think that I am right to say that
women who gained NI credits for their children up to 16, which is now
reduced to 12, should be okay, given buyback to 2006, but what of the
situation of a woman carer not eligible for the carer’s
allowance but who today would be eligible for carer’s credit,
which did not exist before 2006? If she were caring for a couple of
elderly relatives, between, say, 2000 and 2004, she might well have
lost several years of NI credit. Can she buy those years
back<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:25:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000093">As

clauses in the Bill which in the House of Commons were described as
being the complex clauses, which deal with transition. Clauses 2 and 3
deal with entitlement to single-tier pension where the national
insurance contributions are all close to 2016, because of the provision
in Clause 4(1)(c), but this seems as good a place as any to deal with

devastating illness. We felt we could manage without claiming
carer’s benefits (which again would have protected my NI

would have bought more contributions, signed on when unemployed,
applied for carer’s allowance—but I can’t go back
and change the past. The retrospective nature of these changes is
terribly unjust and causes us both huge anxiety and fear for the
future, particularly for when, as is likely, I am widowed, and lose
three-quarters of our income”.</hs_quote>

that we are in the process of reforming the state pension system, the
Government have recently made changes to the arrangements for voluntary
contributions to ensure that people can wait until they are able to
request their foundation amount after implementation, before making
decisions on buying additional years. We have adjusted the rules for
people reaching state pension age under single tier to extend the time
limits for paying voluntary contributions to 5 April 2023,
for the tax years from 2006-07 to 2015-16. Usually, contributions are
paid at a higher rate if more than two years have elapsed from the year
in which they were due, but this rule will be suspended until
6 April 2019. This will mean that a person retiring after
2016 will have had a considerable amount of time, up to 17 years since
the relevant gap occurred, in which to decide whether to pay voluntary
contributions.</hs_para>

what I expected to be the case. However, he has failed to say whether
the changes that we made in 2008 will be sustained—that is,
whether, either before 2016 or after it, you can buy back years that
were missed before 2006. I am perfectly well aware that you can go back
to 2006 and carry on buying back to that date right up until April
2023, and I am pleased that the Minister was able to confirm that for
us, but can you buy back years that were missed in, say, 2000 or 2003,
up to 2006, which was sustained as a result of the 2008 Act? This all

recollection, although I have not gone back over the detail, is that
there was the opportunity to buy back outside of the six years, but you
had a limited period in which to do that. I have forgotten what the
deadlines were and I do not know whether that time has expired now;
maybe it has and we are therefore back to the usual six years, with the
extension that the Minister has explained. There were two systems and
there was a limited opportunity to go back—for any length of

of
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000112"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:39:29"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Freud" PimsId="5439" UID="13121639000250" xid="2007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0001.htm#13121639000250">Lord
Freud:</Member></B> Without indulging in too much nostalgia,
particularly as I was not present in 2008—or was not present
here—that relaxation was because of the change from 39
qualifying years to 30. That was specifically introduced to exclude the
cliff edge, and the concession was only for people reaching their state
pension age before 2008. As I said, I do not think that we need to get
over-nostalgic. As they move through into the new single-tier system,
both before and afterwards, people now have a broad ability to purchase
extensive voluntary national insurance contributions, and of course we
are adding to that capability with the new class 3A
voluntary contributions. Therefore, there will now  be a
substantial opportunity for people to buy state
pension<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:41:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sorry but I really
disagree with the Minister on this. My noble friend Lord Browne showed
rather movingly how losing the 60% dependency pension along with a
failure to claim credits and the limitations on buyback that will
continue to happen interlock to ensure that a woman who has done
“the right thing” by her family at every point that she
has been asked to make a decision, putting her family interest ahead of
her own, will end up with an inadequate, incomplete and pretty minimal
basic state pension. That was why we fought quite hard in those years
to enable people to buy back missing years. I can see no moral
difference between a rich kid living in Antibes having the money paid
for them by their father as they sail around the place and a woman who
failed to complete a year’s contributions because she
accompanied her husband when he moved jobs or because she was caring
for somebody and was not eligible for carer’s credit and is not
allowed to buy back. The time limit of six years or so is entirely
arbitrary to suit the convenience of the DWP and to try to impose this
measure on people’s very different and complicated
lives.</hs_para>

still think that our position was right and that the position taken by
the department and the Minister is wrong. By 2030 or so this will not
be an issue, but a lot of people are going to retire in 2016 and their
missing years will not be from 2006 to 2016 but from 1995 or 2000. The
Minister is now telling us that those people cannot buy back the
missing years, even at an appropriate price, although
it will be no problem for somebody 10 years down the road to
buy back years from 15 years beforehand. That inconsistency,
as well as a failure to recognise the problems that many women have had
in the past—which have bedevilled pension issues—in
building up a coherent NI record, will remain with us if the Minister
is not able to move on this

However, I am simply

possibility of allowing women who have done the right thing and put
their family first at difficult points in their lives to make good
their deficit in the NI record, whereas if she were wealthy, well
informed, stayed at home and bought a year every year, she would be
okay. That is not only a failure to recognise her family responsibility
but a failure to recognise the position in which low-income women have
always been placed in relation to pensions. We can do better than that.

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is about the
35-year qualification period to get the full-rate single-tier
pension—of course, that also applies to the reduced rate
pension. I have tabled the amendment because a lot of concern has been
expressed to me. Presently, there are 30 qualifying years for the basic
state pension. That period of 30 years has been achieved
after a fair amount of agitation  in the past, and people are
anxious to retain it. The Government, however, apparently argue that
the 35 years is associated with a higher benefit, but this
argument ignores the fact that most people will also have 
established some rights to the second-tier pension at that
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

framework, a low-paid employee can establish an entitlement to a level
of state pension equal to £144 if they have 30 qualifying
years’ contributions or credit for the basic state pension, and
of course they have to have 22 years for the second state pension.
Putting in 35 years instead of 30 seems to a number people simply to be
going backwards. It is obvious that other people feel like that as well
because my noble friend Lady Sherlock has tabled Amendment 16, with
which my amendment is grouped and which again raises doubts about the
35-year provision. That amendment suggests that there should be a
review to determine costs and benefits and so on.</hs_para>

would prefer of course to have 30 years rather than the 35,

issued to both Houses of Parliament. I would be in support of that as
well. I beg to

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble

chronology in our thinking, a similar amendment to this was considered
in the House of Commons after Clause 4. That was to the benefit of the
debate in relation to it. The call for a review really belongs with
Clauses 3 and 4 because it relates to transition whereas, as I have
indicated earlier, Clauses 2 and 3 relate only to people whose
qualification in terms of contributions has been achieved post-2016. In
the words of the Pensions Minister, that makes it much easier and
simpler to understand Clauses 2 and 3 than it does Clauses 3 and 4,
which are significantly complex. However, my noble friends will be
pleased to hear that I do not intend to go into the detail of all the
elements of the transition. There are complexities there, some of which
it would be helpful if the Minister explained to the Committee so that
we had an understanding of the complexity and the consequences of it
for
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000126">I
will first address the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lady
Turner, which challenges the imposition, as it were, of a qualifying
period of 35 years so soon after we changed the law to
reduce the qualifying period for the state pension to 30 years. It
would be to the benefit of the Committee’s understanding of the
Bill and the policies that instruct it if the Minister addressed
himself, as I am sure he will, to the way  and the processes by
which that figure of 30 years  was arrived at. It was probably
best explained by the Pensions Minister at col. 141 of the House of
Commons Committee stage on 2 July. He set out broadly that  the
existing state pensions structure had two elements to it: the basic
state pension, for which there was a 30-year qualifying period, and
then the additional pension—as we have come to know it in terms
of the Bill, but which has different elements depending on which years
one looks at—which could be built up from rights that have been
built up over as much as 49 or 50 years of a working
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:53:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

explained that in arriving at a period of contributions that should
entitle one to an amalgamation of these two rights, he looked for a
“weighted average”. He was challenged, probably
correctly, as to why in earlier consideration of where it should lie he
had favoured or indicated—at least in his evidence to the Select
Committee—the figure of 30 years as opposed to any later figure.
He was asked pointedly by my colleague Gregg McClymont whether there
was a financial consideration as opposed to just some broadaxe approach
at trying to work out somewhere that was appropriate, and which could
do justice to those two elements as they were brought
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000128">The
advantage that my noble friend Lady Turner gives the Committee is that
she gives the Minister an opportunity to explain in more detail how the
30-year figure was arrived at and how it can be justified, as opposed
to some broadaxe, weighted average-type judgment. If it is just a
judgment that had to be made for speed and efficiency, the Committee
ought to know that it is about the right figure and there is nothing
more to it than that. That is the strong implication of the
way in which the Pensions Minister approached his explanation in the
debate in the House of Commons.</hs_para>

support the single-tier pension and recognise that at some stage,

do not think I will detain the Committee for nearly as long as my
honourable friend Gregg McClymont engaged the Committee in the other
place on the amendment that now stands in my name and that of my noble
friend Lady Sherlock. However, in introduction, I want to tease out one
or two observations about the amendment that I think should properly
lie in our discussion after the debate about Clause 4, to explain why a
review is necessary. Once one gets a sense of the complexity of the
transition and the interaction of different calculations, one begins to
realise just how important it is to have a review informed by reality.
Of course, a part of that reality is the level at which the single-tier
pension is fixed so that one knows who are the losers and who is being
affected</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000131">What
really instructs the review is a defeat of expectations. The Pensions
Minister engaged with the perception rather than the reality. I am not
keen on trying to argue policy changes on the basis of perception. That
is principally because for two years I was a Minister in Northern
Ireland, where I was repeatedly told, “In this country,
Minister, you have to understand that perceptions are much more
important than facts”. No matter how good my arguments were, I
was told, “But that is not how it will be perceived” in
one community or another, and that perceptions were much more important
than facts—so much so that I thought for a period of having one
of those famous signs on the desk that Ministers and executives often
have made, reading, “In this office, facts are more important
than perceptions”, but I thought that that might have been
provocative and decided that it would not be a good

come to this in some detail—I am not going to take that long

that they were expecting. However, they are retiring into an

interesting. First, the Committee there was engaged for about one hour

simple but it took about an hour and 30 minutes to debate it, when

difficult to keep up with. It is not straightforward. It is a bit like
reading a Russian novel, where you have to keep going back to the first
couple of pages to see who the characters actually are because they
have so many names. The Joes, the Bills and the others in the
worked-through examples that we are given are slightly difficult to
keep up with, and there is a substantial non sequitur on page 3 or 4,
where you have an expectation that you will turn the page and it will

£110. There is no confusion and no need for a review, because it
is already clear”. People who really know what they are doing,
and who to a degree instructed this policy, set out to try to explain
it. Eight pages later, they have done a very good job but what they
have not done, which is extremely interesting, is engage with the one
example provided by one of my colleagues in the debate in the House of
Commons, about a constituent of hers whose working circumstances had
left her in a situation where, like my correspondent today, she had a
shortfall of national insurance contributions and no apparent way of
making it up because she believed that she could not afford to buy
them, but she was not poor enough to be on some form of benefit that
would give her credit. I do not need to go into the detail of all

from the information that we have, we cannot answer these questions

with about how to bridge the gap and get into the position where you

we cannot reassure these people, who are not insignificant in number
and are approaching this deadline—this cliff edge—knowing
that they have fewer years than they need to qualify for what everyone

the reasons that came out clearly in the engagement between the

It is perfectly clear that the pension rate is not going to be fixed

<?notus-xml column=252?>very near the date of April 2016. It could perhaps be done by
anticipation to some degree, but it seems at least arguable that it is
best done as a review of the effects of phasing of the transition and
the requirement for 30 years. Then one can see whether we should all be

hesitation about that. That is that at one stage in the debate, the
Pensions Minister said: “The problem with a review in this
phasing is that if it makes recommendations, there will be an
expectation that they will be implemented. If they are to be
implemented, that will issue a degree of uncertainty into a system that
we have spent a lot of time making much simpler and trying to get
certainty into because it is to be the base for pensions income going
forward and to encourage saving”. That makes me believe that he
may think that a review might recommend change. Why would he deploy
that argument otherwise? If he is as certain as the briefing paper that
we received and his simple explanation of no confusion suggest that
there is no reason for anybody to be confused, they should all just be

two other points. If we set it at 30 years now, there is no going back.
We might like it to be 30 years, but the fact is that if we set it at
30 now there will be no going back if it does not work out. If we
cannot afford it, it will not go up to 35 and we will have to stay with
it; whereas, if it is at 35, there is the possibility of review and it

arguing for 30 years; I am arguing for a review. I was commenting on an
earlier amendment, which is not in my name and which I do not support,
for a reduction to 30 years, suggesting that it opened up an
interesting debate about why it is 30, not 32 or 35. That is not for me
to explain. The noble Lord can be reassured that I understand the
mathematics, or the arithmetic, on this. I am just arguing for a review

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, under the single-tier pension we will be
merging two schemes: the basic state pension, which requires 30
qualifying years for the full rate, and the state second pension, which
you can contribute to for up to nearly 50 years.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121639000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000149">Requiring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>
35 qualifying years for the full single-tier pension strikes the right
balance. It will enable the majority of people who contribute to
achieve a full state pension through either work or the comprehensive
system of credits available to people unable to work, while still
retaining the contributory principle. This leaves considerable leeway
for people to have gaps of up to around 15 years in their working life
and still qualify for the full rate. In 2020, the significant majority
of single-tier pensioners—around 85%—will have 
35 qualifying years or more. Our analysis suggests that in 2020 around
90% of male and 80% of female single-tier pensioners will have 35 or
more qualifying
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:15:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

response to the point that the noble Lord, Lord Browne, raised about
expectations. In the existing system, we have no such thing as a full
state pension. We have £110 basic, plus who knows how much
additional pension. It is complex and people do not know what to
expect. That is exactly the point that the single-tier pension will
address.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121639000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000151">In
the early years after implementation, people in Great Britain with
between 30 and 34 qualifying years are just as likely as those with 35
or more qualifying years to have a higher state pension under single
tier than under the current system. The transition calculation provides
for a “better of” comparison at April 2016 so that the
person receives the higher of their national insurance valuations based
on old and new scheme rules, with the old rules being based on 30
qualifying years.</hs_para>

will, in fact, advantage some people because, where someone does not
have the 35 years needed for the full level of single-tier pension,
they will receive a pro rata amount according to the number of
qualifying years that they have built up, provided that they meet the
minimum qualifying period. Someone with 30 qualifying years
would therefore get a single-tier valuation of 30-35ths of the full
rate, or around £123 per week, as my noble friend
Lord Stoneham pointed out, less any adjustment for contracting out
based on the illustrative single-tier rate of £144. In many
cases, the single-tier valuation will be higher than the valuation that
people would get under the current system, as 30 qualifying
years of basic state pension gives an income of £107 a week in
2012-13
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000153">Furthermore,
where someone’s foundation amount in 2016 is below the full
single-tier rate, people will have the opportunity to increase this
amount by gaining additional single-tier qualifying years before
reaching 
<?notus-xml column=254?>state pension age through work, paying voluntary contributions or
receiving national insurance credits. The current broad range of
credits will be mirrored under single tier, and when universal credit
is in place, it will extend credits to an additional 800,000 people who
do not receive them under legacy
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000154">These
arrangements recognise people’s contribution records in the
existing scheme and allow people to have significant gaps in their
national insurance record while still ensuring that 80% of new
single-tier pensioners reaching state pension age by the mid-2030s
receive the full rate of the single-tier
pension.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000155">The
amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, and the noble
Lord, Lord Browne, would require the Government to conduct a review of
a phased transition for the move between 30 and 35 years for
a full pension. I hope that I have reassured noble Lords that there is
little evidence that such transitional arrangements are needed.
However, I need to point out that, if a review were to recommend a
single-tier pension based on a 30-qualifying-year requirement, this
would carry with it cost implications. The estimated cost of such a
system, compared to a 35-year model, would be around £700
million per annum in 2030 and £2.9 billion per year by
2060.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121639000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000156">Furthermore, to
reinforce the point about uncertainty raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Browne, a delay in defining the qualifying requirements for the new
system, which a review would necessitate, would introduce uncertainty
for those closest to retirement. The period following Royal Assent will
be a crucial time for the delivery of single tier, and making
fundamental changes at that point might well delay implementation. This
moves back to the amendment raised by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie,
about the importance of communicating the reforms and a clean
communication. The point on the move from 30 years to 35 seems more of
a communications issue than one of principle. To this end, helping
people to understand how they may be affected, we have been conducting
field work on communicating the impacts of the policy. I therefore ask
noble Lords to withdraw these
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:21:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121639000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000157"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Turner of Camden" PimsId="4357" UID="13121639000265" xid="1474" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216-gc0002.htm#13121639000265">Baroness

years when they were used to 30 years for the basic state pension that
they have in operation now. They do not understand why there should be
this difference and neither, in fact, do I. The Government have
produced some information about costs, as has the Minister this
evening, that seem quite fantastic to me. I will look at them very
carefully because I will probably want to come back again, perhaps in a
different way, when we look at the whole thing on Report. I will look
carefully at what everyone has said in the debate because it is an
issue that is of interest and concern to many people, otherwise I would

States agreed that over-regulation could have a negative effect on the
development of the market. The UK expressed its view that the current
regulatory framework was broadly appropriate and did not need to be
revised at this stage. However, other Member States considered that the

to change the country of origin principle to country of destination for

report highlights that the selection of lower carbon materials is a
good way of reducing the carbon impact of infrastructure. Such
materials could be alternatives to steel or concrete or more
traditional materials with recycled content. Representative asset
owners from the water and transport sectors, who were consulted as part
of this study, have claimed that the use of such materials in new
infrastructure assets has brought significant carbon and cost
reductions. The report also noted that when selecting a lower carbon
material with recycled content (such as recycled aggregates), the
location of the material source is key as, if located too far from the
construction site, the carbon impact of transporting this material to
the site could result in a higher carbon
impact.</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13121623000001" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131216w0001.htm#13121623000001"><Sup>1</Sup>

enough to support a ban under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. The

Testing badger carcasses for TB was not undertaken on a routine basis
during the pilot cull, or on badgers killed by road vehicles. High
levels of TB were confirmed in badgers in the regions in which the cull
areas are located during the Randomised Badger Culling Trial (RBCT).

evidence started on 4 July, some three weeks before the Spanish
authorities introduced disproportionate and time-consuming checks on 26
July. It is unsurprising that the Commission was unable to conclude
that EU law had been infringed after the visit. The border operated
much more smoothly than normal during the Commission visit. This is not
the same as confirmation that Spain has acted lawfully. We remain
confident that Spain has acted—and continues to
act—unlawfully. We will continue to provide evidence of that to
the Commission. Following a number of complaints from EU citizens about
the checks made by the Spanish authorities at the border with

checks performed by the Spanish customs is unjustified.</hs_para>
