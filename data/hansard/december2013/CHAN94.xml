question related to the Royal Navy, so let me say that the Royal Navy
assets to which I referred contributed significantly to relieving the
suffering in the Philippines. For the record, the Navy delivered more
than 700 tonnes of water and food aid and other assistance and
transported aid teams to remote locations, while personnel on board
those ships demonstrated their versatility by turning their skills and

very important. The Genium limb is very beneficial for somebody who is
in an active phase of their life and we hope many of these veterans and

would not be appropriate for an older person who was less mobile and

stands ready to work with whoever wins the contract when that person is

between the MOD and the Welsh Government. The next step is heavily
dependent on the Welsh Government appointing a contractor to take on
airfield services. That will enable the airfield to progress in a way
that is suitable for commercial tenants. My strong advice is that that
work needs to be done very soon, as we are talking about 29 MOD service
and civilian employees at St Athan, who need to be looked after
properly. If the Welsh Government want this to proceed quickly, it
would be in their best interests, and those of all concerned, to get a
move on.</hs_Para>

Wessely is not only nationally but internationally renowned as a great

some years after they have left the service, we find that sometimes,
because of a trigger event, the symptoms begin to emerge quickly and
the challenge is to reach those people rapidly and to begin to give
them help when they need it. We are talking to the NHS about how we can

surprised to hear. Defence acquisition is one of the most complex
business areas in the country. It has a long history of challenge, as
has been recognised under both Governments, and we are working on what
I hope will be a long-term solution. The Gray report was commissioned
by the previous Government, and we have sought to maintain a thread of
continuity from the thinking that underpinned it. Unfortunately, it has
not been possible to proceed to a GoCo at this time, but I believe that
the exercise has been extremely valuable in informing this process, and
it is clear that DE&amp;S is making incremental progress, even though
the step change that we were hoping for with GoCo was not able to be

that are of concern to our Baltic and Nordic colleagues and the subject
of Zapad 2013 did indeed come up. The stated intention of the Zapad

To that end Russia claims that it deployed 11,900 troops and 180 items
of military equipment, including 10 tanks, 40 aircraft and
10 ships. Some of our Nordic and Baltic colleagues see that as a
slightly excessive response to a terrorist threat exercise, but Members

Jang Sung-taek’s execution was just the most high-profile of
many. For some six decades, the North Korean people have suffered
intolerably. People are

the leadership objects to. Children are treated as prisoners from
birth, and those who try to escape the regime risk not only
imprisonment or worse for themselves but punishment for up to three
generations of their family. An incalculable number of North Koreans
have been, and continue to be, worked to death, frozen to death, burned
to death, gassed to death or tortured in the most unimaginable ways. In

because this terrible situation has persisted for so long—over

Sung-taek—the show trials, force-fed propaganda, and an ideology
that has starved 2 million to death, and bearing in mind
that the UK is now home to the largest number of North Korean
refugees outside South Korea, should we not do all in our power, both
as a country and as a leader in the international community, to help
end North Korea’s reign of
terror?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312161000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0001.htm#1312161000201"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Swire" PimsId="4192" UID="1312161000403" xid="577" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0001.htm#1312161000403">Mr

description of North Korea is, alas, not fantastical but only too true.
To call it an Orwellian nightmare would be a cliché and would
not give a clear enough indication of the horrors vested on the people
of that country by its leaders.</hs_Para>

United Kingdom is playing an important part. My hon. Friend will be
aware that we fully support the United Nations Human Rights Council
agreement to establish a commission of inquiry. That was a unanimous
vote—which is unusual on such issues—and was proposed in
a resolution presented by the EU and Japan, and co-sponsored by more
than 40 countries. As my hon. Friend knows, that commission will look
at all those issues, particularly the prison camps as well as other
matters such as human rights abuses, and report back in March
2014.</hs_Para>

asked about food aid to North Korea, which is understandable given the
reports emanating from that country about food shortages. There are
even some alarmist reports about how people are going about eating,
which, again, are too horrific to recount. The United Kingdom does not
currently have a bilateral development programme in North Korea, and
neither do we provide money to international organisations specifically
for use in North Korea. However, some non-earmarked funds that we
provide to organisations 
<?notus-xml column=479?>such as the World Food Programme may be used for humanitarian programmes
in that country. Our embassy in Pyongyang uses some of its bilateral
funding for small-scale humanitarian programmes such as nutrition for
nursing mothers and greenhouses for children’s homes, although
that remains under regular review.</hs_Para>

also asked about the ongoing issue of the BBC and broadcasting to North
Korea, which I know is something that the North Korea all-party group
has discussed and a matter that Lord Alton of Liverpool has been
pushing hard. The BBC has been in touch with the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office about the issue—or vice-versa, I should say.
It is primarily an issue for the BBC, which has, of course, full
editorial, operational and managerial independence. We understand that
it is not currently persuaded that a Korean language service would be
an effective value-for-money use of available resources. Nevertheless,
our embassy in Pyongyang is working with BBC Worldwide on an initiative
to broadcast BBC drama, nature and science programmes on North Korean
television. We believe that that has the potential to expose
significant numbers of North Koreans to aspects of the outside world
from which they are normally totally
isolated.</hs_Para>

McCarthy</B> (Bristol East) (Lab):</Member> I thank the Minister for
his response and the hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) for
raising this issue. The House is united in its condemnation of the
North Korean regime, and we share the view of the Foreign Office that
this execution is another shocking illustration of the brutality of the
North Korean leadership. We also echo concerns about the shocking
levels of hunger and poverty in North Korea, as well as the many human
rights abuses.</hs_Para>

likely that the execution was intended as a show of strength by Kim
Jong-un, and to the wider world it has also been taken as an indication
of his insecurity and volatility. It comes after a year that has seen
an even more provocative and unpredictable stance from Pyongyang,
including nuclear threats to the USA, and the declaration of a state of
war with South Korea. Recent satellite images published by Amnesty
International indicate that the largest prison camps are continuing to
expand. The international community responded calmly
and—crucially—with a united front to attempts to escalate
tensions earlier this year, and it is important that that consensus
continues.</hs_Para>

urgent question has been granted today, the House must turn its
attention to what can be done in the immediate future to try to address
the situation. Have the Government made any assessment of the possible
implications of the execution for the North Korean leadership and the
wider region? The Minister mentioned that discussions have already
taken place with the USA and the Republic of Korea, but have any
conversations been held yet with Chinese officials, or will that happen
in the near future? It has been reported that Jang Sung-taek had been
building trade links with China, prompting some speculation about a
change in economic policy. What is the Minister’s assessment of
such reports, and of the nature of North Korea’s current
relationship with China? I was in the Republic of Korea earlier this
year, and my understanding is that the relationship is under some
strain. Was North Korea discussed during the Prime Minister’s

action does he think the council can take, and, most crucially, what

lack of clarity in regard to what the execution was about, and an equal
lack of clarity in regard to the implications for what will happen
next. I have read a number of reports this morning, and each of them is
speculative. So the answer is “We do not know.” Whether
we will ever know is also a legitimate question, but as things stand,
we simply do not

what more China could do. China has a 900-mile border with North Korea,
it has a very real and present interest in North Korea, and we believe
that it has a key role to play in the country’s future. She also
asked what kind of relationship the current North Korean regime had

Rights Council and its reporting will be extremely important in respect
of what we do next. We would like the six-party talks to resume as soon
as possible, but at this stage I cannot envisage their resuming until
we see some sort of gesture of good will from the regime in Pyongyang.

of patients left unchecked on trolleys for hours on end at Tameside,
and of blood on the curtains and catheters on the floor at Basildon.

limited period, a trust has failed significantly to improve, the Bill
requires a decision to be taken on whether the trust needs to be put
into special administration on quality grounds—and, yes, where
necessary, a trust special administrator will be able to look beyond
the boundaries of the trust and consider the wider health economy. As

tests that have to be met for any downgrading of hospital services, is
he now introducing this clause? Those greater powers will totally
undermine the clinical commissioning groups that his Government set up

Lady campaigns hard for her constituents. The four tests set out by the
Prime Minister were never designed to require unanimous support from
local CCGs for necessary changes. If we had to secure that, it would be
virtually impossible to make any major reconfigurations. Where there is
a failing hospital, it is important to resolve and address situations.
There are exceptional occasions when that cannot be done in an
individual trust’s area. The change in the law will not apply
retrospectively to Lewisham, but it is right to ensure that, if we are
to learn one lesson from what has happened in recent years, we deal
much more quickly with failing hospitals, and that applies to South
London Healthcare NHS Trust as well. Governments and the NHS must never
again sit on coasting or failing hospitals for year after year without
doing what it takes to sort them out. That is why this year, for the
first time, we have put 13 hospitals into special measures. How utterly
inexplicable but sadly predictable it is that the Labour party, which
failed to sort out those problems, is today refusing to back the
changes that mean those mistakes can never be repeated.</hs_Para>

introducing a new criminal offence that will apply to care providers

this House, whilst affirming its belief that the Care Bill [Lords] is a
modest step towards a better social care system that protects some
people from catastrophic costs, and welcoming the new rights for users
and carers that the former Labour Government initiated, notes that the
Bill’s deferred payment scheme will result in people continuing
to have to sell their homes to pay for care; disagrees with the
Government’s assertion that their proposals will cap care costs
at £72,000 given that self-funders will face far higher bills;
further notes that it includes provisions which could put NHS hospitals
at risk of having services reconfigured without adequate consultation
and without clinical support; further notes that the Bill fails to
include measures to address the current crisis in care and meet the
needs of the UK’s ageing population, including a genuinely
integrated NHS and social care system; and therefore declines to give a
Second Reading to the Care Bill [Lords] because it is an inadequate
response to the scale of the challenge facing social care and fails

an inappropriate attempt to turn an occasion such as this into the

described the care system we have in England. Surely we can do better.
In the last Parliament, the previous Government began a serious attempt
at reform. I give this Government credit for continuing some of that
work. The Bill contains many proposals originally put forward in my
White Paper “Building the National Care Service”,
published in February 2010. What most people will remember from the
pre-election period was the clash between the parties on funding
solutions, but what they might not have realised is that beneath the
rhetoric there was much common ground on other matters. I hope that
people will welcome that, just as we welcome some of the measures that
are carried forward into the Bill.</hs_Para>

stronger legal rights and recognition for carers are well overdue. For
far too long, informal and family carers have been invisible to the
system and taken for granted. That simply cannot go on. If statutory
services are to be sustainable in the 21st century, they must learn to
value informal care and carers and help them do more to help their
loved ones<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:34:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
Secondly, we welcome efforts to simplify the social care system. Better
information and advice will make a difference to some people. Unifying
social care legislation in line with the recommendations of the Law
Commission review initiated under the previous Government is sensible
and overdue.

am happy to say that those are all important steps forward that we
would not seek to oppose. However, let me be clear—this answers
the points raised by Government Members—that this Bill is not
equal to the scale and the urgency of the care crisis in England. It
fails to implement the Dilnot report and does not provide a lasting
solution. It does little or nothing to improve care services now or to
reduce the costs of care for most people; in fact, it is likely to make
things even worse.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:35:48"></hs_TimeCode> is why we
have tabled a reasoned amendment to draw the House’s attention
to two major problems with the Government’s approach. First,
prioritising funding a cap over and above protecting existing council
budgets means that the care system will continue to go backwards and
get worse, not better. In short, the Government are promising future
help instead of helping people right now. Secondly, the proposed
£72,000 cap is not what it seems; it is a care con.</hs_Para>

funding priorities, the Government are failing to face up to the scale
of the funding crisis facing councils right now. In the cross-party
talks on the Dilnot report, Labour stated a clear principle that the
cap and the council baseline must be considered together as equal
priorities. That was supported by Andrew Dilnot himself, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T16:36:40"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow) may remember, because he was
also party to those talks. As a first step, we called on the Government

<?notus-xml column=497?>to use some of last year’s NHS underspend to tackle the care
crisis—and, by extension, to ease pressure on A and
E—instead of handing the money back to the Treasury. The
Government have not listened to that, and this Bill makes matters worse
for local authorities by placing new, unfunded and uncosted burdens on
them. The fact that it restricts the eligibility of those in
substantial or critical need of support is, in itself, a clear
admission on the Government’s part that the support system
overall is being scaled

First, councils have cut eligibility criteria, so more people are
exposed to care charges in a way that they were not before. Secondly,
those care charges are now rising above inflation year on year, so more
people are exposed to higher charges. This means that they are now more
likely to pay right up to the new cap that the Government are

Of course, people are more likely to be living with
chronic disease in more deprived areas, and both those things have to
be recognised in the funding formula. If the change goes ahead, it will

In reality, the average pensioner could pay more than £150,000
for their actual residential care home bill—£300,000 for
a couple—before they hit the so-called cap. I will explain

It is because the cap will be based on the standard rate that local
authorities pay for a care home place, not the actual amount that
self-funders are charged, which is often much higher than the council
rate. It is estimated that in 2016-17, when the cap is due to start,
the average council rate for residential care will be £522 a
week, and the average price of a care home place will be £610 a
week. That is because self-funders pay more than councils. However,
that will not be taken into account when the cap is

facts clear. The Secretary of State seeks to denigrate Labour’s
record at every opportunity, but let me remind him that the Labour
party left an NHS rebuilt with the lowest ever waiting lists and
highest ever public satisfaction. The previous Labour Government
introduced independent regulation of NHS hospitals for the first time,
prompted by previous scandals at Bristol, Alder Hey and the Shipman
murders. The Secretary of State should cast his mind back a little
further before coming to the House and making unfounded

Robert Francis rightly acknowledged in his report, there was no system
of independent regulation before 1997. It was the independent regulator
that first uncovered the failings at Mid Staffordshire and, later, at
Basildon. As the party that introduced independent regulation in the
NHS, Labour has no problem with strengthening it and providing
legislative backing for the appointment of chief inspectors for
hospitals, general practice and social care, but let us be clear: those
were not recommendations of the Francis report.</hs_Para>

help individuals to challenge an organisation where there is a

that simple collaboration between hospitals to solve financial problems
is no longer an option to ease financial pressures. That is what it has

hospitals standing or falling on their own, and in that
context, the weakest can be picked off by the Secretary of State and
closed without consultation. Given the financial pressures on many
organisations, this special administration process is likely to be used

repeal the Health and Social Care Act, and that will be the big choice,

service working for the whole person. That is the only way we can

will not stop people having to lose their homes and savings to pay for

welcome the Bill is that it begins to look at health and care from a
different point of view from the one with which those of us who have
participated in health and care debates in this Chamber over a long
period are familiar. When a Bill comes before the House, it usually
starts off by describing the function of one bit of the
bureaucracy—perhaps creating a strategic health authority or
re-creating a different bit of the bureaucracy somewhere else on the
landscape. This Bill starts in a quite different
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:10:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121614000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121614000188">Clause
1 talks about the “well-being” of individuals and

instead of thinking of it as a bureaucracy planned from the top down,
think about the service that is delivered to individuals who rely
on  
<?notus-xml column=508?>these services. Clause 1 talks about the needs of
individuals, and later clauses place an obligation on local authorities

2 introduces something that the health and care system has talked about
since 1948, but almost never put real resource into, which is
preventing the need for the delivery of health and care services, and

the needs of individuals and on the need we each feel as individuals to
avoid unnecessary health costs and care. None of us wants to be a
patient in an intensive care unit if it is avoidable. That is why

not matter how many needs assessments have been done? In fact, the
longer patients are in hospital, the greater their needs will
be—they will not be able to walk, their incontinence will
increase and so forth. What is important is to put the cart before the

That is why there is the obligation in clause 3 to consider integrating

in what must be a short speech, I can only list four. It is around the
well-being of individuals; it is around early intervention and
prevention; it is around integration; it is also, critically, for the
first time in statutory form, around doing needs assessments that take
account of the needs not just of the individual person, but of their
carer and social context as well. In that way, the support that is
provided to individuals takes account of the context in which they
live, rather than treats them as individuals divorced from the carers
and people who care for them when the statutory social worker is not

Opposition spokesman said this is an enormously ambitious set of
objectives, and I entirely agree that the objective of redefining the
delivery of health and social care in a way that matches the aims set
out in the first three clauses and clause 10 around carers is
ambitious. The objective is to re-imagine care so that we think of the
health and care system not as being primarily around acute hospitals,
but as a system designed to meet the needs of that majority of people
who are the main focus of those who work in the service—people
who primarily have a care need with an occasional medical or clinical
requirement. In other words, this is about thinking about the system
from the front end rather than viewing it from the top of the
bureaucracy. I commend this Bill because I believe it sets that
framework in statute.</hs_Para>

also commend the Government because they are not just setting out these
aspirations as commitments in law. It is one thing to change the law.
It is another thing to change the way the service is actually delivered
on the ground. The most effective step the Government have
taken to achieve this re-imagination of care is the £3.8 billion
that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State talked about. That is
£3.8 billion voted into the NHS but available only if the
service at local level delivers the joined-up, person-centred care that
is set out in the first three clauses of the Bill. So this is not just
a set of wordy aspirations; it is a set of aspirations 
<?notus-xml column=510?>supported by the resources necessary to deliver the
change in the care model that the Bill describes. The £3.8

Member for Leigh and which were legislated for by the Government. This
is an important step forward. If the health and wellbeing board in a
locality can see a way to use health resources to deliver a changed
model of care that puts more focus on prevention and on individuals
through the delivery of more joined-up services, there is no constraint
in the legislation, as I understand it, to prevent more than
£3.8 billion from being used for the delivery of that

billion from the taxpayer, but it is also about individual resources.
It is about individual users having their right set out in the Bill to
engage with their personal budgets and with direct payments, enabling
them to make real choices about how joined-up, person-centred care will
work best for them. It is the curse of these health debates to
imagine that we can gather 650 people together in this Chamber and work
out how we are going to deliver £125 billion-worth of care in a
way that will work for an individual old lady in her own home. That is
nonsense; we need to engage the people themselves in the decisions on
how the resources are used. We also need to assure them that they will
not be exposed to catastrophic personal losses by making their own
contributions to their care. That is why I welcome the fact that,
despite what the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>

fine words into deeds. Also, through the establishment of an

assurance about the quality of care that is provided right across the
health and care system. The right hon. Gentleman claims credit, as he

further up the chain, with people who are beginning to suffer, perhaps
beginning to have memory problems and beginning to need social care?
How are we going to incentivise the system to invest in the new
commissioning in clause 5, which talks about diversity and shaping the
market? How are we going to get the system to focus on that if all the
focus, after £2.85 billion-worth of cuts in social care, is on
how we might manage to look after the people with substantial and

working on that for a long time, and I look forward
to showing the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=512?>some of our examples when he visits. Social
adVentures is a social enterprise that helps people with mental health
problems, and one of its projects is “garden needs”. It
has taken control of a garden centre, and people with dementia and
people with mental health problems are now attending. The way it is
keeping people active in the community and able to do many more things
than they would if they were isolated and at home is amazing. Unlimited
Potential is another fabulous social enterprise, which stands on its
own two feet, is not grant-dependent and is able to invest more money
back into the community. Last week, I had the pleasure of launching a
website called Really Useful Stuff, which is just what it says on the
tin—it is a website where people can get aids, adaptations and
kinds of social care that are modern, innovative and creative. Those
are just a few examples of what is already happening in the
community.</hs_Para>

say to the Minister that at a time when money is tight, and will be, no
matter which Government are in power, the imperative to innovate and be
more creative with the funds we have has never been greater. Therefore,
investing, in particular, in the social enterprise sector, which often
has these great ideas, and in enabling those ideas to get to scale so
that provision can be made across the country, is really important.
Another company in my constituency, 2ergo, has recently developed an
app for the iPhone where people can see what provision is available in
Salford for care, respite care and activity, and how to book it. They
can book it over their iPhone—families can do that; they can
help the people they are caring for. So this use of new technology is
now developing apace, and, again, we have to take advantage.</hs_Para>

commend the Government for organising the G8 summit last week in
London—an amazing event where we gathered support from countries
across the world. I hope that next year we will be able to expand that
to a global event examining dementia, not just one involving the G8
developed countries. Part of that G8 meeting was about how we get more
research. I would like to see far more research on the quality of care.
There is a lot, but not enough, research on the bioscience, but hardly
any research on the interventions we do, particularly for
people with dementia.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:29:16"></hs_TimeCode> all know that
“singing for the brain” has a great reputation.
It helps cognitive development, as do art, drama and reminiscence work.
There is no evidence base behind that, so if we are to have a better
system of social care, we need better research into therapeutic
interventions that work. That will enable commissioners to commission
packages of care that they know will make a difference. If money is
tight, we need to spend it on things that we know will be effective,
and I ask the Minister to support
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:30:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

mobilising the good will of local people, shops and arts centres. In
Salford, a taxi firm has trained 400 drivers to look after people with
dementia. Such care does not cost a lot of money if we can mobilise
ordinary people in their communities. In Japan, 4.5 million people are
signed up to be dementia friends. Our ambition is to have 1 million

5 is about not just diversity and shaping the market, but quality, and

<?notus-xml column=513?>situation in which those who do the most difficult job in caring for our
friends and family are actually some of the least regarded workers? It
is utterly unacceptable to have zero-hours contracts in the social care
sector. The carers who care for my dad come in for 15 minutes. They
will do more if they can. They have to ring up to be assessed when they
have done 12 minutes. They get no payment for travelling and no
expenses for their petrol. They came out one Sunday. They started at
8 o’clock in the morning and went home at 9
o’clock at night, but because they only had five hours of
20-minute slots, they got paid only for five hours. Members should try
being out on a Sunday for 13 hours and going home with five hours of

tolerate that in this country. I hope the Minister will assist in

investment bond that aimed to keep people with dementia in their own
homes for longer, we would save the NHS a fortune. People with dementia
are admitted to hospital more often. They stay longer in hospital and
many more of them die there. If we could mobilise social investment to
offer a reward for keeping people in their own homes, funded by the
savings to the NHS, we could bring in some new money, not just what we

contribute to the debate, not least in my capacity as the Commons chair
of the all-party group on carers. I trust that the House will

on carers’ needs. Other parliamentary colleagues will talk in
detail about other aspects of the Bill, such as the national
eligibility threshold, personal budgets and other important issues
relating to the social care system. They are all important, but in the

welcome the Care Bill and the fact that it contains significant new
rights for carers, including stronger rights for an assessment of their
needs and a clearer entitlement to services for carers and those for
whom carers care as a result of any such assessment. I also welcome the
fact that as well as introducing new rights for carers the Bill
consolidates their existing rights. Over the years, a number of Bills
have enhanced carers’ rights. All the recent ones have been
private Members’ Bills, taken through the House with the support
of organisations such as Carers UK and the all-party group on
carers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>, so I
welcome the fact that this Bill consolidates carers’ rights in a
single piece of legislation. Clause 1 sets out the well-being
principle, which is a hugely welcome overarching duty that will place
individual well-being at the heart of the new reformed social care
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:37:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121614000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121614000222">The
Bill has, of course, already enjoyed detailed consideration and
scrutiny in the other place. It is to the Government’s credit
that they have already introduced a number of further concessions, not
least those for young carers, following the hard work of
parliamentarians and the National Young Carers Coalition. Good progress
has of course been made to enhance the rights of young carers through
an amendment to the Children and Families Bill, which delivers four key
improvements for young carers: the simplification of the legislation on
young carers’ assessments; the extension of the right to an
assessment of needs for support to young carers under the age of 18
regardless of whom they care for; the fact that it has been made clear
to local authorities that they must carry out an assessment of a young
carer’s needs for support on request or on the appearance of
need; and the provision of appropriate links between 
<?notus-xml column=515?>legislation for children and for adults to enable local authorities to
align the assessment of a young carer with an assessment of
an adult they care for. The amendment works closely with the provisions
in the Care Bill that focus on a whole-family approach to support, and
that is all welcome
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121614000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121614000223">There
are three further issues, however, that I hope Ministers will consider
as the Bill makes progress. First, it places new duties on local
authorities to provide information and advice services, which are very
welcome and will enable carers to access vital information and advice
earlier. As part of the enhanced right for carers, the Bill places a
new duty on local authorities to undertake a carer’s assessment
for all carers. It is also good news that under clause 2 local
authorities must have regard to the importance of identifying carers in
their populations with unmet needs with the aim of early intervention
and prevention of future needs, but the clause does not mention the
NHS. Neither the Care Bill nor the health and social care legislation
places any responsibility on the NHS to identify carers.</hs_Para>

might say that there is a co-operation clause, clause 6, that requires
health bodies to co-operate with local authorities on all clauses in
the Bill, including the that on identifying carers, but the way that
clause is drafted gives rise to serious concerns that the onus will
remain on local authorities. That could well mean that carers will
receive very little help from health bodies in certain parts of the
country. It is a matter of common sense that for many carers their
point of contact with the wider world and the person with whom they
will discuss their wider caring responsibilities will be health
professionals, such as their GP.</hs_Para>

Cancer Support estimates that there are nearly 1 million carers of
people with cancer in England, half of whom are not receiving any
support as carers, notwithstanding the substantial impact on their
lives. It is a matter of common sense that carers of people with cancer
come into contact mainly with health professionals who are simply not
identifying them as carers, which as a consequence means that only 5%
of the nearly 1 million people caring for people with cancer
receive a carer’s assessment. Half of carers of people with
cancer are not receiving any support in return for giving an average of
almost 15 hours of care each week. As the number of cancer
patients is likely to double from 2 million to 4 million over
the next 15 years or so, so too will the number of

of the reason why carers of people with illnesses such as cancer are
not receiving any support is that three in five people providing unpaid
care to loved ones with cancer do not consider themselves to be a
carer. They thus lack awareness of carers’ rights,
such as the local authority carer’s assessment, which is
crucially important because it is the gateway for carers to get
statutory support. There needs to be an explicit requirement in the
Bill for health bodies to identify carers with unmet needs, with the
aim of early intervention and support. Neither the Care Bill nor the
Health and Social Care Act 2012 sets out any responsibility for the NHS
to identify carers, which is surprising, given that this was something

first point that I therefore wish to impress on the Minister is that
the Bill should specify that local authorities need to work with health
bodies in order adequately to identify carers with unmet needs and
provide sufficient services for them, and that there should be a duty
on the NHS to identify carers. GPs need to see support for carers of
their patients as also being part of their job, because in supporting
the patient’s carer, GPs are also supporting the patient. There
is, I suspect, a need for a national framework, or guidance, on how the
NHS can better identify and support
carers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:42:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121614000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121614000228">The
second point that I wish to raise is a difficult one. The Government
are introducing new and much appreciated rights for carers of adults
through the Care Bill, and for young carers in the Children and
Families Bill, but parents of disabled children under 18 are not
included in either Bill. It is worth reminding ourselves of the
recommendations of the Law Commission to strengthen the rights of
parent carers in line with other carers, and to consolidate these
rights in new

appreciate that at a time when we are enhancing and hopefully improving
special educational needs in the Children and Families Bill, the
question arises whether every parent whose child receives a statement
of special educational needs should be considered a parent carer, and I
suspect that Ministers would probably respond that in straitened
financial circumstances it simply is not possible to give financial
support to a child with special educational needs through that system,
and at the same time give financial support to their parents as parent
carers.</hs_Para>

sure we all do, that for a parent of a seriously and severely disabled
child, or a child with serious and severe learning difficulties, those
responsibilities as a parent and as a carer can completely take over
their life, with little respite. I hope that there will be an
opportunity in the Public Bill Committee to consider whether it is
possible to give targeted support to parent carers whom, as a matter of
common sense, I think we would all recognise merit
consideration as

third point is that the Bill perhaps needs greater clarity to ensure
that carers are not wrongly charged for services provided to the person
they care for. I know that ministerial colleagues have said that this
is not their intention, but I suggest that that is not yet clear
enough. Social workers and carer support workers will in due course
have to use this legislation to decide on the one hand what is a
carer’s service, and on the other what is a service for an older
and disabled person. I suggest that this needs to be defined with
greater clarity so as to prevent confusion or disputes. I would suggest
that we should remove from local authorities any ability to charge for
carers’
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:44:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Not
surprisingly, many carers are shocked to find, given the support and
contribution they are making to caring for a loved one and the amount

hope that during the passage of the Bill through the Commons, the
Government will give consideration to these three points relating to
carers, but I re-emphasise that overall the all-party group on carers

eligibility issue interacts with the cap on care costs. The vast

As has been said, but we need to keep repeating it, a cap set at
£72,000 ignores Andrew Dilnot’s warning that it would
work only if it were set at a much lower level and if the underfunding
of social care were addressed. It is clear from the Government’s
own impact assessments that the number of people whose costs
will be capped are a tiny minority. It is estimated that just over one
in 200 people 
<?notus-xml column=519?>aged over 65 will be helped in 2016 and that fewer than one in 200 will
be by 2026. It is an incredibly sad reflection of this
Government’s ambition that they will have spent the whole of a
five-year Parliament—in fact, longer than a five-year
Parliament—introducing measures on the long-term funding of
social care that eventually help only one in 200 people.

heard from the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry). Full-time carers are
more than twice as likely to be in poor health as people without caring
responsibilities. I point out to the Minister that this Bill does not
do enough to support those full-time carers. The Government have said
that carers are the first line of prevention in that properly
identifying and supporting them prevents the escalation of demand on
statutory services. Given the A and E crisis, we need that prevention.
However, identification of carers is not happening and the Bill does
not do enough to change that. Macmillan Cancer Support, which has been
carrying out surveys on this, tells us that 70% of carers of people
with cancer come into contact with health professionals, who are the
people who should be identifying them and signposting them for
information and advice. Only 5% of that group of carers receive a
carers assessment, and only one in three of those surveyed by Macmillan
had even heard of a carers assessment. It is meaningless to suggest to
people that they have a right to something they have never heard of and
are not going to get.</hs_Para>

Salford, we have a project run by the Carers Trust centre to identify
carers within the primary care system. I want to pay tribute to the
work that the centre does and to mention its manager, Dawn
O’Rooke, who is leaving this month after several years of work
in this field. Over the years, the project has established a network of
links within GP practices to identify carers. Last year, GPs made only
300 referrals to the carers centre, yet we have 23,000 carers in
Salford, over 5,000 of whom will be caring at the heaviest levels. The
Carers Trust tells us that, nationally, GP practices are identifying
only about 3% of carers, but it should be 10% or more. Health bodies
must be required—this Bill is the place to do it—to take
on the task of identifying carers and referring them for advice and
support, because carers are mainly seen in health settings and not by
local authorities. The figures I gave about people losing packages mean
that 1,000 fewer people in Salford will be seen by, or go anywhere
near, the local authority because the person they care for is not
getting a care package.</hs_Para>

robust measures in the Care Bill to make sure that this happens? As

has rightly been said, clause 2, with its requirements for local
authorities to provide preventive services, makes no explicit mention
of the NHS, and the only duty on NHS bodies is one of co-operation.
Anyone who has tried to work in local authorities on co-operation with
health bodies, as I did years ago, knows that it does not go anywhere
when there is no budget and no duty. Without effective procedures and
systems within health bodies, the identification and signposting of
carers will stay as it is now—patchy and inconsistent. It is
questionable whether cash-strapped local authorities will be able to
assess the needs of large numbers of carers alongside giving
information and advice to self-funders and doing a lot more
assessments. They will not be able to do that in any way that makes it
a worthwhile exercise for carers, and carers will not bother with it if
it is not doing anything for them. Indeed,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:56:09"></hs_TimeCode> Joint

start caring, which is when they most urgently need help and advice.
During carers week here, I met carers who told me about a whole variety
of things that they needed help with but nobody helped them. Nobody
told them that there were schemes to help them with the cost of parking
at the hospital. One mother had to buy a hospital bed and nobody told
her where to find one; she was looking for one on eBay. She had no

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:59:20"></hs_TimeCode>GPs deal with
dementia patients, stroke patients and patients with cancer. The GP and
primary health care team is best placed to establish whether there is
an unpaid family carer or whether they live in another town or city.
The GP can then refer them to sources of advice and support and, if
they are local, give them regular health checks. A new duty on the NHS
professionals is the only thing that would make it easier for social
care and health services to work together to support carers. I

Leslie</B> (Bristol North West) (Con):</Member> I greatly welcome much
of what is in the Bill. I am slightly disappointed by the tone of
some—not all—Labour Members, who seem to suggest that the
challenges our society faces with social care are in some way new. I
looked after an old lady from 2003, during the economic boom times, and
became very well acquainted with her 
<?notus-xml column=521?>care package, care needs and care challenges, and the challenges faced
by her social workers. Back then, social workers were expected to get
across London in 20 minutes, which was obviously impossible,
so the care time that they had with my friend was severely cut down; in
fact, sometimes it was 15 minutes, a figure that we have already heard.
There was also a massive challenge in terms of raising the status of
the profession of social work. Those challenges existed back then,
during the boom times, and they still exist now. It is very brave and
ambitious for the Government to be making such significant steps in
unifying health and social care at a time when the economic situation
is very difficult.</hs_Para>

think that <hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>one
lesson we have learned following the Mid Staffs scandal is that making
rules does not necessarily mean making change. I remind the House of
the 2002 “Code of Conduct for NHS
Managers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:59:56"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T17:59:40"></hs_TimeCode>”,
which
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13121635000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000285">“As
an NHS manager, I will observe the following principles: make the care
and safety of patients my first concern and act to protect them from
risk;…be honest and act with integrity; accept responsibility
for my own work and the proper performance of the people I
manage”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13121635000024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000024">Following
the unravelling of scandals in Mid Staffs and elsewhere, it is
very hard to understand how NHS managers were adhering to that code of
conduct, which was written for them, and why none of them has faced the
consequences of not doing so. That is a salutary lesson: we need to be
wary that putting things in writing does not always mean that they will
happen culturally. People have remained unaccountable for a serious
breach of that managerial code of conduct, many of whom, I am
afraid to say, continue to work in the NHS
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:00:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000025">As
the Bill progresses, I want to see more detail on how the contractual
obligation for a duty of candour, which is welcome, will be enforced. I
understand the desire for a statutory duty on individuals, but I share
fears that it may oversimplify the blame culture that this House has
discussed at length. Having seen what happened with our
hospitals’ complaints system and the cover-up of blame, I am
very worried that a statutory duty on an individual clinician could be
abused, such that blame could be parked at a clinician’s door by
a management system that does not want its own failings to be
highlighted. That could lead to unfortunate false allocations of blame
by the system in which clinicians
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000026">If
a contract’s duty of candour is not met, what will be the
consequences? It is an issue that there have been no consequences for
those who have breached things written down in guidelines and codes of
conduct. It is important to understand in more detail what the
consequences will be of a breach of
contract<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000027">I
would particularly like to know whether managers, organisations such as
NHS England, and Department of Health officials will have the same duty
of candour. The reason why scandals such as Mid Staffs have been
allowed to go on and on is that it was not just the hospital that was
complicit in it; the entire system around the hospital should have been
acting in patients’ interests, but it did
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:02:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=522?><hs_Para UID="13121635000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000028">Some have
faced consequences for their actions—their actions were good,
but the consequences have been diabolical—namely whistleblowers.
I know and understand that real reform of how we treat whistleblowers
and enable whistleblowing will require changes to the Public Interest
Disclosure Act 1998. If a whistleblower has been found to be correct in
raising concerns in the NHS and those concerns are recognised, I would
like to know why any future employer would choose not to employ them.
If an employer is a good employer, they would welcome a whistleblower
into their ranks as someone who would not go native and accept
appalling care when others might do so and who would also have the
moral fortitude to stand up and talk about failings when others might
not. The test of a good employer is how well they employ people who
have been proven to be
whistleblowers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:03:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:03:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000029">People
such as Eileen Chubb and David Drew have sacrificed their careers to
highlight bad care, but they have not seen the systemic changes for
which they made those sacrifices and they are still suffering the
consequences. Surely that is a part of NHS and health culture that the
Bill should seek to change.</hs_Para>

welcome the fact that the Care Quality Commission will be looking at
the issue of whistleblowers and I welcome James Titcombe’s
involvement in the CQC. As someone who thought that the CQC brand was
so damaged that it should probably just be scrapped and we should start
again, I have to say that I think David Prior has made remarkable
progress, given what he started out with, in beginning to turn this
monolith
around<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:04:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

independence of the CQC is very long overdue. I think that
everyone in the House has been concerned about the fact that the
CQC’s mission seemed to be reputation management for itself and
the NHS, and not a brave and courageous stand on behalf of the patients
it was supposed to be
protecting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:04:22"></hs_TimeCode>. In
order to ensure that the CQC remains independent from
Government—independence in words is fine, but independence in
culture is what really matters—it might be illustrative to look
back to the era before the CQC and other regulatory bodies were in
place, when royal colleges used to send their members into hospitals.
They would do so not to inspect hospitals as such, but for reasons of
medical training. However, by getting a granular view of the training
on offer they could see whether or not it was sufficient. If not, the
royal colleges could, under bodies such as the hospital recognition
committee, withdraw training from a hospital, which gave the inspection
teeth. It was the royal colleges that went in—often without any
pay at all; just enough to cover expenses—and interviewed junior
doctors and consultants individually, and problems naturally came to
light because the interviews were often
confidential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:05:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000032">A
Wigan hospital fell foul of an inspection in 2001 and its chief
executive did not take kindly to it. Funnily enough, just after the
inspection took place, the chief executive, who was quite close to Alan
Milburn and the then Prime Minister, went into the Department of Health
and abolished the system whereby professional clinicians could get a
granular view of what was going on in hospitals, replacing it with the
postgraduate medical education training board and then the medical
training application service, which was disastrous. The more we can put
those who do not have an interest in bolstering 
<?notus-xml column=523?>the Government of the day—namely the
professionals, clinicians and members of the royal colleges—on
the ground and doing granular investigations, the more confident we can
be that the CQC will be
independent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:06:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000033"><B><Member ContinuationText="Grahame M.

Leslie:</Member></B> I am afraid that the quality of care and social
care could be the next boil of scandal to erupt as we gain a more
granular view of what is going on. Organisations need not just more
effective tick-box inspections, but more effective granular
inspections. I do not agree with the hon. Gentleman: I think the CQC is
taking great steps forward. I am very sceptical, but I am cautiously
optimistic of progress and will continue to look at what the CQC

will make progress, because I do not want to prevent other Members from
contributing to the debate. Essentially, the Bill can only put down
regulation. One of my favourite things is to warn against systems so
perfect that nobody needs to be good, yet this House really only has
levers to change systems. We cannot always enable people to be good,
but we can devise systems that enable them to be good. This House is
attempting to turn around a massive cultural tanker and it is
unrealistic to think that we can do so through the scope of a single
Bill. I think, however, that the Bill takes very important steps
forward in a very difficult context. I am disappointed that it is not
supported throughout the House, although I think that constructive
amendments and changes to it will be welcomed in the interests of the
patients we are all here to serve. I heartily recommend the Bill to the

legislation that is in desperate need of
modernisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, the premise on which part of the Bill is based is simply
outdated. It tries to focus the debate on residential and nursing care

a small percentage of older people need to be in residential or nursing

<?notus-xml column=524?>in this debate, because of the Government’s savage cuts to local
authority funding, 85% of local authorities now provide care only to
those whose needs are assessed as substantial. If the level is also set
at substantial in relation to the proposed national eligibility
criteria in clause 13, people with moderate care needs will continue to
be ignored. Their needs will inevitably move to severe, which will mean
even greater cost to both the individual and the state. My hon. Friends

willingly, but many would benefit from some support through the
provision of low-level services, such as a sitting service to

concentrate on providing more personal help. Put simply, a small amount

services when, not the previous Government but the one before that,
brought in health and social care services. Within the first six
months, we found that every single person who ended up in residential
care did so because of carer breakdown, as the carer was not getting
support. That is why this support is such an important part of what we

services must be personalised: they have to be about choice, as well as
need. If we are to make such personalisation a reality, we need further
integration of our health and social care services. The duty on local
authorities under clause 3 to promote the integration of care and
support with health services does not go far enough in that respect.
Indeed, a recent survey of health and wellbeing boards found that most
local authorities have not identified integrated care as a priority.
Clearly, we must do more to drive forward the development of integrated
care. Without such an approach, we will return to the days that I
remember well, when there were fruitless arguments about whether a
service such as bathing was required on social or health
grounds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000043">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:12:18"></hs_TimeCode>

matter is especially worrying as regards young carers, who quite often

young carers’ rights by providing that when a child is
identified as a young carer, the needs of everyone in the family should
be considered. That of course presupposes that young carers will be
identified in the first place. If we do not place a corresponding duty

ever. Our social care system is being cut to the point of breaking. As
has already been discussed, should the proposed health funding
reallocation for clinical commissioning groups be implemented, the
situation will only get worse. South Yorkshire is due to lose
£150 million by April 2014. That is staggering given
that, under the proposals, other parts of the UK that already have
better health outcomes and longer life expectancy will receive an
increase in funding. This Bill seeks only to ration scarce resources;
without a completely different approach, we will fail to meet proven
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000049">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>
a former social worker, I welcome clauses 42 to 47, which introduce a
duty on local authorities to make inquiries when they suspect that an
adult is at risk of or is experiencing abuse or neglect. Yet no duty is
placed on care providers to report suspected abuse or neglect to the
local authority. The Government contend that the present guidance is
sufficient, but I disagree. In the light of Winterbourne View and Mid

address the issue. Where victims of abuse are imprisoned in their own

there are no current legal means by which access can be achieved. An

believe that the Bill deserves to be described as landmark legislation,
because it will provide a new governing purpose for our social
system—the idea of well-being, to which I will return—new
rights for carers and, for the first time, parity of esteem between
those who are cared for and family members who provide care and
support. The new national eligibility threshold will end the postcode
lottery for access. We can debate where the line is drawn, but for the

will also be new obligations on local authorities on behalf of the

and postpone the need for care, to ensure quality and choice of
services and to ensure that there is good information and advice about
the whole range of choices that people might need to make as they
approach the point at which they need care. Importantly, the Bill is
foundation legislation upon which a more co-ordinated and integrated
system of health and social care can be

could stop there, but the Bill will do more than that. It will simplify
and clarify entitlements to state-funded support and put personal
budgets into law for the first time. That is all before I have even
mentioned the Dilnot reforms, about which it is important to give some
context. Social care in this country today is not free. That is the
nasty little secret that families discover when they are tipped into
crisis and have to negotiate with their local authority over whether
they will have access to any means-tested support. Most people do not
know that, and it comes as a shock and creates anger and dismay in many
families. While I was a Minister, Members from both sides of the House
showed me letters of anguish from people who felt that the system was
letting them down. To understand the value of Dilnot is to make a true
comparison not with what people hope the system will be but with what
it actually is today—a nasty, mean system that is means-tested.
That is why the Government deserve to be commended for having the
courage to start to put in place the principles that Dilnot

course, it is important that we recognise that not everyone will ever
need formal care. A minority of our population will need formal
support, no matter where the threshold is drawn. Perhaps some will need
it right at the end of their life. Those who do will want the Bill to
give them peace of mind, and that is what Dilnot provides to everyone.
Some people are confused by the idea of catastrophic costs based on all
people needing care, but the reality is that most people will never
reach the cap wherever it is drawn, because they will never need to
draw down that much resource to pay for care 
<?notus-xml column=528?>costs. Moving the means test threshold from
£23,250—the meanest of means tests in our welfare

all those reasons, the Bill can be marked out as a comprehensive reform
of our social care system, and it deserves the House’s
wholehearted support today. There are other reasons why it deserves
support, too. The draft Bill was consulted on extensively and has been
subject to pre-legislative scrutiny, of which I am a great fan. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:23:34"></hs_TimeCode> Minister at
the time, I actively sought permission for it to be subject to that
approach. By a curious twist of fate, I then found myself chairing the
very scrutiny Committee that I had advocated. I was lucky to have
cross-party support from both Houses in doing that job, and it was a
strong Committee. We made 107 recommendations, the vast majority of
which the Government accepted before introducing the Bill. Many of the
others have been persuaded upon them through their lordships’
scrutiny, and I am grateful to colleagues in the Lords for what they
have
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:24:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000069">All
of that will be worth nothing if the Bill is not well implemented. As
the debate has demonstrated powerfully, there is a huge knowledge gap
that leaves people struggling in a crisis. It means that people do not
plan or prepare for care, financially or in other ways. We need not
just local information and advice services but a multi-channel,
multi-media campaign to inform and educate the public, hon. Members and
the people who work in the system. We need to ensure that we manage
changes well, such as deferred payments, about which I hope the
Minister will say more later, not least because it is not a sufficient
defence to say, “Because Labour did this when it was in
government, we will do it as well”. I hope the Minister will
have a better answer on that

want to give one example of why the implementation challenge is big.
There are 300,000 to 400,000 people in this country who already pay for

centre, in the Bill’s first clause, is the disruptive idea that
we should promote individual well-being. It states that well-being is
about quality of life, work, leisure, study, the right to be an active
member of the community, being in control and maintaining and
recovering physical and social function—all things that were

it should be able to inspect the local authority in question without

extra powers to oversee the social care market, in particular companies
that are deemed “too large to replace”. I welcome that,
but we may need to oversee better business models at a more local
level. The Association of Directors of Adult Social Services budget
survey 2013 showed that more than half of directors expect providers in
their areas to face financial difficulty, given the squeeze on local
authority budgets that other Members have mentioned. Perhaps those
oversight powers should better cover small and medium providers too. I
hope the Minister will reassure the House that the CQC will have the
resources and expertise to assess whether all care home owners are

gathered 10,500 exhibits and 12.5 tonnes of documents. It led our
police to brand the negligence discovered as “death by
indifference”. There were 103 alleged victims of care home abuse
and neglect, yet, like their relatives, I was dismayed that Operation
Jasmine secured just three convictions for wilful neglect by carers.

relate to poor care for residents in his homes, but instead to breaches

I joined the last hospice where I worked—Martin House, which at
that time served most of Yorkshire—the construction of its new

could be described as the “older younger people”. As time

it does mean that we must think about how we can help such young
people. The majority of those who may require palliative care have a
range of severe disabilities and complex health needs. Contrary to

those young people have cognitive impairments, which means that that

Palliative care for young people is not simply end-of-life care, but
focuses on enhancing the quality of their lives. In their early to
mid-teens, young people receive palliative care and other support from
children’s services. In their later teens, they start to receive
services from adult agencies which assume responsibility at different
points after their 16th birthdays. The transition is often complex, and

poor. The reduced services and support routinely offered by adult
agencies, which are often focused on older people and end-of-life care,
come as a distressing shock to many young people and their families.

Social Services and Well-being (Wales) Bill is currently before the

piece of legislation for Wales, and is similar to this Bill in many
respects. It will increase the number of services for which people can
claim a direct payment from the local authority, will introduce
national eligibility criteria, and will provide for portable
assessments to avoid the cost and trouble of
reassessments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000113">Let
me make a general point about funding. I understand that the Bill will
require additional spending of about £1 billion in England. If I
am correct—these are the figures I have been given—it
would probably generate about £60 million of Barnett
consequential spending in Wales. Will the Minister confirm whether a
figure has been agreed, and if so, will he tell the House—or me
later on—what it might
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T18:49:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0002.htm#13121635000114">Particular
circumstances apply in Wales. For historical and industrial
reasons—the prevalence of heavy industry—Wales has higher
levels of disability. Thousands of people retire from England to
Wales—they are very 
<?notus-xml column=535?>welcome, but there is a cost implication. Wales has the highest
proportion of older people of any country or region in the UK. Nearly
one in four of our people are over 60, and that figure is expected to
increase by a further 5% over the next 10 years. Any funding system
based merely on total population will therefore inevitably generate
inequalities. In passing, I refer to my concerns about the
Government’s census proposals. I fear we might not have proper
data in the future—but that is a debate for another

will have implications for cross-border placements and the possibility

in Cardiff? Have all outstanding issues been resolved? In particular,
have we resolved the issues relating to social services assessments
possibly being undertaken in Wales for persons who then move to

difficulties to which cross-border issues might give rise are covered

Paragraph (1) deals with cross-border placements from England to Wales,
but the schedule does not specify—or so it seems to me at least,
but perhaps my reading has not been close enough—who is
responsible for paying. Are the provisions in paragraph 1(5) meant to
cover this? It is far from clear to me. Might this be a matter for
regulations? Again, I would be glad to hear from the Minister, either
later this evening or by other means. We need some reassurances on

Clause 109(3) and (4) state that the HRA’s remit is to promote
the co-ordination of standardisation of practice in the UK in the
regulation of social care. Particular aspects of social care in Wales
require a specific approach. The socio-economic make-up of Wales is
different. Gross value added levels in some areas of Wales are as much
as 40% below average levels in the UK. The financial profile against
which any new policy is set will inevitably differ in Wales and England
and will have to allow for Wales’ significantly higher
disability levels. Wales has already set a cap of £50 a week on

of the principles—certainly acceptance of them by

concerns, particularly about the FACS—free access to care
services—criteria. He will probably not know—it is a
recent decision by Bradford council—that the Labour council has
decided to move from “moderate” to
“substantial” in respect of the criteria. It has to go
into a budget process; unfortunately, this will happen. We campaigned
hard against that, with a 1,700 names on a petition opposing it, but it

was unfortunate about earlier exchanges was a certain degree of
dishonesty. This thing did not happen all of a sudden three years ago.
Conservative, Labour and possibly some Liberal authorities—I do
not know—up and down the country were from 2005 onwards moving
away from “moderate” to “substantial” FACS
criteria way before the change of Government and way before the vicious
cuts took place as part of the austerity programme. Indeed, it was
before the recession really bit, and I regret that. What seemed to be
happening was a “follow my leader”
approach—“Every other authority seems to be doing this,
so why shouldn’t we?” It was seen as a way of reducing
the budget. What I argued, continue to argue now and will continue to
argue all the way through until this Bill becomes an Act is that this
is a false economy. I have made all those points to the Minister

believe that eligibility is the gateway to care, but I am not convinced
by the proposed savings that are supposed to be made. We worked closely
with various organisations, including Scope, which has done a fantastic
job of looking at the issue of working age disablement, which accounts
for one third of benefit recipients. People desperately need care to
live a more fulfilled life, whether it be in education or work. This is
just one example—there are many others—where savings can
be accrued, but taxation can also be generated if people are given just
a small amount of support to become economically active.</hs_Para>

charities and organisations have raised serious issues. Principles are
most important, but data collection is crucial. Charities that exist to
help people with Parkinson’s and other neurological conditions
identified the fact that they had no idea how many people with
Parkinson’s actually received social care. How can that be the
case? How can that happen? Something must be sadly going wrong with
data collection. Macmillan Cancer Support pointed out that free social
care at the end of life needs 
<?notus-xml column=538?>to be a crucial element of any changes we are
looking to make and that, if we aim for true integration, we must have
proper identification of carers within their health settings. We should
not wait until people are turned out of hospital and go home before
identifying who is going to look after the person and provide support.
Leonard Cheshire Disability provided further useful information, and I

principles are at issue here. On the national criteria, I may not like
the level, but it is important to have standardisation. On the carers
assessment, we should be applauding the fantastic proposal to make
carers the centre of attention, as they are so often forgotten. How
many times have carers ended up being the people who need care because
of the lack of support they receive? A young person I know has come to
my office on a regular basis to express serious concerns about the
people he was caring for, but I have seen with my own eyes that person
deteriorate over the last 12 months or so as a result of the

have already mentioned the principle of integration. We have the
framework: the health and wellbeing boards are still in their early
days, but this way of bringing together the different parts of social
care, public health and the national health service is so important.
The links between health and social care are crucial. I cited a case in
the Westminster Hall debate of a man in his 50s who had an accident at
work when reversing his vehicle. He had no seatbelt on, as he was just
backing into the car park, yet he became tetraplegic. He was in
Pinderfields hospital for five months. He received superb support and
everyday attention, but when he went home in the ambulance, he could
not get into the house because there was no ramp. He had to go away
again. Then the local authority provided the money for a ramp and the
hospital brought him back again, but he could not get in because it was
a wooden ramp and they did not dare take him on it because that would
have broken it. That is madness in this day and age, and it needs to be
dealt with.</hs_Para>

those who think that we are being churlish will think again. It is the
right route for an Opposition. Talking about being churlish, let me put

understandable reasons,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:09:07"></hs_TimeCode> debate on

Burstow) as well as from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:09:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bradford East—a third of those who receive social care are
actually working age disabled people. We sometimes overlook their
needs, rights and aspirations within the wider debate. Too often
“social care” and “elderly” go together,
and we need to get ourselves out of that mindset, because although they
look the same, I think we would all agree that a younger
person’s need for support can be quite different from the
support needs of those who are older. The emphasis on older people
means that the terms of the debate are often not as relevant as they
might be to younger people who require social care. They often want to
combine that social care with a life that includes work, education and
so forth, and they potentially have a different pace and pattern of
life from that of older people.</hs_Para>

out of the house for many younger disabled people. If social care is to
mean anything to the lives of the disabled working adult, it should be
underpinned by a real recognition of the importance of an independent

the independent living fund is a classic example of that. At present,

around the spend, which is not seen as an investment. I acknowledge the
work done by Scope, and carried out by Deloitte, highlighting that for
every £1 invested in care for disabled people with moderate
needs a saving of £1.30 is generated. The figures 
<?notus-xml column=541?>are pretty staggering. There would be a £700 million saving to
central Government through an increase in tax revenue and a reduction
in welfare spending. This Government always tell us that they want to
reduce welfare spending; well, there are opportunities to do so without
doing some of the things that they are doing. There would be a
£570 million saving to the NHS and local government, and
£480 million would be saved by local government by avoiding the

things that I am sure all of us would like to see added, improved,
amended or clarified. For me, one of the challenges is the role of the
local authority in its commissioning and provision of care services. It
seems bizarre that it should do both, because that must surely give
rise to a conflict of interest. How can it commission and provide? The
conflict was recognised in the NHS, and a split was introduced. It is

authorities and housing, but one area in which there is often no
acceptance of stakeholder responsibility is that of transport.
Transport to get people between care homes and hospital appointments
has almost reached crisis point in my constituency, and there is huge
reliance on the voluntary sector to fill the gap. There is clearly some
provision for the NHS to provide that transport, but the rules are so

looked at the definition of substantial need, we then need to consider
who is to be involved in agreeing the care package. This is about the
process of assessment, and it will be crucial for all the stakeholders
to be involved. I have seen diverse levels of application in my local
authorities. In some, this is very much a matter for the local
authority, and it can sometimes almost seem as though a care package is
being imposed on an individual. In other authorities, however, the
individual, the carer, the family and the care home are all involved to
ensure that the package is understood, agreed, accepted and fit for
purpose. It would be extremely valuable if guidance could ensure that
that always happened, when the Bill becomes law.</hs_Para>

will give us a real insight into what is on offer, and what
“good” and “average” look like. That in
turn will give rise to further questions. Once we know what they look
like, we shall have to answer a much more difficult question: to what
level should the taxpayer pay, after which there should be a personal
top-up? That issue can be addressed only when we have some experience

there are to be different levels, the option of a top-up has to be real
and available. It clearly exists, but I have seen a reluctance to make
it happen in practice in some local authorities. In some ways, that is
understandable. The contract is with the local authority and the care
home, and not with the relatives or, more usually, the individual
picking up the extra cost. The local authority will be concerned that,
should there be a problem of affordability for the caring relatives, it
would be left to pick up the bill. The top-up therefore needs to be
reviewed. If it is to be available, it must be meaningful, and that
might involve looking at whether relatives can be part of the
contractual arrangement.</hs_Para>

the longer term, following the successful passage of the Bill, there is

the framework, and we can then begin to look in more detail at the
strategies needed for those living in their own homes with support.
Historically, we have asked what we should be doing for those in
residential care or in hospitals, but once we have the framework, we
will have the opportunity to look at a much more concrete strategy.
That is something I would very much like to see.</hs_Para>

have spoken before in this place about the care crisis in this country,
not least because of my own family’s direct experience.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:29:27"></hs_TimeCode> my nan had
to move out of her home seven years ago, my family had no idea what was
about to happen to the very modest assets she had built up over her
lifetime. My nan was not an extravagant woman. She never once went
abroad. She simply worked hard and brought up her family. When vascular
dementia 
<?notus-xml column=544?>took hold of her mind and her body, she could no longer stay in the
semi-detached house in Swindon she had bought with my grandfather. She
had to sell it. She moved to sheltered accommodation but, after a few
years, she deteriorated rapidly and soon had to move to a nursing home.
Before she died, she spent £130,000 on care in that home over
three to four years, using up all but £23,000 of her lifetime
assets. If she had known that, it would have broken her heart. She
would not have thought it fair that everything she and my grandfather
had worked for could not in any meaningful way be passed down to her
children. My family are neither rich nor poor; we are like families up
and down the country for whom the hand of fate intervened resulting in
catastrophic care costs for their loved ones.</hs_Para>

Bill’s proposals to cap those costs and to raise the amount of
money that an individual’s family can keep after paying for care
should be welcomed, but we should welcome them cautiously. The cap does
not cover all care costs, and the complexity of the process of valuing
people’s assets and calculating their personal contribution
means that many people will still end up paying very significant sums.
Presenting the proposals as the answer to the country’s care
crisis is disingenuous and risks spreading even more confusion about
what support from the state families can expect.</hs_Para>

individuals are to pay less, the state will pick up more of the tab,
and the financial front line in that respect will be local authorities.
They are already buckling under the strain of providing social care.
London Councils, the body representing the capital’s local
authorities, estimates that the costs of resetting the means-test
threshold, added to the rising demand for care, will see social
services departments facing a shortfall of more than £1 billion
in the years between 2016 and 2020. The money set aside by the
Government to deal with that is inadequate. Be it this Government or

they have serious implications for hospitals and the health service

wish to discuss our experience in south-east London of the first ever
use of the trust special administration regime when the South London
Healthcare NHS Trust was placed into administration last year. It is
important for the House to understand that this process is totally
different from any other hospital reconfiguration. It is a very fast
process—roughly six months from start to finish—led by an
administrator who is brought in from outside the organisation primarily
to balance the books. The administrator is appointed to a specific
failing trust, but what happened in our corner of London was that the
administrator determined that in order to sort out the financial
problems of the failing trust he needed to look beyond its confines,
and that is where Lewisham hospital came in: a separate, successful,
neighbouring hospital was told that its full accident and emergency
department, its maternity service and its excellent paediatric
department would have to go to solve the financial problems
elsewhere.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121635000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000178">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:34:11"></hs_TimeCode>
people of Lewisham did not think that that was very fair. The case was
fought in the courts and the Secretary of State was told, not once, but
twice, that he was acting unlawfully—hence clause 118; he fought
the law and lost, so he is now trying to change it. He wants
administrators to be able to specify and force through massive service
changes at hospitals that are not part of the trust to which an
administrator has been appointed. In effect, he wants to do elsewhere
what the courts told him he could not do in Lewisham. When the trust
special administration regime was first legislated for, guidance was
issued by the Department of Health stating that the process should not
be used as a “backdoor approach” to reconfiguration. That
is precisely how it was used in Lewisham, and had the law not been on
our side our full A and E and maternity service would now be closing,
and half our hospital would be up for
sale.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000179">The
TSA process is a brutal and rushed one. It starts with the need to save
money, with questionable clinician input. When the starting point is
the accountant’s bottom line, the public are understandably
sceptical about whether the medical and clinical input has just been
shaped to suit the desired financial end point. The speed at which the
process takes place leads to shoddy and haphazard work. The
administrator in south London recommended to the Secretary of State
that he make decisions about Lewisham hospital based on an
understanding that the whole process would cost £266 million and
would take three years to implement. After the Secretary of State took
his decision, it emerged, from the office the trust special
administrator, that it would cost twice that and take twice as long.
The quality of the condensed public consultation was atrocious: people
were struggling to find copies of the consultation document in local
libraries; we had an online response form that did not even contain a
direct question about Lewisham’s A and E; and hundreds of people
had to stand outside packed public consultation meetings because they
could not get in. That is not the way to deal with a subject that
understandably arouses such passions in people. People care so much
about the health service because it is often where they experience the
worst and best moments of their life. They want to have their say in
how their services are organised, and giving even more draconian powers
to special administrators erodes their ability to do that.</hs_Para>

understand that hospital services have to evolve—some services

likely that those arguments are won, not more. These changes are at

experience of her late grandmother in Swindon. As the Member of
Parliament for some other members of her family, I was particularly
interested in, and concerned to hear, that story. Clearly there is a
measure of consensus about the progress that the Bill allows us to
make. Although I understand and appreciate her concerns about the
process that was successfully challenged in the courts in relation to
her local hospital, and the detail in respect of clause 118, I do not
think, with respect to her and to the Opposition, that that is
sufficient for the reasoned amendment to pass tonight. I say that
because I think of the thousands of families like hers who, over the
years, have had to wait for change and for politicians to come up with
a decision. We have procrastinated and prevaricated, and had review
after review, so surely time is now up and decisions have to be made.

work, socialise and take part in their communities. At the same time,
it can prevent an escalation of care needs.</hs_Para>

me turn now to the existing duties of local government and the NHS. I
welcome the Bill’s intention to bring together in one place
statutory guidance on care and support. However, the statutory guidance

on the NHS. I want to ensure that those duties on the NHS are not
unintentionally omitted from this Bill.</hs_Para>

is still much progress to be made with regard to the duty to develop a

Swindon the local social enterprise SEQOL has already done that, and
has developed an important diagnostic pathway, which is also followed
up by meetings with and assessments 
<?notus-xml column=548?>by clinicians. That has resulted in adults as old as
50 and above being diagnosed with autism or Asperger’s for the
first time. The issue of what happens next will be key if we are to
make this Bill, and the good intentions behind it, work for people with
autism.</hs_Para>

common problem reported by families of people with autism is that far
too often the person carrying out the care assessment does not
sufficiently understand the condition or how to communicate effectively
with someone on the spectrum. I am therefore encouraged by the recent
amendment to the Bill to enable regulations that will specify where
community care assessments should be carried out by assessors with
specific expertise. Assessments for adults with autism must be covered
by those regulations, because that will reinforce the obligation
already placed on local authorities by the Autism Act and the statutory
guidance to train those who carry out community care assessments. The
NAS found that, at the moment, only just over half of local authorities
have specialised training available for their staff, so,
quite clearly, more work needs to be done to deal with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:46:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000192">The
right to advocacy is essential to enable people who find it hard to
communicate to exercise their rights. I pay tribute to the work of the
Swindon advocacy movement, which, as a result of its efforts and
funding from the local authority, is now extending advocacy to adults
with autism and Asperger’s, who have never had that support
before. What often makes us parents lie awake at night is the question
of who will speak for our children when we are gone. Who will be there
to carry out that advocacy? This service is essential to provide peace
of mind to parents and carers of sons and daughters with autism who
will outlive them.

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:48:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South Swindon (Mr Buckland) speaks with great passion and knowledge
in support of children with autism. He made an incredibly important
point when he asked who cares for vulnerable children once the parents
have gone. Indeed, who cares for all those we care for once we are
gone? That is a powerful and important
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:48:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000194">I
agree with the hon. Gentleman that this debate is about the principle
of the Bill. He talked about the need for action, which is why the Bill
is welcome. We have an opportunity to improve services for many people,
but Labour Members feel that the Bill should be more ambitious, which
is why the reasoned amendment is so important, and it is what the
reasoned amendment is saying. I also agree with him
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:49:24"></hs_TimeCode>about the need
to integrate what happens under the Children and Families Bill with
what happens under this Bill. The crossover he mentioned between
children’s service and adult services as children grow up is
important. The Children and Families Bill and this Bill create
significant new responsibilities for the NHS and local government, and
the big question 
<?notus-xml column=549?>for the Government is about where the resources will come from to
deliver them. I was a local councillor for more than 15 years under
both previous Governments and it was a familiar story for local
councils to be given new responsibilities without necessarily always
being given the resources to deliver them. That is an important point
about this crucial Bill.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Bradford East (Mr Ward) mentioned the need for free
social care at the end of life. That was an important point, but at
what stage should social care be free? What do we mean by end of life?
What criteria should we set? How much earlier than the end of a life
should that care come? How do we fund free social care and how do we
fund social care at all? That is one of the big concerns and that is
why the reasoned amendment mentions our concerns about where the cap
has been set.</hs_Para>

right hon. Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire)
mentioned the concern that the needs of disabled people may have been
overlooked. The London School of Economics cites the fact that
97,000 fewer disabled people have been in receipt of social
care since 2008—the figure for older people is 250,000. The LSE
cites £2.8 billion as the figure required for councils to set
eligibility at moderate, in the context of an overall budget spend for
health and social care of £120 billion. The fact that it would
take £2.8 billion to set the criteria at moderate speaks volumes
about what could be done if we got this right.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander) mentioned
her family and I am going to talk about my family now. My dad cares for
my mum. Let me describe my mum’s experience this year, because
it is the experience of many older people and their families. In the
early part of the year, she was being cared for by my dad and she
gradually declined until she was rushed into hospital. I think it
happened because no health professionals or social care professionals
were keeping a close enough eye on her. She ended up in hospital where,
happily, she received very good care. Her wish was met and she was able
to go home, and the health service provided a hospital bed that she
could use there.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121635000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000198"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:53:05"></hs_TimeCode>Once
she got home, the lack of service in the community became a problem
again. There was not the rehab, the physio or the support to enable her
to return to some kind of active life. Now, many months later, it is
too late—that will not happen. My mum rarely gets out of bed any
more. For many people, such an experience is all too familiar. It
happens because of how social care and health have been allowed to
operate over the years, with no proper integration and without people
in the two services talking to each other. My parents receive a care
package now, with carers coming in. My mum’s social care needs
are met but the lack of proper support has meant that things are not as
they should be.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:54:09"></hs_TimeCode>I do not think
that my mum’s case is the worst, by any means, but it is
indicative of where things are missing.</hs_Para>

Government have made a proposal and they have talked a lot about
integration between health and social care. I remember looking at
integrated health and social care teams many years ago as a local
councillor and there was success then. There has been more success
recently and there are good examples of health and 
<?notus-xml column=550?>social care professionals working together, but cuts to social care, in
particular, mean that the money simply is not there any more.</hs_Para>

cited the figures earlier.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:54:56"></hs_TimeCode>In Sefton, we
have seen a 40% cut in local government funding. The care managers are
simply not there any more. They are not there, as Members have said, to
help people in the community stay in their own homes; they are not
there to help people who have gone into hospital go home again. Those
situations are combining to leave a crisis in A and E—we will
have that debate on Wednesday, but that is what has been allowed to
develop. I am afraid that the reorganisation of the NHS during the
first years of this Government, with clinical commissioning groups
being created, meant that administrators and managers in the health
service were concentrating on setting up new structures and not on
ensuring that health services were delivered properly.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:55:47"></hs_TimeCode>These things do
not happen by accident. When £3 billion is spent on
reorganisation and not on patient care, that is the sort of situation
we end up with.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:55:59"></hs_TimeCode>The question is
what should we do? We have a proposal for a £72,000 cap on care,
but my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:56:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Lewisham East described the sum that her nan had
to pay, which was £130,000. For many people, the £72,000
cap will be no help, and other Members have given the details that show
that.</hs_Para>

are a number of ways of funding social care, one of which is to have a
cap. However, let me return to the comments made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:56:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bradford East. If we are considering free social care at the end of
life, or, as I said, a lot earlier than that, perhaps the time has come
for Members to debate free social care as part of a free at the point
of delivery and at the point of need health and social care service,
like that which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T19:57:03"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

at the edges will not solve the problem. The debate we must
have—and it must be a cross-party debate—is about how to
pay for such a service. As people get older, that is what will be
needed. Sooner or later, we as legislators will have to deliver exactly
that service. Anything short of that will not solve the problems;
things will only get worse. I put it to Members from all parties that
that is what is needed. We have made a start with the Bill and
tonight’s debate, but we will need to move down the route of
free health and social care and of whole-person care. That is the only
way we can solve the challenge of an ageing

on why all these aspects are important. Unfortunately, we also need to
focus on the challenges. The predominant challenge is demographic.
Nationally 2.2% of the population are over 85, but in my constituency
we got there 31 years ago. By 2020-21 2.9% of the population will be
over 85, but for Torbay that figure will be 4.9%. That represents an
enormous demographic challenge. We were discussing with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:10:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) the reasons why age is so important in
assessing need. Because of their demographics, places such as Torbay
and wider south Devon face additional challenges with rurality, which
means that they are under pressure like never before. Although I fully
understand that we must take into account deprivation and health
inequalities, unless we take sufficient account of age and need in
assessing the formulae, the system will

internationally renowned. As a member of the Health Committee, when we

and financial challenges that were the driver for looking at how health

experience of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:01:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

Enormous progress has been made. Waiting times for occupational therapy
have been reduced from two weeks to two days, for physiotherapy from
eight weeks to 48 hours, and for urgent equipment to help keep people

Wollaston:</Member></B> Indeed. It operates very well already in
Torbay, but it cannot be dictated centrally. We need to get the hurdles
out of the way, allow people to work together locally and facilitate
that. We heard on the draft Bill Committee that joint funding streams
were the best way to move that
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:05:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000214">Unfortunately,
in Torbay in the crunch year 2015 we will see the funding drop below
90% of projected expenditure. At that point, rather than driving
further integration, it will cause systems to start to fall apart
because people need to protect their own silos. That is a real danger.
As the Bill proceeds to Committee, I hope we look very carefully at the
effect of the funding gap and make sure that we are not setting a
system up to fail. One of the problems with the Bill is that it sets up
many new statutory responsibilities. Councils will have to fund care
accounts, which will undoubtedly be complex, bureaucratic and subject
to challenge. Councils will have responsibilities for carers’
assessments. There will be increasing numbers of eligible people as the
thresholds and caps change. We will see safeguarding adults boards,
more rights to information and advocacy, and for many, deferred
payments, if they have not already been making
those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:06:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000215">Once
we create these additional statutory responsibilities, there will be
less money to go around for the very things that are at heart of the

not be a tragedy if we set up carers’ assessments but there was
no funding left for services to respond to needs? Voluntary
organisations in my community can function incredibly efficiently on
very little money. They do not need to be fully funded, but they need
some funding. If that money dries up, I worry about how we will move

want the Bill to succeed. In the remaining minutes I shall
touch on those aspects that I think are, sadly, still missing, which
were recommended by the draft Bill Committee. One is how we calculate
care costs according 
<?notus-xml column=553?>to their actual cost, not the cost to the council. For a person living
in their own accommodation, it sometimes costs a great deal more to
access support than it would cost a council to provide it. We need to

is a small but important area relating to powers of entry in
exceptional circumstances for those who are subject to abuse in their
own home. It would be wrong for us to ignore that possibility. Although
the overwhelming majority of carers of course do a wonderful job in
challenging circumstances, there are occasions, sadly, when people can
be at risk from those who love them. Very often that is as a result of
the intensely challenging circumstances that carers face. We need to
reserve a power of entry in exceptional circumstances where there are
very serious concerns about individuals who may be vulnerable and

issue is free social care at the end of life. We know that 73% of
people would like to be able to die at home. In my experience working
as a GP in rural areas, where that broke down for most people was as a
result of a lack of social care, and the challenge of caring for
somebody right at the end of their life, when they may, for example, be
doubly incontinent. Until people are in that situation, they may not
understand how incredibly demanding it is to have to be with someone 24
hours a day, trying to stay awake and provide the intensive support
they need. Allowing everybody to access free social care in those
terrible final days would be a very important step
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000219"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:10:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:10:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:10:54"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow), and I also serve on the
Health Committee, so I have a particular interest in this Bill.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:11:46"></hs_TimeCode> had originally
intended to make a more wide-ranging contribution, but I will confine
my remarks to part 1, which deals with care and support.</hs_Para>

had hoped that the Secretary of State would conduct a hearts and minds
exercise in trying to selling the Bill, so I was rather disappointed
that he turned it into a political knockabout, jumping straight into
the most contentious elements, and clause 118 in particular, which sets
out the trust special administration arrangements.</hs_Para>

do not think that we can consider the Bill without giving some thought
to the background. Let us not forget that over this Government’s
tenure, £2.68 billion— at 20% of the net adult
social care spend, that is not an inconsiderable sum of
money—has been cut from council budgets. Although we were
talking about the principle of well-being in relation to clause 1,
which I think all Members support, in practice cuts of that level mean
that fewer people are getting help with paying for their care and more
people are being charged for vital services, such as help with getting
washed and dressed and with eating—the basic things that most of
us take for granted.</hs_Para>

have no doubt that councils, particularly those in the north that I am
familiar with, are doing their best to save money and provide services
efficiently by changing the way care is provided and, where they can,
working more closely with the NHS. However, the scale of the cuts means
that they are being forced to dramatically reduce services and increase
charges to balance the books. All the evidence that has come to the
Select Committee and the anecdotal evidence that Members receive
indicates that is the case.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State got into a little argument in his opening statement
with regard to eligibility thresholds, which is a really important
point. In 2010-11, 38 councils provided free care to people with
“low” or “moderate” needs, and 114 provided
free care only to those whose needs were considered
“substantial” or “critical.” Those needs
really are substantial and critical, as we can see if we look at the
definitions, which are set out in the guidance. Now, however, only 15
councils continue to provide care and support to people with
“low” and “moderate” needs and 137 provide
care only to those assessed as having “substantial” or
“critical” needs. That means that in many areas
preventative services have all put disappeared. Setting the threshold
at such a high level is therefore a false
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:14:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000228">According
to Age UK, as a result of tightening eligibility criteria, 800,000
people in the UK have a care need but are not getting any support. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:14:33"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire) mentioned, there is
another care crisis, because a third of the total of those requiring
care are working-age adults. Indeed, four in 10 of working-age disabled
people who receive social care say that it does not meet their basic
needs, including eating, washing, dressing and getting out of the
house. One in three say that cuts in social care have prevented them
from working or volunteering.</hs_Para>

for vital care services, such as home help and meals on wheels, are
increasing fast. In effect, that is a tax on some of the most
vulnerable people in our society, people who have already been hit the
hardest by benefit changes. Some Government Back Benchers talked about
the need to cut the deficit. There is a need to address the economic
situation, but not on the backs of the poorest and most vulnerable. To
my mind, it is a question of political priorities. I am proud that my
party has pledged to scrap the bedroom tax, which I think brings great
shame on the coalition Government because of its impact on disabled
people.</hs_Para>

M. Morris:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point. That
ties in with home care visits. The United Kingdom Homecare Association
has indicated in a briefing that three quarters of home care visits now
last 30 minutes or less and that one in 10 last only 15
minutes. There must be deterioration in care if carers are there for
only 15 minutes. Care rationed in 15-minute slots is simply
unacceptable, and I think that the House should reflect on what is
happening. This is important because older people end up in hospital
unnecessarily and stay longer than is necessary. There has been a 42%
increase in delayed discharges from hospitals since figures were first
collected in August 2012. Indeed, last month saw the largest number of
delayed days in hospital ever recorded, and there were 78,400 such days
in October alone. These delayed discharges now cost our NHS
£20 million each month. That money could be used to
fund about 1.5 million hours of home care for vulnerable older people
and help to keep them out of hospital when they can be supported in
their own homes.</hs_Para>

hand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:22:31"></hs_TimeCode>. Given the
high level of interest in my constituency, I recently held a listening
event that was kindly supported by Age UK Sunderland and Sunderland
Carers. I wanted to find out what the people who would be affected by
the Government’s planned reforms thought of them. In the time

I do so, I want to say a few words about young carers. After concerted
lobbying by Members on both sides of the House, particularly
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:22:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley), we now have
clauses in the Children and Families Bill providing for young
carers’ needs assessments and there are clauses in this Bill
covering a young carer’s transition to adulthood—a very
welcome step forward. I pay tribute to the Minister and to his
predecessor, the right hon. Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul
Burstow)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:24:32"></hs_TimeCode>, who
are both in the Chamber today, and to the children’s Minister,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:23:21"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for Crewe and
Nantwich (Mr Timpson), for listening to Members and campaigners on this
very important
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:23:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:23:39"></hs_TimeCode>However, I would
like the Bill also to include a duty on medical professionals to
identify and refer young carers so that they can benefit from those
needs assessments. Family doctors are by far the best placed
professionals to be able to identify where a child or young person is
probably providing support to their parents, and it is not unreasonable
to expect them to make sure that that child or young person has their
needs assessed by the local authority. I very much hope that we will
see more progress on this issue as the Bill continues its passage
through the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000241">Turning
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:23:58"></hs_TimeCode>to the main
provisions of the Bill on social care, if the Minister thinks that my
constituents are happy with the package we have before us at
present, he is very much mistaken. People’s first
question is understandably, “Will this benefit me or my family
members?”, and many of them, when they look beyond the press
releases at what the Bill actually says, are 
<?notus-xml column=557?>finding out that it does not.
They<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:29:27"></hs_TimeCode> know that
only people who are eligible for care will be covered by the
headline-grabbing £72,000 cap on care costs. Therefore, if the
Government say—as looks likely—that only those with the
most severe needs are deserving of help, very few will be covered by
the cap at all. Even if they are covered, £72,000 will not be
the maximum amount they will have to pay; they will also have to pay
hotel and accommodation costs of £230 a week, as well as any
difference between the rate the local authority is able to pay and the
actual care costs. All in all, they could be looking at an extra
£300 a week that does not count towards the cap. That means
that, over five years, a pensioner would have to find an additional
£78,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:25:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000242">The
situation may be different for the Secretary of State’s
constituents, but I cannot think of many pensioners in my constituency
who would be able to afford that kind of bill without selling their
home. Of course, there will be a deferred payment option, but that is
just a more expensive version of what 95% of councils do already and it
will not be available until a pensioner has run down all their other
assets<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:26:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Assuming
they do qualify and they defer five years of care home
charges, they could end up clocking up an extra debt of £13,800

someone needing care for five years could see the entire value of their
home gobbled up. Whether the home is sold before or after they die is
academic, because it will still need to be sold and all but
£23,000 will be called on to pay for care bills and the interest
on them. The only real difference I can see between that and the
current system is that people will pay interest for the privilege of
deferring their home sale, and that is why the Opposition say that this

next thing my constituents asked me at the listening event was whether
the Bill will improve the quality of care that they or their loved ones

the headlines every now and again when particularly shameful examples

in interest only reinforce the worries people already have about either
moving into residential care or becoming dependent on strangers who
come into their homes on a daily

job and 
<?notus-xml column=558?>often on terrible terms and conditions, examples of which we have heard
today. The Bill does very little to tackle the problems of long
hours—or even zero hours—and those of low pay, no
training and low staffing ratios that can lead to demotivation and
desensitisation with regard to the dignity of the people being cared
for. Ultimately, that is what brings down the standard of care that
everyone who needs it should have a right to
expect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:29:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121635000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#13121635000248">On
the quality of care that people receive and the impact is has on their
quality of life, I received an e-mail today from my constituent, Steve
Hudson, regarding clause 48, which has been inserted in the Bill thanks
to my noble colleague, Lord Low of Dalston. Clause 48 extends the
protection of the human rights framework to everyone receiving
regulated social care, whether they are in residential care or their
own home and whether they are self-funding or in receipt of local
authority support.
Frankly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:29:50"></hs_TimeCode>, I was
surprised that that was not the case already. As the Equality and Human
Rights Commission said in its briefing, closing that loophole would be
extremely beneficial in ensuring that the dignity and basic human needs
of every person receiving care are at the forefront of every manager
and business owner’s mind. I therefore hope that if the Bill

final big concern that my constituents shared with me at my listening

cuts to local authority budgets have a knock-on effect in the NHS, with
beds, clinical staff and other resources unnecessarily tied up while
care packages are put in place or even just reasonable adjustments to
accommodation are made. It is no coincidence that delayed discharging
is at an all-time high and costing the NHS some £20 million a
month at a time when many local authorities are at financial breaking

services they are legally obliged to provide over the coming years, let

need to add a bit of zip and eagerness to the process to ensure that
care can be delivered, particularly for those with cancer. Last week a
meeting took place in the Methodist hall across the way, at which a
shadow Minister spoke. The Conservative party also had a representative
there. Everyone outlined the need for help for those with cancer, and
that is one issue that really needs to be addressed. There were people

situation for terminally ill people and their families is difficult,
and NHS continuing health care is supposed to address it. However,
local variations and the way in which CHC funding is allocated mean
that few terminally ill people gain access to care through CHC, even
though it is available. In this age, how can that be? In Northern
Ireland, the Assembly has put in place a commissioner for older people
and tasked her specifically with looking after the concerns and needs
of the elderly population and highlighting their issues. I took the
opportunity to bring the commissioner down to a public meeting in my

care is vital to terminally ill people and their families. A study by
the Nuffield Trust showed that terminally ill people who had access to
local authority-funded social care were far less likely to use hospital
care. Currently, more than 50% of people in the UK die in hospital,
despite only 2% saying that that would be their preference. The
National Audit Office estimated that 40% of people who die in hospital
have no clinical need to be there, and that is thought to be a
conservative estimate. If those people were moved to a community
setting, supported by social care, they would receive the care they
wanted, and it would free up hospital resources

authorities have the option to fast-track social care for terminally
ill people and their families, but no incentives to do so, that could
lead to a high degree of variation across the country in the
availability of social care. Again, that goes back to my earlier point
about whether we have a national health service or a regional health
service. It is important that the service is the same across the United
Kingdom, so that what people get in Scotland is the same as they get in
Wales, Northern Ireland or England. I believe we should have such
services everywhere, and they should not be different for anybody, no
matter what their strata in life.</hs_Para>

Kenny suffered a broken neck while serving in the Army. He is paralysed
from the chest down and uses a wheelchair. Although he is originally
from Edinburgh, he lived in London in the early 1990s, during which
time he received funding for his care package from Greenwich council.
In 1996, he decided he wanted to move back to Edinburgh to receive
additional support from his family, but when he informed Greenwich
council of his intentions it indicated that it would be unwilling to
continue to contribute to his care package and that if he wanted to
move he would have to contact Edinburgh council, which he did but which
also said it was unwilling to support
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:51:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#1312171000015">The
disagreement revolved around the two councils’ conflicting
interpretation of the social work group Act 1968, particularly two
clauses, one relating to the “authority of the moment”
and the other to “ordinary residence”. This impasse
continued from 1996 to 2000. In October 2000, Mr Kenny resorted simply
to moving to Edinburgh, with help from his family physically to do so,
and paying for his own care, which put him into a lot of debt. Although
Edinburgh eventually agreed to pay for his care, he should never have
had to experience such
difficulties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:54:37"></hs_TimeCode>.

today’s debate and others I have heard during my time at
Westminster, a great deal of discussion on the cost of care is about
the “who pays?” element. Does the state pay? Does the
individual pay? At what point do we take a decision? They are all
important questions, but if we spent all our time looking at the cost

need to put additional funding into care to make more care

the introduction of free personal care in Scotland nearly 10 years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T20:56:58"></hs_TimeCode>. I emphasise
that the Scottish provisions apply only to a relatively small part of
personal care. After people have heard all the hype about free personal
care in Scotland, they tend to assume that everything about it is free,
but then discover that it clearly is not. Creating even this relatively
small part of care and making it “free” meant that the
financing was transferred to the Government, to the taxpayer, to all of
us.</hs_Para>

the same time, however, not an extra penny was put into the care system
at a time when, as much discussed today, demand was steadily rising. If
we add to the mix the difficulties of local government in
Scotland—we have had six years of council tax freeze and the
reduction of councils’ overall budgets—the result is that
my Scottish constituency is affected by exactly the same issues as
people have raised here: rising thresholds for care, for example, which

care at all.</hs_Para>

the outsourcing of many care contracts to save councils money, but at
the expense of the care workers and, indeed, the care recipients. I
have seen the poorer conditions that lead to the 15-minute care times
that we have heard about. We see them in Scotland, which was brought
home to me very clearly when my mother-in-law was terminally ill,
having been a fit person up until then. The first time when the care

first concern is about the regulation of carers who are recruited as a

progressively towards direct payments, where the individual recruits
carers on the open market. That is extremely difficult, but at least
they have some choice. I want to be clear about whether these carers

understand the subtleties of that, but there does seem to be a gap in

wanting to assess people and then reassess them, rather than putting

goes into assessment as opposed to provision, I think we would see some

to be more assessments and more spent on assessment than on getting the

it is struggling, as is every other voluntary
organisation in the area, as a result of local government cuts

told me in this Chamber that money spent on home care would be treated
as part of that cap. But the legislation that this Government introduce
never lives up to expectations, and it is deeply disappointing that the
Bill will still leave people having to sell their homes and does not
solve the care problem facing people every day of the
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:12:48"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
thousands of people will be deciding today whether or not to put their

lack of joined-up care is also presenting big problems for our accident

of people over 90 being “blue lighted” into A and E, and
the number of over-65s admitted to hospital with avoidable conditions
has been increasing—last year, it reached half a million. Of
course, we also have a problem at the other end, as we cannot discharge
people because of a lack of care in place. There has been a 42%
increase in delayed discharge, and in October alone 78,400 delayed days
were lost, so people who are admitted, often because of the lack of
appropriate care in the first place, are not being discharged because

has had to find £100 million of cuts, which has meant that it

“moderate” care needs. They may be moderate to the
decision makers, but they are still care needs; we are talking about

Members have mentioned the financial cap and other elements of the
Bill, so I will use the rest of my time to talk about the realities of
home care, which do not appear to be solved by this Bill. As many
Members know, I have a vested interest in the issue of care. Like
millions of others, I entrust the care of my mothers to carers every
day of the week. Most of the carers are lovely, but they are paid only
just above the minimum wage and only for the time they spend with the
person they are looking after; they are not paid at all for their
travelling time. I find that absolutely disgraceful, but it is normal
in this sector. I have been told that it is common for carers to be on
zero-hours contracts, and I have been told today of the pressure put on
workers in Manchester to work beyond 70 hours a week or else lose their
jobs.</hs_Para>

for disabled and elderly people is a precious job, and the Bill does
nothing to address the fundamental flaws in the way that care workers
are treated, which of course impacts on the care that people receive.
Yesterday, I met a woman and her 98-year-old mother—I will call
them Valerie and Lilian. Valerie told me about a few of the problems
she was encountering and why she had to change the care provider for
Lilian for the second time. She told me about the endless stream of
different care workers who do not know Lilian or her needs. One carer
had written in the logbook that Lilian had already washed and dressed
herself one morning. How did they know that she had washed, and why did
they think that the bed jacket she was wearing was appropriate
clothing?</hs_Para>

carer wrote that Lilian was eating toast for her tea when she arrived.
How did they think she had made the toast? Of course she was eating the
remnants of her breakfast, and her tea, which was made by the morning
carer, was still sitting untouched in the refrigerator. Another carer
left Lilian with her food tray in her lap, which meant that she was
unable to move until the next carer arrived a few hours later. It is no
wonder that Lilian’s carers make mistakes. Her tea-time visit is
a mere five minutes, and her bedtime visit is only 10
minutes. Lilian only got the tea-time visit because she now attends a
day centre for two extra days, which freed up some money to spend on
the
visit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#1312171000058"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:17:02"></hs_TimeCode>Lilian<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:19:31"></hs_TimeCode>
lives in sheltered accommodation where, years ago, there would have
been a warden who made regular visits. Now there is just a housing
manager whose role does not include checking on the residents. Valerie
told me about the strain being put on her because of the expectation
that she would be available at all hours. As she said, she is nearly 70
herself. She has already suffered a stroke and cares for her
76-year-old husband. Once she has taken her own medication, she cannot
go out in the middle of the night, but there is no other
support.</hs_Para>

and Lilian’s story is just one, and a depressingly familiar one.
The reality is that carers themselves are ageing and the elderly and
disabled are not getting the care that they need. I was told just this
morning of a carer who left an elderly person in bed in the morning
when she should not have done. When the lunchtime carer turned up, the
person could barely breathe. The lunchtime carer called the doctor who,
after some prevarication, came out. He left a prescription on the
elderly person’s table. I do not know how he thought it would
miraculously be filled in or how this ill person would miraculously be
able to take the necessary medication.</hs_Para>

have seen first hand the distress that is caused when a carer turns up
more than an hour late. There is chaos when different carers turn up
and do not know what to do. I understand too the realities of
inadequate care. I have also experienced the unresponsiveness of the
system when care needs change temporarily. Indeed, Marie Curie Cancer
Care has raised the issue of the time it can take for a terminally ill
person to get care. They can often wait weeks while local authorities
test their means and their level of need. Sadly, some people die before
they ever get any help at all.</hs_Para>

do not want to be too critical of the Government—not just
because it is the festive season—but we have talked about many
of these issues for a long time. When I read what was said in the other

compassion for and concern about their role, but that that has been the

heart of what the Act sought to achieve. The demand for that advocacy
is still there today. Advocates support people to articulate their
needs and to make informed choices, and they make the process less
intimidating. They support planning and reviewing care and help people
to speak out if they are dissatisfied with care or when safeguarding
issues arise.</hs_Para>

early stages of a concern being raised, and local authorities must take
this into consideration. Mencap is concerned that the local authority

defined on the face of the Bill. This seems to give prominence to one
form of abuse, although others clearly take place. Lord Rix and

critically makes other forms of abuse appear less relevant or
important. Again, recalling the recent institutional abuse and neglect
highlighted by Winterbourne View, Mid Staffs and the confidential
inquiry into the premature deaths of people with a learning disability,
it is crucial that other forms of abuse are set out in the Bill. They
may be covered by guidance, but evidence has shown that this has not
protected people with a learning disability who may well be subject to
multiple abuses. I agree with the Government that an exhaustive list
might be wrong and difficult to defend. However, the Bill should be
amended to include reference to physical, sexual and psychological

main concern, raised repeatedly by hon. Members today, is that the Bill
does not address the fundamental issue facing elderly and disabled
people and their families or put in place the really bold reforms we
need to tackle the growing care crisis in England. It is true that
council care budgets have been under pressure for many years, but this
Government’s decision to impose the biggest reduction in any
Department on local councils has the pushed care services that hundreds
of thousands of people rely on to “the brink of
collapse”—not my words, but those of Age UK.</hs_Para>

social care budgets have been cut by £2.7 billion
under this Government. The result is that fewer people are getting the
care they desperately need, particularly at home, which is the key
issue for the future, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:32:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn) and for South Shields (Mrs
Lewell-Buck) pointed out. Frail, elderly people are receiving home
visits that last barely 15 minutes, or in some cases only five or
10 minutes, as we have heard. Disabled people are being
trapped in their homes, denied the basic opportunities to work, train,
volunteer or have a social life that other people take for granted, a
point powerfully made by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:33:07"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Stirling (Mrs McGuire). Paid care staff on
zero-hours contracts are not even earning the minimum wage, let alone a
living wage, and unpaid family carers have been left struggling without
the help they need to look after their loved ones, which means that
their own health suffers, too. At the same time, more people are being
charged more for vital services such as home visits and meals on
wheels, which are up by £740 a year since the
election.</hs_Para>

care budgets by that scale hurts some of the most vulnerable people in
society. It is also a false economy, because as more elderly people do
not get the help they need to stay at home, they are ending up in
hospital in increasing numbers, which costs the taxpayer far more.
Delayed discharges from hospital have soared by 42% since the election,
as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:34:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris) rightly said.
Delayed discharges have costs taxpayers £225 million this year.
That could have paid for almost 17 million hours of home care. It is
spending money in the wrong place in a way that is not good for the
people using the services and does not provide value for
money.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:31:32"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears) said, one in
three carers now has to give up work or 
<?notus-xml column=575?>reduce their hours because they cannot get the help they need to look

are the Government being straight with people about their plans to
reform long-term care funding in future. Any measures that protect
people from catastrophic care costs are welcome, but Ministers have not
spelled out the reality of their plans. They have repeatedly claimed
that no one will have to pay more than £72,000 for their care,
but this is not the case. People’s care costs will start to
count towards the so-called cap only if they are assessed as having
eligible care needs. Nine out of 10 councils provide care only for
those with “substantial” or “critical”
needs. If someone needs help to stay living at home but their council
assesses their needs as “low” or
“moderate”, what they pay for home visits will not count
towards the cap.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:35:59"></hs_TimeCode>residential
care, the cap will not be based on what someone actually pays for their
home care but on the standard rate paid by their local council. I see
that the Secretary of State is being informed by the Minister about the
reality of these plans, so I hope that he listens to more of my speech.
The standard rate paid by local councils is currently, on average,
about £470 a week. Government Members, as well as Labour
Members, will know that many of their constituents pay far more than
£470 a week for their care home, but these extra costs will not
count towards the so-called cap.
People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:36:51"></hs_TimeCode> will
also, rightly, have to contribute towards their hotel and accommodation
costs. The Government are setting this contribution at £230 a
week—much higher than Andrew Dilnot recommended—and these
costs will not count towards the cap either. Taking both those factors
into account, it will take elderly people almost five years,
on average, to hit the so-called cap, during which time they will have
clocked up, on average, £150,000 for their care home bill, and
much more in many cases. Because elderly people stay in a care home for
about two and a half years, on average, six out of seven people will be
dead before they hit the
cap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T21:37:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0003.htm#1312171000085">Ministers
have repeatedly claimed that people will not have to sell their homes
to pay for their care; again, this is not the case. The Bill puts a
duty on councils to offer deferred payment schemes—care loans
that will have to be paid back by selling the family home after the
person has died. The loans will not be universally available, as Andrew
Dilnot recommended, but means-tested. Interest will be charged on the
loans, but that interest will not count towards the cap. Although the
Government are raising the upper level of the means test, that will not
help many pensioners on average incomes because of how the test works,
whereby councils take a notional income from the remaining assets in a
person’s house and add it to what they get from their pension
and any savings or second pension. For many pensioners on average
incomes, this combined total will take them over what their local
council will pay for care, and they will therefore not qualify for any
extra support.</hs_Para>

from existing users who are already desperately struggling to pay for
reforms that will benefit a small number of future care users in five,
six or seven years’ time. I think that many people will be
astonished, particularly after the Government had claimed that all the
additional costs for their proposals would come from elsewhere. I hope

This afternoon you heard a point of order from the hon. Member for
Hendon (Dr Offord) relating to me, and you expressly asked whether he
had informed me of his intention to raise the point of order. I am
afraid he did not inform me. He informed your office last Thursday. He
informed the Clerks last Thursday. They had four days’ notice.
As for me, moments before he got up to speak—literally moments
before—someone in his office sent the following
e-mail:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="1312171000774" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0004.htm#1312171000774">“Please

had no idea whether this was meant to be on a point of order or in the
debate this afternoon, or whether it was meant to be today or tomorrow,
later on this month, next month, or whenever. Incidentally, I should
say that I told the hon. Gentleman that I would raise this point of
order tonight; I both sent him an e-mail and rang and spoke to somebody
in his office to that effect. I note that he is not in his place

1994 the Chair ruled very clearly against my right hon. Friend the
Member for Neath (Mr Hain) —my hon. Friend the Member for Neath

say they have informed them by virtue of having sent some piece of
paper somewhere very late in the day. That is a deliberate attempt to
get round the common courtesies that should apply between one Member

ample warning.</hs_Para>

of order. I am familiar with the precedent to which he refers, when my
predecessor but one, Speaker Boothroyd, ruled. The answer to the hon.
Gentleman is that certain standards should obtain in this House. If a
Member is to raise a matter relating to the conduct of another Member,
there is an obligation to notify the Member about whom the complaint is
to be made some reasonable time in advance of getting up to make the
complaint. Simply to send an e-mail a few moments beforehand is way
below the standard of behaviour. <I>[Interruption.] </I>With great
respect to Members chuntering from a sedentary position, it has
absolutely nothing to do with being thicker skinned or anything of the
sort; it is a matter of parliamentary courtesy, and people who have
been around in this place for a little while understand these matters.
That is the situation and I hope we will not have to revisit it again
because it is really very clear.</hs_Para>

I have just been talking to the Vote Office about the papers that
accompany the ninth report of the 2013-14 Session from the House of
Commons Transport Committee, “High Speed rail: on
track?”, which is going to be the subject of our new procedures
on Thursday. I asked for copies of the oral and written evidence, which
are said to be available from the Committee’s website, and the

into the matter as I was not sighted on the issue, and it sounds to me
as though the right hon. Lady has become so only very recently. I
absolutely understand that she and others might seek some enlightenment
before Thursday. It is perfectly reasonable that they should do so.
Therefore, I will look into the matter, and as and when I have anything

and emergency services across the country are feeling the pressure
caused by patients arriving at A and E departments because they feel
they have no viable alternative. The Government have been clear that
patients should be able to access good quality, out-of-hours NHS
services without having to go to A and E departments. To support that,
they have recently taken action to expand the role of GPs and to
improve out-of-hours care. They have announced nationwide pilots to
extend GP opening hours from 8 am to 8 pm, seven days a week, and
agreed a new GP contract that will give millions of elderly people a
dedicated GP who is personally accountable for their care.</hs_Para>

have also maintained that it is up to NHS commissioners to secure
high-quality services that will meet the health care needs of local
communities, driven by what is in the best interests of patients. The
Holly Hall walk-in clinic provides a vital out-of-hours service to
patients when they cannot see their GP, and many Dudley residents have
expressed their support for the centre to remain open. It is unclear
whether the out-of-hours services on which hard-working people rely
would be maintained if the centre were to close. It is therefore my
belief, and that of the petitioners, that closing the walk-in centre

see the reintroduction of safe standing at football grounds, but
tonight I would like to turn the debate on its head and argue that the
solution is the introduction of some seating at football grounds that

August 1994, clubs in the premiership and championship have been
required to provide all-seated accommodation. This followed Lord

is obvious that sitting for the duration of the match is more
comfortable than standing. It is also safer. When a spectator is seated
he has his own small piece of territory in which he can feel reasonably
secure. He will not be in close physical contact with those around him.
He will not be jostled or moved about by swaying or surging. Small,
infirm or elderly men and women as well as young children are not
buffeted, smothered or un-sighted by large and more robust people, as
on the terraces. The seated spectator is not subject to pressure of
numbers behind, nor around, him during the match. He will not be
painfully bent double over a crush barrier. Those monitoring numbers
will know exactly how many there are without having to count them in,
or assess the density by visual impression. There will still, of
course, be scope for crowd pressure on standing whilst entering and,
especially, when leaving but involuntary and uncontrolled crowd
movements occasioned by incidents at the game are effectively
eliminated…Apart from comfort and safety, seating has distinct
advantages in achieving crowd control. It is possible to have
disturbances in a seated area and they have occurred, but with the
assistance of CCTV the police can immediately zoom in with a camera and
pinpoint the seats occupied by the trouble-makers as well as the
trouble-makers

Lord Justice Taylor got it wrong was the assumption that everyone would
get used to sitting at football. At every all-seater ground, up and
down the country, persistent standing remains a part of the game every
week. That is why there have been continued calls for the introduction
of “safe standing” areas, and in March 2011 the Football
Supporters Federation launched a campaign, including an online
petition, arguing that supporters should have the choice to stand. The
campaign has gained significant momentum, so much so that at the
Football League’s annual general meeting on 7 June, more than
two thirds of the 72 clubs voted in favour of a motion to explore safe
standing trials. There is overwhelming support from supporters for the
campaign; in the FSF national supporter survey in 2009, almost 90% of
respondents believed that supporters should have the choice of sitting
or standing, with more than 50% preferring to stand. By 2012, 92% of
respondents wanted the choice, including 82% of women, even though

what is the outcome of this systematic failure, and what is the
solution? We have whole sections of grounds designed for sitting being
occupied by people who choose to stand, or who are forced to stand by
other people standing. That is particularly problematic in away
sections, where it is very common for away fans either to choose to
stand or be forced to stand by others for the entire duration of the
match. But this is not confined to specific sections of grounds where
the majority of people want to stand; it often ends up being a problem
in areas where most people would choose to sit but are forced to stand
in order to

problem is twofold: First, thousands of fans standing in areas designed
for sitting down is not as safe as it should be. I stood on the Kippax
for about 20 years without ever being injured. The only time I have
been injured at a football match was at Borussia Dortmund last season.
Having been forced to stand in an area that had been converted to
seating for the champions league, with no safety barriers, I was
knocked forward, injuring my leg on the seat in front. If there had
been barriers in front of each row—behind and in front of
me—that would not have happened, because I would not have been
knocked forwards. It might be argued that it was my
own fault for standing up, but I would not have been able to see any of
the game had I been sitting down. Nobody had the choice to sit down and

we seem to have forgotten the need for football grounds to be
accessible for all. Some people, while not confined to a wheelchair and
not considered to be disabled, are still not able to stand for a whole
game and need to sit down. Fans in that position have found it
increasingly difficult to attend away games, where there is
a consistent problem with persistent standing. Anecdotally, I am aware
of a number of people who no longer attend any away games, because they
either cannot see the game or they struggle to stand up for
90 minutes. Given how much work has taken place to encourage disabled
fans to access football, how can we possibly allow this situation to
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:30:37"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000708" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0004.htm#1312171000708">What
is the solution? In two words, it is rail seating, which is basically a
seat that is attached to a rail or barrier. Rail seats are used in many
football grounds across Europe, in countries that allow standing for
domestic matches, and then convert the standing areas to seating for
European games in line with UEFA rules on all-seater stadiums for
European matches. For domestic games, those rail seats are permanently
locked in the upright position, and everyone stands, which increases
incapacity. For European games, the seats are permanently locked in the
seat position, and the number of fans allowed into an area is one for
each seat. That system works well. It is safe and creates a great
footballing atmosphere, cheaper tickets and ensures that other areas of
the ground with standard seating are occupied by people who want to sit
down, and do not stand up and block the view of others. Such a system
was evident at Borussia Dortmund, where the area usually designated for
standing fans had everyone standing, even though it had been converted
to seating, while the areas that are permanently seated had fans
remaining seated. That is the ideal solution. It ensures the safety of
standing fans who currently stand in areas that are not designed for
standing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:32:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Unfortunately, that solution fails to address 
<?notus-xml column=593?>concerns from the police about crowd control and the perception that a
football match can be more easily policed when each spectator has a
designated
seat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:32:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000709" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0004.htm#1312171000709">Andy
Holt, the ACPO lead on football policing, has voiced opposition to
standing areas because he believes it could contribute to unruly
behaviour and hooliganism. I do not accept that assessment, and it was
also disputed by Superintendent Steven Graham of West Midlands police
who has backed the call of the Football Supporters’ Federation
for safe standing areas to be trialled. I would argue that
unruly behaviour at grounds is often a direct result of attempts to
force fans to sit
down<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:32:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000710" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0004.htm#1312171000710">The
easy solution is to designate each spectator a specific
seat-cum-standing position in the rail-seating area, in the same way as
they are currently allocated a seat. My proposal is that rail seating
should be allowed to be introduced at clubs, without the seats being
locked in either the open or closed position. That creates a seat for
each spectator in exactly the same way as any other seat in the ground.
The difference is that as well as being a seat, the rail seating
provides a safety barrier in front of each row. That means that when
people are standing up, they are safer than they currently are when
standing in existing seats. Does the Minister accept that that is the
case? I hope and assume that she does, as it is an indisputable fact
that a seat that has a safety barrier in front cannot possibly be less
safe than the current configuration with no barrier, and a barrier
between each row must make it more difficult for a spectator to be
pushed forward and over into the next row of seats.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1312171000711" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0004.htm#1312171000711">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:33:50"></hs_TimeCode>
established that that configuration must be safer, my next question is
whether the Minister believes that rail seating is currently legal, or
does she think that a change of law is required to introduce rail
seating? When I met Ruth Shaw of the Sports Grounds Safety Authority,
she tried to argue that rail seating was not allowed under the current
legislation because it provided not only a seat but a place to stand,
even if the seat is not fixed in the open or closed position. I
disagree. It is clearly no different from the seats currently used at
all football grounds that flip up and down but still provide a place to
stand if the spectator chooses not to sit down. If the Minister
disagrees with me, perhaps she could explain the difference between the
two types of seat. Of course, there is none. The only distinction is
that the rail seat is safer because it has the safety barrier in front,
so will the Minister explain to me why the SGSA is arguing against
seating that would make stadiums
safer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:35:03"></hs_TimeCode>? I
challenge her this evening to admit at the Dispatch Box that there is
no justification for the SGSA to take such a view, and ask her to give
the green light to willing clubs to introduce rail seating with a seat
for every
spectator<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:35:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000712" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0004.htm#1312171000712">My
final point is about whether there is a groundswell of opinion in
favour of introducing safer seating and making it safer for people who
continue to stand. I believe that there is. In January, in response to
my oral question, the former Sports Minister,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:35:33"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Hugh Robertson), for whom I have
great respect, argued that there was no support from the football
authorities, the police or those involved in the safety of the game for
any change. Unfortunately, that fails to recognise that the authorities
all take their lead from the politicians. Privately, most people
involved in all areas of the game from the FA to 
<?notus-xml column=594?>the police support safe standing but stick to the official line because
they believe that there is no political will for
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-16T22:36:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312171000713" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/debtext/131216-0004.htm#1312171000713">This
is not an issue of safety. I have already outlined why safety would be
enhanced rather than compromised by rail seating. It is about political
will. Politicians must wake up to the fact that standing will continue
and rail seating is the solution that will improve safety and enhance
choice for fans. That is why it is Liberal Democrat policy and why the
other parties need to recognise that the status quo cannot be allowed

suggests that it might be easier to allow clubs to choose to introduce

sections of crowds can be an issue at some football matches. Football
clubs will have ground regulations which prohibit persistent standing
in seated areas, and it is primarily the responsibility of football

£916 million of provisional new homes bonus funding for local

hope this funding will be welcomed by councils at a time when new
orders in residential construction have risen to their highest level
since 2007 according to Office for National Statistics figures
published last week<Sup>1</Sup>. This is in stark contrast to the last
Administration, when house building fell to its lowest peacetime rate
since the 1920s. Top-down regional strategies and eco-towns failed
hardworking families who aspired to own their own home, building
nothing but
resentment.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000035">As
I noted to the House in my recent answer of  2 December 2013,
<I>Official Report</I>, column 558W, the new homes bonus ensures that
those councils which promote and welcome local growth can share in its
economic benefits, and support the communities in which people want to
live and work. This money is not ring-fenced and so councils are free
to spend the bonus as they choose, including on providing new
facilities, protecting frontline services and freezing council
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000036">The
bonus is based on the council tax of additional homes (net of
demolitions) and long-term empty homes brought back into use in the
12-month qualifying period, with an additional premium for affordable
homes. The increase for 2014-15 will be paid in respect of
133,000 homes and 37,000 long-term empty properties brought
back into use. The affordable homes premium is £15 million in
respect of 42,830 new affordable
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000037">These
allocations bring the total amount of funding awarded under the new
homes bonus since it began in April 2011 to over £2.2 billion.
This total recognises delivery of almost 550,000 homes, including over
93,000 long-term empty properties brought back into use and provision
of over 160,000 affordable homes, in that period. This also reflects
the success of this Government’s comprehensive programme to get
empty homes back into productive
use.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000038">There
are many good examples of local councils using the bonus in a variety
of ways. For example, south Northamptonshire council reinvests
affordable housing premiums into new community projects. South Lakeland
district council has approved grants totalling almost £80,000 to
support projects identified by organisations across the district such
as improving footpaths, renovating buildings, and enhancing play areas.
And Test Valley borough council is delivering a new £140,000
urban sports facility for Andover, funded by a mix of developer
contributions and the new homes bonus. It has also launched a
£300,000 community asset initiative, funded from the bonus, to
support community-led projects. Other councils will simply be using the
money to help freeze council tax and/or support local
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000039">Local

change and how media companies, markets and consumers are responding.
In the debate, member states identified three key principles:
pluralism, cultural diversity and protection of minors. Most member
states agreed that over-regulation could have a negative effect on the
development of the market. The UK expressed its view that the current
regulatory framework was broadly appropriate and did not need to be
revised at this stage. However, other member states considered that the
audiovisual media services directive should be revised, in particular
to change the country of origin principle to country of destination for
regulation of audiovisual media services, and to deregulate in the
areas of advertising and quotas for European
works.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000046" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000046"><I>Sport</I></hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000047">The

<?notus-xml column=72?>benefits of adopting a more active lifestyle, and physical activity in
supporting active ageing. The Netherlands informed the Council that it
did not consider there was a sufficient cross-border element to the
issue to justify EU-level action and that it should be for the member
states to take action. Therefore, the Netherlands could not support the
recommendation. However, most member states supported the
recommendation and it was, therefore, adopted. The UK considered the

inclusion. The conclusions present sport as a tool to address the
social challenges that young people face across Europe. The Netherlands

supporting those organisations to implement and maintain high standards
of governance. In the debate all member states agreed on the importance
of good governance to maintaining integrity in sport and that sports
organisations should remain autonomous, though with Governments

copyright, and the digital agenda. He said that France would organise a
forum on Europe and culture in Paris in April 2014. France’s
proposal was welcomed by other member states and Greece indicated that
consideration of this issue would begin during the forthcoming Greek
presidency of the Council. The UK stressed that any future strategy
should not impose new restrictions on areas such as the internal

Hull and Humber city deal will build on the area’s strengths in
the energy industry. A centre of excellence for energy skills will be
established where local businesses will work with training providers to
ensure local young people are equipped with the skills they require for
careers in the energy sector and a payment-by-results system will be
introduced so that skills training providers are properly incentivised
for supporting local adults into sustainable employment or education
that furthers their careers. To provide confidence to companies wishing
to invest in developing key sites around the Humber, while ensuring the
area’s environmental assets are protected, the deal commits
statutory agencies to working together to provide a single point of
contact to potential investors. In addition, the Humber Local
Enterprise Partnership and its member local authorities have committed
to the production of a 25-year spatial plan to optimise the Humber
estuary. The city deal will also deliver a business support programme
to provide businesses with the support they require to grow. Hull and
the Humber Local Enterprise Partnership predicts that the deal will
lead to an expected £460 million of private sector investment in
development on the Humber and deliver more than 4,000 jobs, in offshore
wind related
industries.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1312168000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000082">The
Tees Valley city deal acknowledges the area’s strengths in
large-scale production, chemical and process industries. The deal will
see the Tees Valley make plans for an industrial carbon capture and
storage network, which will identify the best options for an onshore 
<?notus-xml column=78?>network, explore investment opportunities and develop a business case
for investment in industrial carbon capture and storage. In parallel,
two waste heat networks will be developed, where
waste heat from industry will be used to heat
homes, businesses hospitals and local businesses, serving to reduce
energy bills in the areas covered. The deal will benefit local
businesses through the Tees Valley Business Growth Hub, which will give
them a single point of contact for national and local business support.
Tees Valley Unlimited Local Enterprise Partnership predict that the
city deal will create 3,500 jobs and unlock £44
million of private and public sector
investment.</hs_Para><hs_6bDepartment UID="1312168000007" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000007"><DepartmentName xid="60">Education</DepartmentName></hs_6bDepartment><hs_8Statement UID="1312168000022" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/wmstext/131216m0001.htm#1312168000022">Technical

provides councils with an average spending power including Public

build up new local growth income. Average spending power including
Public Health Grant reduces by just 1.3 per cent in 2013-14. Since

application cycle shows that, as at 30 August, 369,410
applicants from the UK and overseas had been accepted for entry to
their preferred, or first choice, main scheme course offer, a higher
number than any previous year at the same point in the cycle. In
addition, a further 1,230 had obtained a place via the adjustment
route, which allows applicants to adjust to a place at another
institution if they exceed the conditions of their offer. UCAS have not
published comparable figures at constituency or county level. Final
figures for the 2013 application cycle will be published on 19
December. UCAS is an organisation independent from

Goodwill:</Member></B> The introduction of concrete barriers in the
central reserve on motorways was implemented as policy in January 2005
following research that was commissioned by the Highways Agency.
Research looked at real costs associated with all types of safety
barrier installation, maintenance and accident statistics. The research
concluded that high containment concrete safety barrier is the
preferred option, when compared to steel, 
<?notus-xml column=428?>as it has the lowest whole life cost and has a minimum life of 50 years
compared to 20 years for steel
barrier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121637000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/text/131216w0002.htm#13121637000173">The
installation of concrete barrier in the central reserve reduces
significantly the likelihood of crossover incidents, is essentially
maintenance free and is unlikely to require repairs after vehicle
impact. The accident risk to the travelling public and to road and
traffic management workers on our busy motorways is therefore
reduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121637000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/text/131216w0002.htm#13121637000174">Steel
safety barriers in the central reserve of motorways is replaced with
concrete when the steel barrier is reaching the end of its serviceable
life or when there is an opportunity to bring the central reserve up to
current standards during other maintenance or improvement

cost of implementing concrete barrier schemes vary dependent on the
design requirements such as length, road alignment, cross
section, central reserve construction, drainage requirements and
traffic management. An indicative cost for such schemes range from
£1,200 to £2,000 per

importance of ensuring that there is a robust regime in place to
control the advertising and marketing of alcohol, and in particular
that children and young people are suitably protected. Following
Ofcom's report into alcohol advertising in May this year, the
Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) launched 10 investigations into
audience data provided by Ofcom, eight of which resulted in upheld
adjudications. Separately, the body that writes the Broadcast
Advertising Code, BCAP, has been undertaking work to make sure that the
regulation that limits children's exposure to alcohol advertising
remains effective, and will set out its recommendations

ASA recently undertook a survey to find out what adverts young people
see and engage with online, and whether those complied with UK
advertising rules. Of the 427 ads seen by young people as part of the
survey, three were for alcohol (i.e. less than 1%), and these adverts,
whose content complied with the rules, were delivered to those children

increasingly valuable source of finance for the creative sector,

are emerging in the UK, and by providing alternative sources of finance
to businesses it is helping to make an important impact in the real
economy. A sub-group of the CIC is looking at improving access to

employee shareholder status, it is not feasible to determine an
estimate for the average annual tax relief to employee shareholders.
However, the overall annual cost of the reliefs is estimated at
£75 million by 2016-17. It is estimated that some 50,000 to
80,000 individuals could potentially benefit from the income tax and
national insurance contributions relief on the acquisition of shares,
and that around 20,000 to 40,000 may eventually benefit from the

the transport fuel costs of businesses. The liquefied petroleum gas

next three years and by £1.3 billion in 2016-17. Scotland
benefits as part of the UK from being able to pool resources and share
risks, so instead of needing to cut spending over the next three years
as a result of lower oil and gas revenue, the Scottish Government will
see a significant rise in its
budget.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121637000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/text/131216w0002.htm#13121637000295">The
OBR published its Economic and Fiscal Outlook on 5 December 2013. This
included their forecasts on oil and gas production and prices, which
inform their revenue forecasts, and outlined the reasons behind the
downward revisions. Their forecast over the next three years is
£7 billion lower than the Scottish Government's lowest forecast.
The Government has no plans to conduct a separate assessment of the
Scottish Government's forecast.</hs_Para>

in areas of high TB incidence. The purpose of the pilots was to test
our assumptions that controlled shooting can be carried out safely,

Maude:</Member></B> Before the last general election there was no
effective cross-government work to tackle the enormous losses to the
Exchequer from fraud and error, despite losses estimated at around
£29.6 billion a year. That's why in 2010, the Prime Minister
established a Fraud Taskforce of Ministers and officials from central
Government Departments, representatives from local authorities, the
National Audit Office and experts from the private sector. The
taskforce has since expanded to consider error, debt and grants. The
cross-government strategy to reduce public sector fraud was published
last year and is available

1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on EFS which formed the education
part of the local government finance settlement, plus various grants.
This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund
education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an
authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different
coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and a local education
authority (LEA) block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only
covers the EFS school block. LEA block items are still funded through
DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot
be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the

comparable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312172000343" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/text/131216w0003.htm#1312172000343">To

over-allocated initial teacher training (ITT) places above the number
of trainees required by our estimates. This helps us to ensure we train
enough teachers, taking account of the likely level of recruitment in

the first world war and during the inter world war years, the burying
of the deceased was traditionally a function of the Ship, Regiment or

Ministry and over the succeeding years, only a limited number of such
graves have been maintained by the Ministry of Defence. These are

the two partners from Akin Gump had refused to attend the trial to give
evidence and face cross-examination without preconditions. While this
is obviously a disappointing result, it should be noted that the case

weather station level rather than any other standard GB geography such
as ward or country level. The coverage area for each weather station is
determined by the Met Office through assessing the most appropriate
weather station for each postcode area. The boundaries of weather
station coverage areas and wards do not match exactly so some wards

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI)

disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD
equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income

In the HBAI and FRS a household is defined as a single person or group
of people living at the same address as their only or main residence,
who either share one meal together or share the living accommodation. A
household will consist of one or more benefit units. A benefit unit
(family) is defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting
couple, plus any dependent children. From January 2006 same-sex
partners (civil partners and cohabitees) are also included in the same
benefit unit. The figures above are based on household
income.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
Income calculated here includes earnings from employment and
self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private
pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax payments,
national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some
other payments are deducted from
incomes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
Households receive income from a variety of sources. The main ones are
earnings, self-employment, state support (ie benefits and tax credits),
interest on investments and occupational
pensions.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost basis. For Before
Housing Costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage
interest payments, buildings insurance payments and ground rent and
service charges) are not deducted from
income.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7.
Mean equivalised household income of individuals is found by adding up
equivalised household incomes for each individual in a population and
dividing the result by the number of
people.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">8.
Median net family income divides the number of families, when ranked by
family (benefit unit) income, into two equal-sized

Regional statistics are always presented in three-year averages as
single-year regional estimates are considered too small. Therefore

so that claimants can get timely access to the support available from

continue to promote awareness of the new arrangements. This includes
messages on the Department's telephone enquiry lines, scripts for DWP

letters, and information on the benefits pages on the www.gov.uk

taken prior to the changes being introduced included holding many

and administered by the National Offender Management Service but will,
under the Transforming Rehabilitation reforms, be delivered and paid
for by providers of probation services from across the public, private
and voluntary sectors. The proposed extension of drug testing in the
Offender Rehabilitation Bill gives the Secretary of State a
discretionary power to impose a drug testing requirement on offenders
released from custody. The Government will provide guidance but it will
be for the individual providers to decide when and how frequently to
test
offenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1312174000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131216/text/131216w0004.htm#1312174000057">There
will be costs associated with breaching offenders who test positive for
drugs following the extension of drug testing requirements. It is not
known which offenders providers will choose to test. The Offender
Rehabilitation Bill impact assessment provided an illustrative scenario
where 10% of offenders released from custody are tested, which would be
around 9,000 offenders per year. It is estimated that this could result
in around 1,000 recalls to custody per year, at a cost of around
£1 million per year but this has to be seen in the wider context

efforts to reduce reoffending. This has been informed by the Surveying
Prisoner Crime Reduction study which shows that 61% of offenders who
reported using Class A drugs in the four weeks before custody
reoffended, compared with 48% of those who reported using Class B
and/or C drugs in the four weeks before custody, and 39% who had not
used drugs in the four weeks before custody. In comparison, 30% of
those who had never used drugs reoffended.</hs_Para>

was a build up of cases at the SSCS tribunal in Kettering due to a lack
of suitable accommodation. The tribunal’s work load is often
unpredictable but HMCTS has responded quickly to put in place more
hearing rooms and more judges to increase the capacity of the tribunal.
Additional venue capacity was made available at Kettering magistrates
court in June 2012 which has led to a 300% rise in SSCS sessions in
Kettering. HMCTS has continued to target extra resources at Kettering
in order to reduce waiting times for appellants. From January 2014, an
additional day a week is being made available at the venue, which will
increase capacity by 400% overall, and which will have a positive
impact on waiting

effect on waiting times will not be immediate, especially as the oldest
cases, which can take longer to hear, are being targeted first. Older
cases are more likely to be complex and have had more than one hearing,
for example, a first hearing may have been adjourned for further
evidence to be gathered and submitted. Complex cases also often need a
longer time slot, reducing the number of cases that can be heard per
session. The impact these measures have on waiting times continues to
be monitored

registers are constructed to underpin indicators on quality of care,
and they do not necessarily equate to prevalence as may be defined by
epidemiologists. For example, prevalence figures based on QOF registers
may differ from prevalence figures from other sources because of coding
or definitional issues. It is difficult to interpret year-on-year
changes in the size of QOF registers, for example, a gradual rise in
patients on a QOF register could be due partly to epidemiological
factors (such as an ageing population) or due partly to increased case

campaigns to raise awareness on "blood in poo" as a symptom of bowel
cancer and "blood in pee" as a symptom of kidney (and bladder) cancer.
We have run local pilots for ovarian and oesophagogastric cancers. The

screening is also an important way to detect cancer early. Since it
began inviting men and women aged 60 to 69 in 2006 (now extended to men
and women aged up to 75), over 12 million home testing kits have been
returned completed as part of the NHS Bowel Cancer Screening Programme,
and over 17,500 cancers diagnosed. Public Health England is now
piloting Bowel Scope Screening (BSS), a one-off complementary screening
method to the home testing kits for men and women aged 55, with the
potential to save 3,000 lives a year. The Secretary of State's
commitment is to have the BSS programme rolled out to 60% of England by

Ellison:</Member></B> Campaigns are now the responsibility of Public
Health England (PHE). Be Clear on Cancer campaigns (encouraging symptom
recognition and earlier general practitioner (GP) presentation) have
been running since early 2011 and have covered a number of cancers
nationally and regionally; these include bowel, lung, kidney and
bladder under the common symptom of “blood in pee”,
breast, ovarian and oesophageal. There are no plans to include prostate
cancer in the campaigns but the effect of the existing campaigns does
help to encourage earlier presentation to GPs with any worrying
symptoms. The “blood in pee” campaign is also relevant as
this symptom can also be a sign of prostate cancer. Within PHE's
screening programme there is a Prostate Cancer Risk Management
Programme for the prostate one. Although not a campaign as such, the
programme also covers symptoms giving men an informed choice on whether
to have a prostate-specific antigen test.</hs_Para>
