on the part of the Scottish Government. As I said a few moments ago,
they know that the Barnett formula is something that people in the

their strategy. They identify things such as the pound, the Bank of
England and the ability to build complex warships on the Clyde, which
are the things that the people of Scotland value from being part of the

is down. Long-term unemployment is down. Unemployment among women is
down. We have talked before about 1 million more people in work under
this Government; there are now 1.2 million more in work. There should
not be one ounce of complacency, because we have still got work to do

greater stability for them, a greater ability to plan for their future,

today instead of having to be dragged to the House. Will he explain why
the further cut of, supposedly, 10% in real terms—announced by
the Chancellor in the spending round for 2015-16—is actually a
15% real cut to the settlement funding assessment? Why are the most
disadvantaged communities once again the hardest hit? Will he confirm
that by 2017 the city of Liverpool, the most deprived local authority
in the country, will have lost 62% of the Government grant it was
receiving in 2010? How on earth can he justify that? As the Audit

The bonus excess each year is financed by the redistribution of the

involves about a third of the homes that we had been planning
for—there has been a redistributional effect away from areas

Connarty</B> (Linlithgow and East Falkirk) (Lab):</Member> On a point
of order, Mr Speaker. Possibly in anticipation of the fact that I had a
question today on the post office network, I received a
message—it was not in my e-mail and I could not find it on my
computer; it came through my mobile device—from the Minister
with responsibility for postal services,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:21:56"></hs_TimeCode>
Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, the hon.
Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson). It said that it was going
to all MPs and explained that she was having to put £640 million
extra into the network reorganisation fund, on top of the £1.34
billion that was already there. My point of order relates to the fact
that this did not come through my computer and it was not in
today’s written statement from BIS. If she is going to give a
statement like that telling all MPs about a massive spending increase
because of a shortfall and the failure of her policies, which are
destroying the post office network, is she not obliged to do so in a
formal written statement or here at the Dispatch
Box?</hs_Para>

of disseminating that information to Members of the House other than by
purely electronic means. If that did not happen, I understand that
there may be some disappointment on that front. It is not something I
can pursue further today, but in response to his inquiry I think I have
put the point clearly on the record as to what ordinarily is expected.

personnel on lower incomes have access to low-cost loans and other
low-cost financial services and, as a result, are not vulnerable to
high-interest payday loan businesses. I should declare at the outset

unions are financial co-operatives. They are one powerful demonstration
of how through pooling our efforts and through co-operation with
others, we can each become better off. Those of us who champion credit
unions have always believed that what makes them different from other
financial services providers is not just the lower interest rates they
offer, but their mission to operate for the benefit of their
communities, to retain money in local economies and
to empower people, especially those often unable to access credit
elsewhere. Key to credit unions is a common bond between the members,
who in turn are the investors and consumers—indeed, they can
also serve as directors. It is, in essence, about people in the same
community looking out for each other but benefiting directly themselves
from a service that they are able to provide
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000329" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0001.htm#13121855000329">As
many in this House will recognise, many successful credit unions are
already operating in the UK: the police credit union has 21,000
members, has been going for 10 years and has Lord Stevens, the former
head of the Metropolitan police, as its president; the former British
Airways credit union, which is now known as Plane Saver and covers more
than just British Airways, has more than 7,500 staff as members; and
the London mutual credit union, with its origins in Southwark, has more
than 15,000 member owners, and offers competitive online and affordable
payday loan services. For a 30-day, £400 payday loan, the LMCU
charges, typically, an interest rate of 27%, or £19. For the
same loan, a commercial payday loan company might charge an annual
percentage rate of 5,600%, or £127. In short, it might be
£108 more expensive for the same amount over the same period.
That shows the kind of service that should specifically be available to
our servicemen and women, and their families: a low-cost credit union.
Only a credit union—a financial co-operative—would be
able to offer such a service.</hs_Para>

specifically draws inspiration from the biggest and most successful
credit union in the world. A rear-admiral of the US navy and former
commander of the American enterprise battle group is probably not the
most obvious enthusiast for financial co-operatives, yet Rear-Admiral
Cutler Dawson is president and chief executive officer of Navy Federal,
the world’s largest credit union. It is based in the United
States and serves all Department of Defence and Coast Guard active 
<?notus-xml column=762?>duty, civilian and contractor personnel, and their families.
Rear-Admiral Dawson previously served in the United States navy for
some 34 years.</hs_Para>

was founded by its members in 1933, when soldiers returning from war
were unable to access affordable credit. It now offers a service to US
special forces, navy cooks, veterans and the families of servicemen and
women. In the US, payday lenders used to target military bases, trying
to hook American sailors and soldiers with their high-cost financial
services, yet Navy Federal is able to offer some of the most highly
competitive financial services in the US market. Indeed, Navy Federal
now holds some $55 billion in assets, and has some 4 million
members, 235 branches around the world and a work force of more than
11,000 employees. Surely our soldiers, sailors, airmen and women, and
their families, could benefit from a similar credit union.</hs_Para>

to address the growing fears that low-paid service personnel are having
to turn to payday loan companies to get through the last week of each
month. Research by the Royal British Legion found that about a third of
veterans, including almost half of the recently injured, experience
financial difficulties, leading many into unaffordable levels of debt.
The RBL’s dedicated benefits and money advice service helped
some 2,500 people in its first year, 2007, but last year that figure
rose to more than 11,000 Army personnel being helped out, and the RBL
predicts that the figure will keep
rising.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0001.htm#13121855000333">We
know from the Debt Advice Foundation that one in four people who take
out payday loans need the money to buy food or essentials, with 44%
using them to pay off other debts. Similarly, Citizens Advice research
has shown a fourfold rise in just two years in the number of people
coming to their citizens advice bureau with debt problems as a result
of taking out payday loans. I have spoken to the chief executives of
many citizens advice bureaux located close to military bases and I have
heard about some of our soldiers and sailors who are facing real
financial difficulties. One serving Army soldier who was living in MOD
accommodation with his wife and children had two payday loans, one for
£435 and one for £375, both due for payment at the
beginning of the month. If he failed to repay the loans in full, he
incurred an £80 charge for deferring them. He was in a vicious
circle. If he repaid the loans, he was left without sufficient funds to
finance his monthly expenditure and again had to take out a payday loan
to manage until the end of the month.</hs_Para>

is a story that many of us will have heard time and again in our own
constituency surgeries—a small loan that, through huge interest
rates, gets bigger and bigger. Of course it is true that families
across the UK are feeling the pinch, and we need a major expansion in
the promotion of and access to credit unions across the UK. A levy on
the profits of the payday lenders could help to drive that expansion of
low-cost financial services that credit unions offer. I hope the House
will recognise that serving personnel and veterans face particular
challenges. Surely it is time to inject new energy into the credit
union market and take the steps necessary to address this particular
problem for our soldiers and

in this matter from the Ministry of Defence, but I say gently that it
is at best tentative. Ministers need to show more enthusiasm and energy

<?notus-xml column=763?>this most basic of services that our troops should be able to expect.
When US soldiers, sailors and marines are on active service duty, they
can focus on their day job without worrying about their financial

bring into our debate today the voices of those A and E nurses,

back to the

a private ambulance which did not appear to have adequately trained
staff to take patients to
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:36:15"></hs_TimeCode>. A
community nurse spoke of her frustration at spending an hour and a half

up in A and E. Surely we can do better than

want to set the record straight about the 2004 contract and dismiss the
myths that have been put about. The fact is that it gave the public
much quicker and more convenient access to GPs and relieved the
pressure on A and E. Let me explain the changes it made. First, it
created the ability to add an incentive to allow patients to book an
appointment several days ahead. Members might recall Tony Blair being
challenged on that very point during a live TV debate before the 2005
general election. As a result, he brought forward a new measure to give
people that ability to plan ahead. Secondly, it created incentives for
GPs to offer evening and weekend opening. Thirdly, it allowed the
previous Government to offer people a new guarantee of a GP appointment
within two working days. And it worked. In 1997 only half of patients
could get an appointment within 48 hours, but by 2005 nine out of 10
patients could do so. As a result, A and E was performing much better
than it had been in 1997.</hs_Para>

happened since? This Government have scrapped all those measures to
improve patient access and convenience. They removed the right set out
in the NHS constitution to an appointment within two days, stating that
it was no longer a priority. It might not be a priority for them, but
let me tell them that it remains a high priority for my constituents
and those of my hon. Friends. This is the simple truth that they do not
like to admit: it has got harder to get a GP appointment under this
Prime Minister and this Government. People who call their surgery early
in the morning only to be told that nothing is available now know
why.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000380" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000380">There
are now 854 fewer GP practices in England offering evening and weekend
openings than there were in July 2009. The Patients Association has
found that six out of 10 people said they could not see a GP for at
least two days and four out of 10 said they could not book an
appointment for at least two days in advance. All that is leading to
some people turning straight to A and E and others getting sicker while
they wait and then arriving in A and E as a more serious
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000381" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000381">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T13:51:48"></hs_TimeCode>

getting worse on his watch. He has presided over the worst year in A

consider making urgent changes to NHS 111 and putting nurses and

across the NHS tells us that the cut-price model of call handlers with

“Call an ambulance or go to A and E.” The sensible change

is the centrepiece of what I want to say today—given the
evidence to show that the 48-hour guarantee worked to divert people
from A and E, there is a clear case for reintroducing it this winter.
It is true that GPs might not be so keen on it, but it was valued by
patients, and that is the most important thing. The Secretary of State
needs to listen to what people are saying about their difficulties in
getting an appointment in office hours, not in out-of-office hours. He
must do something to address that. Will he divert some of the funding
that he has made available to meet A and E pressures to that purpose,
or indeed will he reclaim some of the funding he has handed back to the
Treasury? It is so important that people can get appointments when they
need them.</hs_Para>

the Secretary of State will not accept them, he needs to put forward
other suggestions of his own to help people get access to good advice

straight answers from the Secretary of State. It has got harder to get
a GP appointment on his watch and people want to know what he is going
to do about it. A and E is getting worse and worse on his watch and

He asked me to give him some answers, so he should just listen. He
threw out numerous statistics, but let us look at the facts he chose
not to mention. First, given that A and E departments across the United
Kingdom face similar demographic challenges and have similar structures
and targets, a comparison with Wales is instructive, not least because,

<?notus-xml column=771?>with a Labour-run Government, it is following policies that are closer
to those that he favours. The most recent full-month data available for
both countries show that England hit the target, with 95.7%, but Wales
missed it, with 90.4 %. Last year, England hit the target, with 95.9%,
but Wales missed it, with 87.7%. In fact, Wales has missed it every
single year since 2009. He also talked about ambulance times. In
October, the figure for England was 74.6%, and for Wales
65.2%.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman used some strong language. He talked about complacency
and crisis. Will he now demonstrate that those comments were not
shallow point scoring by making the same criticisms of Labour in Wales?
If not, the House will see those comments for what they are: a hollow
attempt to turn an operational challenge—one that he faced, that
I face, and indeed that all Health Secretaries face—into a
political argument regardless of the impact on patients or staff.
Vulnerable people are relying on our emergency services this winter, so
to whip up fear and run down performance, as he has done, is frankly

should be more extensive services outside hospital, and this, too, will

still to come.

a time of funding pressures that are causing real pain, how expensive
those offices were, situated in the middle of Manchester. Imagine my
surprise, Madam Deputy Speaker, when Healthwatch Wigan found through a
series of Freedom of Information Act requests that the total cost of
the Healthier Together programme in Greater Manchester to date has been
£3 million, with £1.3 million of that spent on
third-party organisations. The NHS would not reveal who or what that
money was spent on. To date, the programme could, in total, have paid
for 90 new nurses, 20 A and E doctors or 9,000 bed days at
Wigan infirmary. Instead, this hugely expensive programme has caused
huge anxiety across my local area, and communication has been dire. I

at least half an hour by car. What the Minister may not know or
understand is that many of my constituents do not have cars or the
money to take several buses or use public transport. Our borough
typically has large, tightly knit families. When someone’s

point about this crisis not being anything unusual. The
Government’s own Health and Social Care Information Centre has
published figures showing that the number of visits to A and E
departments in England has risen by 11% in four years to 21.5 million
attendances, which is 60,000 a day. The numbers are clearly increasing,

25% of the NHS budget will be spent on diabetes by 2025. I am sorry,

Doctors came to us politicians and said that, if we reconfigured

more lives. I took the view before the general election that the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:46:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Lady
about the proposed reconfiguration in south-west London and about St
Helier hospital. Whether that will ever happen is still up in the
air—let us hope that it does not. A leap of faith was demanded
of constituents across south-west London, not least because the plans
did not contain any measures to improve out-of-hospital care, without
which it would not be possible to achieve the changes to emergency
services that were being proposed. Those points are part of this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:47:08"></hs_TimeCode>, which is
primarily about whether there is a crisis and, if there is, what the
nature and causes of it might be. Although the Labour motion
acknowledges that there are many causes of the problem, it has a very
simplistic
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000505" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000505">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>
evidence shows that there is a mixed picture across the country. That
is reflected in the allocation of the first wave of additional funding
for the NHS to meet winter pressures. That funding went to the health
economies that were the most challenged. Some are coping well with the
seasonal change from the higher volume, but less complex A and E
attendance pattern of the spring and summer to the winter pattern of
fewer, but much more complex cases, which often involves more frail and
older people, and leads to more admissions.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:48:40"></hs_TimeCode> pattern is
repeated year on year and the demographic changes continue year on

professional opinion on why that would not be good for patients. I will

that the average number of diagnosed conditions for patients admitted
from A and E has increased over the past five years. In other words,
the medical needs of people attending A and E are getting more complex,
and that impacts on the amount of time people spend in A and E
departments. Therefore, the answer is not one simple solution but must
be a combination of actions. Much of that needs to be centred in
primary and social care, as well as mental health services. In primary
care we must recognise that it is not just about GP services and that
we need best practice around the country, for example in engaging

the current situation in Trafford and some of the lessons that
Ministers might want to learn from the transition we went through when
the A and E department at Trafford general hospital was downgraded to
an urgent care centre and closed overnight. Despite assurances that
neighbouring accident and emergency services at Manchester royal
infirmary and Wythenshawe hospital would be able to cope following that
change, problems are already piling up. Those problems may not have
been caused wholly—or perhaps at all—by the changes at
Trafford, but the impact on Trafford patients is pretty dire and we

departments were already exceptionally busy, with the one at
Wythenshawe working well beyond capacity. It was built to accommodate
70,000 patients a year but was already dealing with more than 100,000,
as my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East (Paul
Goggins) pointed out from the outset. We welcome the fact that the
Department now appears to have unlocked a route to additional funding
for capacity at Wythenshawe, but that funding, let alone the additional
capacity, is not yet in place.</hs_Para>

Minister will know, in the past couple of weeks Wythenshawe A and E has
reached “black” status for waiting times, and privately
there are indications that the quarter 3 target for waiting times at
the hospital will not be met. There are also reports that waiting
queues for ambulances are doubling outside Wythenshawe hospital, and
pressures are mounting at Manchester royal infirmary. The other day a
constituent told me that she had visited on the evening of Sunday 8
December with her diabetic daughter and there were not even enough
seats for waiting patients. Some people were forced to wait
outside.</hs_Para>

pressures were predicted. Last year, Manchester royal infirmary and
Wythenshawe hospital struggled to meet waiting time targets, and indeed
failed to meet them on at least one occasion in 30 out of 35 weeks. The

<?notus-xml column=788?>Secretary of State was clearly concerned about the pressures on those
hospitals because one criterion he set down for the reconfiguration of

consistently meet waiting times before the changes were

of performance in the two summer quarters, the NHS asserted that the
criterion on waiting times at those hospitals had been met, despite
warnings from many people—including me—that not measuring
performance during the winter months would give a distorted picture of
the capacity of those hospitals to cope. The Minister must recognise
that that caused a great collapse of public confidence—they were
not very confident about the proposals for the reconfiguration
anyway—because it seemed that fudging was going on to present an
impression that hospital services could cope, when it then turned out
they could not. To use data that are clearly applied in a way that
suits the outcome NHS managers want, rather than being in the best
interests of patients, is a matter of great concern. Will the Minister
say how we can have genuine and robust criteria for reconfigurations in
which the public can have confidence? The total absence of clarity and
the fudging over the decision at Trafford over the past few weeks has
had an unfortunate effect.</hs_Para>

first is the way that funding fails to take adequate account of
deprivation. Secondly, there will inevitably be a hump at the time of
transition, as new arrangements settle down and people adapt to the
changing service configuration. When providing resources to Manchester
royal infirmary or Wythenshawe, no account seems to have been taken of
the effect of that transition and the likely need for additional
resource to take those hospitals through that period. Indeed, in a
private meeting with the Secretary of State, after the reconfiguration
was announced, he confirmed that there would be no additional
transitional funding. I could, however, look forward to additional
funding to enable greater integration of services, although not until

ties in with local information. I asked my A and E doctors at the
Lancaster royal infirmary to give me figures for the past few years.
They say that the number of new patients attending A and E decreased
between 1989 and 1993 and steadied at about 35,000 admissions a year
until 1999, when the number increased rapidly. The figures are clear.
There were 35,000 A and E admissions in 1999; 36,000 in 2000; and
37,000 in 2001. There was an increase of 1,000 in every single year to
2007. Funnily enough, there was a 3,000 increase in A and E
attendances from 2006 to 2007. The latest figures I have are for 2011,
when there were 52,500 attendances. The increase did not happen
yesterday but continually over that period, for all the reasons hon.

other side of the problem is the training and retention of A and E
specialists. We have all heard stories of vacancies in A and E
departments. I understand that it was announced today that Wales is 15%
down on A and E specialists. One reason is that working in A and E is
hard, and there is evening and weekend work, so people move to other
specialisms. To increase retention, we need to recognise the work of A
and E specialists, which might mean through salaries. We need to give
A and E specialists the recognition they deserve to keep
them in those
posts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000539">The

that when the Prime Minister wanted to detoxify the Tory brand, he said
that he could spell out his priorities in three

did a survey across Chesterfield this summer and spoke to people about
a range of issues, as I did back in 2009. Back then, satisfaction with
the NHS was clear, but now 37% say that GP services have got worse, and

<?notus-xml column=791?>just 12% say they have got better. Only 8% say that they think the NHS
has got better since 2010; almost 50% think it is getting

want to focus on the part of the motion that deals with the difficulty
of accessing GP services, which is one of the primary causes of those
figures. Some 42% of people who appear in A and E have
previously attempted to contact GP services. Hon. Members might
remember my raising the case of Jemma Hill on 22 October with the
Secretary of State. Her GP referred her to a specialist, who
recommended hip arthroscopy surgery. She was then told that her
clinical commissioning group would not fund the surgery. The Secretary
of State promised to look into the matter if I wrote to him. I wrote to
him on 23 October but still there is no response. Jemma Hill is still
in agony. She sees a fragmented national health service leaving her
behind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000543">The
problems in the NHS, and in GP services in particular, are acute in the
Staveley. A recent Care Quality Commission report found that the
Rectory Road and Grange health centres failed on five different
criteria. I surveyed almost every house in Middlecroft and Inkersall,
which are parts of Staveley, and had hundreds of responses. Eighty-six

poor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000544">I
have here some of the comments of the people who responded. One says,
“I don’t bother going to the doctors anymore. I could
never get an appointment. I simply self-diagnose on Google.”
Someone else said that they are entirely dependent on locums, meaning
that when their scans or results come back, the GP is not there. One
patient said that a GP broke down in tears in front of them. Another
patient said that no one had contacted them after their blood test
results. In fact, they should have been urgently sent to
hospital—subsequently, they discovered they had
cancer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000545">One
person said that they waited eight weeks for a GP appointment. When
they eventually got one, they were told that they had a hernia and were
sent straight to hospital. Another person waited two weeks for an
appointment for a repeat prescription, meaning that they did not have
their prescription for more than a week. One 90-year-old said that they
had to get a taxi to the surgery and had to queue outside at 8
o’clock in the
morning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000546" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000546">I
met a partner at that GP surgery to talk about the GP crisis. They said
that they are desperately struggling to recruit people. There is a
widespread GP recruitment crisis. I was told that a huge number of GPs
have retired, either because they are disillusioned or simply because
they want to get out of the service. Forty-three per cent. of GPs told
a <I>Pulse</I> survey that they will retire earlier than they had
intended because of how disillusioned they
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000547" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000547">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:09:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy) spoke about the massive
impact the Government’s cuts to care services have had on A and
E, but there is also a huge crisis in general practice. The people of
Staveley, and people across the country, do not have proper access to a
GP service. The problem is getting worse and it is exacerbating the
problem in A and E. The people suffering are not only the brave heroes
who work so hard in the national health service, but those in the most
deprived communities in our constituencies. It is a disgrace.</hs_Para>

Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), and the current Secretary of State,
with the usual antics of carefully selected and spun statistics thrown
at each other. Those expectations were not disappointed. This issue is
not helped by being dragged into the gutter of partisan politics. The
fact is that the A and E crisis—if there is indeed an A and E
crisis—has existed and has been endemic in the NHS before and
after 2010. This is largely the result of A and E being seen as an
issue that somehow needs to be treated separately and not part of an
integrated NHS. Before 2010, there were ambulances queuing outside the
A and E in my constituency and in the Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust in
Truro. The problem exists. From time to time, there will be those kinds
of pressures. Those pressures are created by a whole set of things that
are not entirely the fault of a failing A and E
service.</hs_Para>

aspect of unscheduled care in Cornwall that I raised with the former
Secretary of State is the out-of-hours GP service. The previous Labour
Government were perfectly happy to see that service put out to tender
and privatised, and we saw a fragmented unscheduled care service. I
reported the Serco out-of-hours GP service to the CQC, because it was
simply putting profit before patients by manipulating statistics to
make the outcomes appear better than they were. It was announced last
week that Serco will be handing that contract back early. I hope that
that will result in an integration of unscheduled out-of-hours care, as
that is the kind of thing we need to do. This is not an issue that
should be subject to party political point scoring, because that

intervention on

Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow) spelled out the
theme of integration. Unscheduled care includes not only A and E, but
minor injuries units, urgent care services, the 111 service, the
ambulance service, the out-of-hours GP service, GP surgeries
themselves, and, indeed, GP walk-in centres, which the previous
Government created. Significant confusion is created about where the
general public are supposed to take themselves if they have an urgent
need for medical attention. We really need to find ways to integrate
those unscheduled services in a way that does not result in the
fragmentation that bedevils the service at present.</hs_Para>

prevention, often in acute hospitals planned work cannot go ahead
because patients cannot be discharged from hospital and other patients
cannot be admitted 
<?notus-xml column=793?>because there are insufficient beds. The health service is not
integrated, because there are insufficient community beds and the
primary care service is struggling and stretched to the limit, unable
to provide the kind of care for people in their homes and community
hospitals that would avoid them ending up in hospital as emergency
cases. Those are the two themes: further integration of the service,
which is not helped by the Health and Social Care Act 2012, and
significant investment in preventive care and primary
care.</hs_Para>

care trust, when we had one, axed the pilot of an active case
management scheme for people with long-term conditions. Those things
were done under the umbrella of NHS efficiency savings, but they
achieve the opposite. More older people will not be receiving

conclusion, £2.68 billion has been cut from adult social care

people will lose care. That will put pressure on their health and that

integration transformation fund, but there is no new money in that
fund—none at all. Health Ministers need to think again about the
impact that cuts in social care are having on the NHS. Pooling budgets
with the same amount of money in the integration fund will not help.
They need to deal with the crisis in A and E staffing and try to make
it a career that people want to go into. As the motion states, they
need to restore the 48-hour appointment guarantee. I support the

Northumberland, we feel that we are leading the way in health care
provision. Begun under the previous Government, that has continued

olden days would have been shut, but which now is being rebuilt as an
integrated NHS and local authority facility. It is the first of its
kind in the country, it is utterly transformative and it is exactly
what the NHS and the local authority should be doing with old
buildings, although I urge the trust to resolve the contracts that are
not yet resolved. When I visited it last week, however, I saw that it

A and E is also a fantastic building. This November, I worked there as

Cramlington, an innovative, pre-Keogh assessment health care centre

As an A and E specialist care facility, it is exactly what Keogh is

however, at least 10% to 20% of the population do not take up the flu

the past 18 months, the A and E department at the James Cook university

problems with handover times, with ambulances and paramedics
waiting up to two and a half hours to admit patients,
despite the national target time being 15 minutes. I raised
this matter last year with the Secretary of State for Health, who
agreed that the situation was completely unacceptable, and

addition to the issues I raised with the Secretary of State, it became
evident that James Cook’s A and E department struggled to manage
with the pressure that winter placed on it. In January and February,
South Tees Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust failed to meet its target of
seeing 95% of A and E patients within four hours. With James Cook so
clearly overstretched, I was surprised to discover in September that
the Secretary of State decided not to award it, or any other hospital
trust in the north-east, funding to alleviate pressures on A
and E. It struck me as beyond belief that of the £250
million he awarded to 53 trusts, not a penny was to reach the
north-east. Thankfully, following pressure

to that letter, our ambulance service will see more cuts, more private

this, but the chief operating officer of the North East ambulance

region, costing £86,118. In 2009-10, there were 1,816 call-outs,
costing £151,112. In 2010-11, however, there were 6,429 such
call-outs, costing £477,575. In 2011-12, there were 9,034 of

have to say, however, that people outside listening to some Government
Members’ contributions will think that they simply do not get
it. They simply do not understand how hard it is to get a GP
appointment; they do not understand the real issues facing their own
local A and E departments; and they do not understand the pressures
hitting the NHS in England. I politely suggest that they do what the

such extraordinary and professional care. We have a work force who are
completely dedicated and caring, but the House should be in absolutely

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:35:10"></hs_TimeCode>The Secretary of
State may wish that Labour Members had short memories, but we remember
the summer news reports of ambulances queuing outside hospitals with
unacceptably long waits, and some people even having to be treated in
tents erected in car parks, while the Secretary of State and his
Ministers buried their heads in the sand and the Secretary of
State’s “Crisis, what crisis?” strategy
unravelled. Labour Members highlighted those problems, as would have
been expected of us

we are seeing in A and E is also the culmination of three and a half
years of mismanagement of our NHS, with a needless top-down
reorganisation and the waste of billions of pounds that could and
should have been spent on front-line care. It is little wonder that, as
we discovered last week, 79 A and E departments missed the
Government’s own targets.</hs_Para>

we have heard in the debate, the reasons for the crisis are many and
complicated, but it is on the lack of access to GPs’ services
that we have focused today. Surely no amount of spin can hide the fact
that this Government have made it harder to obtain an appointment to
see a GP. All Members will know of constituents who have had to phone
their doctors only to be told that no appointments are available and
that they should ring back the next day, which they do, only to
experience the same problem

it not obvious to all—except, seemingly, the Secretary of State
and his Ministers—that many patients who phone the surgery at 9
am and find it impossible to obtain an appointment will turn to A and E
for help? That is not just my conclusion. According to an analysis
carried out for the Department of Health, 42% of A and E attenders had
attempted to contact their GPs beforehand, and researchers at Imperial
College London found that patients who were able to see their GPs
within 48 hours made fewer visits to A and
E<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:37:35"></hs_TimeCode>

are some inconvenient truths that the Minister and other Government
Members need to consider. First, by the time Labour left office, 98% of
patients were being seen within four hours at A and E departments.
Secondly, by May 2010 more than three quarters of the general practices
in England offered extended opening hours at weekends and in the
evenings. It is also clear that Labour’s achievement in widening
access to primary care is being undone on this Government’s
watch: data released by the Health and Social Care Information Centre
have revealed that 854 fewer general practices now offer extended
opening hours than was the case in
2009<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:38:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121855000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855000597">The
truth is that now, during evenings and at weekends, many people are
left with no alternative but to go to A and E because of this
Government’s actions. It was this Government who cut funding for
extended opening hours for GPs’ surgeries, it was this
Government who scrapped Labour’s guarantee that patients would
be able to obtain an appointment with a GP within 48 hours,
and it is this Secretary of State who shows not one degree of regret
for those actions: actions that have piled more unnecessary pressure on
A and E departments and more misery on patients, at the very time when
they need the NHS to help them.</hs_Para>

wonder things are going so wrong so quickly. To put it simply, under
this Secretary of State and under this Prime Minister, it has become
harder, not easier, to see a doctor, and as a result more people are
heading 
<?notus-xml column=800?>towards A and E.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:39:48"></hs_TimeCode> more
evidence do Ministers need that A and E departments in England are
under real pressure and that action is needed now to prevent them from
struggling further over the winter months? Their confusion has been
laid bare today for all to see. In three weeks, they have gone from
“Crisis, what crisis?” to “The crisis is behind
us.” It does not sound as though the Secretary of State is in
control; people will struggle to take reassurance from his mixed
messages. The problems in A and E have the fingerprints of the
Secretary of State and the Prime Minister all over them. The components
of the A and E crisis might be complex, but the real cause is very
simple: you just cannot trust the Tories with the national health
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:40:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13121855001528" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0002.htm#13121855001528">3.40

notes that over the last three years prices have risen faster than

factors in the rising resort to foodbanks are rising living costs and
stagnant wages, as well as problems including delays to social security
payments and the impact of the under-occupancy penalty; calls on the
Government to publish the results of research into foodbanks
commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
which Ministers promised would be made public in the summer of 2013;

dependency on foodbanks, including a freeze on energy prices, a water

it is. It is very clear that the Government are determined to hide the

embarrassed by the truth, but they should come clean, so I say to the

without the Government’s hidden report, the reasons for the rise
in food bank use is clear: it is the cost of living crisis facing
householders up and down the country; it is because even as we finally
see some growth in parts of the economy after three years of failure,
that growth is not being shared fairly. Last week’s Office for
National Statistics figures were clear: average earnings have risen by
less than the rate of inflation for the fifth year running. Figures
published alongside the autumn statement showed that real wages will
have fallen by 5.8% by the end of this Parliament.

4.3%—all up by more than inflation. We know from DEFRA’s
own annual family food statistics, published last week, that families
on the lowest incomes spent 22% more on food in 2012 than five years
ago. Those families were already spending the largest share of their
income on food. The consequence is that families have been forced to
trade down, with a third switching to economy brands. A quarter of
those on low incomes are now buying less fresh fruit, with one in five
families buying fewer fresh vegetables, which means poorer nutrition

charity’s network of food banks has helped half a million
people, a third of whom were children. The reasons for that are clear:
the rising cost of living, caused by rising prices that have
outstripped falling and stagnant wages; the Government’s
unwillingness to stand up to vested interests in the energy and water
companies; their unwillingness to take action on the lack of available

on energy prices while we reset the market, a water affordability
scheme and tough new powers for Ofwat to cut bills, measures to end the
abuses of zero-hours contracts, Make Work Pay contracts that reduce
company’s tax bills to incentivise

four-year-olds from 15 hours to 25 hours a week to help
working parents, and the abolition of the bedroom tax. That is how we,
a one-nation Labour Government, will address the scandal of food
poverty in our country. That is how we will once again reduce and then
remove the need for food aid and the reliance on food banks in our

us be honest. The Trussell Trust saw what was happening in 2000. It
looked at the evolving problem that was caused by personal debt,
overspending and people living beyond their means. It set up the first
food bank in that year and the food bank network in 2004. The number of
food banks had grown tenfold by 2010. Most startlingly, when those food
banks started, Labour did not want to know why. When they grew tenfold,
Labour did not want to know why.</hs_Para>

housing and our skills base, and enable the food system itself to

final verdict on any Government is based on how they treat the poorest
in society during the hardest of times. The rise in the need for food
banks is a horrifying indictment of this Government’s record,
and it demands urgent action. The complacency of those on the
Government Front Bench and of Ministers in the other place is as
distasteful and unedifying as anything I have 
<?notus-xml column=821?>ever witnessed in Parliament. In July, Lord Freud seemed to suggest that
the increase in the number of people using food banks was simply a
result of the increased prevalence of the food banks. He claimed that
he did not know which came first: supply or demand. He also claimed
that there was an infinite demand for what he called “free
goods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:00:27"></hs_TimeCode>”.
In order to access the services of a food bank, a person or family
needs to be referred by health services, local authorities or other
groups that look after their welfare. I am not going to try to
second-guess what was going on in the Minister’s mind, but he
seemed to be implying that there was somehow an ambition to reach
hardship, and a desire and aim for people to reach poverty in order to
get a free basket of shopping to get them to the end of the

better inform the parties opposite on how food banks actually operate,
I shall give them a quick rundown. People who are forced to turn to
food banks can receive help only a limited number of times. They go to
the local food bank not to do their full weekly shop but because they
need the bare essentials in order to get by. Many of those people will
already have made extremely difficult decisions, such as whether to sit
in a cold room rather than go hungry. There is no more harrowing
example of that than the fact that one in five mothers in the UK

crisis has been pretending that there is some magic wand: that prices
can be declared to be lower; that wages can be declared to be higher;
and that if only Labour Members were on the Government Benches the
state would be responsive and in times of crisis would quickly leap in.
That is not true now, it was not true 33 years ago and it
will not be true in the future. It is essential that things such as
food banks step in, but I am encouraged by things such as the community
store, which go further and make this kind of mutuality and
co-operative approach—this charitable endeavour—much more
sustainable by making inexpensive food available to the working

banks have come rather late to my constituency, but I really welcome
them. I went to the New Life church in Llandrindod Wells and was very
impressed by the number of volunteers who were working there. They were
members of the church and other volunteers who had gone there
particularly to distribute food. I then went on to Tesco. I do not
often compliment Tesco on its work, but on this matter it was doing
very good work indeed. The church had a stall near the store’s
exit and people were encouraged to donate some of the food they had
bought. I was overwhelmed by the generosity of people—some of
whom were on low incomes themselves—who were prepared to give a
little away in order to help others. Tesco also made a 30%

the Government where their policies have made this position much, much
worse. We may not yet understand the basic forces to which we may want
to apply policies, but the Government could raise questions about their
own policies and ask how they are impoverishing people. I hope the
reason for the absence of the whole of the DWP ministerial team is that
it is thinking about what sort of reply it is going to give to this

that if people are worried about not being able to meet their rent or
that their electricity will be cut off, and there is the possibility of
people giving them food, they will take that opportunity so that they

ought to get an answer to that. Secondly, if we listen to the food
banks and the other bodies that are handsomely filling the ranks of
those giving help in our society, they say the two things that are
increasingly important in driving people to food banks are the
sanctions regime and the sheer incompetence of the DWP in relaying
benefits. Could the Minister—whoever it is and wherever they

will a twofold instruction go out from this Government? First, will
they ensure that anybody who has waited for more than a week for their
benefit gets an advance on the benefit they are entitled to? No one is
disputing that it will be clawed back later. That would abate some of

right hon. Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field), may I commend to the House
the report published by the Church Urban Fund in September, entitled
“Hungry For More: How churches can address the root causes of
food poverty”, which can be found at www.cuf.org.uk/research?
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T17:40:46"></hs_TimeCode> part of their
mission to the communities they serve and as part of their mission as
the national Church, thousands of parish churches around the country
play an active role in their local community, including by running food
banks, the majority of which have been set up in the past two years.
The report suggests that if churches are to contribute to a long-term
solution to food poverty, there is a need to rebalance church-based

the situation is to be resolved, the root causes need to be tackled. In
April, an online survey was sent to 3,000 Church of England incumbents.
In that survey, the Church Urban Fund asked clergy in parishes right
across the country questions about their perceptions of food poverty
and what was going on in their parishes. The respondents were invited
to indicate what they considered the causes of food poverty, based on
their experience of running food banks. These figures come to more than
100% because some clergy selected more than one topic, but 62% chose
low income, 42% chose benefit changes and 35% chose benefit delays. As
it happens, these three issues match those identified by the
Trussell Trust as the most common reasons for food bank
referrals last year. It is also worth noting that some
respondents believed that individual behaviour was a contributing
factor, with 27% selecting poor household budgeting as a significant
cause of food  poverty.</hs_Para>

a huge cost of living crisis because of the downward pressure on wages.
Increasingly, people in work, and people on benefits, are turning up at
food banks because of a series of social security cuts implemented by
the Department for Work and Pensions. The food banks in my constituency
report increased usage because of the bedroom tax, and not just for
food parcels—people who have had to move into private rented
accommodation but do not have the appropriate furniture are going to
food banks that provide furniture. Food banks report increased usage
because of sanctions, delays in appeals and delays in benefit
decisions. The Atos centre in my constituency does not have suitable
disabled access, so people on employment and support allowance have to
go to either Nottingham or Birmingham for their assessment. They cannot
afford to do that, so they end up going without the ESA they deserve

for the voluntary sector will be responding to this debate, not a
Minister from the Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs—he will undertake to produce that study, so that both
sides of the House can study it. I hope he will also tell us—I
am sure the officials in the Box have the statistics—whether the
Government, in their considered view, think that demand for food banks
will increase or decrease in 2014 and 2015. That would be an
interesting statistic and I look forward to the Minister outlining that

Friend the Member for Torfaen (Paul Murphy) said earlier that food
banks demonstrate both the good and the bad in our modern society. I
want to thank all the volunteers who have made a success of food banks
in my constituency, and I refer specifically to the North Liverpool
food bank, which has 90 volunteers who see about 150 people a week. It
opened two years ago in November 2011, and now has eight separate
distribution centres in north Liverpool, including in my constituency,
in Croxteth and Norris Green. Norris Green is the council ward in
Liverpool that has the largest number of households directly affected
by the bedroom tax—more than 1,000 households in that single
ward—which the food bank tells me is one reason for the
increased uptake.</hs_Para>

belief that much of the problem is caused by errors in benefit payments
is shared by Citizens Advice Scotland, which reports that 73% of the
people using food banks cite problems with their welfare payments, that
30% are experiencing delays in getting the payment to which they are
entitled, and that 22% are the subject of jobseeker’s allowance
sanctions. However, people who have been sanctioned make up less than a
quarter of those who are using food banks. All too commonly, people are
using them because they have fallen on hard times through no fault of
their own. People are still falling ill and losing their jobs as a
result, only to face a long delay in getting any benefit. Those delays
have got worse in recent years.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T18:23:40"></hs_TimeCode>It also seems to
be taking longer and longer to get benefits reinstated once they have
been stopped, even by accident. Cuts are also being made to the
benefits that people get, including the most pernicious of

change of all, universal credit, has been introduced. So things could

should be breaking dependency, not making it worse. The Government need
to recognise that the increase in the use of food banks is no accident,
that it is not just a result of the economic downturn, and that it is
not happening just because the food banks are there. It is a result of
the policies being actively pursed by the Government. The use of food

the benefit changes that the Government so desperately want to bring in
have a chance of success if we do not make those changes? Some of the
benefit changes have taken a long time to come through, and we need to
let them take effect so that we can deliver the deeper change that
needs to occur. People are motivated to go to the Trussell Trust and
other food banks across the country for a whole number of reasons. They
may find themselves in chaotic situations; they could be in debt and
have no financial management skills to know how to prioritise their
spending. I am not saying that that is true in every case, but we must
be honest about the breadth of the problems faced by the individuals
who use the food banks. We must come up with a solution that addresses
all the issues. We should not tritely simplify the matter and say,
“It is all about the benefit changes and the Government must do
something, but by the way I will not specify what we would do as an
alternative, how much it would cost and how we would pay for it and in
what time scale.” Unless alternative policies are advanced, the
things that some Members are saying ring very shallow for everyone
involved in food banks.</hs_Para>

Aldous</B> (Waveney) (Con):</Member> I am pleased to have secured this
debate as I believe that the coastal flooding that took place on 5
December should be considered on the Floor of the House. The storm
surge has had a devastating impact on many coastal communities, and
there is a strong sense in those communities that Parliament has not
properly considered what was a narrowly averted national crisis. Many
have seen their homes destroyed, while other homes have been seriously
damaged and people will not be able to return home for many months.
People have lost possessions that were built up over a lifetime, and
many small businesses—some of which had difficulty securing full
insurance cover—have been seriously hit.</hs_Para>

business Saturday when MPs were out promoting small businesses, many
firms in coastal communities were busy trying to salvage what was left
of their livelihoods. Many of those communities face significant
economic challenges, and I am concerned that such events might make it
more difficult to attract the inward investment needed to create new
jobs.</hs_Para>

Waveney and Lowestoft are the focus of my remarks, I am aware that
these events affected many communities along the North sea coast and
that colleagues will have their own specific concerns, some of which I
hope I shall be able to address on their behalf. I am conscious that my
colleagues, the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, my hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon
Lewis) and the Minister of State, Department of Health, my hon. Friend
the Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), have been particularly
active in support of communities affected in their constituencies, but
they are unable to participate in this debate due to their ministerial

one lost their life as a result of the flooding, my constituent Robert
Dellow died in the course of his work as a lorry driver as a
result of the high winds. I offer my condolences to his family, friends
and work colleagues. Although geographically small areas in Lowestoft
and Oulton Broad were affected, the impact has been dramatic. Levington
Court is a complex that provides housing and care for vulnerable older
people. The residents of the 19 flats on the ground floor have been
evacuated, their possessions have been destroyed and they will not be
able to return to their homes for some months. The Fyffe Centre
provides accommodation for the homeless. Twenty-seven people have been
flooded out. It will take some months to refurbish
and repair the building before they can return. Other
residential areas, including St John’s road and Marine parade,
have been hard-hit. Many of the homes are in the rental sector, and
people have seen all their possessions
destroyed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121866000708" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0004.htm#13121866000708">Businesses

is important that the Government review the policies and strategies
they have in place to deal with such events. Concerns have been
expressed to me that they were not devised with serious coastal
flooding in mind. The Pitt review, which was set up by the previous
Government after the storms that occurred in autumn 2007, appears to
have some deficiencies in that it does not address coastal flooding and
erosion properly. Its recognition of the need to protect the economy is
too limited. Similar criticisms can be made of the new flood and
coastal erosion risk management plan that was introduced in 2011. It,
too, places insufficient weight on the need to protect the economy or
recognise fully the differences between inland flooding, which is
temporary, and coastal flooding and erosion, which can be terminal for

Bellwin scheme is the main vehicle through which the Government will
deliver financial support to local communities by reimbursing local
authorities for immediate costs incurred in the storm surge. Based on
the feedback I have received there is a concern that the scheme, which
was originally established in 1983, is no longer fit for purpose. I
would be interested to learn what feedback the Government have had in
that regard, but I will draw various conclusions to the

a result of recent changes in the localisation of business rates, any
rate relief granted by councils to affected businesses will in part be
met by them rather than entirely by the Government, as was the case in
the past. The scheme is too time-limited and restrictive. It does not
cover the costs incurred in repairing sea defences that have been
weakened by the event, and is not generally supportive of capital
expenditure, which is necessary to repair sea defences. In Waveney,
that is estimated at £120,000, while I am advised that in North

further problem with the Bellwin scheme is that the two-month
limitation that applies to expenditure means that extensive capital
works are excluded if they cannot be completed in that time scale,

light of those and other concerns, there is a worry that Bellwin on its
own will not be able to achieve the Secretary of State’s
objective of getting places back on their feet quickly. In the short
term, there is a need for communities to look at a variety of measures
that manage flood risk. They include the provision of flood boards and
valves in air bricks and in WCs, and liaison with the insurance
industry to ensure that, where such protection measures are in place,
it provides cover on realistic terms. It is also necessary to plan for
the future. I believe that owing to rises in sea levels such events

receive favourable consideration. It is important to the town’s
future that work on the scheme starts as soon as practicable. There is
the opportunity to attract considerable investment into the town,
particularly in the oil and gas and offshore renewables sectors, and
the inclusion of this part of Lowestoft in the draft assisted area map
will help in this respect. However, businesses will think very
carefully before making such commitments unless adequate flood defences
are in

Brooklands and Jaywick. Thousands of people were moved; it is to the
great credit of people in Jaywick and Brooklands that thousands of
people were moved with such minimum fuss. Does my hon. Friend accept
that absolutely key to the whole process was the fact that the
Environment Agency put the information out in the public domain early?
By mid-afternoon, it was available through mainstream media and, in
particular, social media, which allowed people to take responsibility
and act responsibly. Often, they did not need the authorities to do
things for them because they were able to make arrangements themselves.

their greatest test in 60 years, with record tidal surge levels
experienced at many locations along the entire length of the east
coast. In Lowestoft, the record high tide, or the recorded high tide,
was the same as in 1953, and over half a metre higher than the more

for the local impact, the latest Environment Agency estimate suggests

commercial heart of Lowestoft. The area of Oulton broad, which lies at
the western end of Lake Lothing in Lowestoft, also suffered a second
inundation by flooding from the River Waveney, some two hours after the
initial tidal surge. The road crossings at the bascule bridge and
Mutford lock crossing were both closed, effectively cutting Lowestoft
in half. Flooding also resulted in the closure of the A12 at
Blythburgh. Rail services between Lowestoft and Norwich and between
Lowestoft and Ipswich were disrupted as a result of flooding at
Lowestoft Central station and damage to the signalling network. The
Lowestoft to Ipswich line remained closed some 11 days after the tidal

south in the constituency, there was limited flooding at a number of
locations in the Blyth estuary. Recent defences protected the vast
majority of properties in Southwold. It was confirmed that seven
commercial and three residential properties had been flooded in
Southwold and the surrounding marshes, while 133 properties
in the town had been protected from flooding. My thoughts go out to all
who have been affected by the floods: it is especially difficult for
them in the run-up to the season that we are about to celebrate. The
internationally important designated coastal habitats between Lowestoft
and Southwold were all subject to breaching of the fragile sand and
shingle barriers that offer them limited protection, but the
Environment Agency has inspected the sites and expects the barriers to
repair themselves naturally over the next few
tides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T19:35:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121866000748" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/debtext/131218-0004.htm#13121866000748">The
principal coast protection authority in the Lowestoft area is Waveney
district council, while other defences are maintained by Associated
British Ports, the harbour authority. The Environment Agency has worked
closely with the council’s engineering staff throughout the
event and its aftermath. The damage to defences has been assessed and
appears to be relatively minor except on Lowestoft south beach, where
more detailed engineering assessments are still taking place.
Separately, Suffolk county council has been preparing a flood
alleviation scheme for sections of the A12 that were flooded at
Blythburgh. The scheme is expected to become operational in
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T19:36:08"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
550 properties that lie outside Lowestoft in the Waveney valley. The

Mahmood</B> (Birmingham, Ladywood) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Chope. I am grateful for
the opportunity to hold a debate on a matter that is a growing concern
in my constituency and that now accounts for an increasing proportion
of my constituency case load. As Members look ahead to the Christmas
break, this debate is a stark reminder that for a growing number of
people in our country Christmas and the new year will not be a time to
enjoy celebrations with their family and friends in the comfort and
security of their own
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T09:31:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000008">I
was going to set the debate in context by looking at some figures,
which are obviously worrying and stark, but behind every homeless
statistic is a story, so I thought that I would instead start with the
story of one of my constituents, whom I met at my advice surgery only a
couple of weeks ago. She did not want me to give her name or anything
that might give her away, which I will respect, but she came to my
surgery with her two daughters, one of whom is 15 years old and the
other is five or six years old. Some months ago, she had left an
abusive relationship with a partner who was prone to fits of rage and
had been occasionally violent. She eventually found enough courage to
decide to leave  that relationship, but her journey into
homelessness then began. She and her daughters unfortunately 
found themselves in temporary bed-and-breakfast accommodation, which
was not fit for purpose, for much longer than the six-week limit. The
media often talk of councils spending money on Premier Inns and hotels,
but the bed and breakfast that this woman and her two daughters were in
was frankly disgusting. It was mice-infested. There was grime
everywhere. I was struck by the fact that her two daughters’
only request was for somewhere clean to
live<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T09:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000009"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jim Cunningham" PimsId="2803" UID="13121846000221" xid="147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000221"><B>Mr

bed-and-breakfast accommodation temporarily into a small, one-bedroom
flat, which again 
<?notus-xml column=220?>unfortunately happens to be in a state of disrepair. The heating is not
working properly and there was an issue with the water supply in the
first few days. Again, it is not a particularly
clean environment, and she of course does not have the means to do it
up and make it a comfortable, warm, secure place for her daughters. She
is still waiting to be placed in what she hopes will be permanent

she was talking to me, she expressed how utterly terrified she was when
looking ahead to Christmas and how the lack of security she felt from
the lack of a permanent roof over her and her daughters’ heads
was a ball of tension sitting in the pit of stomach that affected her
from morning until night. Every minute of every hour of every day, that
is all she could think about. She feels that she has let her daughters
down and that she might have been better off had she not left her
former partner, because the temporary terror of the occasional rage was

and her daughters were alive, but they were not really living. That was
a really powerful example of how just having a roof over one’s
head can be the difference between being alive and actually living. It
would mean her having a decent quality of life and a decent future that
she could look forward to with her daughters. Despite my best efforts

2012-13, 922 households in Birmingham were in temporary accommodation,
which is up 32% on the previous year, and 115 of them were in
bed-and-breakfast accommodation. Just like my constituent, households
have often found themselves in bed-and-breakfast accommodation that is
not fit for
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T09:38:34"></hs_TimeCode>. When I
was first elected in 2010, the majority of homelessness-related cases
that came to me involved people who could be described as vulnerable,
such as women escaping domestic violence, people
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T09:38:48"></hs_TimeCode> mental
health problems and people with drug or drink issues. I had several
cases of people who had left the care system without adequate support
and had found themselves homeless. There were also people who had come
out of prison and who may have been in and out of prison over many
years. A chunk of my casework involved people with unregularised status
in this country, such as the people living in a twilight world while
waiting for a decision on their asylum case from the UK Border Agency,
as was, or the Home Office. Such people had no recourse to public funds
and were homeless as a result.</hs_Para>

however, although those groups remain well represented in my
homelessness case load, I am seeing an increase in the number of
people—families, in particular—who have been made
homeless as a result of their private sector tenancy coming to an end
and their being unable to find or afford anywhere else to live. Some
months ago, for example, I met a couple who had a business a few years
ago, but it had run into trouble as a result of the recession. They had
lost it and could not keep up the payments on their home, so they lost
their home as well. They managed to get other jobs, earning much less
than before, but a job is a job. They are working hard and were renting
in the private rented sector, but the rent went up and they could not
afford the increase, so they found themselves homeless. They were
struggling to find anywhere else to live that they could afford on
their
budget.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000021">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T09:46:13"></hs_TimeCode>
am seeing many more cases of that
nature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T09:40:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The end
of a private sector tenancy now accounts for 22% of all homelessness
acceptances nationally, a rate that I fear is likely to increase
further and, in my constituency, the biggest rate of increase that I am
seeing in my own case load. The two main, connected reasons are that
the cost of renting is going up—since 2010, it has increased by
more than twice as much as wages—and house building is at its
lowest peacetime level since the 1920s. The failure to deal with
housing supply is not only causing a huge strain now, but storing deep
problems for us as a society for the

go back to the case of my constituent, let us think about the effect on
her two daughters. Even when I met them in my surgery, they were quite
down and displaying a nervous disposition; their mum told me how their
performance at school had dipped; and they were upset. As I mentioned
earlier, I was struck by how their only ask was somewhere clean to
live. The pressure on families 
<?notus-xml column=222?>and young people, children in particular, from always being desperate to
move and never being able to put down roots causes
those young people lasting harm, which will present itself in different

logical were there somewhere for those people to move into. The reason
why I cited the Birmingham figures of five bedsits and 54 one-bed flats
is that, as of yesterday, that is what is available in my
city—the second largest city in this country and the largest
local authority in Europe—for waiting lists that number in the
many tens of thousands. The problem is stark. Were there many hundreds
or thousands of properties for people to downsize into, allowing
homeless larger families to move into the larger properties, her
position would be logical. I am afraid, however, that that is simply
not the case in the area that I represent or in many instances up and

again. When she says that 54 one-bed flats are available, does she
meant that 54 are empty? With how many is a home swap possible, so that
those who are homeless with multiple children could swap into homes
with the space that they need? People in homes that are too big for
them could swap with people who are hopelessly overcrowded. If people

Mahmood:</Member></B> The ability of people to swap depends on
appropriate accommodation for the people who want to downsize or upsize
to go into, and my point is that housing supply throughout my city is
simply not enough for all kinds of homes. I spoke about the lack of
affordable and social housing, but there is also a lack of housing for
people to buy privately—not enough is being built anywhere in
the city. The numbers simply have not kept up with demand. Swapping and
other such solutions therefore will not deal with the large numbers
presenting themselves in Birmingham. I am afraid that unless we could
build thousands of homes overnight, my city will not be able to cope
with the issues that it is facing, some but not all of which result in

right to cite the Government’s own impact assessment. If people
who are moving are forced into the private rented sector and their
rents go up, that puts extra pressure on the housing benefit budget as
well. I have not focused on welfare and benefits in my speech, but that
is an additional pressure and an additional cost for the state, as it
meets the increased demand and as rent in the private rented sector
goes
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T09:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000035">Organisations
under pressure include not only Birmingham city council, but many that
provide support to the homeless. I have mentioned SIFA Fireside, a 
<?notus-xml column=224?>charity based in my constituency that works with the homeless. Its
representatives visited me and my hon. Friend the shadow Minister in
Parliament a couple of weeks ago. They brought a group of homeless
people from across Birmingham and the west Midlands, so that they could
speak to parliamentarians about the problems they face. It provides
practical support to homeless people, including daily drop-in sessions,
a resettlement service, a specialist alcohol support service and an
employment and training programme.</hs_Para>

SIFA Fireside provided just over 35,000 meals, 500 food
parcels and 3,700 showers. We are talking about real basics: food,
somewhere to have a wash and somebody to help people make some phone
calls to try to get their lives back on track—the charity made
just over 4,000 phone calls on behalf of people who are homeless to
help them sort out somewhere else to move on to and ultimately, they
hope, somewhere permanent to live. But rising prices are causing a cost
of living crisis for families up and down the country, and neither
businesses nor charities are exempt from that problem. Rising costs
have forced SIFA Fireside to cut by half the number of meals it will
provide in the coming year, because it can now afford to put on only
one meal a day for homeless people.</hs_Para>

provides a vital lifeline for Birmingham’s homeless people,
especially over the winter months, but is facing real challenges just
to stay open. Although I am sure that all Members are grateful for the
safety net that charities such as SIFA Fireside are providing in
constituencies across the country, we cannot take that for granted:
charities are under significant pressure and the availability of their
services will be significantly curtailed—certainly, that is what
I am seeing in my constituency.</hs_Para>

systemic problems cause homelessness. The primary one is the issue we
face with house building, and the fact that housing supply has simply
not kept up with demand. Also, the private rented sector is not fit for
families, as it does not give people the security they need or
predictable rent rises that would allow people to plan their household
budgets. Finally, the bedroom tax is causing acute concern. We need to
look at those issues in order to deal with the problem of homelessness.
Doing so will not fix the problem entirely, as people find themselves
homeless for many reasons, but I believe that for the 80,000 or so
children whom we expect to be homeless—that is according to the
official figures, and I think the real figure is probably
higher—dealing with the problems with both house building and
the private rented sector and scrapping the bedroom tax would be pretty
good places to start.</hs_Para>

Kingdom—turn to the homeless people who, each night, lay down
their blankets and boxes in dark corners of this great city of ours.
Their presence makes all of us ask questions about where we as a
society are falling short. I am afraid that to many of us who live in

people and rough sleepers is increasing very
quickly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000043">I
live, with my wife and two children, a stone’s throw from
Westminster cathedral, and from The Passage, a charity sponsored
predominantly by the Roman Catholic Church that has provided succour
for the less fortunate for a century and a half. One need only look
around the streets literally a few hundred yards from this Chamber and
witness the many people, young men in particular, sleeping rough in
Westminster station to understand that the situation has become
markedly worse in recent months. Constituents from all over my
constituency worry about the people they find each morning in their
doorways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000044">All
of us know that local authorities have a statutory obligation to
undertake regular counts of people sleeping on their streets. Figures
from Westminster city council indicate that the number of rough
sleepers has increased sharply: a total of some 2,440 people were
recorded bedding down as rough sleepers in 2012-13. Although that was a
slight reduction on the figure for the previous year, the number in
2009-10 was only 1,693, so there has been an increase of over 40% in
the past three years. Meanwhile, in the other part of my constituency,
the City of London, the most recent figures available, for the period
from 1 September to 31 October, indicate a marked increase of 39% in
the number of rough sleepers when compared with the same period last
year.</hs_Para>

how to respond, we must first grasp why people sleep rough. To be
honest, for as long as big cities—particularly ones such as
London—have existed, people have slept on the streets. There are
myriad reasons why, but over the past few years, and certainly in the
time that I have represented my central London seat, we have tended to
see two quite distinct categories of rough sleepers, with very
different stories to tell.</hs_Para>

so-called traditional rough sleepers in Westminster has remained
relatively static. They tend to be people with an addiction
problem—some 52% of the homeless take drugs, and 20% drink
alcohol at harmful levels—people who have been affected by
family breakdown, or, of course, people with mental health
difficulties: nearly half of the people on our streets have long-term
mental health needs. Colleagues will recall the “Street
Stories” exhibition that I sponsored in this House only a few
years ago, for the homeless charity St Mungo’s, which aimed to
educate parliamentarians about why that very diverse group turned to
the streets.</hs_Para>

rough sleepers is well known to outreach groups. Local authorities and
established charities patiently conduct long-term and meaningful work
to rehabilitate such people into mainstream society. Homelessness
services provide support to over 40,000 homeless people a year,
delivering cost savings to public service budgets, and better outcomes
for the most vulnerable. It has been  
<?notus-xml column=226?>estimated that a single rough sleeper on the streets of London costs
some £35,000 a year in crime, emergency health and social
services alone.</hs_Para>

Minister knows, the Mayor of London has a programme that aims to ensure
that no person spends more than one night sleeping rough on the streets
of London. That is now the case for eight out of 10 rough sleepers, but
of course, logically, that means that for one in five rough sleepers,
the promise of only one night on the streets is not being kept. I
support the broad thrust of the changes that have been made to housing
benefit entitlement, and have done so repeatedly, both in TV studios
and in this House, but both the Mayor and I continue to make the case
to the Government that those changes will continue to have a
disproportionate impact on central London, where rents, to which the
hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood, has referred, are at their
highest. I have expressed those concerns to the ministerial team in
Parliament. It is also deeply concerning that although rough sleeping
continues to rise, there is a reduction in the amount of available
support. Hostel bed spaces are being reduced at a concerning rate, and
are at their lowest number since 2008.</hs_Para>

second group of homeless people, namely foreign nationals, many of whom
have no recourse to public funds and therefore require an alternative
policy response. In the midst of the changes that will go through

Bulgarians—all of us agree with those changes—we should
remember that those who do come here could be an even bigger strain on

central European countries now make up 32% of all rough sleepers in
Westminster. That is no surprise: following the enlargements of the
European Union in 2004 and 2008, Westminster experienced a sudden
influx of new arrivals from eastern Europe, often via Victoria coach
station. In advance of the enlargements, both Westminster city council
and I warned repeatedly of the increased dangers of jobless and
unqualified nationals from the new EU accession countries ending up
sleeping rough, but the previous Government failed to put into place
proper plans to deal with the sudden influx. I am afraid that the
situation has not improved in the three and a half years since the
coalition came into office.</hs_Para>

nationals were particularly at risk of homelessness, as the law
prevented them from accessing benefits provided by local authorities to
residents, as well as state benefits such as income support, shelter

they would live and work, and I emphasise that many are making a
fantastic contribution to our economy, but for others, the likelihood
of them descending rapidly into street life was exacerbated because
they had no 
<?notus-xml column=227?>other means of support. Westminster city council has done a lot of work
to help those individuals, sometimes by trying to reconnect them with
their families back home, assisting with repatriation, providing
language services, and so

gold standard support and training scheme to help local authorities to
tackle homelessness. The concern of all of us is not that the will is
lacking, but the lack of resources. We have no idea of the numbers, and
the extent to which the problem is likely to be exacerbated in the
months ahead. I am interested to hear what the Minister says today, but

foot conditions, dental problems, infections, sexual health issues and
tuberculosis. One in 10 people diagnosed with TB has a history of
homelessness. Lack of suitable washing facilities can aggravate those

homeless people are struggling to access health care, more must be done
at an early stage to encourage people at risk of homelessness to access

triggers that lead to homelessness. Up to 70% of homeless people suffer
mental health issues and 14% suffer a personality disorder. In London,
almost one fifth of rough sleepers have mental health needs combined

for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood) on securing this timely
debate. We have heard about the growing extent of homelessness and the
staggering number of people it affects. The problem reflects some
serious structural problems in the housing sector and welfare system.
We have also heard about the long-term problems that homelessness can
cause. Many are profound, but are not easily quantifiable. However,
they are cumulative because homelessness prevents people from finding
or staying in work and has a cumulative impact on their health,
sometimes provoking them to engage in criminal activity and so
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000074">Homelessness
is part of a wider problem of social exclusion and it is obvious that
the solution, especially for harder-to-reach cases, must be
comprehensive. It is not just about finding a new home for someone
to  stay in and leaving them to get on with it. It takes
an  
<?notus-xml column=230?>average of seven years for someone to get to the point of sleeping rough
on the streets and it is unrealistic to expect that they can be turned
round and brought back to independent life within a matter of months.
Helping people in that situation is a long-term commitment.</hs_Para>

huge range of hostels and temporary accommodation schemes have been the
bulwark of the response to homelessness, quite often for those who do
not fit the priority needs assessments of local authorities, as well as
those who do. Many are run by local charities and although they often
have generous benefactors, they are reliant on public funding to stay
solvent. The Government’s strategy from 2012 was accompanied by
promises that funding for such organisations would be protected as much
as possible, with more than £400 million being devolved to local
authorities and voluntary groups. Unfortunately, that does not lead to
steady investment on the ground. More than half of all homelessness
services are seeing cuts in their funding, and that will become far
worse when local authorities start to make cuts for 2014
onwards.</hs_Para>

urgently need a solution to stop local authorities cutting these
services indefinitely. If the Government were to look at a ring fence

see a great improvement and not the impending social disaster that

local Christian community could respond to a growing number of people

community response to the homelessness crisis. Those agencies included

lease was for just three months, but such was the need that it has
never been able to close. The Torbay Churches Homeless Trust
decided  to merge with the Langley House Trust in 2003 when it

hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood) on
securing the debate and on making a very powerful case. As she and
others have said, in recent years, we have seen homelessness up
overall. We have seen rough sleeping up by 60% in London in just two
years alone, and we have seen homelessness in London rise by more than
a third in just three years. All that was entirely predictable and it
was predicted, because it has arisen not entirely by accident, but by a
foreseeable combination of circumstances. There is the continuing
squeeze on house building and particularly affordable house
building—last year we saw the lowest level of housing
completions since the 1920s—and the failure, which many of us
have been flagging up for several years, of the Department for
Communities and Local Government and the Department for Work and
Pensions to have even the most basic conversation about how their
policies interact.</hs_Para>

is most striking in London and the south-east is the extent to which
the Government’s policies on social security, especially the
housing support safety net 
<?notus-xml column=232?>cuts, have led directly to the rise in homelessness, particularly in
London. A staggering figure was flagged up by the estimable Crisis and
the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in their 2013 homelessness report: there
has been a 316% rise in homelessness due to the end of assured
shorthold tenancies in London—that is private sector tenancies.
Overwhelmingly, the end of those assured shorthold tenancies is either
because the tenant can no longer afford the rent—they were
relying on the assistance of housing benefit—or because
landlords, in an increasingly competitive market, are withdrawing those
properties from the sector, which is a point that I will briefly return
to in a minute.</hs_Para>

the only area affected, although with that 316% rise it is at the sharp
end. We saw a 128% increase in homelessness due to the end of assured
shorthold tenancies in the south, and even in the north of England,
which does not have the same housing pressures, there was a 73% rise.
The Government’s welfare policy is without doubt driving
homelessness, especially for families.</hs_Para>

seen an average of 60%—nearly two thirds—of household
income in the private rented sector being taken up by rent. That is
clearly unsustainable. People are struggling to keep the roof over
their heads. They are relying on a safety net that is increasingly

first, homelessness led to a surge in the use of bed-and-breakfast
accommodation, as hon. Members have said, which is ridiculously
expensive and wholly unsuitable. The Labour Government were absolutely
right, more than a decade ago, to make it illegal for local authorities
to keep families with children in bed-and-breakfast accommodation for
more than six weeks. The growing pressure of homelessness meant that
local authorities, including Westminster, were breaching that six-week
standard, which cost an absolute fortune—millions and millions
of pounds. Local authorities had to place people in the Premier Inn
hotel and the Jurys Inn hotel in Chelsea, because they could not find
accommodation. Of course, they were breaking the law and were roundly
told off by Ministers for doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000091">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:19:43"></hs_TimeCode>
am delighted that Westminster, in particular, is no longer using
bed-and-breakfast accommodation for more than six weeks. That has been
a significant change in the past few months. But what has happened? It
is like squeezing a balloon: unless the circumstances change, the
pressure simply builds somewhere else. What has 
<?notus-xml column=233?>happened is that local authorities are beginning to use something called
annexe accommodation which, in some cases, is merely bed-and-breakfast
accommodation with a gas ring. It is not always; sometimes it is
different kinds of accommodation. It is basically self-contained, but
it is booked nightly and has no time limit on its use. Local
authorities—in particular, inner London authorities under
pressure—are now using that nightly booked accommodation, which
means that families, including many of those I am dealing with,
literally do not know from one day to the next where they will be going
for their accommodation. Many of the annexes are out of borough, so
families have to commute their children in from the outskirts of London
to maintain their school places. They cannot move their child’s
school to the local authority area in which they are now
placed—it may be Hounslow; it may be Enfield; it is many miles

commuting their children two hours to school and two hours home at
night. Understandably, the schools then come to me and say that
children are falling asleep at their desks because they are being put
under that pressure. Even children with special needs were being placed
in this accommodation, despite the local authority telling me that that

Baker</B> (Wycombe) (Con):</Member> It is a thorough and utter disgrace
that anyone should be homeless in the 21st century in our country. It
makes me wonder whether the welfare state safety net has any meaning
whatever when people are out there, dying on our streets—and I
do mean dying on our streets, because on Christmas day in 2006, Josie
Razzell died in the stairwell of Easton Street car park in High
Wycombe. She died of exposure. As a result, the Churches in High
Wycombe came together in a story similar to that told by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:24:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

debate, mentioned one particular cause and one particular story and
made the case very movingly, but if only that man had not treated his
partner violently, that problem perhaps would not have arisen. I think
that every hon. Member present knows that the causes of homelessness
are complex and wide ranging. They include addictions, debt,
worklessness and educational failure and, of course, are compounded in
a dreadful cycle of health problems, both physical and mental. Those of
us who have worked in night shelters for a number of years will have
seen, I suspect, altogether too much suffering in that

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:25:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Torbay said—and of course the problem extends far
before that. Opposition Members talked about the housing market and the
shortage of supply. The housing market is characterised by state
land-use planning and state intervention in the credit markets. If
there is too little housing, it can only be the case that the state has
made a mess of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000101">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:26:24"></hs_TimeCode>
I look at all these stories, I see a number of things: the failure of
individuals to live in the right relationship with one another, the
failure of a man to look after his partner and the failures of people
to get a 
<?notus-xml column=235?>good education, get a job and build up their lives. What I want to see
is the shortest possible route to minimising this human suffering, but
what I see at the moment is a constant recourse to state action at a
time when the quality and quantity of welfare, health and education
produced by the state simply is not good enough and we also, very
clearly, cannot afford it, because we have resorted to quantitative
easing to suppress interest rates just to keep up the borrowing
necessary to sustain this level of

what I have to say to my hon. Friend the Minister is twofold. First,
what is he doing to end the complex cycles of state failure that are
ruining people’s lives? Secondly, will he please take every
possible—every conceivable—step that he can to remove the
obstacles that the state places in people’s way, preventing them
from just getting out there and helping people across the wide range of
complex causes of chronic and abject

with what he has to say on the macro-economic side about the very
insidious—dangerous—long-term effects on the British
economy of quantitative easing. Will he accept that part of the
difficulty with housing law, which goes back almost 100
years—the first rent Acts came in at the end of the first world
war—is that, every time, we try to add another elastoplast to
the system when there needs to be a much more imaginative approach by
politicians, academics and the like to looking at the way in which our
housing market operates? All too often, we have seen short-term
problems, which we have tried to solve with new legislation, rather
than recognising, as my hon. Friend rightly said, that it has been
state action and legislation in the past that has helped to produce all

want to finish with this thought. We are coming up to
Christmas—the anniversary of the death of Josie Razzell in High

from all these difficulties began with an event that we celebrate at

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:29:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood) for introducing
this timely debate. It is timely because we always, rightly, think more
about homelessness and homeless people as we approach Christmas. I
should point out that before I entered Parliament, I worked as a social
researcher and spent some 10 years researching homelessness
issues. I interviewed  
<?notus-xml column=236?>hundreds of homeless people during that time to
learn what circumstances led to them getting into that situation and
what the solutions were.</hs_Para>

absolutely no doubt that homelessness is getting worse. When I have
been around Rochdale, and when I went into Manchester the other day, it
has been clear that more people are living out on our streets and
sleeping rough. It is as though we are returning to the 1980s and early
1990s. We do not need anecdotal evidence to see that homelessness is
getting worse. The Government are keen to devise policies on the back
of anecdotal evidence, but there are statistics to prove that
homelessness is getting worse. The figures that I have been given show
that in England, there has been an 11% increase over the past two years
in people approaching local authorities saying that they are homeless.
The number of people housed in temporary accommodation during 2012 rose
by 10% and the number of people in bed and breakfast accommodation rose
even faster, by 14%. In 2012, there were an estimated 2,309 people
sleeping rough on any one night across England, which is a rise of 31%
over two years.</hs_Para>

will be aware, because he was present at the hearing, that the Minister
for Housing, the hon. Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins), gave evidence
to the Communities and Local Government Committee on 9 December. When I
questioned him about rough sleeping at the Committee, the Housing
Minister said that it had reduced by 8%. I now understand that there is
no truth in that whatsoever, and there is no evidence to suggest that
rough sleeping has fallen. I hope that the Minister takes the
opportunity to correct the record today. The latest figures show that
last year in Rochdale, 717 households approached the council as
homeless, which was an increase of 180% over two years, and 280
households were accepted as being statutorily homeless. That is an
increase of 324% over the past two years.</hs_Para>

Government are cooking up a homelessness crisis, and I do not say that
lightly. All the ingredients are being added to create such a crisis:
in go economic and social instability problems, dramatic benefit
changes, major cuts to support services and a lack of suitable
accommodation for people who find themselves in difficulty. Whether
they accept it or not, the Government are steadily mixing the dish to
create a severe homelessness problem similar to that of the 1980s. The
irony is that we have learned how to deal with homelessness. Levels of
homelessness and rough sleeping and the numbers of people going into
bed and breakfast accommodation were dramatically reduced in the mid to
late 1990s and into the 2000s, but we are having to re-learn the
solutions, which is exceptionally unfortunate.</hs_Para>

Member for Torbay (Mr Sanders) has pointed out, more than half of all
homelessness services have seen their funding cut. The Petrus
homelessness project in Rochdale has achieved an incredible amount on
an exceptionally tight budget, even though it has faced severe budget
cuts. If it were not for Petrus, dozens of people in Rochdale would
have died prematurely as a result of homelessness. If politicians are
serious about addressing homelessness, they should watch a video called
“RoofLess” that Petrus produced with Community Arts North
West which shows homeless people telling everyone about their fragile,
damaged lives and how they ended up becoming homeless. I went to the
launch of that video a week ago, and it is well worth
watching.</hs_Para>

Phillipson</B> (Houghton and Sunderland South) (Lab):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr Chope. I

approach Christmas, I am conscious that too many families are without a
permanent home or are worried about what the new year will bring, when
many of us are looking forward to spending time with our families. At
this time of year, I am reminded of the incredible generosity of local
people, particularly on Wearside. It is lonely and isolating to be
facing Christmas in temporary accommodation, or to be worried about
whether your children will be able to receive any Christmas presents.
That is why it was always so comforting for the women and families that
I used to support in a women’s refuge to know that others were
thinking of them at Christmas and that the local community were always
willing to help and support them in their time of need.</hs_Para>

homelessness is deeply troubling. Across England, as we have heard, the
number of people found to be statutorily homeless has risen. Regional
figures may vary, but that is also the case in my local authority.
Since 2007, Sunderland city council has focused on preventing
homelessness, on the understanding that it is always best to work with
people to try to find alternatives and manage their difficulties, and
to support landlords to try to prevent people from becoming homeless in
the first place. However, Sunderland city council reports that the
number of people that it has been able to prevent from becoming
homeless has fallen, which is of great concern. In the 12 months up to
September 2013, there were 577 preventions, which fell from more than
700 during the previous year. The disproportionate cuts that councils
such as Sunderland face are having a serious impact on their ability to
prioritise work to prevent homelessness. Over the same period to 2013,
the number of people found to be homeless increased by 54%. Councils
tell me that they fear that 2014 will be worse still, once the impact
of welfare changes such as the bedroom tax starts to be reflected in
the figures.</hs_Para>

problem of women who find themselves homeless as a result of domestic
violence. As my hon. Friend indicated earlier when she spoke of the
difficulties faced by her constituent, that is a problem across the
country and no doubt we all see it in our constituency surgeries.
Figures vary, but we know that domestic violence accounts for a
significant proportion of homelessness acceptances. Many women who are
forced out of their homes by domestic violence do not approach councils
and are not counted in those figures, so the real numbers will be
higher still.</hs_Para>

way to go in shifting perceptions about what women’s refuges are
like and the services that they offer to women and children.
Understandably, many 
<?notus-xml column=238?>families this Christmas would rather be settled in a permanent place
that they can call home, rather than in a women’s refuge.
Equally, in my contact with women’s refuges, what I saw at
Christmas was women and children who were able for the very first time
to enjoy a peaceful Christmas without fear. Children did not have to
worry about whether their mother would be beaten before their eyes.
They did not have to worry about whether their father would shout at
them or smash their presents, or whether they, as young children, would
be subject to abuse. I saw the incredible generosity of local people
who provided presents, enabled children to have Christmas parties and
supported them so that they could try to enjoy a normal, peaceful
Christmas after the difficult and traumatic ordeal that they had been
through.</hs_Para>

reasons, I am concerned about reports that the number of spaces
available in women’s refuges is contracting. Providers across
the country report that they are having to turn more and more women
away. As part of an inquiry into access for justice for women, the
all-party parliamentary group on domestic and sexual violence recently
took evidence from providers, which explained the real pressures on
their services. Providers told us that they face big cuts to their
budgets, which are affecting their ability to offer families a safe
place to turn. So much progress was made in that area under the

pay tribute to the work of the charities hon. Members have mentioned,
and the volunteers who work all year to provide invaluable support to
those who are homeless and those sleeping on the streets. The UK is the
seventh richest country in the world, yet homelessness and rough
sleeping are increasing year on year. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:40:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk) explained, the figures are
getting worse; since the Government came to power, rough sleeping and
homelessness are up by one third. It is heartbreaking that 80,000
children will be without a permanent home this Christmas. The number of
families with children  
<?notus-xml column=239?>living in bed and breakfasts is at a 10-year high.

the Member for Birmingham, Ladywood, set out, the reality of living in
a bed and breakfast is absolutely shocking. She spoke movingly about
the case of her constituent and her daughters. In more than half the
cases investigated by Shelter this year, children in such accommodation
were sharing beds with their parents or siblings, and two thirds of
families said that their children had no table to eat meals on, and
often had to eat on the floor or bed. As my hon. Friend points out,
homeless children living in temporary accommodation are more
likely to fall behind at school, and lose vital opportunities at that
formative age to develop and grow in a healthy living
environment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000124">Rough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:41:44"></hs_TimeCode>

referred to the wide-ranging and complex reasons why people end up
living on the streets. I pay tribute to the work my
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:42:02"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Friend the
Member for Houghton and Sunderland South (Bridget Phillipson) did, even
before she became an MP, in providing support for victims of domestic
abuse. Many women and men end up living on the streets as a result of
such abuse. Some have come out of institutions, such as care settings
or prison. The effects of sleeping rough are enormously damaging to
people’s physical and mental health, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:42:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) set out in her excellent

described, many people who live on the streets are at risk of dying
prematurely. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Rochdale pointed out that the average age of
death for rough sleepers is 47, which is a tragic statistic.</hs_Para>

support to those at risk of homelessness, or those who were already
homeless. As my

Member for Rochdale mentioned, we had great determination to bear down
on and tackle homelessness. As a result, it decreased by 70% during our

homelessness are complex and wide-ranging, under the current

grown significantly
worse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000126">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:49:49"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have failed to tackle the chronic housing shortage so
central to the cost of living crisis. The cruel and iniquitous bedroom
tax is putting many social tenants at risk of eviction, because they
are falling into arrears for the first time. The 60% cut to the
affordable homes budget when the Government came to power has had an
impact on the number and affordability of homes available. The
Government have also cut away support at a time when there are more and
more homeless people, who are in need of help. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Houghton and Sunderland South pointed out,
cuts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:44:16"></hs_TimeCode> to local

it is good that the Government have continued the initiative, I am sad
to report that they did not do so on a cross-party basis, and we were
not invited to the meeting earlier this week with young homeless people

the young people who came to Parliament last year demonstrated, vital
services need to be brought together to help those at risk of
homelessness, but other factors also contribute to homelessness. Hon.
Members talked about the lack of homes in our country. The sad truth is
that the Government are presiding over the lowest peacetime level of
house building since the 1920s. We are not building even half the
number of homes needed to keep up with demand. While home ownership is
falling for the first time in more then a century, private rents are
soaring, particularly in our big cities. In London, 59% of an average
income is consumed by rent; outside London, the figure is
41%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000129">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:49:49"></hs_TimeCode>
many hon. Friends have pointed out, the loss of an assured shorthold
tenancy is now one of the key drivers of homelessness; more than one in
four households are accepted as homeless for that reason, and that
number has tripled in the past three years. The Government said that
they would introduce a tenant’s charter, but I worry that it
will be a meaningless and toothless initiative if it does not deliver
what we desperately need: longer-term, more stable tenancies, with
predictable rents. The truth is that the 9 million people who live in
the private rented sector are being let down by poor standards in the
sector. It is the worst type of housing to be in, because, according to
the English housing survey, one third of homes in the private rented
sector do not meet even basic standards. Tenants will seldom complain
to their landlord because it puts them at risk of eviction. We must
redress the balance of power between the landlord, letting agents, and
tenants. Tenants simply do not have the protections in law that they
need; those protections that they do have are seldom enforced. The
Government need to look at those issues seriously.</hs_Para>

Labour Government would tackle the cost of living crisis and
the chronic shortage of housing. We have pledged to build 200,000 homes
a year by 2020. We would scrap the cruel and unfair bedroom
tax. We would freeze energy bills for millions of hard-pressed
families. Crucially, we aim to reform and regulate the private rented
sector to bring about more secure, longer-term tenancies, especially
for families with children. We will introduce a national register of
landlords; in fact, we had the measures in place to introduce such a
register at the end of our time in office, but the current Government
got rid of the plans within weeks of coming to power. We will empower
local authorities to bring in licensing schemes across the private
rented sector. At the moment, they have to jump through a lot of hoops
to prove that a licensing scheme is needed and can introduce one only
in a particular geographical area, or for a particular type of
accommodation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000131">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:49:49"></hs_TimeCode>

those Ministers who are willing to speak truth to power—there
are not many. We heard him do so in recent weeks in a dramatic fashion,
so I implore him to make demands of his Government to get a grip on the
issue sooner rather than later. It is a tragedy that so many families
with children are living in bed-and-breakfast accommodation over
Christmas, and that so many people find themselves with no option other
than to sleep on our

most startling facts about homelessness over the past 10 or 20 years is
that it was at its height when the economy was booming, and when

Homelessness peaked in 2003-04; sadly, it only reached the level it is
at now in 2008, just when the financial crash hit. Throughout a period
when the economy was

It was only brought down to its current level in 2008. The devastating
financial crash in 2008 has had economic and social ripples that will
continue for years and decades to come, and one of those ripples has

do everything in their power to house people within their own
boundaries, whether temporarily, if that is unfortunately the only
possibility, or ultimately permanently. It is deeply regrettable that
some authorities have found that they are not able to do that. We are
constantly writing to them, speaking to them and putting pressure on
them to ensure that they fulfil that duty, because it is clear and
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000144">Briefly,
on the bigger argument,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T10:57:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wolverhampton North East pointed out that we have been building far
too few homes, not just recently, but over the past 20 years. We can
all make political points about whether house building rate are lower
than they were five years ago, but the fact is that we have had the
most devastating financial crash and the deepest recession in 100
years. It is not surprising, at a time when several of our major banks
had to be nationalised and others bailed out by the taxpayer, that the
possibility of lending money to builders to build and to people to buy
houses has become severely constrained, and that has led to a dramatic
fall in house building.</hs_Para>

Government are utterly determined—I am utterly
determined—to do everything we can to reform the planning
system, the funding streams for mortgages and the lending for builders,
to enable the rate of house building to increase. It is also clear that
we need more housing of a tenure type and cost that makes it available
to many of the people likely to be affected by homelessness. I simply
point out that nobody’s record is perfect on this matter. The
previous Government presided over a dramatic fall in the number of
affordable houses available to people, and under this Government, the
number has gone up. We have managed to build just less than 100,000
affordable houses in the three years that we have been in office, but
that is not enough and we accept that. We hope that we will build
170,000 over the life of this Parliament. Are 170,000 houses enough to
deal with the problems that we have, and the 20-year backlog in house
building? No, they are
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121846000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000146">At
the same time, however, we have created 1.5 million jobs, and I am sure
that all hon. Members will accept that the long-term solution, to
prevent more people falling into homelessness, and to help the people
whom Members have all admirably mentioned, is to enable those people to
get stable jobs that pay them more than the minimum wage, and ideally
more than the living wage. That will enable them to hold down a
tenancy, whether in social housing or private rented housing. That is
the solution to the homelessness problem of our
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_18_PT_1/8C7D91155095C36B672975CC64197862A83ACDE6" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 December 2013">Wednesday

this great House has ever said that it could not help me. I then
tweeted about crowdfunding, and all sorts of interesting people pitched
up in the House of Commons and started to educate me about it. We
formed the Westminster crowdfunding forum, we have an all-party group
on crowdfunding and non-banking finance, and suddenly we have what I

is so exciting about crowdfunding is that it gives power to the
crowd—to ordinary people—to say that there is a problem
in their community and that they can form a small group to head
something up. They can form a community enterprise and they can fund it
through the crowd on the internet, on a platform; there are now many
platforms out there that enable crowdfunding. Some of them specialise
in education, others in financing films and theatre, and others in
community enterprises.

me, crowdfunding is one of the most vibrant, exciting and important
industries to appear in the past decade. The possibilities of
crowdfunding are endless, first because all of us know that most people
who are entering employment in this country today will work for small
and medium-sized enterprises. If we can have more and more SME
start-ups and they can grow successfully, the country will be so much
wealthier and so much more successful.</hs_Para>

enables and empowers people who want to start a business to do it in
their own way, and to raise the money to do so. It often starts with
friends and family, and then a wider range of people become excited
about the enterprise and put a little bit of money in to 
<?notus-xml column=245?>help it start. The history of the last few years has been that many more
businesses have started up successfully using crowdfunding and the new
social media to reach out to a broader audience and involve them in a
very interesting way.</hs_Para>

is the practice of funding a project or venture by raising many small
amounts of money from a large number of people, typically via the
internet. However, people become confused about what is crowdfunding
and what is not. I will talk briefly about four kinds of
crowdfunding.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121846000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000156"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:04:30"></hs_TimeCode>First,
there is equity crowdfunding. It is very simple indeed. Someone wants
to start a business and they give a share in their business to someone
else. It may be worth a fiver, or fifty quid, but it is usually only a
small amount—an amount that I am sure you, Mr Chope, and I could
afford to put into an enterprise that we believed in and that might
make us money in the longer term. It is also possible for someone to
invest in the little corner shop that they do not have in their village
or community, or in a failing pub that the community wants to take
over. There are lots of enterprises that crowdfunding can
help.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121846000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000157"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:05:03"></hs_TimeCode>However,
there is the very interesting issue of starting
businesses—private sector businesses. There is nothing wrong
with starting businesses. As chairman of both the all-party group on
manufacturing and the all-party group on management, I am a passionate
supporter of well-managed enterprises and start-ups.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121846000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000158"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:05:23"></hs_TimeCode>Equity
is one way that crowdfunding works; someone can invest money in that
way. However, it is also possible to borrow and lend money through the
internet and crowdfunding; that is the second form of crowdfunding I
want to discuss. Some people in the peer-to-peer lending area are a
little cautious about being called part of the crowdfunding empire,
but—in broader terms—they certainly pitch up to the
Westminster crowdfunding forum. Such lending allows people to borrow
money at very low rates of interest, and it also allows people to lend
money at quite high rates of interest. People might think that is
impossible, but the fact is that we have a system that gets rid of the
intermediary. It is peer to peer—very direct. There is no big
bank, with glass panels and marble halls, to go into, or a network of
branches of banks, with all the people that have to be employed in
them. There is a very simple relationship, and it means that the
facility to lend and borrow money is made quite radically
different.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121846000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121846000159"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>Thirdly,
there is rewards crowdfunding. That is the kind of crowdfunding that
you, Mr Chope, and I might be most interested in; I realise that I am
interpreting your wishes in saying so. Rewards crowdfunding means that
someone asks someone else to help them with an enterprise, such as the
John Clare Cottage Trust, which I am involved with and which is a
national centre for learning outside the classroom. We run a campaign
called every child’s right to the countryside. What we do to
raise money is to ask people, “Will you adopt a school in less
affluent area of the country, whose pupils would benefit from coming to
the countryside and learning in the countryside for a day?” We
look to crowdfund up to £500 to bring a whole school class to
the countryside for a day. We can do that by offering rewards, because
we not only give the reward of a day in 
<?notus-xml column=246?>the country to the pupil but—as we will do in the new
year—we will give a limited edition of John Clare’s love
poetry to those giving money. It is a collection of poems that were
never published in his lifetime, because they were a little steamy for
Victorians. We can give the reward of a limited edition, or free entry
to the lovely John Clare poet’s house in Helpston, which is
right next to Burghley house. So, with rewards crowdfunding, people do
not get their money back, but they get the engagement, and the reward
might be, at the bottom end, with a small amount of money, a mug or a
tea-towel. Further up the scale, there are more substantial
crowdfunding rewards.</hs_Para>

there are donations. Mr Chope, you will know about the success of
justgiving.com, which is estimated to have raised £3 billion for
good causes, in direct donations.</hs_Para>

I say, <hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T11:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>there are
various types of crowdfunding, and I hope that I have educated those
attending this Westminster Hall debate about them.</hs_Para>

the alternative finance sector raised £939 million in the UK in
2013. That is a hell of a lot of money, and it was up by 91% from the
£492 million raised in 2012. The UK alternative finance market
provided £332 million-worth of early stage growth and working
capital to more than 3,700 start-ups and SMEs in the UK in 2013 alone.

we play it right, the UK is likely to become the centre of crowdfunding
in the world, partly because  the United States, in its haste

play a part in that; £939 million is a large sum of money. The
sector is also incredibly varied. In my constituency, for example,
SyndicateRoom is doing equity crowdfunding, and the Future Business
Centre is using social impact bonds to build an entire building for
social enterprises. RealVNC, a software company, was set up though
merchandising; it sold products with its logo on to get the money to
build a better product. There is also Frontier Developments and its
game, “Elite: Dangerous”. Those are all crowdfunded. The
area is so varied that there is a huge challenge for
regulation.</hs_Para>

say that to him. I say that not in a spirit of good will because it is
close to Christmas, but because I thought he talked a lot of common

letting down small businesses. That shows the power of crowdfunding. I

brought it to my attention. I will take more interest in it now. If I
heard her correctly, she mentioned that it has already raised

steps to support this burgeoning industry. We have invested £30

diversity while ensuring that there is regulation, without making false
divides and pigeonholing the diverse crowdfunding industry into the
categories of debt, equity or, indeed, donations? Donations are not

some regulation, it is keen for a more tailored

have mentioned on a number of occasions that it was my privilege to
work in the hospice movement for some 16 years, mostly in the
children’s hospice movement. Although being elected to this
place was one of the proudest days of my life, it was tinged with a
little sadness, because it meant that I had to leave Martin House
children’s hospice. Through my time there and at Hope House
children’s hospice, I got to see and hear at first hand the
incredible stories of so many children, young people and their
families. I got to witness people offering care and support not only
because it was their job, but because they cared passionately about the
families they were caring for. I got to see some remarkable courage and
resilience on the part of children and of families living with the
constant prospect that their child would not live into
adulthood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:31:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000007">Many
of my friends often said that they could not understand how I could
work in such a place. Their perception was that a children’s
hospice was a depressing place, filled with sadness and despair. For
someone who walks into any children’s hospice in this country,
however, that preconceived idea simply disappears. Of course there are
sad days, when a child has deteriorated or come to the end of their
life, and there are moments of pain, but for the most part it is rare
to visit a children’s hospice and not to hear the sound of music
in the background and children laughing, and an atmosphere of warmth
and support, not to mention the wonderful smell of cooking and baking
by the
volunteers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:31:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000008">Martin
House hospice is not only the hospice that I worked at, but it serves
the children in my constituency. When it opened its doors for the first
time some 25 years ago, it was only the second
children’s hospice in the UK and it served most of the country.
As time moved on and more hospices were built, so its catchment area
changed. Today, Martin House offers practical help and support through
a range of services to some 400 children and their families. That is
the critical bit: it is not only about caring for the
child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:32:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000009">When
I spoke to many of the families, they would try to describe their
feelings on learning that their child was going to have a short life.
The most memorable reply that I ever heard was from someone who
described it as the loss of hopes and dreams. At the birth of their
child, they had dreamt about the child’s first steps, first
words and first day at school, about the child going to university,
getting married and eventually having children of their own. The family
said that they had to make new dreams when they realised that their
child would not be able to do those things. Martin House was there to
do just that: to help them to build a life for their
child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:33:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000010">The
hospice offers a host of services that have developed over 25 years
through knowledge, experience and listening. The impact on a family in
which there is a child or young person with a life-limiting illness is
difficult to 
<?notus-xml column=253?>imagine, but Martin House—like all hospices around the
country—is committed to being alongside the children and their
families. Such close work has helped Martin House to develop and fine
tune what it has to offer, providing truly family-led care and
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:33:43"></hs_TimeCode>. The
ongoing day-to-day care of a child with a life-limiting illness, which
may go on for a number of years, can be a physical and emotional strain
on the whole family. Martin House shares that care with them, and it
can take various different forms from symptom control, through
emergency and respite care to terminal
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000011">Respite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:34:08"></hs_TimeCode>
care offers the opportunity for a short stay to give the family a
break. I spoke to one father who said that if he got up eight times in
the night he would consider it a good night’s sleep. His
daughter was eight years old at the time. Imagine doing that for more
than eight years—it is no wonder that they need respite and
support. Sometimes they may all stay together as a family, or sometimes
they leave the child at the hospice, but it is an opportunity for them
to recharge their batteries. Many a time I saw them looking exhausted
when they arrived on a Friday, but was pleased to see them looking much
more relaxed on Monday morning after a weekend of not having to think
about feeding the child, doing the ironing, washing or
cooking—all of that was taken care of by the wonderful
staff.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000012">Emergency
support is there for when the families hit those everyday problems that
we all experience. If a relative falls sick or there is a problem at
home, it is difficult enough for us to deal with, but for someone with
a child with a life-limiting illness such things are much harder.
Knowing that there is someone at the end of a line, in a hospice, who
is able to help is a great
relief<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:35:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000013">We

in which staff deal with parents, such as at my own local

of my constituency in that terrible situation. The care, the passion

Andrew:</Member></B> I certainly agree. I got to know Haven House
through my time working in various hospices. It and the other hospices
do tremendous care—even at the most difficult and challenging
times, they manage to do it with a great sense of dignity, which we
should all be proud
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:36:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000016">Ensuring
that the families are supported through the most difficult period is
paramount, but also beyond that, through bereavement support. What is
good about many of the hospices, Martin House included, is that the
services are offered not only at the hospice, but in the family home,
to ensure that as much as can be done is being
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T14:36:44"></hs_TimeCode>. The first
head of care at Martin House was an inspirational lady called Lenore
Hill. I remember  
<?notus-xml column=254?>that her phrase to the families was: “The answer is yes; now,
what is question?” Such a philosophy is what makes the hospices
so
wonderful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000017">Time
has gone on and medical advances have been achieved, so many of the
children are now living longer. For example, when I joined Hope House
children’s hospice in Oswestry, boys suffering from Duchenne
muscular dystrophy would invariably live to about 18. By the time I
left Martin House, however, some 14 years later, some sufferers were
living into their mid- and late 20s. Naturally, that is good and

was talking about the youngsters living longer, but the hospice
environment was generally geared towards young children. It started to
become less appropriate or even desirable for young adults to go into
the same building. The trustees at Martin House took the brave decision
to build a new, separate teenage unit in the grounds. Through generous
public donations, Whitby Lodge opened its doors in 2002, the first
hospice of its kind in the United Kingdom. It has been a huge success,
and is being replicated around the country, because young adults get to
behave just like that: as young adults. The conversation is more
appropriate to their age, and they can share and talk openly about
their own 
<?notus-xml column=255?>needs, fears and hopes. As a result, the care team can learn more about
the young people and help them where they can with
their particular ambitions. While I was based at Martin House, a number
of young people went to university, encouraged by the care team. The
team also tried to help those young people when they were going through
the transition from child care to adult social
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000025"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robin Walker" PimsId="5656" UID="13121849000274" xid="1178" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000274"><B>Mr

the young people at the hospice to say what it meant to them. The head
of care was interviewing them, so that they were with somebody they
knew and felt as comfortable as possible; she asked that young man,
“What is the most difficult thing about your condition?”
He considered the question for a moment, and what he said had a
profound effect on me. He said: “Falling in love.” At
that moment, it hit me that despite their physical limitations or their
conditions these are still young people, with all the same feelings and
hopes that we all experience. He wondered if anybody would ever love

There are some wonderful and committed professionals
providing that care in some inspirational places—not just in
hospices, but in the family home, in hospitals and in community
settings. Families with children with life-limiting illnesses are some
of the people most in need in the UK, but many are still not getting
the help and support that they require. Although services offer a
day-to-day lifeline to families, many of the challenges that they face
can be addressed only by changes to policy, both nationally and
locally.</hs_Para>

I was proud to co-host a reception in Parliament for Together for Short
Lives, the UK charity that supports all children with life-limiting
illnesses. At that event, the charity launched its policy priorities
for the next Parliament. During the reception, the audience heard from
Lucy Watts, who is 20 years old. Lucy described the impact that her
condition has on her life, the care that she receives and the needs of
young people like her. She became ill at 14, and was diagnosed just
after her 15th birthday. Lucy is fed straight into her bloodstream, via
a central line, and can sit up only for up to five hours a day. She is
wheelchair-bound, but has to spend the majority of her time in bed.

has been forgotten is that in between children’s and adults,
there are the young adults. We deserve the same recognition and
distinction as children’s and adult services, but it’s
barely recognised. There is the transition period, but young adult care
goes beyond transitioning from children’s services to adult
services. As a result, the transition can be a huge leap, too many
changes too soon without factoring in the needs of people who are not
children, but not mature adults yet
either.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13121849000033" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000033">That

sure that the right children’s palliative care services are
available, in the right place, at the right time, is crucial. Those
services should cover the whole spectrum of care, including short
breaks for children and families. Commissioned and delivered
effectively, children’s palliative care can play a
cost-effective role in supporting early discharge for children from
acute care settings through step-down care. It can also help to reduce
unplanned admissions among children to acute care settings. A
Government-commissioned funding review has highlighted that hospital
admissions in the last year of life for children who need palliative
care can cost an estimated £18.2 million. That far outweighs the
cost of providing palliative care to children outside the hospital
setting.</hs_Para>

also shown that short breaks provided by children’s hospices,
which often include health care interventions, help to reduce stress on
families and demand on public services. Children’s palliative
care services, including children’s hospices, must be funded
fairly and sustainably. Families need to know that their local services
will continue to be able to provide the care that they need—an
issue that was reflected in the 2010 coalition
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000036">I

Andrew:</Member></B> Absolutely. My hon. Friend makes  a valid
point, and brings me on to the issue of  funding from NHS
England. Children’s palliative  care is commissioned by
the NHS using two separate methods. The first is through NHS England
specialised commissioning. The care is commissioned directly by NHS
England, and covers functions such as prescribing unlicensed medicines
and managing complex symptoms. NHS England has published a
specification for specialised children’s palliative care
services, which came into force in
October.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000043">The
second means of commissioning is through clinical commissioning groups,
which should commission the more general aspects of children’s
palliative care. There is confusion among some CCGs about which
elements they should commission. I hope that the Minister will provide
the answers, today or later, to ensure that the CCGs know that they are
responsible for commissioning children’s general palliative care
and know what that should be.</hs_Para>

statutory funding for children’s palliative
care in England is patchy and inconsistent. For example, local NHS
commissioners contribute an average of only 13% to the care costs of
children’s hospices. However, that masks significant variation.
Three hospices in England receive no local funding from their NHS
commissioners, and three organisations account for one third of their
total income. The Government currently provide a central grant of more
than £10 million through NHS England to address the shortfall,
and they have committed to introducing a new per-patient funding system
for children’s hospices as part of the coalition
agreement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000045">The
umbrella organisation, Together for Short Lives, shares the aspiration
and vision for a transparent funding system that is fair to all
sectors, and it is supporting NHS England to develop it. However, there
is growing concern in the children’s palliative care sector
about whether an NHS tariff will deliver a more sustainable future, and
how practical it will be to implement. I have a couple of questions for
the Minister. Will she set out an implementation and commissioning plan
for the tariff, including a commitment to consult on the detail and
fully test the tariff? Will she commit to a simple tariff that includes
the central elements of children’s palliative care, including
short breaks when there is an assessed
need?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000046">Many
families rely on short breaks to recharge their batteries and spend
time together. However, not all of them can access such breaks, because
commissioners do not always commission them appropriately.
Children’s hospices receive less than 2% of their care costs
from local authorities, despite £800 million being available to
fund short breaks. Half of children’s hospices receive no
funding from their local authority. Will the Minister ensure that local
authorities ring-fence money allocated to them for short breaks, and
audit local authority spending on them, to ensure that as many families
as possible are able to have
them?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0001.htm#13121849000047">I

Members want to make a contribution, so I will write to the Minister
about the final point I wanted to talk about—mobility.
Children’s hospices in the UK are a beacon of a decent and civil
society. People in other countries look to them with awe and
admiration. They do truly amazing and innovative work, and always
strive to make the best of short and difficult times. There is a
wonderful saying in the hospice movement: “While we cannot add
days to their lives, we can add life to their days.”

their child is in safe hands. It gives families the chance to recharge

Rotherham just over 12 months ago—I see that she is not too sure
about that phrase. Bluebell Wood costs £3 million a year and as
we know, adult hospices in England receive an average of about 34% of
their funding from Government. Children’s hospices typically
receive much less Government funding—somewhere in the region of
15% of their running costs—although some get next to nothing,
and I have to say that Bluebell Wood falls into that category. It
receives 5% of its funding from Government and, were it not for the
volunteers, the rest of it would not be there at all. It certainly
would not be in the shape that it is now, providing that vital service,
not only in the hospice itself, but at home.</hs_Para>

need to declare an interest, as I shall focus on Shooting Star CHASE,
which is a fantastic organisation that serves south-west London, west
London, Surrey and West Sussex. My interest in it is that I have a
family member deeply involved in it. I am stunned—merely going
on to the website is such an education. It looks after 600 families in
the area, 365 days a year, 24 hours a day. The basic cost is
£23,000 a day, because it is not just about what is done at its
hospices. They are out helping the families and so on. They are working
outside, right across the board in the area—in the homes and in
the various organisations outside that support them. I shall focus,
because everybody is hankering to get in, only on some of its
costs.</hs_Para>

moment, Shooting Star CHASE does not appear, from my research, to
receive any money apart from charitable funding and from the
Government. As has been mentioned, NHS England provides £10.7
million, which is shared among 49 organisations, but that money has
remained the same since 2007. Shooting Star CHASE receives
£630,000 a year for its programme. A quick back-of-the-envelope
or iPhone calculation will indicate that huge amounts of money have to
be found over and above that. It is vital not only that that money is
there, but that it gets charitable backing.</hs_Para>

mentioned, it is not unreasonable that the coalition Government have
decided that they want to review how all hospices—by that, I
mean adult and children’s hospices—are funded by the
state. As has been mentioned, the review was launched in 2010. The aim
was to produce a new per-patient funding system. NHS England, as I
understand it, has set up a series of pilots across children’s
and adult’s hospices to collect the data so that the tariff can
be developed. I get the impression that the children’s hospice
movement agrees that a consistent and rational method is needed. We are
still waiting for that—it has been three and a half years to

with that development, it is perhaps worth emphasising how I see it, as
someone who has worked in the national health service in dentistry. I
have watched review after review, and I have seen how they
have become 
<?notus-xml column=262?>more complicated and more difficult for organisations, such as those
hospices, to understand. It is absolutely vital that the resulting
method of funding is not complex, nor should it be—as is classic
with the national health service—over-bureaucratic. An adequate
process for transitional funding is also necessary, because the new
funding method will undoubtedly bring in changes and shifts, with dips
and rises in funding.</hs_Para>

the new scheme, it is vital that there is no sharp change—I mean
positively rather than negatively; I hope that there will not be any
negative changes. With any changes, we need a commitment to
transitional funding, so that there are no sharp bumps in the funding.
It is progressive—these organisations are looking after children

change.</hs_Para>

my back-of-the-envelope calculation. This one small, two-unit facility,
plus all the group’s work outside, gets £630,000 from NHS

£23,000 a day comes to about £8.4 million. This
Government, the previous Government and future Governments must be
thankful that they are not being landed with the full bill. It is vital
that we recognise that we should move with the times, that we should
give people results, and bring in the transitional funding to buffer
them, as well as having a system of funding that is sensible,

should declare that I am a long-standing supporter and patron of
Julia’s House, a children’s hospice in my constituency. I
am pleased we have this opportunity to recognise the plight of families
with a seriously ill child, as well as the role of children’s
hospices and other palliative care providers in supporting them. I
endorse many of the comments that have been
made.</hs_Para>

would like to use this opportunity to highlight a
vital type of support that is lacking in many parts of the country for
these children and their families, but which Julia’s House has
helped to pioneer. Most children’s palliative care focuses on
end-of-life care, emergency care and some respite, but Julia’s
House, in response to parental demand, mainly provides all-year-round,
frequent respite care at homes throughout Dorset and south Wiltshire,
as well as in the hospice in Poole, in Dorset.</hs_Para>

families with a child with a life-limiting or life-threatening illness,
sleep deprivation, exhaustion and anxiety about the child’s
health can take a heavy toll on family relationships. Parental break-up
rates in families with a long-term seriously ill child vary, but they
are known to be higher than the national average. People commonly
report isolation, lack of time as a couple or as a family, and physical
and mental exhaustion among their worries. Knowing that a specialist
service will take the pressure off them for a few hours at a time of
their choosing each week can be the difference between coping and not
coping. It is even better if the service comes to their own home, as
many families cannot easily transport their fragile
child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:18:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000094">In
the more than 10 years since Julia’s House began to provide this
care, evidence has emerged that many parents see frequent respite as a
factor in helping them to stay together as they try to cope with their
child’s complex round-the-clock care needs. The impact of the
frequent respite service and the flexibility afforded by offering much
of it in families’ own homes earned Julia’s House the
accolade of health care charity of the year at the 2012 national
charity
awards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:18:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000095">Julia’s
House and Bournemouth university are now researching the extent to
which frequent respite care helps couples with a seriously ill child to
stay together. Their three-year study will conclude in autumn 2015,
with interim results available in autumn 2014. Reliable data from the
research could point the way towards a change in policy. It is in
nobody’s interests, including the welfare state’s, for
the parents of seriously ill children to separate. If frequent respite
can play a preventive role, and if successful models of support are
emerging, health and wellbeing boards should be asked to make frequent
respite for families a strategic priority. As well as involving
Julia’s House the research project will widen early next year to
include client families from a selection of children’s
palliative respite providers in
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:19:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000096">When
the research started, the Julia’s House chief executive Martin
Edwards met officials at the Department for Work and
Pensions and the family policy unit to explain the research aims. The
officials were naturally interested in tracking the results. I hope
that the Department of Health and the Department for Communities and
Local Government will take a similarly close interest, along with
policy makers in all the main political parties. We all like to talk
about reducing family break-up, but we struggle to find levers for
that, and the project could provide one. Julia’s House will
share the research results with the children’s palliative care
sector and representatives of the three main political
parties.</hs_Para>

voluntary sector, is very important, but it may come after a process of
several years. Many 
<?notus-xml column=266?>children diagnosed with a life-limiting or life-threatening condition
will live into their teenage years or beyond, and it is important to
make that time as happy as possible. The cumulative effect on parents
of sleep deprivation, exhaustion, isolation and anxiety is enormous.

hon. Lady makes a great point about respite care. The Forget Me Not
children’s hospice in Huddersfield opened its doors formally
this year, but for a couple of years its nursing teams have been going
into the community, helping 50 families. I volunteered with them last
summer and remember vividly a single mum with a very ill child, whom
they would help two mornings a week. She has not had more than two
hours of unbroken sleep in the past six years, and those two mornings a
week are the only times when she gets a little time to herself, whether
to have her hair done or meet a friend. The contribution of those teams
to her life make her a better mum, and help her to care for her child
better. It is an excellent

family in my constituency likened the pressure to slowly drowning, in
exhaustion. In their words, “The only name on the life raft read
‘Julia’s House’.” For families elsewhere in
the country, in the numerous places where there is no genuinely

the Minister and look forward to her response. The research is likely
to show the great benefits to commissioners of spending more money on
respite

many hon. Members have said, and others will know from constituency

have concentrated in the debate, as people often do when talking about
the hospice movement, on children’s and adult hospices, which
are vital. However, there is an area in between that is all too often
overlooked: the need for more palliative care, and hospice care and
treatment, for young people aged between 18 and 40. The needs of
someone in their late teens or 20s are completely different from the
needs of children, or of aged adults, who make up a large proportion of
the 
<?notus-xml column=267?>people cared for in adult hospices. Things have been improving in recent
years, with greater recognition of the situation, but I do not think
enough account was taken in the past of the age group in
question.</hs_Para>

will be honest: 10 years ago it would never have occurred to me that
there was a problem. I assumed that someone who was not a child would
go to an adult hospice, where the care would be wonderful—as it
is—and that would meet the needs of even a young adult. However,
when I met my constituent Denise Whiffin, and the friends around her,
it was brought home to me how much extra attention and concentration is
needed to meet the special requirements of that age
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:26:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Denise
Whiffin’s son Jonathan was diagnosed, aged three, with Duchenne
muscular dystrophy. Of course he was cared for through the
children’s hospice movement. However, when he was in his late
teens that was of course no longer the most appropriate form of care.
He moved to an adult hospice, with people who were much older, and
whose needs, outlook, attitudes and requirements were totally
different.</hs_Para>

Whiffin and others in my constituency looked around and came across a
role model. I believe that it was the first hospice to be created in
this country—in Oxfordshire—specifically for those aged
18 to 40. The group was inspired to try to replicate that in
Chelmsford, to provide the same sort of help for mid-Essex. Those
involved have done sterling work in the past decade, raising money from
scratch. For some years they have been able to provide a wide range of
badly needed services for young adults, in the patient’s home
setting. Those things include specialist advice and support; unique
care packages for each patient, drawn up by the clinical nurse
specialist; expert advice on transition from children’s to adult
services; practical nursing care; respite care in the home;
counselling—which is vital for many families and young people;
and a chaplaincy service and music therapy. They have expanded because
of demand for specialist care for the age group, and their hope and
ambition now is that in due time they will acquire premises in which to
provide health care and palliative
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:28:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sarah Champion" PimsId="6005" UID="13121849000299" xid="1242" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000299">Sarah

continuity of care. Just because someone reaches a cut-off point in
their age and lifespan, they should not

have been providing their health care up until that point. The
individual’s needs and requirements might progress or change so
that their consultant or other health care practitioner needs to change
because of the skills that they have, but that is a totally different
argument. I hope that my hon. Friend the Minister and the Department of

would like to make some observations and reflect on the journey that I
have been on this past year in engaging with this subject, starting
with a question to 
<?notus-xml column=269?>my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on 5 December last year. In that
question, I raised the issue of Naomi House hospice, which serves
Wiltshire, Hampshire and Berkshire and does amazing work, along with
all the other hospices mentioned this afternoon. Naomi House hospice
also has a facility, opened in recent years, for young people in the
18-to-25 age group, reflecting the fact that, previously, young people
with some of these conditions did not survive for very long, but now

Khalid Aziz, who was the chairman of Naomi House hospice for well over
20 years, observed that he received funding from three different
primary care trusts, as they then were—they are now clinical
commissioning groups. Wiltshire, which is my local authority
area—it was the PCT at the time—had agreed a very simple
tariff arrangement whereby it gave £308 per night for
any child who was staying at the hospice. Naomi House had not managed
to secure a similar agreement with Hampshire or Berkshire. It therefore
relied on a share of the grant from the Department of Health and some
other statutory local authority funding, but, as with all hospices, it
fundamentally relied on raising money through fundraising activities. I
think that the figure was about £4 million a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:35:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000117">A
little time passed and then, on 13 February, I, along with Professor
Aziz, had a meeting with the Prime Minister. He understood the issue
very well. He was aware of the review that is being undertaken of
palliative care funding across all age groups, and we went away greatly
encouraged. A few more weeks passed, and I was a little concerned that
progress was not being made. I sensed that there was some reticence to
separate the issues about children’s palliative care and the
palliative care review that is under way. In the end, we had a meeting
on 19 June with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:36:35"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, Department of Health, and we set out our concern that the very
simple arrangement that works so well for Wiltshire, securing a
guaranteed amount of funding, should be rolled out across the
children’s hospice movement as the way forward. There was
general agreement, I think, among the officials at the meeting that
that amount of money was the appropriate
amount<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:37:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000118">I
came up and had another meeting on 29 July. That time, I met Professor
Alan Craft, who is the head of children’s health, and Dr Bee
Wee, the national clinical director of palliative care, and they took
me through all the work that is being done to understand the profile of
need, how we calibrate what the tariff would look like and what
conditions would go into it. I recognise that that is a very difficult
piece of work and we definitely need it to be data led, as I think
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:37:35"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

was somewhat disturbed because the system that works so well for Naomi
House could easily be rolled out. It is a very straightforward
arrangement whereby a CCG is engaged with a local hospice and has said,
“This is a contribution to the costs.” We know that there
is a significant differential between the 38% funding 
<?notus-xml column=270?>that adult hospices receive—38% of their costs—and the 10%
to 15% that children’s hospices receive, so this was a very

November, I received a letter that said that the Government would
include the local commissioning example in their national tariff
document. Basically, the process that the Government are going through
to review the whole arrangement for palliative care funding would
continue and we would wait for the outcome. In the meantime, although
Wiltshire and Naomi House would be put on the table as an example, it
would not be presented in a compelling way so that it could be taken up
as, I think, a very reasonable interim
measure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000121">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:39:04"></hs_TimeCode>
am somewhat disappointed by that final response after all those
meetings and all that dialogue, because what is needed sometimes is
yes, rigorous analysis of the facts and the issues, but also promotion
of quick solutions that would work in a very helpful way—that
would ease the enormous burden on fundraisers in making up the gap in
funding. There is great support in our communities for
children’s palliative care. I sometimes feel that because of the
very emotive nature of the work done by children’s palliative
care providers and the fact that it pulls at the heart strings, there
is always a sense that money will be found for it. I plead with the
Minister to accelerate that process if she can, because we need to
address the funding gap and ease some of the considerable pressure on
providers.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_18_PT_1/18B22D54D6D82842D3A9BC23BE801E05038B8707" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 December 2013">Wednesday

congratulating the hon. Member for Pudsey (Stuart Andrew) on securing
this debate on a topic about which he is clearly passionate. I pay
tribute to him and to all the members of the all-party parliamentary
group on hospice and palliative care for the work that they have done
to bring this important issue to the
fore.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000123">As
we have heard, there are 49 children’s hospices across the UK,
which all do fantastic work for young people and their loved ones. As
my right hon. Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron) said,
much of the hospice movement is supported by volunteers and millions of
pounds of charitable donations. Many hon. Members from both sides of
the House made passionate representations on behalf of their local
hospices and the holistic care that they provide. Hon. Members have
raised many powerful points, and I hope to touch on several of them. I
want to focus on three points covered in the debate. First, I will set
out the full scale of the care crisis facing young people with complex
health and care needs; secondly, I will explain why that is an issue
not simply for individual families but for society at large; and
thirdly, I will touch on some of the areas that need attention to make
life better for those young people, particularly those receiving
palliative care.</hs_Para>

heard, more than 40,000 children and young people in England have
palliative care needs. That includes children suffering from curable
and chronic conditions, children with severe disabilities, and children
and young people nearing the end of their life. That represents a 30%
jump over the past 10 years. There has been a particularly marked
increase in the number of 16 to 19-year-olds requiring
palliative care, as we have 
<?notus-xml column=271?>heard from several hon. Members, to around 4,000 young
people, which accounts for roughly 10% of young people under the age of
19 with complex care needs. That is in many ways a positive sign,
because it demonstrates the great advances made in science and medical
technology, and that they have resulted in people living
longer.</hs_Para>

accounts for around 14% of young people diagnosed. Cancer Research UK
figures show that five-year survival rates for teenagers and young
adults have risen significantly across all cancers across the past 25
years. In the late 1980s, less than three quarters of young men lived
longer than five years after having cancer, but the rate is now better
than eight in 10. For girls and young women, the five-year survival
rate now stands at 84%. There has been a particular improvement in
leukaemia; the survival rate has jumped from less than 50% to more than
60%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000126">We
are moving in the right direction, but as we have heard from hon.
Members today, that presents a particular challenge, because more young
people live beyond the reach of children’s care and transition
into social care. Too many young people who receive care from
children’s services turn 16, 17 or 18 and then fall off a cliff
during the transition to adult social and health care. The right hon.
Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns) and the hon. Member for Pudsey
highlighted the specific challenges facing young adults, and we heard
an emotive quote from Lucy Watts, who summed the situation up well.
Much more needs to be done to make the transition work better. Some of
my constituents who have accessed wonderful services at the Alder Hey
children’s hospital struggle when the health professionals and
familiar surroundings that they have been accustomed to for so long
change—a point that my hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham
(Sarah Champion) articulated. Many families are shocked by the reduced
support that they receive in many aspects of adult social care after
they have made that
switch.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000127">Transition
is a hugely stressful process, and in most cases families are moving
from dealing with a single, comprehensive agency to managing several
different agencies with up to four points of contact. It is easy for
gaps to emerge in that fragmented process. Many conditions reach crisis
point in late adolescence, so it is all the more important that young
people and their families receive responses from care and health
agencies in an appropriate, sensitive and timely fashion. There are too
many instances of people having to endure the agony of being put on
hold, or waiting for a reply to an e-mail, when their loved one has an
urgent care
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000128">That
is all in the context of a crisis in adult social care. Since 2010,
£1.8 billion has been cut from council budgets for adult social
care, and we await the impact of the local authority settlements, which
have been released today. That means that fewer people receive help
with paying for their care and more people face increased charges for
vital services that help them to get up and get washed, dressed, fed
and helped to bed at the end of the
day.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000129">Let
me make a brief comment on the wider costs to society. Demand for care
is growing at a time when resources are being reduced. The costs to
society of a bad care transition—whether those costs take the
form of greater illness, negative social and educational outcomes, or

my welcome for some of the modest measures the Government put forward

me conclude by looking at some areas that still require attention, and
with a few questions for the Minister. I praise the many charities
working in the sector, particularly Marie Curie Cancer Care, which has
a hospice not too far from my constituency, and Together for Short
Lives, the leading UK charity for children with life-threatening and
life-limiting conditions. Their joint “Don’t let me
down” report, published last year, set out sensible and
important proposals, a number of which the Government adopted, but four
areas of concern remain.</hs_Para>

we need a much more joined-up approach to commissioning health and
social care services for children with palliative care needs.
Currently, we have a split: NHS England commissions specialist care,
and local authorities manage social care. That fragmentation means that
the very high variation in access to and quality of services, depending
on where people live, will continue. I would be grateful if the
Minister told us the Government’s assessment of that postcode
lottery, and what they are doing to address the
disparity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000136">Secondly,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:58:23"></hs_TimeCode>children and
young people need to be consulted, so that their care caters to them
and their needs. There is a particular role for health and wellbeing
boards in that. More than half the health and wellbeing boards have
explicitly examined care for terminally ill adults, according to the
National Council for Palliative Care. The likelihood, however, is that
far fewer will have engaged with children and young people on the same
scale. I would welcome a response from the Minister on that specific
point. Thirdly, the different agencies that provide hospice and
palliative care to children and young people need to talk to each other
much more. Local authorities are unable to share data. What solutions
are Government considering to address that problem? Fourthly,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T15:59:07"></hs_TimeCode>a solution needs
to be found to enable all the information and records about a young
person’s needs to travel with them. Too many young people have
to tell their story all over again when they need to access a new
service, or when they are
transitioning.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000137">The

care and palliative care for children and young people is an important
and sensitive subject. From what the shadow Minister said, I can see
that there is a good degree of cross-party consensus on the need to
take the subject seriously and to sustain the way we serve the sector.
The coalition placed great emphasis on palliative care in the coalition
agreement, which included several specific commitments, such as a
commitment to placing hospice funding on a more transparent and
sustainable footing—that has been the subject of many comments
today—and to introducing a new per-patient funding system for
all hospices and providers of palliative care, so that the most gravely

we are keen to continue that substantial level of support now that
responsibility has transferred to NHS England. We recognise the need
for change in how children’s hospices are commissioned and
funded. While a new funding system will be introduced in 2015, and
while we have provided money to support hospices until then, we know
that more needs to be done to support effective local commissioning.

deal with transition, and stop there being a cliff edge when a child

According to Shelter, the proportion of homes rented privately in the
United Kingdom has rocketed by nearly 70% since 2001, with the private
rented sector now home to 3.8 million households in England alone.
There is no doubt that the private sector is playing an increasingly
important role in meeting housing needs, especially for families.
However, this rapid expansion in the market has been marked by a few
rogue landlords and some well-meaning but ill-informed
landlords, who are failing to ensure that the homes they let
comply with basic safety
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:11:14"></hs_TimeCode>.

I was a student in Manchester in 1972—I know that is going back
a fair way—I entered the house in Whalley Range where I had my
digs and a loud hum could be heard. It was coming from the fuse-box
situated 
<?notus-xml column=278?>near the front door. As I was curious, one day I looked inside. The
reason for the noise was clear—in place of fuses, there were
several three-inch nails. Until very recently, I assumed that nothing
like that could happen today. As we have already heard, however,
according to Government statistics the cause of more than half of all
accidental fires in homes is electrical. Tragically, last year 25
people died in fires that started because of an electrical fault, and
we also know that other people have been
electrocuted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:13:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, current rules mean that landlords are under no obligation to
provide tenants with electrical safety certificates. They do not even
have to prove when the electrics were last tested unless their
properties are registered as shared houses, as the right hon. Member
for Oxford East (Mr Smith) mentioned. That is despite the fact that a
gas safety certificate is required.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121849000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000163">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:13:51"></hs_TimeCode>
problem with electricity is that very often faults are not visible.
Unlike a gas leak, someone cannot smell an electrical fault. This means
that it is possible for properties to be rented with dangerous or
faulty electrics that neither the landlord nor the tenant are aware of
until it is too late, which can mean the loss of a loved one.
“Too late” is just not good
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:14:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Luckily,
Mr Parker, my constituent, who raised this issue with me,
was aware of problems in his rented property. He was seriously
concerned about the electrics in his rented house in Eastleigh and came
to me. He showed me alarming pictures of exposed wiring that quite
frankly looked like a death-trap. Shockingly, there was loose wiring,
some of it in close proximity to water. This was self-evidently not a
new problem. If it had been and if his landlord had immediately taken
action, as a responsible landlord would do, none of this would have
come to my attention. But unbelievably Mr Parker’s landlord
would rather run the real risk of injury or death to his tenant and
damage to his property than repair the
defects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000164">Of
course, on hearing Mr Parker’s concerns one of my first
reactions was to ask if he had any kind of electrical safety
certificate for the property. Imagine my shock when I discovered that,
under the current regulations, landlords do not have to certify the
safety of the electrics in a rented property in any way. As a result,
the judgment of what is classed as safe comes down to a personal
opinion rather than scientific fact.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:15:21"></hs_TimeCode>Gas safety
testing is mandatory on a yearly basis. Both gas and electricity are
dangerous if there is a fault. So we apparently believe in protecting
tenants and their neighbours from fire and injury caused by gas, but
fire and injury caused by electricity is fine.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:15:30"></hs_TimeCode>Of course, if
someone is renting a room in a house of multiple occupation, or in a
hotel or bed and breakfast, electrical checks are required, meaning
that if someone is staying in a hotel or renting a bedsit they are
safer than they would be in their own home.</hs_Para>

is evident that current laws are just not up to scratch. The Landlord
and Tenant Act 1985, and the housing health and safety rating system
brought in under the Housing Act 2004, have proven to be inadequate,
mainly because they neither protect the landlord nor the tenant against
unknown faults. The law assumes that the tenant is aware of faults.
When I moved into my house in Bishopstoke in 1994, all the electrics
looked perfect. However, an electrical safety check showed up several
worrying faults that could have had tragic
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:16:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Needless to say, they were repaired. A simple five-yearly check,
similar to the gas safety check 
<?notus-xml column=279?>that landlords must carry out on a yearly basis, would ensure that
tenants and landlords are protected against such
risks.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121849000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000166">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:16:26"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Members are surely aware, the Communities and Local Government
Committee agrees that a change in the law is needed. In its latest
report on the private rented sector, which was published in July, the
Committee recommended that the Government develop an electrical safety
certificate and legislate to ensure that landlords carry out full
wiring checks every five years. This recommendation is backed by the
Electrical Safety Council, the Chartered Institute of Environmental
Health, the National Private Tenants Organisation, the Residential
Landlords Association and the National Association of Professional
Inspectors and Testers, an electrical certification body.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:17:06"></hs_TimeCode>, the
Government have rejected this proposal, arguing that it would increase
red tape<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:17:06"></hs_TimeCode>. Their

administrative aspect of electrical certification could be minimised by
including such documentation alongside existing gas installation work.
Most qualified gas engineers are also qualified electrical engineers.
It is also important to remember that the introduction of the type of
measures proposed in the Select Committee’s report would protect
not only tenants but landlords. Accidental landlords, such as those
people who inherit a property, are very often unaware of their
obligations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:18:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
Indeed, a study by the ESC showed that almost half of all landlords and
tenants admitted that they had no idea who was responsible for
electrical safety. Therefore, landlords are exposing themselves to
significant financial risks, from fines and invalidated insurance, by
not meeting their electrical safety obligations. That is not to mention
their conscience if a tenant is injured or killed by an electrical
fault in their property, which could result in a lifetime’s
burden of guilt.</hs_Para>

of the last points that I want to make is a wider point about tenants
having the confidence to complain about such important issues as
electrical safety. Both the ESC and Shelter have significant concerns
about the power imbalance between tenants and landlords. I welcome the
recent announcement from the Department for Communities and Local
Government that it will be looking into the possibility of restricting
the use of section 21 eviction orders that apply to assured shorthold
tenants following the receipt of such a complaint. I have been made
aware of instances where a tenant has been issued with a section 21

existing health and safety rating systems and whether smoke and carbon

alarms are required only in certain circumstances, where particular
sources of heating, such as solid fuel, are installed, but we are
reviewing whether that duty should be extended. We are looking at
existing licensing and voluntary accreditation of landlords, building
on the discretionary licensing scheme that exists in several urban
areas at the moment. Bristol city council has just started a
discretionary licensing scheme to improve the standard of private

are also considering what redress might be available for tenants; for
instance, whether landlords should be required to repay rent where a
property has been found to contain serious hazards. I agree with my
hon. Friend that it is shocking that retaliatory evictions might occur
where a tenant has made a reasonable request of their landlord for an
improvement to be made to their property. They should not face the
threat of deprivation by losing their home. The Department does not, at
the moment, have any comprehensive evidence that retaliatory eviction
is a widespread problem. My hon. Friend mentioned evidence from
Shelter. Perhaps he would be kind enough to share that with me after
this debate, so that I can raise the matter with Department

the health and safety rating system, local authorities have strong
powers to inspect properties and make sure they are safe, healthy and

prohibiting use of the dwelling; undertaking the works directly

require the installation of

monoxide alarms. This was the subject of an amendment and a debate in
the other place, during the passage of the Energy Bill, when the
Department announced that 
<?notus-xml column=282?>it is undertaking that review. Smoke alarm ownership is quite high, with
86% of all domestic buildings having at least one smoke alarm.
Ownership of carbon monoxide alarms is much lower, estimated at about

gives local authorities some degree of control over the condition of
privately rented housing in their area. Large HMOs are subject to a
mandatory licensing scheme. As part of that, a smoke alarm must be
installed in the building. A
local<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:28:21"></hs_TimeCode> authority
can also require that an electrical safety certificate is produced on
demand, but that is in the narrower circumstances of
HMOs—narrower than those my hon. Friend is talking
about—which are already subject to a local authority licensing
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000184">Local<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:28:30"></hs_TimeCode>
authorities can decide to licence other rented housing. I mentioned the
discretionary licensing scheme. At the moment, this can be applied
where general antisocial behaviour is found in an area of high private
sector rented accommodation or low housing demand. Our review will look
at whether those conditions should be widened. Where that licensing is
in place, an authority can impose conditions requiring regular checks
of electrical installations of the sort that my hon. Friend
requires.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000185">In
the review into property conditions, we will also consider whether a
landlord could be required to pay rent if they let out a property that
contains serious hazards. Landlords are already liable for fines if
they are found to be breaching certain conditions, but we are
considering how tenants may receive redress and compensation, and the
repayment of rent seems to be a good way of doing that. That is subject
to the review, and I urge all hon. Members present to contribute their
views to that
review<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:30:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000186">As
part of the review, we are also considering the letting agents market.
As I am sure many of us know from the experiences brought to us by our
constituents, and possibly from our own personal experience, many
private rental properties are secured through a letting agent. The
majority of agents provide a good service, but some do not and charge
tenants excessive fees for a poor service, which might include not
giving information about electrical installations or white goods in the
property<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:30:47"></hs_TimeCode>. From
2014, all letting agents will have to belong to a redress scheme, which
will ensure that tenants have access to an independent adjudicator, who
will be able to investigate complaints about a letting agent and order
compensation to be paid, if
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:31:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000187">Before

see STV as the Scottish broadcaster in a devolved nation, and its
unique position has now been recognised. Without seeking comment from
the Minister, I would say that, as a broadcaster, STV makes a good
contribution to Scottish dialogue and to the field of production, which
I will not discuss today. We have to recognise STV’s impact on
Scotland’s creative industry. There are very few people at the
centre, in the production team. STV sucks in, develops, encourages and
grows the other independent organisations that are required by
television production, which is a very good

second part of moving forward into Scottish television’s future
of broadcasting to a devolved nation is recognising that the various

they are real. I am a west coaster, but I now live near the east coast.
My constituents often see things through an Edinburgh-centric prism,
and people on the west coast often see the world through a
Glasgow-centric prism. The people of Ayrshire complain that others do
not recognise the importance of Ayrshire, and they may in fact have a

regions of England. People in England will look at their digital

local television services as prominent and as near to the top of the

city television is launched in Scotland it will at first be based in
Edinburgh and Glasgow. Because city television is
independent—although it is a public service
broadcaster—the question will be whether it is viable. Will it
have enough users in each area so that advertisers fund the channel
properly and allow it to develop correctly? In the future, people might
have their own digital menus and the channel will be there for them to
use, but at the moment that will not be the case. Obviously we see
public service broadcasters in the first 10 channels. I understand that
Ofcom has a responsibility to provide “appropriate
prominence” to public service broadcasters, and I would define
Scottish local television as a public service broadcaster. The first 10
channels include Sky and—no offence to ITV—ITV2, but the
public service broadcaster for Scotland will not be found until channel
25 or 26, which seems to me to be inappropriate. There is too much of
one thing and not enough of the other. If we really are saying that we
want Scottish local television to develop as a recognised public
service broadcaster for a devolved nation, not a separate
nation—I am totally opposed to the idea of
independence—we must recognise it as a public service
broadcaster. We should be supporting it, the Minister should be
supporting it and Ofcom should be doing whatever it
can<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:39:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000200">The
Minister and Ofcom will say that it is not really in their gift to make
one broadcaster give up a channel to another and that it is Digital UK,
the operator of the digital terrestrial television platform, that needs
to be persuaded or perhaps instructed to do that. I am unsure of the
Minister’s powers here, but he may outline their limitations
later. I would be happy to hear that his focus and control could be
extended, although it may require a change to Acts of Parliament. It is
incumbent on the

public sector broadcaster. The point is that STV gives a different
view. We have seen that most people now tune into “Scotland

STV has a particular

Gael colleagues say to me that there is something odd about running
rugby with Gaelic commentary, because it is not necessarily a natural
selection of sport for people in the Gaeldom, who would perhaps rather
watch something else. Borderers watching rugby, and even sometimes
football, often have to listen to Gaelic commentary, which can be
confusing. It may be of interest to the Gaeldom, but not necessarily to
others. I am not suggesting that we should push BBC Alba off the first

moving to channel 26, 27 or wherever. Investment in UK-originated
public service content has declined by some 20% in the past five years,

somewhat limited in its powers on this issue. Ofcom maintains that it

dealing with such an effective chief executive is good news, because
whenever he comes to lobby Ministers, he has a clear and specific aim

update the regulations. I will write to the hon. Gentleman, setting out
in detail the criteria for the licence slots. It is important to note
at this point, however, that local television is a new service;
although it is public service broadcasting and should therefore have
due prominence, that must be balanced against the fact that other
stations already had slots that their viewers had got used to. There

need to make a number of points. First, we are talking about new
channels, so we should celebrate the fact that we are getting local
television in Scotland. Secondly, when bids were invited, those who bid
for local television slots in Scotland knew at the time that they would
get channel 45. Importantly—and in a testament to the importance
of local television and to the fact that Digital UK, which has in
effect now taken over DMOL, also considers it important—when new
slots became available, local television was moved up the EPG. It moved
initially to channel 41 and then to 34; it has now reached 26, as it
moves up the virtual hit parade. That is a significant

Connarty:</Member></B> I may be anticipating the Minister’s
comments, but I will draw him out anyway. My point is that if money has
to be spent on advertising for people to find their local channels,
revenue is being taken away from use on other things—I mentioned
my positive view of production by STV—and advertising time on
the main channel, which could have been sold to other people, is being
taken away to advertise the new channels. 
<?notus-xml column=289?>If we believe in local television, we need to get it in parts of the
country other than England and Northern Ireland. We have to give some

Vaizey:</Member></B> It is important that I do not say too much, in
case I get anything wrong, but it occurs to me that STV can certainly
use its continuity announcements to make regular reference to city
television being on channel 26. STV need not detract from
its commercial advertising time, which is incredibly important to its
finances. STV will take an imaginative and innovative approach to
ensure that its viewers are aware that it is running effective local
television. Furthermore, it is worth making the point that STV has
already pioneered the way with web television, with—off the top
of my head—about eight local web TV services for viewers to
access<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-18T16:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121849000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/halltext/131218h0002.htm#13121849000225">As
I hinted earlier, I am in regular touch with Digital UK about local
television. It understands the importance that I personally attach to
getting the best outcome possible, in particular given the challenge of
the new services and getting them established. As I said earlier, I
hope that the hon. Gentleman recognises that we have made considerable
progress. I am due to meet Caroline Thomson, the chair of Digital UK,
in the new year and will raise the issue again with her, as I recognise

hon. Gentleman pointed out that local TV services have been designated
as public service broadcasters, so they should benefit from the
requirement that such services are prominent on the EPG. As I said,

existing channels. That gives me the opportunity to move on to what I

hon. Gentleman made a number of points about BBC Alba, pointing out its
prominent spot on the Freeview EPG in Scotland. BBC Alba is an
important service and is designated as a public service broadcast
channel, as local TV is. It was launched in September 2008 and took the
free channel 8 slot when it joined Freeview in 2011. That has helped it
to attract viewers, which in effect makes the hon. Gentleman’s
point. It 
<?notus-xml column=290?>now has 0.5 million viewers a week on average, with 3.4
million tuning in via the BBC iPlayer last year. In fact, there was an
86% increase in iPlayer viewings in that year compared with the
previous year. The decision to allocate the channel 8 slot was made by
DMOL, now taken over by Digital UK, in line with its code on EPGs. I do
not want to comment on whether the new local television service should
take precedence over BBC Alba, but no doubt both the BBC and Digital UK
will be watching the debate and reflecting on the points the hon.
Gentleman has made.</hs_Para>

questions. First, is it the case that BBC 1 will have the channel 1
slot, BBC 2 will have the channel 2 slot and BBC Alba will have the
channel 8 slot? That gives the BBC a good run in the top 10—the

engaged with Digital UK and it clearly took notice—although I
would not claim that it was as a direct result—because local TV
has effectively been first in the queue when channel slots have become
free, and has moved up to the channel 26 slot. That is in line with the
regulatory system, which requires due prominence for public service
broadcasting—and local television is designated public service
broadcasting—balanced against the contractual situation with

area coverage permits the UK to provide additional investment to firms
in the designated areas. It does not bring specific funding, instead
offering eligibility for certain forms of financial support. Other
forms of financial support are available inside and outside assisted
areas, including aid for research and development, to improve access to
venture capital and to support environmental projects. Additionally,
all areas of the UK will be eligible to apply for European structural

within the Commission’s guidelines, the draft map published
today represents a thorough, evidence-based approach to allocating the
UK’s population coverage. We have proposed assisted areas based
on a combination of the potential to use regional aid to encourage
economic growth in localities through levering private sector
investment, as well as the economic need of the locality. A strong
principle underpinning the proposed map is to use our coverage to focus
on areas that are able to use the flexibility provided. There are many
deprived parts of the UK that do not have the scale of industrial or
development sites necessary to exploit assisted area
status.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000050">The
Government are seeking to refresh the map, not simply add coverage to
those places that already have it. Economic geography evolves along
with the rules which dictate coverage, and assisted area status does
not benefit every ward in the country that currently has designation
and could be economically beneficial to many wards that currently do
not. Local enterprise partnerships (LEPs) in England and local
authorities (LAs) in Scotland and Wales led in responding to stage 1 of
the consultation, 
<?notus-xml column=99?>and 41 out of 49 of their returns sought increased coverage. We have
ensured that allocation is given to those areas where it can make
the most difference, and difficult decisions have
had to be made as to which areas are included on the draft map. We now
look forward to receiving the responses which will help shape the final
assisted areas map
2014-20.</hs_Para><hs_8Statement UID="13121862000017" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000017">Contingencies

next year so that councils can deliver a council tax freeze. Councils
now have more stability and certainty to plan budgets and move ahead
with transforming local services and ongoing efficiency. English local
government accounts for £1 of every £4 spent on public
services, and is expected to spend some £117 billion
in 2013-14. So the settlement that we are proposing recognises the
responsibility of local government to find sensible savings and make
better use of its resources. This settlement marks the second year of
business rates retention, and leaves councils with considerable total
spending power, with an overall reduction, excluding the Greater London
Authority, for next year of just 2.9%. We expect the average spending

£2,089.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000072" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000072"><I>Supporting

recognise the additional costs of delivering services in rural areas.
We will be providing an efficiency support for sparse areas grant worth
£9.5 million so that the most rural local authorities can
continue to drive forward efficiencies in their area. This is an
increase on the grant paid for this purpose in 2013-14 and we intend

this we have increased the protection that the safety net will offer,
so that no council will face a loss of more than 6.9% in their spending
power in 2014-15, a higher level of protection than we offered both
last year and the year before. We have achieved this by increasing the
amount we have made available to protect councils through the
efficiency support grant, now worth some £9.4 million in
2014-15. But we will expect the councils in receipt of that
funding—in line with the efficiencies that we are asking all
councils to deliver—to improve services. It is unfair on the
rest of local government to expect them to subsidise other
councils’ failure to modernise public services. In order to
further facilitate effective budget planning, we are also making
available illustrative figures for 2015-16, and we announced in June
that we will be making £3.8 billion worth of pooled

those councils who bring in jobs and business will be rewarded for

£650 million this year and will be some £916

our growing population, and to implement the universal infant free
school meals entitlement. I am also pleased to publish Sebastian
James’s review of progress since his original 2011 report on
education capital. I am also announcing the Government’s main
school funding allocations for 2014-15 through the dedicated schools
grant (DSG) and the education services grant
(ESG).</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000107">This
Government’s overriding priority for capital investment is to
ensure every child has a place at school. Demographic pressures have
put strain on schools in many parts of the country. That is why we have
more than doubled funding for new places to £5 billion in this
Parliament. By May 2013, this investment had already helped to create
an additional 260,000 school places with more still to
come.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000108">Today
I am announcing further funding for new school places up to 2017. We
are giving local authorities longer-term allocations for new school
places, which will give them more certainty in their planning. We are
targeting funding more effectively, based on local needs, through using
data we have collected from local authorities about the size of schools
and forecast pupil projections. We are also analysing local authority
capital expenditure on new school places, so that there is greater
accountability and transparency around how they use these
funds.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000109">The
major investment I am announcing today will enable local authorities to
make sure that there are enough school places for every child who needs
one in the years to come. The number of pupils in England is rising and
is set to continue to rise well into the next Parliament. Ensuring that
every child is able to attend a good or outstanding school in their
local area is at the heart of the Government’s comprehensive
programme of reform of the school system. To achieve this we will
provide an additional £2.35 billion to support local authorities
to plan and create new school places that will be needed by 2017. This
is additional to the £5 billion that has been
allocated between 2011-15. Extending the allocations to a three-year
period will allow local authorities 
<?notus-xml column=107?>to plan strategically for the places they need. I have listened to the
particular challenges faced by London, and therefore the methodology
used to allocate funding for 2015-17 takes into account the higher
costs of building in the
capital.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000110">I
am also announcing further details about capital investment in 2014-15
to support universal free school meals for children in reception, year
1 and year 2 in state-funded schools. As part of the autumn statement
the Chancellor confirmed £150 million of capital funding for
improving school kitchen and dining facilities in order to offer every
infant pupil a free nutritious school meal at lunchtime. Universal free
school meals for primary school pupils were a key recommendation of the
independent school food plan produced for the Department by Henry
Dimbleby and John Vincent in July 2013. The aim is to improve academic
attainment and healthy eating, and save families
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000111">Turning
to revenue funding, the distribution of the dedicated schools grant
(DSG) to local authorities will continue to be based on the current
“spend-plus” methodology for 2014-15, set out in three
spending blocks for each authority: an early years block, a schools
block and a high-needs block. The underlying schools budget will be
kept at flat cash per pupil for 2014-15. To protect local authorities
with falling pupil numbers we will continue with arrangements to ensure
that no authority loses more than 2% of its budget in cash
terms.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000112">Although
the overall schools budget will stay at the same level on a per pupil
basis before the addition of the pupil premium, the actual level of
each school’s individual budget will vary. To protect schools
from significant budget reductions, we will continue with a minimum

the CRC energy efficiency scheme on behalf of schools. A deduction of
£50.5 million will be made from the DSG for 2014-15
to compensate the Exchequer for the loss of revenue resulting from
local authorities no longer needing to meet the costs of purchasing

proposed Hinkley Point C investment contract. I welcome the
investigation and the consultation that will follow which will seek
views to enable the Commission to make a legally robust decision. Such
investigations on the part of the European Commission are a standard
part of the process for interventions that are novel and complex and
the raising of doubts, questions or concerns as part of this process is
also to be expected. Indeed, this is what happened on the Royal Mail,
property tax on telecommunications infrastructure and Nuclear

European Commission’s decision represents another important step
forward in progression of the state aid case for Hinkley. Alongside
Royal Assent, today, of the Energy Bill and my Department’s
publication tomorrow of the electricity market reform (EMR) delivery
plan and revised version of the contracts for difference (CfDs) terms,
this opening decision for Hinkley demonstrates excellent progress in
delivering the Government’s EMR programme. Investment contracts,
such as those proposed for Hinkley, are in effect early CfDs and, like
CfDs, they are a market-oriented instrument designed to incentivise
investment in new low-carbon generation while ensuring an appropriate
allocation of risks between generators and consumers. This investment
is needed at scale if the UK is to play its part in meeting the
EU’s common security and diversity of supply and decarbonisation
objectives, all at least cost to the consumer. EMR, taken together with
our other energy interventions, for example in relation to energy
efficiency and the pursuit of interconnectors with other member states,
will help ensure that the UK is able to make its fullest contribution
to achieving a single EU energy market.</hs_Para>

UK’s electricity market reforms are groundbreaking, with much
of Europe following our progress with close
interest. This is particularly so in the case of CfDs. CfDs are
necessary given the current market failures and are an innovative
intervention, with impacts on competition and trade limited to the very
minimum required to ensure that security of supply and decarbonisation
objectives can be achieved. For example, as set out in the commercial
agreement on key terms for the proposed Hinkley Point C investment
contract that I announced on 21 October this year, any contract awarded
to EDF for Hinkley would include in-built mechanisms to prevent
overcompensation. These include construction and refinancing gain
shares and operating cost reviews taking place at 15 and 25 years into
the contract term. Indeed, CfDs are less distortive and less generous
to generators than some other interventions, which have previously been
approved by the
Commission.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121862000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/wmstext/131218m0001.htm#13121862000130">We
have already provided a substantial amount of information and evidence

have been discussing the case and EMR more generally with the
Commission for the past 18 months. I now look forward to considering
the opening decision, and continued close engagement with the
Commission on Hinkley and other EMR-related state aid cases. The
Hinkley investigation will include a public consultation period during
which third parties can provide views to the Commission and there will
of course be opportunity for the UK Government to provide further
evidence to the Commission on why the agreement we have reached with
EDF is consistent with state aid rules under the European

this month, the Chancellor announced further reductions to departmental

2014-15, the Home Secretary has decided that central Government revenue
funding to the police will be protected from further reductions. This

funding for 2015-16 will be made at a later date after careful

police reforms we have introduced have seen the biggest change to the
policing landscape in a generation. These reforms are working and crime
is falling. We have put policing back in the hands of the public
through directly elected police and crime commissioners. We have given
chief constables greater operational independence by scrapping national
targets. We are improving police skills through the new College of
Policing. We have made sure we reward skills, not just time served,
through the Winsor reforms to pay and conditions. And we have
established the National Crime Agency to lead the fight against serious
and organised crime.</hs_Para>

crime commissioners with the opportunity to submit bids on initiatives

areas where there is a national policing interest. We have already
announced that the Independent Police Complaints Commission will be

additional £18 million from the police settlement to build up
the resource and capability of the IPCC to begin taking on additional
cases from next year. We are also providing funding of up to

2014-15 the Home Secretary has also decided to provide HMIC with

decisions on police funding in 2014-15 will provide the police with the
resources they need to carry out their important work. We recognise
that the funding settlement remains challenging. However, as HMIC has
identified, there are areas where the police can continue to make
further savings without affecting the level of service to the public,
for example through greater collaboration across operational and
support services, through improved procurement of goods and services,
and by improving productivity. The Home Secretary and I are confident

whether a part of income tax in Wales should be devolved; and, subject
to a vote in favour in a referendum, the Bill will enable the Assembly

Rail. The new timetable and passenger capacity at Bolton have been
discussed with both operators as they have developed the timetable
changes necessary for the electrification of the Manchester to Scotland

their proposals. It is for the railway industry to best match passenger

During the first week of the new timetable, operators have advised that
there has not been a significant increase in crowding on peak services
between Bolton and Manchester. Passengers travelling between Preston,
Wigan and Manchester are being advised to travel via the new TPE route
using Wigan North Western station. This will help provide more places
for passengers travelling from stations on the Bolton line. Northern
has worked with the Department on contingency plans to provide
additional morning peak capacity on the Bolton corridor if morning peak
passenger demand exceeds operators'
expectations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121870000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131218/text/131218w0001.htm#13121870000209">As
they are introduced to the Manchester to Scotland route, the new TPE
electric trains will further increase the number of seats between
Manchester and Wigan. From May 2014, additional capacity will be
provided on TPE services serving the cities of Northern England. This
will increase the capacity across TPE routes by around 30%. This will
include a fifth train each hour between Manchester and Leeds. A new

how employers can better support people with dementia in the workplace.

of the key changes we have made to the Right to Buy is to ensure that
all additional receipts raised from local authority Right to Buy sales

1,622 homes have been started on site or

will invariably be a certain time lag between the Right to Buy sale and
the construction of the new build home, but the replacement timetable
is in control of the local authority. If a council were to fail to
spend the receipts within three years, it would be required to return
the unspent money to government with interest. This provides a strong
financial incentive for any slow-coach councils to use this new funding
and get on with building more homes for local people.</hs_Para>

Lamb:</Member></B> The Government does not have plans to issue guidance
solely aimed at employers and employees on identifying signs of early
dementia. However, next year, Public Health England, working with
Alzheimer's Society, will launch a three year, £12 million
social movement to make the nation more aware of dementia and how to
help people with the condition. Aside from public-facing activity, the
movement will target business partners and urge them to continue roll
out the Dementia Friends programme within their organisations, giving
their employees an understanding of dementia and the 
<?notus-xml column=663?>supportive action they can take to help themselves, family, friends and
customers. In addition, the NHS Health Check programme offers advice
and support to help people aged 40 to 74 make lifestyle changes that
can reduce their risk of dementia and other conditions, and now
includes dementia awareness advice for those aged 65 to 74 years.

military. In the UK we have a strong tradition of youth uniformed

who were received into custody for contempt of court between January

covers a wide variety of conduct which undermines or has the potential
to undermine the course of justice. I welcome the Law Commission's
report on contempt and look forward to discussing its
recommendations.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table tabstyle="nofoots"><tgroup cols="2"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="50*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="50*"></colspec><thead><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2" valign="bottom"><hs_TableHeading><I>Month

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the
courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to
ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are
used.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
