2009-10. Also, 1.5 million new apprenticeships have been
created since the Government came to power. Our reforms will ensure
that apprenticeships are even more rigorous and responsive to the needs

Britain has not been good on technical education. Therefore, the

apprenticeships represents a real success story and a real
breakthrough. It is also good that we are involving employers in the

Apprenticeship is a real success story of our country and we should all
encourage it as best we can. We have announced eight trailblazer
projects, which will be the first to develop new standards and
approaches to assessment for apprenticeships. These began work in
autumn 2013. My noble friend raised the important issue of small
businesses. Almost 50% of our apprenticeships are in small businesses
but there is only a 13% take up. Therefore I am delighted that the
apprenticeship grant, which we have also launched, will allow new
employers with fewer than 1,000 employees to take on new apprentices
aged between 16 and 24, which the Government will be supporting

Young of Norwood Green (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the
Government’s focus on the value of apprenticeships, building on
the work of the previous Government. Does the Minister agree that,
especially in the 16 to 18 group, demand vastly exceeds supply? To keep
on quoting the figure of 510,000 when the large majority of those are
adult apprenticeships does not address that particular problem. We have
almost 
<?notus-xml column=903?>1 million NEETs and that is the area the
Government need to focus on. We still have only a small number of
employers taking up apprenticeships. The figure is somewhere between 4%
and 18%, and only a third of the FTSE 100. What additional action are

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> On the contrary, I would say to the
noble Lord that we are tackling the problem head on. We talked earlier
about mentoring. The noble Lord is very good role model for
apprenticeships and how much one can achieve. I pay tribute to his
personal example. On what the Government are doing right now, on 28
October we published our plans for reform in <I>The Future of
Apprenticeships in England</I><I> </I>and those reforms will do exactly
what is required by increasing the quality of apprenticeships. This is
not a numbers game. It is about setting higher expectations with a
focus on English and maths. Equally, we are putting employers in the
driving seat, making sure that rigorous training is delivered and thus
ensuring economic growth. Finally, we are simplifying apprenticeships
by replacing long and complex frameworks with a simpler procedure to
increase take-up, particularly by small
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T11:13:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Neville-Rolfe (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, when dealing with
apprentices as an employer a few years ago the biggest problem that we
faced was bureaucracy. There were bureaucratic requirements for
extensive record-keeping that we at Tesco could just about manage, but
for smaller companies it is obviously a big issue. Is the system now
less bureaucratic? Will the Minister comment on that very important

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My noble friend has raised an
important point which the Government acknowledge and the consultation
proved that apprenticeships needed to be simplified. I go back to my
last point by saying that we have done that by replacing long and
complex frameworks with one-page standards written for employers to
encourage take-up in the SME sector. Equally, we are providing
additional grants in the small business sector for organisations with
fewer than 1,000 employees. My noble friend talked about the experience
at Tesco. I think that large employers have a key role to play in this
and Tesco is one example among others of companies that are doing very
well. Rolls-Royce in Derby provides 100 to 200 apprenticeships a year
and that goes across the board. Large employers and the SME sector both
need to be encouraged. Apprenticeship is a success story and we should
all get behind
it.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_12_PT_1/7E37BC781D82B9882913D31D08DDF90ABEBA9D98" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 December 2013">Thursday,

accommodation being provided, why is that the case and what are we
going to do about it? I raise this as a former Minister for Housing
who, some 25 years ago, started, rightly or wrongly, the grants for
rough sleepers. Nearly 50 years ago, almost to the day, I was one of
those who set up Crisis at Christmas—now called
Crisis—which all goes to show that 50 years can be a short time

friend for his long-standing interest in, and efforts to combat, rough
sleeping. I think that I can be quite confident in saying to your
Lordships that none of us wants anyone to end up on the streets. Our
first priority in government is prevention, and we have invested
£470 million on measures to prevent people ending up on the
streets. However, in the sad event that prevention does not work, we
need to ensure that those who do end up on the street are supported and
moved off them as quickly as possible. That is what we are doing. We
have provided £34 million to the GLA, which is using
some of that money to fund the No Second Night Out campaign. I am
pleased to report to noble Lords that 75% of first-time rough sleepers
last year did not spend another night on the streets. Rough sleeping is
increasing but we are getting people off the streets more
quickly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T11:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Rooker" PimsId="448" UID="13121261000455" xid="1615" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000455">Lord

remind the Minister that, by 2005, the previous Government had
virtually eliminated the problem of children and families living in
hostel accommodation. The situation has deteriorated since then. I am
not casting any blame but I have a suggestion. I know that the lady I
am about to mention is incredibly busy but, when the Minister goes back
to the department, could she commission Louise Casey—who set up
the original system in the early part of the previous decade that
brought about that result in 2005—to take a few minutes off from
dealing with troubled families to have a look at what has gone wrong
and why we have ended up with children back in hostels? It is quite

the number of local authorities accepting families as

and breakfast accommodation for more than six weeks, which the noble
Lord will know is the statutory limit for any family
to stay in a B&amp;B. Overall, because of the money
that we are investing in prevention, which I spoke about earlier, the

the private rented sector these measures apply only to new and future
tenancies and have not been applied retrospectively to people in

retirement, the Government agree that they should get the best from
their retirement savings. That is why we are already taking action to
combat excessive pension charges. It is also why we set up the Open
Market Option Review Group, which introduced measures to prompt
consumers to shop around for an annuity and secure a better retirement
income. The Financial Conduct Authority is also looking, through its
thematic reviews, into the important issues that this report raised.

that low interest rates are a key determinant in supporting growth, and
that growth is in the long-term interest of the entire community. The
Bank of England has given forward guidance in respect of when interest
rates might rise. Monetary policy is firmly in its purview rather than

report indicates that insurers can make £35,500 out of a

dysfunctional market. The Government have been told this for years.
Given that the annuities market will double by 2015, is there not a
case for the Government to consider a standing commission on pensions,
which can look at the industry and pensions in the long term to ensure
that people are not ripped off and that they get the best deal for

new development in pensions is around auto-enrolment. In this area, the
Government have set a cap on allowable fees, precisely to deal with the

undertaking a thematic review of annuities, which will look at fees

Phillips of Sudbury (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, would the Minister not
accept that, after the latest in an apparently endless series of
disillusioning revelations about the cynicism of too many parts of the
financial sector in particular, it is about time that we as a
Parliament, and indeed the Government, made clear to the people of this
country that there is a limit to what we can do in these issues? They
bear on profound moral issues. Perhaps the time is right for us to, in
effect, throw the ball back into the court of Mr and Mrs Britain and
call upon them to exercise their own, individual moral autonomy and

depressing state of

Newby:</Member></B> There are obvious limits to what government and
Parliament can do, but I have always believed that one of the very
important things that Parliament can do is to act as the bully pulpit
and set out what it thinks is the correct way of behaviour. In terms of
the financial institutions we have instituted, as the noble Lord knows,
a number of pieces of legislation in this area but, as the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards pointed out, culture is
very important—that is, the culture of the industry and also of
consumers. A big problem around pensions 
<?notus-xml column=910?>in particular is that virtually no consumer understands the product that
they are buying, which makes it very difficult for us to get people to

review, which brings together the Government, the regulator, providers
and consumer groups. It is looking at how we can promote best practice.
There is also an ABI code which, for example, requires insurers to no
longer send out application forms so that people take out an annuity
automatically with the company with which they have their pension pot.
We are bearing down on this issue, and what the report that was
produced only this week shows, is that there is further to go. However,

that while some of the

others are controversial. But there is one thread running through all
this: how we can best achieve informed patient choice. We are better
able to discuss death today than ever in the past and it is becoming
less of a taboo subject. This is in large part down to the work of the
hospice movement, other stakeholders such as the Dying Matters
coalition, successive Governments who have implemented the end-of-life
care strategy, and the ongoing public and parliamentary debate on
assisted dying led by Dignity in Dying, to which I owe my thanks for
some of the help that it has given me in this debate, and indeed in the

like to say a little about what has influenced my own views. I
remember, as vividly as if it were yesterday, the debate on my noble
friend Lord Joffe’s Bill in this House some years ago. I
listened hard to that debate; at the beginning of it, I was not even
certain where I stood, but by the time I had heard the arguments I
realised that I could not vote to deny other people something that I
would want for myself. So of course I supported the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T11:39:57"></hs_TimeCode>, and have
been a supporter of that cause ever since.</hs_para>

was at about that time that a friend of mine with motor neurone disease
was dying. I went to see him, his wife and children around him, and he
tapped out a message to me on a keyboard, the only way in which he
could communicate because he was no longer able to speak. His message
was that I should support the change in the law to permit assisted
dying—a very passionate plea from a person who could not
actually speak with passion. That was almost the last time I saw him
because he died at home shortly afterwards. It moved me enormously in
my attitude to this whole issue.</hs_para>

is worth noting that palliative care, an area of healthcare that
focuses on alleviating the suffering of patients, is, by comparison
with other established forms of healthcare, a fairly modern
development. I believe that palliative care merged with the hospice
movement in the late 1960s, and since then it has made great progress
to ensure that patients at the end of life can die comfortably and
peacefully. Of course there is still some way to go in making this a
reality for all people at the end of life, but I believe that this
House will be united in its admiration for how far we have come in such
a short space of time and would like to join with me in expressing my
admiration for the healthcare professionals, in both the NHS and the
wider hospice movement, who have dedicated their lives to alleviating
the suffering of their patients.</hs_para>

we know that the journey to date has not been without difficulties and
areas of controversy. The House will be aware of the recent concerns
raised in the media about the Liverpool care pathway for the dying.
These concerns resulted in an independent review by the noble Baroness,
Lady Neuberger, in July, which recommended the phasing out of the
pathway, a recommendation that the Government accepted. There are other
documented cases where standards of care at the end of life have fallen
well short of what we expect, some of them highlighted by the Patients
Association.

understand by patient choice. Some people are uncomfortable about that
concept. There is a concern that the patient may not make a free choice
but may somehow feel under pressure from those close to him or her,
possibly not always from worthy motives—I have had that point
put to me. However, it is only right to point out that there are no
safeguards at all in going to Switzerland to have an assisted death
provided that one can afford the air fare, so my noble and learned
friend’s Bill would actually improve the situation significantly
by having safeguards in the process. The issue is whether there can be
satisfactory safeguards for an ill patient who may also be in

to the experience in Oregon, which of course introduced assisted dying
about 15 years ago. All the assessments conclude that the law worked
safely. Eligibility has never been extended beyond terminal illness,
nor has there been pressure for it to be extended. Numbers are very
low. Assisted deaths have remained stable since 2008 at around 0.2% of
all deaths per year. There is no evidence that potentially vulnerable
groups are negatively affected. Around 40% of dying people who meet the
strict safeguards to obtain life-ending medication never use it, simply
taking comfort in having the option. That is a crucial point. It means
in practice that people in Oregon who are terminally ill and in great
pain can be in hospice care, knowing that if things become intolerable
for them, they can opt to take the medication that will end their
lives. Because people in Oregon feel that they are in full control,
they seldom exercise that choice. That, to me, is one of the particular
arguments in favour of a change in the

journey. This seems to be an intolerable dilemma which we impose upon
people. Assisted dying and palliative care are not, and should not be,
alternatives. As was stated by the noble Earl, Lord Arran, in a debate
last week, the former chief executive of the Oregon Hospice
Association, Ann Jackson, told the Select Committee on my noble friend
Lord Joffe’s Assisted Dying Bill that the Oregon Act had not
adversely affected the hospice movement. In fact, hospice provision had

a difficult conversation to have, more so because he thought that I was
absolutely mad to be having this conversation. He turned to me in his
way and said, “Well, dear, we’ll just have to see how it
goes and what’s best at the time”. As it happened, he did
die at home, but he would not have wanted to do so if that was a
terribly distressing situation for my mother and it was more
appropriate for him to be in another setting. That element of
individuality in these choices is tremendously
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000095">Like
the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, I came to the Select Committee as someone
without objection in principle, understanding about the hard cases and
moved by them but as an ex-law student who had had it drummed into me
that hard cases made bad law. Therefore, I was concerned as to whether
adequate safeguards could be incorporated to make sure that there was
no pressure on individuals to avail themselves of this option. My
experience of taking evidence, visiting Oregon and going to other
jurisdictions, persuaded me that it was possible to provide those

were two other things that I learnt in the course of the past 10 years.
One was that no one can speak for their demographic on this issue.
Different

cannot speak for 64 year-old female Jewish parliamentarians in good
health. There are probably quite a few of them around. I cannot speak
for that group. There are differences of opinion among doctors—I
am a member of the General Medical Council—nurses, people with
disabilities, people of faith and, indeed, ministers of religion.

second thing I have learnt concerns the insurance cover value of
assisted dying legislation, to which the noble Lord, Lord Dubs,
referred. In Oregon, the latest figures for 2007 show that 9,800 people
considered a prescription for assisted death out of 30,000 who died.
Just over 1,000 talked to a doctor about the prescription. Of these, 85
received the prescription and only 49 used it. However, other people
gained great confidence and strength from knowing that if life was
intolerable at the end, something could be done. I gain confidence from
the fact that I have in place an advance directive about what should
happen to me. I think that that confidence should be extended to others

existential event which raises and asks significant questions. Those
questions are often suppressed, masked by humour or denied, but surface
in times of vulnerability throughout our lives. What is it of the human
person which endures? What light does death cast on the way in which we
live? What is a good death? What does it mean to come to terms with our

support to the dying and to the bereaved, to patients and staff. They
are a vital part of the team in end-of-life care as a specialist
resource, as experts able to offer training to colleagues and as a
point of referral in moments of crisis. I invite the Minister in the

assertion. There is no audit system in 
<?notus-xml column=921?>place for Oregon’s law. It is totally dependent on the honest
reporting of doctors. What we do know, from the annual
statistical reports, is that the number of legal
assisted deaths is rising year on year. In 2012, the number was nearly
five times that in 1998, and the latest figure is the equivalent of
between 1,100 and 1,200 such suicides per annum in England and Wales.
It is claimed that the rising trend has levelled off. It has not. The

Committee on the Assisted Dying for the Terminally Ill Bill. I
travelled to Oregon, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, and the
noble Lord, Lord Taverne, in 2004 to see how the Death with Dignity Act

opponents that there has been a meteoric, inexorable rise in the number
of people who have an assisted death in Oregon. Quite aside from the
fact that a modest rise should be expected in a new system such as
this—proving, surely, that the system is working well—we
are still looking at a very small number of cases each year. There have
been fewer than 80 cases each year, representing less than a quarter of
1% of all deaths in that state. In this country, as has already been
said, that would amount to approximately 1,000 to 1,200
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000117">What
better proof can there be of the law’s effectiveness than the
continued support of Oregonians themselves? They voted to retain the
Act by 60% to 40%, and polling consistently confirms that between 75%
and 80% of Oregonians continue to support the Death with Dignity
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000118">I can
suggest several reasons why that support remains so high. First, as I
have already said, assisted dying is not running rampant across Oregon.
It is used by a small number of people who suffer from intractable
distress. However, while assisted dying is not used widely in Oregon,
it offers reassurance—again, as has already been said—to
a great many people. Forty per cent of those who request medication
that would allow them to have an assisted death and meet the safeguards
to access the medication do not use it and die naturally. Only around
1% or 2% of those who begin the discussion with their doctor about
assisted dying actually go on to take life-ending medication.</hs_para>

reassurance to dying people that they may avoid unnecessary suffering;
it offers reassurance to healthcare professionals that they may discuss
openly and frankly with their patients the whole range of choices at
the end of life; and it offers reassurance to family members that they
need not face the impossible moral dilemma of breaking the law and
helping a loved one to die, as is the case in this country. The fears
raised by those who are opposed to a change in the law have simply not
materialised. There are no documented cases of abuse in Oregon.
Vulnerable people are not disproportionately affected by the Death with
Dignity Act. There have been no public calls to extend the Act to cover
those who are not terminally ill or do not have mental capacity,
proving that the alleged slippery slope does not exist. Indeed,
assisted dying is now law in the states of Washington, Denver and
Montana<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T12:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000120">As
I said last week, palliative care continues to play a vital role
alongside assisted dying in Oregon, showing that they are not mutually
exclusive. Of course, we must offer excellent palliative care for all,
but we must also acknowledge that some people who are dying, even with
the very best palliative care, will suffer at the end of life. For this
small but significant minority of people, our current law is not
working. As so often happens, it tends to be society as a whole that
eventually brings about the great humanitarian reforms. Witness, first,
the Sexual Offences Act 1967 on homosexual reform, which incidentally
was introduced by my father in your Lordships’ House; and,
secondly, the Abortion Act 1967 and further such legislation in 1990.
Ultimately, it is the will of the people that pushes open the barriers
and Parliament has to act. Both of those reforms involved the
possibility of death. This Act deals directly with death and it is
critical therefore that we get it right. Against a background of a
growing majority of public support, I believe that we have got it

suicide. Let it be remembered that we used to prosecute people who

profound difficulties in devising the right legislation, with real
dangers to be avoided and real concerns to be met, and of course it is
imperative that nothing is done to imperil the continuing availability

close. We must recognise the vulnerability of the terminally ill and
ensure that they are not subject to the least pressure to end their
lives a day earlier than needs be. Obviously, assistance must be given
only to those of sound mind with a clear and settled intention of
ending their lives early. All these safeguards seem to me to be fully
enshrined in the draft Bill of the noble and learned Lord, Lord

condition, insupportable 
<?notus-xml column=926?>though he found it after suffering for so long, was not terminal in the
sense of dictating that he was likely to die within six months.
Secondly, his case was argued on the basis that he could not himself do
whatever was required actually to end his life. He needed more than
assistance to commit suicide, and in fact he needed what under the
present law can only be described as mercy killing. One might have
thought, with his position being even more helpless than that of
someone who can at least self-administer the final medication, that the
law should be, if anything, the readier to allow him the choice of
death.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000146">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T12:34:46"></hs_TimeCode>

assisted dying is working out in Oregon and the various other American
states where it is practised. As far as it goes, I shall certainly
support the Bill of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer. Surely
the underlying principle must be to promote human dignity and autonomy

final point is one that has been made, and rightly made, by a number of
other noble Lords. The great advantage of the Bill would be to give the
terminally ill the knowledge that they have a safety net available if
things get too terrible. In some cases, that confidence and
assurance—that the time and manner of their ending is ultimately
in their own hands—will not only give them peace of mind but
actually prolong their lives, by deciding them against committing
suicide early, while they are still able to do so unaided. That, I
recollect, was very much part of Mrs Purdy’s thinking in the
very last case that we heard in the House of Lords as Law
Lords—the subject of that picture in Committee Room 1,

Lord Bishop of Chester:</Member></B> My Lords, I join other Members of
the House in welcoming the reinforcements to the Bishops’
Benches. I will make three brief points in my contribution, the first
of which does not have a direct connection with assisted suicide. We
typically have long waiting lists today for transplantation surgery in
this country, due to an absence of an adequate supply of donated
organs. I hope that we will do as much as we can, and more, to
encourage people to carry organ donation consent cards and to engender
a culture in society in which transplantation and donation of organs
are encouraged, especially for those whose death comes in an untimely
and unchosen
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T12:37:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T12:38:03"></hs_TimeCode> is a matter
of choice at the point of death, as are the things that we are
discussing in the main part of this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000149">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T12:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>
religious communities exhibit a particular reluctance to support organ
donation, which often works to the disadvantage of the members of that
community who are waiting for transplantation. For some time, efforts
have been made to overcome this reluctance. Earlier this week, a new
interfaith organ donation action plan was launched, backed by the 
<?notus-xml column=927?>NHS and with the active involvement of a number of churches including
the Church of England. I mention this simply to
underline that there are various issues connected
with choice at the point of death beyond the main issue of
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T12:38:04"></hs_TimeCode>’s

to issues of choice in relation to assisted suicide, I acknowledge the
strength of the momentum for legalising assisted suicide, which has
been well illustrated in the contributions to the debate so far. I must
acknowledge the state of public opinion on the matter, which I believe
is likely to get stronger. For a society that has now embraced abortion
by choice, the move to assisted suicide by choice might seem, in moral
terms, rather a modest step. I am surprised that this connection is not
made more often, although two noble Lords in today’s debate have
acknowledged it and, in last week’s rat-a-tat-tat debate, the
noble Baroness, Lady Hayter, made quite a lot of it, saying that the
parallel between abortion and assisted suicide was connected by issues,
as she put it, of common humanity. Whether one accepts that parallel or
not, and whatever one makes of the parallel, I believe that the wider
social context is crucial to our debates on this subject. Choice always
has a context, and the context of our society has changed and is
changing. I need to acknowledge
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000151">I remain
personally opposed to the change in the law that is in the Bill of the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer. But the question with which I
wrestle is: on what basis can I prevent others who take a different
view from making their choices on the basis of a change in the law? It
is a somewhat open question but I think I am still persuaded that in
order to sustain justice for the vulnerable in our competitive and
individualistic society—the context in which we are discussing
this matter—there would have to be very powerful bulwarks in the
law to prevent the exploitation of the weak and vulnerable.</hs_para>

safeguards in the draft Bill, changes in the law tend to create their
own momentum, as has been well illustrated with what has happened with
abortion. For me, that is where the problem will lie if a change in the
law is based too much on the notions of choice and autonomy to which a
number of noble Lords have referred very centrally. If you accept

the heart of the debate there is, unfortunately, an illusion or a
self-deception: the suggestion that under the present regime the
medical profession does not get 
<?notus-xml column=928?>involved in determining the timing or circumstances of the death of its
patients. In fact, as we all know, for a number of generations it has
been pretty widespread practice for doctors who have a patient who is
in distress right at the end of life to accelerate the process. One
doctor put it to me as, “helping the patient on his way”,
generally by administering a lethal dose of an opiate or perhaps a
barbiturate. This is not talked about because of course it is against
the law, so there is a great deal of hypocrisy here, but we should not
have any illusion about the
truth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000156">More
frequently in recent years, the patient has been referred to a hospice
and there a clinical decision is taken steadily to withdraw the
necessary means of life support: resuscitation, ventilation,
antibiotics and dialysis will be denied or withheld. In the case of
someone who was very close to me, liquids were denied. The only thing
that was administered was a sufficient amount of opiate to keep the
poor patient comatose, presumably on the grounds that if she was killed
by an overdose of the opiate that would be against the law, but if she
was killed by dehydration that would not be against the law. She
actually took two weeks to die. I cannot think of a more cruel

support the Bill of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, for
three reasons. First, it would liberate the patient and give the

profession from these agonising dilemmas—the conflict between
the law and the duty to do the best for the patient. The third reason
goes to the heart of the responsibilities of this House. The law in
this country—in any country worthy of the name of a country
living under the rule of law—ought to be clear, unambiguous,
respected and upheld. The law in this area is none of those things in
this country. The law is cruel, anomalous and nobody takes it

area, jurisprudence has changed the law in respect of establishing the
double-effect rule. No doubt the GMC will be producing guidance on what
doctors can and cannot do, particularly as new pathways are brought in,

be made by judges under jurisprudence. It certainly should not be made

Meacher (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, applaud the noble Lord,
Lord Dubs, for moving today’s Motion. I strongly support his
position that every individual should have the right to decide how much
suffering they must bear. Of course, we acknowledge that right for
those who want to continue until the end point and take any suffering
that life throws at them. We just ask for the same right for those of
us who wish to take advantage of it. Patient autonomy is a well
established principle in medical ethics, enshrined in professional
guidance. How can we justify removing the right of choice—the
autonomy—at the end of life when people most need it? I simply
do not understand that. To respond to the noble Baroness, Lady
Nicholson, we are not here talking about euthanasia, yet most of her
contribution was devoted to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000169">I shall
not repeat the very eloquent points made by many noble Lords but will
instead focus my comments on two other end-of-life issues, particularly
the right of choice. One is the right not to be resuscitated when life
has become unbearable and the second is the right to decide where we
die. When a person has capacity, there is no excuse at all for not
doing what they wish. Yet, routinely, patients are resuscitated against
their wishes and do not die in the place of their choice. The Mental
Capacity Act 2005 created advance directives that should ensure that
patients’ wishes are known and followed should they lose
capacity. However, even when a patient completes an advance directive
and a copy is included in their medical records, too often it proves
useless because we do not have in place procedures that ensure as far
as possible that emergency services and hospital staff know that an
advance directive exists, let alone what it says. We need a national
policy that governs exactly how and where advance directives are
documented. It sounds a trivial point, yet there is really no use in
having a document hidden away in some GP’s surgery when the
ambulance men turn up and have to make
decisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000170">One
suggestion is a register of advance directives similar to the organ
donor register. Of course, it should be electronic for easy access.
That would greatly increase the likelihood that emergency services have
the information they need when they need it. Will the Minister consider
whether NICE should publish guidance 
<?notus-xml column=931?>on the detail of these advance directive procedures, such as how they
should be recorded and stored, and what procedures the emergency
services should follow to make sure that they access that crucial
information? I understand that, shortly, electronic medical records
should include advance directives. Again, these must be user-friendly
and accessible quickly. Will ambulance men have access quickly to that
information? Also, will the Minister propose to the CQC that it gives
priority to inspecting these procedures? In mental health services, the
CQC gives terrific focus and priority to how documentation is
preserved, kept and stored in relation to detentions in hospital. If
the CQC gave anything like that priority to advance directives, the
care of elderly people towards the end of life could be radically
enhanced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000171">Now
I turn to the issue of where patients die—I will do this rather
quickly. The issues are raised very clearly in the Macmillan Cancer
Support briefing. The fact is that 73% of cancer patients want to die
at home but only 29% are able to do so. There are all sorts of reasons
for this, such as a lack of free social care at the end of life. Can
the Minister say a little about that? There is also the lack of 24/7
care, most particularly nursing care. Again, what does NHS England plan
to do about that? Thirdly, there is the need for the early
identification of people at the end of life. Is the Minister able to
provide some statistics about the projected numbers of domiciliary
nurses available over the next five years relative to last year? I hope
that the Minister can provide some reassurance to this

Lord Dubs, for providing us with the opportunity to debate this topic.
It is being proposed that the law should be changed to allow assisted
suicide. This presupposes that there is agreement that the law as it
stands is not adequate. What is being referred to by some noble Lords
today would represent a major change to the criminal law. Parliament is
being asked to agree that some people, namely doctors, should be
licensed by law to involve themselves in deliberately bringing about
the death of some others, namely people who are terminally ill. This, I
propose, is no small adjustment; it is a major change of the

suggest that if your Lordships’ House is to consider such a
proposal seriously, it needs hard evidence that currently the law is
not fit for purpose and if that is so, that which would be put in its
place would be better and, above all, safer for us all. I do not
believe that such evidence has been produced. All we hear are some
honeyed words about the need to reduce suffering and some ill informed
claims of what the law says and how it works.</hs_para>

told that the law does not provide certainty as to whether a person who
assists a suicide would be prosecuted. As citizens, we most certainly
have the right to know what the law is. I submit that we do know. The
law is clear: encouraging or assisting another person’s suicide
is a criminal offence. Discretion is provided to the Director of Public
Prosecutions to decide whether a prosecution is 
<?notus-xml column=932?>needed in the individual circumstances of any case. There is a published
prosecution policy setting out how such decisions are reached and
providing some of the circumstances which might incline the DPP to
prosecute, or not to prosecute. This, however, is not sufficient for
those who wish to see assisted suicide licensed by law.</hs_para>

that someone who breaks the law and assists a suicide does not have
certainty as to whether the offence will be prosecuted. Certainty
cannot be given as the outcome of a breach of the law will depend on
the circumstances in which it was committed. To give assurance that a
prosecution for assisted suicide would be in this or that circumstance
would clearly amount to changing the law. Further, we are encouraged to
believe that the law is cruel because of the maximum penalty that it
holds in reserve— some 14 years. But no sooner do we work
ourselves up on this issue than we are told that the law is not working
properly because those who break it are not being prosecuted.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121261000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000176">The reality, when the
spin and fog is cleared away, is that we see a law with a stern face
and an understanding heart. The penalties which the law holds in
reserve are, I suggest, sufficient to make anyone minded to assist
another person’s suicide think very carefully before proceeding.
As a result, the offence is rare and the few cases that reach the DPP
tend to be those where there has been serious soul-searching and
genuinely compassionate assistance, perhaps somewhat reluctantly given.
In such cases, the DPP is able to exercise the discretion that the law
provides. I suggest that before there can be serious discussion of how
the law should be changed by Parliament, we need clear and convincing
evidence that it should be changed and that what would be put in its
place would be better and safer—safer, that is, for us all.
Until that evidence is submitted, we should return these proposals to
the drawing
board.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_12_PT_1/E95360A554E8FBC6BE0E20315F09A7A356EAAF3B" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 December 2013">Thursday,

imprisonment is the penalty, no one has been prosecuted for many years.

<?notus-xml column=933?>have to be involved. I do not think that anyone quite understands what
that means. If an assisted death has taken place and the police arrive,
they will deal with that as a potential homicide scene. They will
photograph it, isolate it and seize notes left for relatives, gifts and
computers. Those involved are under the threat of arrest, are
interviewed under criminal caution and will face months of waiting for
a prosecutorial decision, and it may not be possible even to have a
funeral very quickly. However kind and professional the police are, how
much more pain do we want to inflict on people who have done what they
believe to be right, out of compassion?</hs_para>

his wife, who had been diagnosed with motor neurone disease. She was a
nurse so she knew what the disease would do. She was determined to die
before she was unable to take her own life. She told her family that
but she would not ever tell them when and where she would do so, which
meant, as the witness said, that the love of his life died alone with
no one, particularly him, to hold her hand while she was dying. If that
was not enough, it did not work, of course, because the police came in

emphasise a point that is misunderstood by many of those who oppose
assisted dying: the change in the law that we are proposing would apply
to only a very small number of people in very specific circumstances.
It has nothing to do with euthanasia or helping or encouraging people
to die prematurely unless they have specifically and unambiguously
requested it. It certainly would not apply to elderly people suffering
from some form of dementia. Yet some of our opponents appear convinced
that assisting dying is just the thin end of the wedge, the slippery
slope that will eventually lead to helpless old people being quietly
put to sleep. No; as many noble Lords have already said, this is first
and foremost about individual choice, a choice that we may all have to
make when we learn that we are dying and have only a short time to
live.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121261000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000184">In the
vast majority of cases, nature will take its course and we will be
fortunate enough to die peacefully in our sleep with the minimum of
pain near our end. However, a minority of us will contract a terminal
disease or illness where we will face the inevitable prospect of
several months of severe pain and indignity, even with the best medical
treatment. Some of us will 
<?notus-xml column=934?>seek palliative care while some will choose to fight through to the end,
but others would like the option of being able to die in their own
homes on their own terms at some time before the scheduled time of
their death. To achieve that, though, they will almost certainly need
assistance, particularly from a doctor or medical practitioner. As the
law stands now, they are denied that help. Consequently, they are
denied that choice and sometimes feel desperate enough to travel at
considerable cost so that they can spend their last hours in an
impersonal clinic in Switzerland.</hs_para>

this country deny them that choice, to die in their own home with their
family around them, because of fears of slippery slopes or the second
coming of Dr Shipman? This choice would be taken up by only a small but
significant minority of people. Surely the law should allow terminally
ill patients who are in their right mind to die in the way that they
choose. Anything else is nothing less than unnecessary cruelty and a
denial of human rights. The choice—I repeat that it is only the
individual’s personal choice that I am talking about—of
being able to avail oneself of assisted dying should surely be a great
comfort to all of us, and certainly not a
threat.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121261000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000406"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T13:05:38"></hs_TimeCode></I>1.05

Hylton (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, today’s debate seems to be a
dress rehearsal for the Second Reading of the Bill of the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Falconer. However, I start from antiquity, where
suicide was normal if someone suffered disgrace or their honour was
seriously impugned. The Japanese samurai had a somewhat similar view.
For the Jews, suicide largely fell under the command, “Thou
shalt not kill”. For the western world, the Christian faith
changed the earlier ways of thought. Shakespeare summed it up and gave
a strong pro-life view in Act I of
“Hamlet”:</hs_para><hs_newline10 UID="13121261000002" url="13121261000002">“Or

is clearly opposed to euthanasia. Buddhists are doubtful about the
rightness of suicide, emphasising the principle of not doing harm.
Hinduism stresses Ahimsa, which is similar, and believes in Dharma, the
accepting of moral duties. All faiths seek to minimise unnecessary
suffering. Given the views of the great world religions, I conclude
that humanists would be unwise to impose their genuine convictions on
everyone else.</hs_parafo>

from the old saying, “Hard cases make bad law”. We may be
harrowed by individual cases of people suffering great pain, longing to
die but perhaps too weak to kill themselves. Appeals to our compassion
or to the principle of utility, however, should not be allowed to
outweigh our duty to the common good of the great majority.</hs_para>

handicapped or depressed will ask, “Am I a charge on society? Am
I using resources that should be devoted to others? When will I reach
the six-month point?”. Carers will wonder, “Should I
speak to the declining person while they are still capable of
deciding?” Temptations will face the beneficiaries of wills.
Young people, perhaps aged 19 or 20, could make valid decisions, thus
robbing 
<?notus-xml column=935?>their parents of precious time still together. Doctors and nurses also
believe in preserving life rather than ending it. They have, and still

Murphy (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, there are policy priorities for the
end of life and there are legislative priorities. They are very far
apart, but intimately connected. I have no doubt that the policy
priority must be to improve the experience of dying in hospital, as
that is, at the moment, where most people die.</hs_para>

requires honest conversations between doctors, nurses, patients and
families. The antecedents of a bad death are exactly the same as those
that engender generally poor care in hospital wards. I admire the
report published by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, and her
colleagues which looked at how to replace the Liverpool Care Pathway
with individual care plans, but I fear it will not make a jot of
difference until the culture of medicine and nursing is
transformed.</hs_para>

priority is not the legislative priority, and compassion dictates that
we find a safer way in legislation to help all dying people, just as in
Oregon state the death with dignity law stimulated the public’s
understanding of death and dying and increased the provision of good
palliative care. I believe that focusing our legislation on the tiny
few who want to make their own choice of time of death will not only
help the few but will help to create an understanding of the broader
needs of dying
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000193">Let us
imagine for a minute that the Falconer Bill has already been enacted.
In the average clinical commissioning group area, we are talking about
five or fewer people a year who would make the request and fit the
criteria. That figure is derived directly from Oregon state. The noble
Lord, Lord Alton, is right  in saying that the numbers have
gone up slightly in Oregon, but there is no statistically significant
increase. It has remained at that tiny figure over the past
15 years, and it looks as if in Washington state, which is
double the size of Oregon, it will be the same. There are four years of
experience there. Five people annually are enough for a small team of
expert doctors to administer a code of practice that would be devised
by the professions and laid before
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000194">I
want to concentrate on just one safeguard because the others are fairly
easy to address. It is about what the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, in a
debate in Grand Committee so memorably referred to recently as
“the vultures”—relatives who cannot wait to get
their hands on an inheritance—and those who might exert subtle
pressures on people to kill themselves. This has already been mentioned
by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and 
<?notus-xml column=936?>has been mentioned in the past by the noble Lord, Lord Tombs, and the
noble Baronesses, Lady O’Neill, Lady Campbell and Lady
Grey-Thompson. I spent many years as an academic psychiatrist doing
much testamentary capacity expert witness work and, believe me, I know
that the vultures are circling overhead. It is crucial that we can spot
where there are profound or subtle pressures on individuals. But given
that all those seeking an assisted death will have full mental
capacity, how susceptible are they really? We do not need to guess or
to create false scares. A research review has recently been published
by the American Bar Association Commission on Law and Ageing. Almost
all those who are subject to undue influence or subtle pressures are
indeed suffering from lack of mental capacity, as you would expect.
They are very aged, frail and have dementia. They are habitually
exploited. The very few who are subject to undue influence when they
have full capacity are in those very curious situations, which are
fairly easy to detect, where one individual is very dependent on
another. We saw that recently in the case where a group of people were
subject to imprisonment. I would refer to it as emotional imprisonment.
They are very rare cases indeed. We can take account of them. A humane
society that really cares for individuals should be able to meet the
wishes of that tiny few who want to say where and how they die, with
whom they die and also when.</hs_para>

McColl of Dulwich (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, if it was possible to

conclusions from my experience. First, it is imperative that we care
for those who are suffering in this way and that we treat them with
dignity. We need to create a society in which such care and treatment
is the norm. I am so grateful to those of your Lordships and,
especially, the doorkeepers and security officers who treated Jean with
dignity and extended many kindnesses to her. It is so important to
invest our time and resources to ensure that dementia patients receive
proper care. Secondly, dependence is natural at certain stages in life.
All of us were dependent on others at birth and for a considerable time
thereafter. Dying is part of living and during that time we
may  be dependent on others. Why should that be a fearful
thing? It is probably because our society prizes independence and
schools us into it at an early age. We need to revisit this and to be
educated to appreciate that dependence is no cause for
shame.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000197">The
choice that I would like people to be able to make at the end of life

of this debate recognise that if assisted suicide is to be legal, there
must be safeguards. Many of us believe that it is not possible to
legislate for adequate safeguards. 
<?notus-xml column=937?>That aside, it is pertinent to ask whom the safeguards are intended to
protect. It is sometimes assumed that it is only the would-be suicide

is a danger of confusing the role of the health professional and

patient is not treatment, no matter what the patient may request. Where
one cannot cure, society should provide care. At present, the provision

the introduction of assisted suicide

lead to more cuts being made to end-of-life care. Assisted suicide,
instead of being an option, would be the cheaper alternative. We would
be offered either/or—rather as in Oregon, where patients have to
sign out of active treatment to access hospice support and where
palliative care is not a clinical specialty. Since our healthcare

psychoanalytic literature. Suffice it to say, the real issues at the

me, because I love him. A lot of us who love people—those who
are close to us and suffering—cannot bear it; as much as the
person cannot bear it, we cannot. I think the DPP will now say that
that is all right. That is a move forward. Fortunately, however, my

Harries of Pentregarth (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, patient choice is a
very great good and we ought to do all we can to encourage and enhance
it. There are various ways in which we can do that. First, we can make
it much more widely known that there is no moral obligation to go on
receiving burdensome treatment when it is doing no good. There is no
moral obligation to prolong life at all costs. That has always been the
fundamental teaching of both the Roman Catholic Church and the Anglican
Church. It is part of our culture and is quite properly reflected in
all medical ethical

was very glad that the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Sheffield,
whom we congratulate on his maiden speech, spoke about the Liverpool
care pathway. I myself was very privileged to be on the commission
chaired by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger, and I examined very
carefully the principles on which the Liverpool care pathway was set
up, coming to the conclusion that they were fundamentally sound. The
Liverpool care pathway was set up with good intentions, but it became
bureaucratic and was not always administered well. I very much hope
that our recommendations for the future, from pathway to personal care,
will set good palliative care firmly in place in all our hospitals, not
just in

is another way in which personal choice can be enhanced and encouraged:

choice is, therefore, a very great good. However, sometimes other goods
override the good of patient choice. I will put before your Lordships
three very simple and straightforward examples. First, a teenager in
great despair pleads with you to help them end their life. Quite
properly you override their choice because there is a greater good: the
long-term well-being of that teenager. Somebody who is deeply
depressed, who should be in a psychiatric hospital, resists going. They
have to be sectioned, and sometimes drugs have to be administered to
them so that they can be forcibly put into their hospital. Their choice
is, quite properly, overridden. If a prisoner is in danger of suicide,
they are put under “suicide watch”—a very careful
watch has to be kept on them so that they do not commit suicide.

people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T13:32:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

examples that although patient choice is a good, it is not the only
good, and that sometimes there is an overriding good. Those examples
indicate that our society values human life at all times and in all
circumstances. The noble Lord, Lord Taverne, said that the present law
and DPP guidance are a mess 
<?notus-xml column=941?>and have been brought into disrepute. However, I suggest that where you
have a very difficult situation, between lives that are unbearable and
society’s desire to convey the message that lives at all
times—even at the end of life—are of value, you are bound
to get some kind of compromise like that. The DPP compromise is
workable. It expresses society’s view that everybody’s
life, even in extremis, is of value. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, quoted

together a community of professionals and volunteers. While the
volunteers seek to achieve professional standards in all that they
contribute, the professionals are really volunteers 
<?notus-xml column=942?>themselves in bringing a quality of commitment which is way beyond what
could be expected from a contract. At its best, there is a culture of
teamwork and mutual support. Volunteers can have a sensitive and
effective part to play in family support and bereavement counselling.

Singh of Wimbledon (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, this debate takes us
into new ethical territory with complex medical, legal and emotional
implications. Rational discussion is made more difficult by a
polarisation of attitudes and opinions. I saw something of this about
12 months ago when I attended a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary
Group on Assisted Dying. I raised some concerns and was made to feel
that there was something wrong with my thinking if I could not
immediately see the open-and-shut case for changing the existing law. I
am also too aware of the opposite arguments, couched in religious
terms, that life is a gift from God and we should never, ever, even
think of curtailing
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000230">I served
for some years as a member of the BMA Medical Ethics Committee and am
well aware of major changes in society and bewildering advances in
science and medicine that require us to constantly look anew at
previously accepted views and attitudes. Sikhs accept that life is a
gift of God to be cherished and preserved wherever possible, but we are
also required to bear in mind the important Sikh teaching of
compassion, dignity and care for the suffering. These two
considerations are not necessarily incompatible. However, I am unhappy
about a narrow focusing on individual autonomy to justify attitudes
that clearly affect others. We have seen some of this today. We
constantly hear the argument that we are all individuals and that our
happiness and needs are all-important to the exclusion of our
responsibility to others. I believe that this over-focusing on self, on
me and my, is responsible for many of the ills in society today. For
example, we are all aware that religious teachings suggest that
marriage is a committed partnership for mutual care and support and for
ensuring that children grow up as responsible adults. What I believe to
be a short-sighted contemporary social attitude encourages 
<?notus-xml column=943?>us to believe that it is okay to look exclusively at our rights, without
consideration of the effect on others. This focusing on individual
needs rather than on the family as a whole is, at least in part,
responsible for the growing increase in dysfunctional families, with
children frequently ending up in what we euphemistically call care, or
with them mirroring the narrow thinking of their parents. A
person’s decision to end their own life has an effect on friends
and, importantly, on the message it can give to wider society of
trivialising life. We all have wider responsibilities in all that we
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000231">I shall
pull together these different threads in rational and compassionate
decision-making to arrive at the way forward. First, we should always
respect the gift of life and question the concept of autonomy.
Secondly, there are times when those in ill health feel that life is
not really worth living but, within a short time, they often feel that
it is not really that bad. It is worse for those who find themselves
with severe disabilities but, as the Paralympics showed, despite such
disabilities, it is often possible to live a meaningful life. Relatives
and carers sometimes find looking after someone onerous, and they can
inadvertently make their feelings known to those they are caring for,
making them feel an unnecessary burden. Sadly, there are others who may
have more mercenary motives. A seemingly hopeless situation today may
not always remain so. Huge strides are constantly being made in
combating previously incurable diseases, as well as in palliative
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000232">In
summary, while we should always be on our guard against the notion of
individual autonomy trivialising life, we need to recognise that, from
an individual’s perspective, life can become pretty intolerable
and there is an argument for helping to end it in strictly controlled
circumstances. The danger is that, if we go down this path, it could
itself be a slippery slope to trivialising life, altering the very
ethos on which medical care is provided. I feel, on balance, that we
should leave the law as it
is.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13121261000415" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000415">1.43

Mental Capacity Act 2005, this is something that is worth doing and
which preserves choice, even in the case of the person being
incompetent. One difficulty that has already been mentioned is the
difficulty of access to an advance directive, even if it has been made.
This is very serious. I have a friend who was involved in trying to
devise a bracelet that people could wear to say that they had made an
advance directive and how it could be accessed by people in the
ambulance service. She was refused hospital help in devising this
bracelet because the authorities said that they would be liable to
prosecution as assisting suicide if they were known to have helped to
devise this bracelet. That seems bizarre, because it would be a help
if, as one can carry a donor card, one could also carry some kind of
indication that an advance directive
existed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000236">A
worse difficulty is that so few people know about what their rights
actually are under mental capacity law, and that many even do not know
that there are such things as advance directives or that a power of
attorney can be given. The culprits here are general practitioners, who
should have a duty to have in their surgery accessible information
about advance directives, in the way that they have dozens of leaflets
about diabetes, asthma and other kinds of ills that people may suffer.
This seems to be something that would be very easy to do—and
then people, whatever their age or state of health, who came to the
surgery, would have access to the means of making an advance directive.
The means could be made simpler; the doctor could sign the pro forma
that could be supplied in the surgery. People could, almost as a matter
of routine, ensure that they had such a thing in place if they feared
that their treatment at the end of life would be not what they would
want and not what would be best for their own interests and the
interests of
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000237">This
is a very important change that ought to be made, and which could be

frequently talk to my GP, who I know well, about death—and he to
me. But that is very rare. On the whole, doctors need, most of all, to
change their attitude to death, because their professional and
compassionate duty is not always to save life but to relieve the
suffering of their patients. I think that this is a change that we can

Lord Dubs, for giving us the chance to discuss the final moments of
life. End of life comes in so many ways; very often there is not the
opportunity to have a choice. I was so pleased that Nelson Mandela, a
remarkable person who had been ill with a chest infection and treated
in hospital, went home, with 
<?notus-xml column=945?>medical help, and was able to die with his family around him.
Seventy-three per cent of cancer patients would prefer to die in their
own homes. However, only 29% of people with cancer are able to do so.
Macmillan estimates that, in 2012, 36,000 cancer patients died in
hospital who would have preferred to die at
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T13:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000239">My
husband, who would have liked to die at home, died in an A&amp;E
department on a Sunday because the out-of-hours doctors would not come
out on the Saturday and Sunday. On the Friday evening, when he became
ill with a chest infection, which was serious as he had many medical
conditions, the out-of-hours doctor came and prescribed a liquid
antibiotic as my husband had a swallowing problem. However, I think
that she wrote in the notes that he was not too bad. We had to drive
for miles to find a supermarket with a pharmacy with the liquid
antibiotic. This is the problem with rural healthcare; pharmacies and
out-of-hours doctors are miles away. It is much easier to get an
out-of-hours vet. With so many medical conditions it would be so much
better if the people suffering from them had a copy of their own
medical records. My husband died in a hospital 24 miles from home. The
doctor could not get any records and had only the information that I
could give him. My husband died in the presence of myself, a doctor and
a very helpful and kind charge nurse. As it was classed as a sudden
death, one had to wait for the police. The chaplain was late. So many

the House next
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T13:53:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I
particularly commend the measured and dispassionate way in which the
noble Lord, Lord Dubs, introduced the debate, and, indeed, the
generally restrained temper of the debate as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T13:54:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000243">We
do not have long, so I will make just a couple of points. The first,
picking up on a point that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, himself made, is
that assisted dying and palliative care are often portrayed as
antithetical 
<?notus-xml column=946?>to one another; indeed, we have heard echoes of this today. The
supporters of assisted dying are depicted as heartless monsters who
simply want to bump their relatives off for their money or because they
have become a burden, but this is a travesty. Most people would want to
see the alleviation of suffering that palliative care can bring
exploited to the maximum. It is only when palliative care is inadequate
or can do no more that they say an assisted death should not be ruled
out as an option. Pace my noble friend Lord Hylton, nothing is being
imposed on
anybody<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T13:54:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000244">I
certainly do not accept the argument that the desire for an assisted
death simply shows that the palliative care is not good enough, and
that it would not be necessary if it was. That is one of those
arguments that cannot be disproved because, by definition, the care
could always be better. The fact is that in practice that is not always
the case. In fact, assisted dying goes hand in hand with palliative
care. Evidence from Oregon, where assisted dying for terminally ill
adults was legalised in 1997, demonstrates that the vast majority of
people who are assisted receive palliative care and support. The use of
assisted dying legislation is very low and researchers suggest that the
reason for this may be the high quality of care provided by
Oregon’s hospices. Hospice provision in Oregon now ranks among
the best in the country, but its growth has actually gone hand in hand
with the legalisation for assisted dying rather than the reverse. Fears
of assisted dying impacting negatively on palliative care have not been
borne out; in fact, the opposite seems to be true, and assisted dying
can act as a catalyst for the improvement of palliative care. But
though palliative care may be excellent, there will still be some
people who at the end of life seek assistance to die, and they should
be allowed to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T13:56:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0001.htm#13121261000245">My
second point is that the views of disabled people are much more diverse
than is represented by disability activists. No, that is too
mealy-mouthed in an effort to avoid polemic; they are actually the
opposite of how they are commonly represented. In a YouGov survey of
1,000 disabled people reported in the <I>Times</I> yesterday, almost
80% said that someone who helps a friend or family member who is
terminally ill to die should not face prosecution. Asked what position
they thought disability rights groups should take on assisted dying for
the terminally ill, just under half said they should remain neutral,
and a third that they should support a change in the law. Only 8% said
that they should oppose a change in the

propose a licensing system for doctors to supply lethal drugs to
patients to deliberately shorten the lives of those who are thought to

illegal action by doctors in Britain is rare or non-existent. This is
not just about the complexities of an individual choosing to end his or
her life. There are ramifications for others. It is a matter of both
conscience and public safety. Others are directly involved in the
suicide, and by normalising assisting suicide an attitudinal change
occurs across society. Currently, doctors have a key role in preventing

Oregon’s figures do not confirm safety but show an almost
fivefold increase in the incidence of reported physician-assisted

Oregon since 2008 there has been a 21%

20 cases cross the DPP’s desk. Oregon has no audit system to
shed light on what is happening there. The dynamic seems to have
changed. The Bill of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, gives
eligibility criteria, not safeguards. It seems to be looser than the

no reporting and audit system to detect abuse. Indeed, in Oregon, it

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Baroness has just
reminded us, this debate encompasses two issues. The first is one that
has clearly attracted unanimous approval throughout the House: the need
to provide care and support for the dying at the end of life and to
honour their choice, particularly in relation, for example, to whether
they die at home, in hospital or in hospice—matters referred to
by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy. There is clearly agreement that
this objective should be fulfilled, and there are ways in which matters
can be taken forward from the current position. Compassion in Dying,
for example, has recommended that progress be made in dealing with
advance decisions, and simplifying the procedure for living wills and
lasting powers of attorney. The noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, referred
to establishing a register that, again, Compassion in Dying has

the highest traditions of this House in terms of thoughtfulness and

religious and practical—that need to be addressed. It is not a

necessary briefly to rebut three points that have been made by some
speakers. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, said that under the
proposals of my noble and learned friend’s Bill doctors would be
required to take the life of patients. That is not the case. The Bill
specifically deals with self-administered drugs that could end life.
The noble Lord, Lord Alton, spoke of the “emasculation”
of the hospice system. I see no evidence of that at all. As I shall say
later, I have knowledge of the working of the hospice system and I do
not think that anyone who might support my noble and learned friend
Lord Falconer’s Bill or some version of it would for a moment
wish to diminish the effective role of an important part of our health
provision. There was a suggestion by the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, that
among the major religions Buddhism was clear in its maxim that one
should do no harm. That, of course, is also the substance of the
Hippocratic oath. However, the question is: what constitutes harm? Is
it confined only to causing death? Can it not also be allowing or
facilitating the prolongation of suffering? Therefore, the situation is
perhaps more
nuanced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T14:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

introduced into your Lordships’ House, having suffered from
bowel cancer for two years, with secondaries in the liver and lung. It
was always a treatable but not curable condition. She was the daughter
and sister of doctors. She nursed her mother, who died of cancer, in
our home. She was a health visitor, a nurse and a Relate counsellor.
From the outset of her illness, she was very clear that, should she
suffer considerable pain, she would wish to be helped to end her life.
She received wonderful treatment from the National Health Service in
Newcastle and from the hospice in which she spent her last few days.

the stage, as it were, there under the system that currently prevails.
However, a minority of people can take that course and there will not

Lords may be aware of the different ways in which to document decisions
on end-of-life care. Many of the general public are not. One option is
a health and welfare lasting power of attorney. It allows someone to
give authorisation to the attorney to make decisions about health and
care, including decisions on life-sustaining treatments. Another option
is making an advance decision. This enables anyone aged 18 or older who
has capacity to make a decision about their future care. They may wish
to refuse a particular treatment or intervention in the future when
they no longer have the capacity to make their wishes known. It is a
way of making plans for the future. It is a legally binding way of
being able to refuse a treatment or intervention. An advance decision
can be made not to be resuscitated under certain conditions. An advance
decision can be made to refuse all life-sustaining care, provided that
certain conditions are met. The decision must be witnessed and made in
writing. These advance decisions are legal mechanisms to help a person
plan their care. Both advance decisions and lasting power of attorney

sense to ensure that advance decisions are stored so that they could be

advance decision should decide how best to record their decision to
suit their individual circumstances. There are also practical issues in
trying to rely on a central register to record wishes, such as ensuring
that it is up to date and accurately reflects current issues and
wishes. Even if a register was established and showed that an advance
decision was in place, healthcare professionals would still be required
to satisfy themselves that it was valid and applicable, and would have
to seek information from other healthcare staff and close family to
ensure wishes, so a register would not be solely relied on. The noble
Baroness, Lady Meacher, also raised the point of whether NICE should
issue guidance on the use of advance decisions. NICE is an independent

patients make informed choices. It is not compulsory for them to

improving the quality of people’s experience at the end of life

GPs can help make sure that that happens by offering people the
opportunity to prepare an end-of-life care plan. Care planning of this
type is not a single event. Plans evolve as people’s conditions
change or their preferences alter. This mechanism allows GPs to ensure
that people get the treatment they want at the end of their lives, and

people than any other pandemic in history, and is developing a drug

some 1,600,000 people worldwide died from AIDS, while 2.3 million were
newly infected, and for every person who was put on to antiretroviral

Africa has the biggest problem, but more than 2 million people live
with HIV in India, while in Russia and Ukraine there are major problems
of injecting drug users, home-made drugs and shared needles. Of those

antiretroviral 
<?notus-xml column=960?>drugs, many do not adhere to the treatment, storing up all kinds of
problems for the future. So, yes, not only is there a problem, but
there is an acute and urgent challenge to every Government in the

honourable friend Andrew Mitchell to increase their Global Fund

progress that has been made because it has been formidable and dramatic
in terms of the number of lives saved, but I would suggest that the
lesson is that we must not give up now. We should recognise what that
means: we are talking about a lifetime commitment to people living with
HIV. It is not a condition where, after treating a patient for six
months, you can move on to the next one. That is one reason why the
world needs to put far more emphasis than it has on preventing new
cases of HIV. As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T14:49:56"></hs_TimeCode>
I mentioned, I have joined the board of IAVI and did it for this
reason. A vaccine gives the best hope for the future: you cut through
some of the prejudice that surrounds testing and, from the financial
point of view, it opens up the hope of reducing an otherwise constantly
increasing bill. That was why—if I may say so to my noble
friend—I was surprised and dismayed a month or two ago, before I
joined the board, that the Government slashed the help from a hardly
princely £9 million or £10 million down to £1
million.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121261000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121261000309">I

That means we have to do two things. First, we need to keep up our
contributions to the Global Fund. It needs to be underlined that, in
the vast majority of cases, that has been money well invested,
resulting in tremendous advances and the saving of lives. Secondly, we
need Governments globally to engage with the  key minority
populations where the risk of HIV is highest. It is absurd, unjust and
counterproductive that homosexuality is criminalised in so many
countries in the world. We also need to treat drug dependence as a
medical issue, not just as part of a so-called and unsuccessful war on
drugs, and to introduce more clean needle schemes, which we did in this
country in 1987. We need to engage with people such as sex workers,
where the rate of HIV remains very high, and not simply pursue a policy
of looking the other way. We also need to fight discrimination against

are two types of malaria. There is the less lethal type that none the
less revisits you and debilitates you year after year, and then there
is what is called “cerebral” malaria, which goes straight
to your brain and kills you. I had the second kind. That day, I could
have easily joined the ranks of the well over 500,000 people who die of
malaria every year. I was told I had only a day or more to live. It is
only because I had access to the best medical treatment that I
survived. Today, thanks to the deal that was recently made in
Washington DC, far more people will survive and become malaria-free, as

described today in encouraging, through the leadership programme,
people from underrepresented groups to participate in political life.
We hear and see a great deal about the perpetuation of privilege in
public life in this country and it is enormously important that stories
about those who overcome obstacles and the triumph of talent are also
told as examples to others. I first heard about the noble Lord, Lord

against malaria, to which the noble Lord, Lord Verjee, referred.
Hearing the statistic that since 2001 the number of child deaths from

achieve. The Global Fund has been enormously important in that. The
Malaria Consortium is the leading UK implementer of Global Fund money.
In Uganda, with the fund’s support, we are working with the

debates about the Global Fund, it is essential that we replenish the
fund if we are successfully to continue and build on what has already
been done. The fund is hugely important, not only in its own work
but—as was made clear to me at a meeting of the all-party group
last night—in the effect it has on the upstream work to face the
new challenges and create the new vaccines, medicines, insecticides and
diagnostics. While those are being developed, there must be the
encouragement of knowing that there will be an implementation machine

will also allow the Global Fund to build and extend its work. I very
much welcome the new funding model, which seeks to align investments in
combating HIV, TB and malaria with national health strategies, while
strengthening health systems and serving as a platform promoting the
health of a person rather than combating only specific diseases. I feel
this particularly strongly when I look at the issues of maternal and

the world’s poorest people, these things do not fit into nicely
delineated silos and different funding streams; these are the health
issues of the poor. To be effective, we need to combine the programmes

schistosomiasis. Schistosomiasis increases by twofold or threefold the
likelihood that an adolescent girl exposed to HIV will contract HIV.
The treatment for schistosomiasis is very cheap but, as a neglected
tropical disease, it does not fall within the bounds of the Global

HIV positive and have TB can access anti-retrovirals. TB preys on a
weakened immune system and, without access to anti-retrovirals, TB will
progress faster in an HIV-positive patient. Co-infected patients

another clinic or another place, necessitating another long journey to
a health centre—and sometimes the provision does not exist at
all. I am delighted, therefore, that the Global Fund is now trying to
ensure that more comprehensive health systems will be set up alongside
the treatments for AIDS, TB and malaria. I would love to hear the

noble Lords made clear, AIDS, TB and malaria remain among the biggest
causes of death and illness in developing countries. In 2012 alone,
AIDS killed 1.6 million people, malaria 627,000 and TB 1.3 million.
However, great progress has been made: new HIV infections are declining
in many of the worst-affected countries; there has been a significant
reduction in malaria incidence and deaths; and the world is on course
to halve TB deaths by 2015, compared to 1990 levels. Just 10 years ago,
the world struggled to respond to HIV, TB and malaria, and access to
key prevention and treatment interventions was very limited—as
noble Lords will remember. This picture has now been transformed and
the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria has played a
major part in this. Since 2002, Global Fund-supported programmes have
detected and treated 11.2 million TB cases and distributed 360 million
treated nets. Some 6.1 million people living with HIV are now receiving

Devastating rebounds can occur quickly. That is why we must redouble

opportunity. The UK is playing a groundbreaking part in that, as noble
Lords noted. We are committing £1 billion—provided that

encourage other donors to come forward and meet the target. Developing
countries, civil society and the private sector also have crucial roles

that action in one area is supported by action in another, and that it

Norton of Louth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the proposition I wish to
put to the House is straightforward. In terms of membership, the House
of Lords has grown, is growing and ought to be reduced. There is an
immediate problem; there is an even greater prospective
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121263000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000039">My
starting point is that this House does a good job in fulfilling
functions that add value to the political process. It complements the
elected Chamber, not least in carrying out tasks that the other House
may not have the time, resources or political will to fulfil. However,
the fact that we do a good job does not mean that we could not be even
more effective than we are. Enhancing our effectiveness has two
elements. One is making changes to how we operate and the other is
bolstering public confidence in what we do. Unlike the other place, we
cannot take our legitimacy for granted. We have to earn it. The changes
that would enable us to fulfil our functions more effectively and
enhance public support go well beyond limiting how many Members we
have. However, addressing the size of the House is critical because of
its relevance to fulfilling the functions of the House and our public
standing.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121263000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000040">There are two aspects
to the size of the House. One is the total membership and the other is
the active membership. The total membership is especially relevant to
how the House is seen by the public, and the active membership is
relevant to the capacity of the House to do its job. In terms of total
membership, the House has grown markedly since the passage of the House
of Lords Act 1999. At the start of the new Session of 1999-2000, we had
666 Members—in other words, a membership slightly larger than
that of the House of Commons. Today, we have a total of 835 Members,
making the House more than a quarter larger than the House of Commons.
We are the largest second Chamber in the world. That remains the case
even if we exclude those who have taken leave of absence or are
ineligible. Excluding those who are ineligible or have taken leave of
absence, we have 781 Members. However, we have to take into account the
fact that ineligible Members, such as those holding judicial posts,
will in due course be able to resume their seats. Some of those on
leave of absence because of the positions they hold, such as the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton of Upholland, may well resume their seats upon
completion of their current posts.</hs_para>

with the figure of 781, imagine what will happen if a new list of Peers
is announced. Then think ahead to the next Parliament and the likely
creation of another list. There may be ebbs and flows—we lose
some Members each year and there is a lull between lists—but the
underlying trend is clear. That is demonstrated graphically in Figure 2
of Meg Russell’s pamphlet, <I>House Full</I>, published in 2011.
As she points out, the largest single number of Peers to be created in
any one year since 1999 was the 117 who were created in
2010-11.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121263000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000042">The
number, be it of all Peers or just of eligible ones, is rising and has
risen most markedly in the past three years. It is not beyond reason to
envisage  a House at some point in the next Parliament with a
total membership close to, or even in excess of,  900 Members.
A House of that size, whether active or inactive, does nothing for the
reputation of the House; it is difficult to defend in the public
arena.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121263000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000043">One
can certainly justify a House similar in size to that of the other
House, given that we need a large membership to sustain an active House
of part-time Members. We benefit fundamentally from Peers having
outside links and maintaining current expertise. This House forms an
invaluable arena for discourse by civil society. However, the more that
we grow in number beyond the size of the other place and, like Topsy,
just grow and grow, it is difficult to defend against the criticism of
being primarily an expanding repository of political
patronage.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121263000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000044">There is no obvious
justification for the expansion in terms of fulfilling the tasks that
are core to our activity. The more that we grow in size, the more that
the position becomes indefensible. It would not be bad if there were a
rational argument for the growth in numbers, but there is no clear
intellectual basis for it. The composition of the new membership in
this Parliament bears little relationship to the stated aim of the
coalition agreement in terms of membership proportional to votes in the
general election. To achieve proportionality now would require a
further, substantial injection of new Peers.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121263000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000045">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T15:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is a more tangible problem in terms of the resources of the House. The
growth in membership in recent years has brought in Members who
contribute regularly to the work of the House. This is reflected in the
daily attendance: the average daily attendance in the Session 2009-10
was 388, while in the most recent session, 2012-13, it was 484. As Meg
Russell records, this substantial recent growth in the active
membership generates three problems. First, it puts pressure on the
limited resources of the House. Secondly, it puts pressure on the work
of the House, not least in terms of demands to contribute to Question
Time and debates. Thirdly, it has a negative impact on the culture of
the House. The more that Members are brought in quickly and in large
numbers, the more that this makes it difficult to socialise Members in
the accepted norms of the House, and the danger is that the House may
become more fractious and partisan.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121263000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000046">The pressure on
resources is fairly obvious, not least in terms of space. Members have
always been underresourced relative to Members of the other place. This
is shown in the extent to which Peers are allocated 
<?notus-xml column=974?>not offices of their own but rather desk space. The pressure is also
obvious in the Chamber, in that at various times it is not able to
accommodate all the Members who wish to attend. We have a smaller
Chamber than that of the other place but a larger membership. The
Commons has seating for more than 60% of its Members; we cannot match
that, even based on the average daily attendance, and the situation is
clearly growing worse.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121263000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000047">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T15:42:41"></hs_TimeCode>
increase creates particular problems in a House that works on a fairly
lean support base. The cost of this House is notably less than that of
the House of Commons. In the previous Session, the cost to the public
purse of the House of Commons was £392 million while
the cost of the House of Lords was £87 million. We may take some
pride in delivering value for money, but making a case for more public
money at the present time is difficult. We are expected to make
efficiency savings. That will be difficult with an influx of new and
active members, each eligible for an attendance allowance and transport
costs and adding to the demands on the resources of the House. There is
clearly a problem in how this will be seen by the public. There is also
the problem of how we can cope within our existing physical capacity
and administrative support. The demand is in danger of outstripping the
ability of the House to meet it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13121263000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000048">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T15:43:46"></hs_TimeCode>
the situation that we are in is clearly problematic, and if there are
many more creations then it will likely become unsustainable. What,
then, is the answer? There are various steps that can be taken,
although in taking them it is important to have regard to certain
principles. One is that no party or coalition of parties forming a
Government should have an absolute majority. Another is that there
should be a protocol, a formula, on the balance between the parties in
order to prevent another escalation in membership. Any reduction needs
to have regard to the balance between political groupings in the House.
A third is that we should work towards a membership that is smaller
than that of the House of Commons. That may take time but it is a
useful aspiration; it provides a framework for managing the reduction
in numbers.</hs_para>

immediate and rather modest step would be to put a limit on the size of
the House. One proposal is to have a moratorium on the creation of new
Members. I would propose a cap on membership. That way, one could
create new Members but only when existing ones had demised. One could
develop a formula of creating, say, only one new Peer for every three
who left the House. That would gradually reduce the size of the House;
it would be a slow process, but over the course of the Parliament it
would reduce the size of the House by at least 50.</hs_para>

steps include those embodied in the Bill introduced in this House by
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, and that in the other place by Dan
Byles, such as removing Peers who hardly ever attend. That would not
affect the active membership but would have a beneficial effect in
terms of public perception. Another provision of the Bill would create
a form of retirement provision, which would have the effect of the
Members ceasing to be Members of the House, with no provision for
retirement to be rescinded.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=975?><hs_para UID="13121263000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000051">More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T15:45:43"></hs_TimeCode>
radical proposals have been canvassed. These include proposing a
mandatory retirement age or imposing a set period for which
a new Peer may serve, such as 10 or 15 years. The problem
with each of these is that it has the potential to
rid the House of Members who are making a substantial contribution to
it. There is another proposal that would not have such an arbitrary
effect and could be geared to the need to maintain a balance between
the parties in the House and allow for some recalibration in each
Parliament: to determine the number that each political grouping should
have in a Parliament and to allow each to elect from within its own
ranks those who should remain within the House—in other words, a
scheme not dissimilar from that employed in 1999 to determine which
hereditary Peers should remain in the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121263000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000052">My

need to act, the sooner we may be able to achieve some steps by

additional costs estimated to be incurred in a full financial year once
the introduction of the current tranche of new creations has been
completed? Does he accept that a further list of Peers in
the current Parliament will create not just additional but
significant difficulties in terms of the finite resources of
the House? Projecting ahead, would my noble friend accept that the
problem will be exacerbated in the next Parliament, especially in the
event of the return of a new Government? That will be the case if the

Norton of Louth on this very timely debate. He and I gave evidence to
the Select Committee of the other place that looked at this issue, and
I shall briefly refer to its report because it was rather useful for
people outwith this House to look in, although it has to be said that
very many distinguished Members of this House gave evidence to that
committee. My noble friend referred to some of the issues looked
at—for example, the proposal that there should be legislation to
expel Peers who have been convicted of a serious offence. I do not
think that reform would produce a serious decrease in the size of the
House; I would hope not.</hs_para>

strong agreement that action should not be taken in two areas: first,
in relation to the introduction of a long-term moratorium on new Peers,
and secondly, in relation to the introduction of a compulsory
retirement age. It specifically said that it did not think either of
those things were appropriate or would receive proper support in either
House. The committee went on to say that there seemed to be some
widespread support for no longer replacing hereditary Peers in the
House of Lords when they died. That has proved very contentious in this
House, so maybe there was a certain naivety at the other end of the
building on that issue. On the other hand, the committee quite sensibly
pointed out that tackling the issue of persistent non-attendance is by
definition not particularly useful in dealing with problems of
overpopulation in this House. It is a classic non-solution. Finally, it
said that it thought that the evidence about introducing fixed-terms
appointment for Peers suggested that it would prove to be just as
controversial as some of the more major reforms that both Houses have
been looking at in recent
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121263000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000058">The

passed by this House, and the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, is likely to
be squeezed out in the current Session by the Conservative high
command’s insistence on giving precedence to the European Union
(Referendum) Bill. Is there really a chance of making progress in this
Session—I doubt it—or the next Session, a few months
before a general election? Presumably we can now confidently assume
that all three major parties will reiterate their previous and repeated
manifesto commitments to full reform of this House. It would presumably
be perverse if Labour failed to commit itself to legislation which
incorporated all the main features of Jack Straw’s White Paper

high hopes of proposals for permanent retirement, and I welcome them,

few parts of our constitution where the voices of older, more
experienced people are regularly heard and to force them out. It is

arguments for a formal cap on the size of an appointed House raged
three centuries ago over the Peerage Bill in 1719, and were skewered
very effectively by Robert Walpole in debates on that legislation, not
only by frightening his fellow MPs that, if they voted to limit the
size of the House of Lords, a pleasant retirement home would be denied
them, but on the more serious basis that a firmly capped unelected
House could not be overborne by new creations if it brought a
government to deadlock. Creation to secure the Crown’s business
was needed or threatened in 1711, 1832 and 1911, and some of us are old
enough to remember hearing Tony Benn call for 1,000 Peers to carry
Labour’s programme of 1976. Even with the cumbersome blunderbuss
of the Parliament Act, an unelected House can still disrupt business,
as we all recently experienced. There needs to be an ability to break a
cap, and defining that would be
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121263000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000079">Nor

<?notus-xml column=981?>friend the Prime Minister is overegging it. Mr Blair allowed only 49
Conservative Peers in his first two Governments; my right honourable
friend has allowed 44 additions to a Labour Party
that was already the largest in the House in one as yet uncompleted

have been through a stage of exceptional creation—a
missile-building period—and the House will take time to get over
the hump of those massive creations. But I think that it can return
progressively, as I hope that it will, to the lower rates of creation
that were standard in the past. There may well need to be a steady
decommissioning of the stacks of Back-Bench ICBMs, waiting in the
Bishops’ Bar to come into Divisions—but with patience and
a will, it can be done. Even in the quarter century from 1905 to 1929,
which included the Lloyd George era, the average was 11 creations a
year. In 1929 to 1955, with many changes of Government, it was 12.
Those figures are less than the number of those leaving the House in

be extremely difficult in this House, partly because of the coalition
but also because of the existence of Cross-Benchers. However, a search
for a START treaty in the usual channels might bear fruit, if searched
for. If some of the Peers who do not intend to take part in proceedings
could be slipped from the duty to vote, the House could keep, and draw
on, the pool of their wisdom while not flooding the byways of the House
for the more humdrum Divisions that punctuate our lives. That task
would be difficult but I hope that the Front Benches might rise to that

speak from a Bench whose Members are required to accept the disciplines
of a cap on numbers and a final retirement age. Certainly, those
limitations have not prevented this Bench playing a full part in the
range of policies and laws which come under scrutiny in this House.
Indeed, a process of appointment which is time-limited and
number-limited enables Members of this Bench to reflect our regional
involvement and speak not out of self or party interest but rather
reflect the truth that profound moral and ethical questions surround a
great deal of the work of your Lordships’ House. From this
experience we have consistently argued in favour of measures to allow
for the expulsion, retirement and suspension of Members of a reformed
House of Lords, believing those measures to be the interests of this

in its proceedings and offer rather more than is presently possible.

modification to the Bishoprics Act, which governs the succession of

a self-denying ordinance to some extent. The Select Committees of this
House also give great scope, perception and insight to others who are
contemplating legislation in these fields. As a member of the Select

affairs, I am conscious of how well regarded the work of the committee

we face, which has been raised by the noble Lord, Lord Norton, comes
from the lack of understanding of the role played by this House, which
is largely due to the press and media—particularly the press,
which used to quote in columns what was said in the debates in the

changes that could be made and they have been largely encapsulated in
the Bill produced by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman: the changes
providing for permanent retiral, ending by-elections of hereditary

offenders. Those all seem commonsensical. The probability is that they
would not have a massive effect on the Members of this House but they
would meet the observations of those who want to see some change. I

what I indicated not very long ago in a debate in this House: I think
that it would be wise to establish a convention on the future
governance of the United Kingdom. That should not be done in a hurry;
it should be deliberated upon and attract input from the citizenry of
this country so that they can sense that what is being done is based on
a consensual decision with the backing of the majority. I do not
believe that including reform of the House of Lords in a manifesto will
necessarily give that kind of legitimacy. Manifestos list dozens of
policies, and what moves people’s minds in elections is not
necessarily the small print of manifestos. The structure of our
governance is so important that it needs to be considered not in an
election period of three, four or five weeks but in a wider context

Hayman (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I join in congratulating the noble
Lord, Lord Norton of Louth, on introducing this debate with his usual
clarity and intellectual analysis, and on his passionate commitment to
this House and the way in which it does its job. It is a commitment
shared by all those who have spoken, most notably the noble Lord, Lord
Maclennan, who enjoined us to look at the quality of the work that we
do rather than having an obsession with
size<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T16:25:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121263000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000098">Size
does matter, actually. Political balance matters, and the balance
between the political appointees and the independent appointees
matters. It matters because the function of a second Chamber,
particularly one like ours that is not elected directly, is to ask the
directly elected Chamber where power resides to think again. That is a
very important responsibility of this House, and it is important that
the House can discharge that responsibility, not least when, as we know
because of timetabling in another place, much legislation comes to this
House without having been
scrutinised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T16:26:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121263000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121263000099">The
role of this House is not to overturn or to have the final say, but it
is very important that it should be possible for a Government to be
defeated in this House so that the other place can have second
thoughts—or sometimes first thoughts, because it has not looked
at the legislation at all. It is imperative to safeguard that. The
quality of the work that we do is not essentially posited on the size
of the House. We all agree that we probably need a larger House than we
might think at first glance, because of the part-time 
<?notus-xml column=985?>nature and the quality that is added to our work by the fact that people
have interaction with the outside world.</hs_para>

the decision taken that we needed a 25% increase in average attendance

at the previous general election represented in membership and
appointments to this House, but it is very important that we understand
the terms of engagement going forward into the next general election.

anticipate—I am sure that some Labour Peers would want to resign
from here in order to get that balance, rather than see the creation of
new Conservative

Why not create the equivalent of the Irish peerage? We could offer
people a peerage, but no right to sit in this House. That would be a
good thing. Then there are the ex-MPs, who make up 22.7% of
this House. I welcome them. Most are Labour, and have kept this House

Dykes (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure noble Lords are all
grateful for the explanation of the age paradox from the noble Earl,
Lord Caithness. I hope I am correct in saying that the main speaker in
the debate so far who has not been worried about size in the future was
the noble Lord, Lord True, whose points I can understand. The general
sense of the debate so far, as far as I can tell, is that size is a
problem and that something needs to be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000123">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T16:44:24"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill from Dan Byles MP in another place has 11 very able and senior
members of all the parties acting as sponsors, including some of course
who are also in favour of an elected House of Lords. When it
comes to this House, it will have a very tight timetable
for us as well, as it will follow the European Union
(Referendum) Bill, with its equally stringent timetable.
I hope that there will be ample time for discussion. The Dan
Byles Bill is really the intellectual and psychological follower of the
four earlier Steel Bills—which were, incidentally, ignored by
two Governments not just by one. If we add Peers who do not attend
during a Session and do not apply for a leave of absence under the
Standing Orders, ceasing membership would be an important part of any
future
elements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000124">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T16:44:24"></hs_TimeCode>
the way through the efforts that I have detected to make rational
progress on the successive Steel Bills, as I will call them, the hope
was entertained that the Government of the day would pick up the Bill
and make it central government business. There is still an
opportunity for that and I think more and more
Peers would support that aspiration. Although the three or
four measures for reducing individual membership seem to be very modest
and at the margin, the practical effect would be
quite rapid over time. It is crazy that we contemplate the fact that
this Chamber is literally too large with some
calmness at the moment—although I hope not
too much. It is around the size of the entire European Parliament,
which represents 28 member states. The latest text of the Bill, which
began its Second Reading before June 2010, in February 2009,
added the helpful provision of non-attendance producing
disqualification.</hs_para>

the fate of the fundamentalist parts of these ideas—mostly
having elected Members in the future—in the Joint
Committee’s plans published at the end of April 2012, the stage
has now been decisively and helpfully set to bring about a reduction in
numbers if this legislation becomes government business. To my mind,
the Commons would never have accepted the election plan. Although there
was a huge majority on Second Reading of the fundamental reform Bill,
ironically it began to unravel almost immediately after that. Many
members of the leading coalition party refused to ordain new laws which
they feared would inevitably lead to the upper House challenging their
unique powers and legislative primacy. Eventually, beyond the inaugural
Session of a new elected House of Lords, they would presumably want to
turn themselves into an ambitious senate in no time at all. There were
articles about this saying that there would eventually be senators in
the House of Lords demanding office facilities and staff expenses of
£1 million per office to deal with all the correspondence and
work that would now arise as a result of being elected. The House will
indeed be large and expensive if attendance claims rise, even if, as we
hope, they rise because of expanding membership rather than individual
claims as the number of days goes down.</hs_para>

drawn-out, painful episode of various bits and pieces. The provisions
of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill of July 2009 that
covered the suspension, resignation and expulsion of Members were taken
out of the text in the final version; hence the reintroduction pledge
by my noble friend Lord Steel. He repeated his view then that the Bill
did not deal with future composition. The Bill also provided for the
end of the hereditary Peers’ by-elections, which were described
as farcical by some, but that section was later taken
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000127">All these
matters lead to the fact that a good number of non-Tory Peers have
always agreed with Tory traditionalists in both Houses that an elected
senatorial peerage would be bound to challenge the superior powers of
the other place. In the mean time, the size problem has acquired the
ominous characteristic of an almost grotesque situation, with
Parliament being unable to make rational progress on these matters, in
a perverse and ridiculous setting, which gives rise to very great
public dismay. The most recent intake of nominated Peers, we remember,
had to be announced deliberately after the House rose for the summer
holidays. There was an outcry in the press and it is very difficult for
the public to accept the seeming illogicality and absurdity of yet
another large

gives me no pleasure to say these things about the financial side of it

to—especially among those who happen to believe that the House
of Lords does a pretty good job as a revising and improving Chamber,
which I feel is definitely the case. Of course, all parties have donors
so I will avoid smugness. I will only mention in passing that we
Liberal Democrats have donors only from time to time; they do not come
along in serried ranks. Labour, too, has a good crop nowadays, which

fact that there was not any consensus between the party leaders. I

This is doing damage because these are parliamentary matters rather

policy. If we can separate those two things out and see how the Dan
Byles text makes progress in our House and goes back to the Commons in
unamended or amended form, we can begin to see the beginnings of common

era when only 12 or 15 Peers were appointed each year. The answer to
the problem of size—and it is a problem—lies in three
things. The first is an abandonment of any idea of a ratio to the last
general election; the second is a degree of self-restraint; and the

there must be an abandonment of the ratio idea and there must be a
paring-down of the number of Peers who are appointed each year. As
someone earlier pointed out, sadly, we lose 12 or 15 Members each year

would certainly not be inflating the size of the House. My noble friend
Lord Norton in his very admirable speech referred, as did the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayman, to the average attendance now being 484 per day,
but we must bear in mind that they are not the same 484 people day
after day. If we are to draw upon a wide range of experience and deep

suggestion to my noble friend the Leader of the House, fully
appreciating that he cannot comment in detail on the first point that I

bear in mind the need for expertise. Let us ask

from that comment, I put two suggestions to my noble friend the Leader
of the House. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, was an admirable Lord
Speaker of this House. In her just as admirable speech, she suggested
that party leaders should try to get together. I agree with that but
something else should be done. I say this with a degree of hesitation
and reservation because I do not want to see a proliferation of
committees, but in the last year of this Parliament there is a real
case for establishing a Select Committee of this House to consider the

while I do not always agree with all the emanations from the group that

to agree with the key point made at the beginning by the noble Lord,
Lord Norton, that your Lordships’ House has grown, is growing
and ought to be reduced. I think I share the following point with a
number of noble Lords: while the size of the House is important, much
more crucial is the question as to whether it is effective in acting as
a check on the Executive and as a revising Chamber, and in adding to
the effectiveness more generally of parliamentary
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000142">As
ever in your Lordships’ debates, most noble Lords who asked that
question have tended to come to a view in the affirmative. Of course,
we all understand the strengths of your Lordships’ House but we
ought to examine its effectiveness in the context of the impact of
coalition government. We have a situation where the coalition parties
in your Lordships’ House have a political majority over the
opposition. I would argue that that threatens the effectiveness of the
House. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hill, when he comes to wind up
will refer to the defeats that his Government have suffered here but
the rate of defeat is much less compared to the period of 1997 to 2010.
I know that it is a little early to draw conclusions from the impact of
the latest appointments to your Lordships’ House but, 
<?notus-xml column=993?>certainly from this side of the House, it would appear that the
Government are able to win votes which in normal terms they would not
have done. The problem with that is that if a Government are no longer
able to be defeated in your Lordships’ House on a regular basis,
this can no longer call itself a revising Chamber. We need to consider
that very
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000143">I
also agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, on substantive reform
in the sense that we surely need to see the outcome of the referendum
in Scotland and any constitutional fallout from it. Substantive reform
of your Lordships’ House cannot be considered in isolation from
either wider constitutional issues or the impact on the primacy of the
Commons. At the risk of tempting the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, to get up
and remind me of my past sins, in the joint working group chaired by my
right honourable friend Jack Straw—the noble Lord is right that
I served on that, with its cross-party talks—there was a
failure, which the Deputy Prime Minister repeated, even to contemplate
how an elected second Chamber fits with a House of Commons when there
is a pretty consensual view that we wish to retain its primacy. That
failure, in my view, led to the failure of Mr Clegg’s Bill. In
the end, that was a failure; it was quite clear from what was happening
in the other place that it did not stand an earthly chance of getting

quite yet reached double figures but one is ever hopeful. The Hunt
committee said that the problem with an ever increasing size is that it
risks the reputation of the House, that it probably makes conducting

intent on implementing what was in the coalition agreement or have they
stood back from that commitment? Does the Leader of the House accept
that the general view of Members of your Lordships’ House is
that there should be very few appointments between now and the general
election? Does he agree with the noble Lord, Lord Norton,
that there ought to be a cap on membership, and will he institute
cross-party discussions as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Tyler? The
noble Lord, Lord Cormack, suggested that there might be a Select
Committee of your Lordships’ House and there is an argument in
favour of the political parties and the Cross-Benchers discussing these
matters in a small group or in a more formal Select Committee. It would
surely be useful, in the run-up to the election, for there to be some
discussions across the House.</hs_para>

that I do not believe is contentious—one that my noble friend
Lord Maclennan and others made—which is that we perform a vital
role and that we do so very well. I start with that point 
<?notus-xml column=995?>because sometimes, when we discuss our internal matters, we can be in
danger of losing that bigger picture. I believe that our scrutiny of
primary legislation is as thorough and as expert as ever; I agree very
much with my noble friend Lord Cormack on that. Having had the dubious
pleasure of taking legislation through your Lordships’ House, I
can speak from experience about the rigour of that scrutiny. We may be
polite but we are relentless.</hs_para>

scrutiny in this House and scrutiny down the other end is remarkable,
as a number of noble Lords have said, and I see no sign of any
diminution in our performance of that most fundamental role. I agree
with the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, on the importance of being able
to defeat the Government—a point made also by the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. That is what we have in this House. However,
we need the addition of new expertise and new vigour from time to time
to help us to carry out that role of scrutiny.</hs_para>

place, all Members in this House can take part in all stages of
legislation. All noble Lords can table amendments and, because there is
no process of selection, they are guaranteed a debate on each of those
amendments, should they wish to have one. Less visible, but, I think,
of great importance is the work that we undertake on secondary
legislation. Our House gives more time than the other place to
scrutinising these rather unglamorous yet often highly significant
pieces of legislation—and, again, in this House, all Members can
participate fully in all stages of that
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000156">Through
Oral and Written Questions, Questions for Short Debate and longer

made by the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, were very pertinent. I know how

increased attendance, it has in many respects continued to improve year

numbers this afternoon, and there has been talk, including by the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Leicester and my noble friend Lord
Dykes, about packing the House and overcrowding. I listened to the
figures adduced very carefully, but there are other figures. It is the
case that the list of new Peers announced in August was the first
political list for three years. I am afraid that I have to disagree
strongly with the comments made in that context by my noble friend Lord
Dykes. There are only 24 more eligible Members in the four main groups
than there were in 2007, and I am not aware that in 2007 people were
making the point that there were too many Peers in the House. There
have certainly been new Peers 
<?notus-xml column=996?>created since 2010, but around 100 Members have sadly died or taken
leave of absence over the same period. I argue that the figures also
show that my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has been
even-handed in his appointments. For example, 39 Labour Peers were
appointed in his first year compared with 47 Conservatives, as my noble
friend Lord True reminded
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000159">I think
there has been general acceptance this afternoon that we need to
refresh our ranks from time to time, rather than freezing the
membership at a particular point in time, so that the expertise and
experience on which the House relies for its good name can be kept up
to date. In fact, I think the real issue is not so much the absolute
number of those entitled to vote—a point that has already been
made—which has been more constant over the past five years than
many people recognise, but the higher level of
attendance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0002.htm#13121276000160">I
accept that average attendance has been increasing—it was about
480 in the previous Session—but that is the figure we should
concentrate on, not the figures we sometimes read about which do not
relate to our day-to-day experience. I recognise that higher attendance
means that the House will sometimes be crowded on popular occasions,
but it is important to remember that we should not overstate the
problem. There is plenty of space in the Chamber and in Grand Committee
during the great majority of our business, particularly legislation,
and the same is true of debate—there are some empty spaces here
this afternoon.</hs_para>

time to speak. There has been some reference today to Members having
only one minute to speak. They had an average of nearly six minutes in
time-limited QSDs in the previous Session, and more than nine minutes
in balloted debates. Even during Oral Questions, which I know, probably
more than anyone, is a particularly busy time, we have a wide range of
participants. Work done by the Clerk of the Parliaments earlier this
year showed that in the first quarter, 288 noble Lords asked one or
more supplementary questions during Oral Questions. Because more
Members are attending, one of my priorities has been to increase the
scope for Back-Bench Members to take part in the work of the House.
Perhaps most noticeably, we have almost doubled the amount of time we
make available for Back-Bench QSDs, and the results have been dramatic.
The only noble Lords yet to be offered time for their QSDs are those
who have already had a QSD this Session.</hs_para>

time is sometimes exceeding demand. For example, this Tuesday evening,
the House rose at 6.20 pm because the Whips’ Office was unable
to find anyone to ask a QSD or put forward a Select Committee report
for debate after the Second
Reading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:14:43"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
also introduced a new slot in prime time for a weekly topical QSD,
which Back-Benchers had said that they wanted. We supported the
creation of additional Select Committees, especially ad hoc committees
and post-legislative scrutiny committees, so that more noble Lords
would have the opportunity to participate in that important aspect of
our work.</hs_para>

recognise that participation in proceedings is not the only aspect of
the issue raised by my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth. Some noble
Lords have suggested 
<?notus-xml column=997?>that the facilities in the House are not able to cope with the current
level of attendance. While that is a matter for the Chairman of
Committees, we should not overstate the extent of the problem. We know
that there is plenty of spare capacity in our restaurants, for example;
indeed, the problem we have is too few people eating in them rather
than too many. While desk space for Members has always been at a
premium, we currently have more accommodation than before, thanks to
the acquisition of Millbank House. Figures presented to the House
Committee earlier this year showed that there were desks which had not
yet been allocated to individual
Members<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:15:55"></hs_TimeCode>. In
terms of research capacity, something about which Members are
concerned, noble Lords may like to know that the number of Library
staff has increased from 31.5 full-time equivalents in 2007 to 38.5

House—and, indeed, the cost of politics, which was raised by a
number of noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth
and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath—the cost of the
House of Lords has not gone up: it has gone down. The resource budget
for the current financial year, including the costs of Members’
allowances and expenses, is £4 million lower than it was in
2010-11. That is equivalent to a real-terms cut of 15%, which is a
considerable achievement by the administration, on which we would all

cost for new Peers, and I recognise that. My noble friend Lord Norton
asked me what it was. It is hard to predict precisely because, of
course, it depends on attendance and on how much an individual Member
will claim. On future numbers, it is clearly hard for me to predict
what any future Government might do on appointments. The noble Lord,
Lord Hunt of Kings Heath asked me whether I accepted that the mood of
the House was that it would not welcome any more new Peers before the
next general election. Obviously, I am very aware of the mood of the

were made by noble Lords as to ways forward. Many of them would require
legislation to achieve. I will briefly update the House. We have had a
bit of discussion about what we are calling the Byles Bill. As my noble
friend Lord Tyler reminded us, there was a government proposal for an
elected House that would have dealt completely with my noble friend
Lord Norton’s question about size by reducing the House to
around 450 Members. However, following the failure of that Bill to
emerge from the other place, the Government have made it clear that
they do not intend to bring forward any further relevant legislation

retirement. Here, I share the greater optimism of the noble Baroness,
Lady Hayman, rather than the pessimism of my noble friend Lord Tyler.
The House of Lords Reform (No. 2) Bill, more commonly known
as the Byles Bill—but which, down at our end of the building, we
still rightly think of as the Steel Bill—has been making some
progress. I know that we are all grateful to my noble friend Lord Steel

make a number of modest but, I think, sensible changes. It would allow
permanent retirement and resignation and the exclusion of
non-attenders, and would expel those convicted of a serious criminal

whereby Members could resign or retire with
dignity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:19:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I
should, however, say for the record that I do not believe—I know

Convenor, as it happens—that retirement with dignity is
compatible with any system of financial incentives to encourage that
retirement. This point was also made by my noble friend Lord

some noble Lords have raised with me what possible rationale there
could be for opposing some kind of payment on retirement. I have two
main reasons for opposing it, which I think are shared by the other
group leaders. The first reason is one of principle and the second is
practical. The issue of principle is, quite simply, that it is an
honour to be here, not a job; noble Lords are given an allowance, not a
salary. If noble Lords decide that it is time to retire, they should do
so, and if they are no longer coming, they should not require an
allowance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:20:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000170">The
second reason is a practical one to do with the reputation of the
House, about which we have heard a lot this afternoon. I think that the

so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:20:37"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope very

House could take other measures short of legislation, some of which
have been set out in the recent report by the Commons Political and

raised in that report are matters for this House alone to determine.
For example, the report suggested that retirement from this House could
be marked in a more formal way, both in the Chamber and outside.
Another proposal was that the leave of absence scheme could be further
strengthened to build on the success of the recently introduced
practice of the Clerk of the Parliaments inviting infrequent attendees,

absence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:21:50"></hs_TimeCode>. I am

opinion from the Cross-Benches, Labour and some coalition
Peers—on both sides of the coalition—can readily defeat

mathematical formula. We should not consider it as the latter; that is,

will do what they can to help the church take forward its desire to see
women bishops in your Lordships’ House. But pending more

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are determined
to do all that they can to minimise the threat from terrorism to the UK
and our interests abroad. Proscription is an important part of the
Government’s strategy to tackle terrorist activities. We propose
to add Imarat Kavkaz, also known as the Caucasus Emirate, to the list
of international terrorist organisations, amending Schedule 2 to the
Terrorism Act 2000. This is the 13th proscription order under that
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000183">Having
carefully considered all the evidence, the Home Secretary believes that
Imarat Kavkaz meets the statutory test for proscription and that it is
appropriate to exercise her discretion to proscribe it. Section 3 of
the Terrorism Act 2000 provides a power for the Home Secretary to
proscribe an organisation if she believes it is currently concerned in
terrorism. The Act specifies that an organisation is concerned in
terrorism if it: commits or participates in acts of terrorism; prepares
for terrorism; promotes or encourages terrorism, including the unlawful
glorification of terrorism; or is otherwise concerned in terrorism. If
the test is met, the Home Secretary may then exercise her discretion to
proscribe the organisation. In considering whether to exercise this
discretion, the Home Secretary takes into account a number of factors:
the nature and scale of an organisation’s activities; the
specific threat that it poses to the United Kingdom; the specific
threat that it poses to British nationals overseas; the
organisation’s presence in the United Kingdom; and the need to
support other members of the international community in tackling
terrorism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000184">Given
the wide-ranging impact of proscription, the Home Secretary exercises
her power to proscribe only after a thorough review of the available
relevant information and evidence on the organisation. This includes
open source material, intelligence material and
advice that reflects consultation across
government, including with the intelligence and law enforcement
agencies. The Home Secretary is supported in her decision-making by the
cross-Whitehall proscription review group. Decisions to proscribe are
taken with great care by the Home Secretary and it is right that the
case for proscribing new organisations must be approved by both
Houses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000185">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:33:42"></hs_TimeCode>
carefully considered all the evidence, we firmly believe that Imarat
Kavkaz is currently concerned in terrorism. Noble Lords will appreciate
that I am unable to comment on specific intelligence that leads to any
decision to proscribe, but I can provide a brief summary of its
activities. Imarat Kavkaz, or the Caucasus Emirate, is a terrorist
organisation which seeks a Sharia-based caliphate across the north
Caucasus. It regularly uses terrorist tactics and has carried out
attacks against Russian state and civilian targets. The organisation
claimed responsibility for the January 2011 suicide attack on
Domodedovo Airport in Moscow that killed 35, including one British
national, and a suicide attack on the Moscow metro in March 2010 that
killed 39. Since then, there has been continued activity by Imarat
Kavkaz, including renewed threats of activity in Russia made during the
summer of 2013. The organisation is designated by the US and listed by
the UN under the 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>al-Qaeda sanctions regime. Subject to the agreement of this House, the
order will come into force on Friday, 13
December.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000186">In

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> The Minister explained the statutory power
available to the Home Secretary to proscribe an organisation that she
believes is currently concerned in terrorism and the factors that she
has to take into account before exercising her discretion. The United
States proscribed Imarat Kavkaz in 2011 after it was linked to the two
deadly attacks in Moscow to which the Minister referred—namely
at the international airport, when 35 people were killed, and in the
Moscow metro, in which 39 people were
killed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Imarat
Kavkaz was formed in late 2007 and is an Islamic militant organisation
based in Russia’s north Caucasus. Its stated goal is the
liberation from the control of Moscow of what it considers to be Muslim
lands. It regularly conducts attacks against Russian security forces
and is linked to al-Qaeda.</hs_para>

proscribed organisation are considerable for both the organisation and

offence to arrange a meeting in support of such an organisation, wear
clothing or carry articles in public that arouse reasonable suspicion
that an individual is a member or supporter. A proscribed organisation
or any person affected by the proscription may apply to the Secretary
of State for deproscription. If the Secretary of State refuses, the
applicant may appeal to the Proscribed Organisations Appeal Commission.

relationship of this proscription and others to organisations such as
YouTube and Facebook. We have been removing illegal terrorist content
from the overt space where it is hosted in the UK or overseas and we

YouTube and Facebook. To date, the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral
Unit, which the noble Lord referred to in commenting on the reply in
the Commons, has removed more than 18,000 pieces of illegal material.

last question was about the recommendation made by David Anderson. We
obviously take note of that, and indeed matters have been set up. In
response to David Anderson, the Home Secretary said that under the
current regime any person affected by a proscription can submit a
written application to her requesting that she considers the removal of
a specified organisation from the list. The Home Secretary is required
to determine the application within 90 days. If the
Secretary of State agrees to deproscribe an organisation, she will lay
an order before Parliament removing it from the list of proscribed
organisations. That is subject to the affirmative procedure, as is this
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:43:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The Home
Secretary’s consideration of these matters following
applications from the groups themselves is an effective process. There
is a right of appeal and challenge, should the Home Secretary’s
decision be negative. Any valid application for deproscription will be
considered by the Home Secretary in accordance with the Act. I hope

a Written Ministerial Statement. The same Statement on the same day was
issued by the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, in this House. It related to
the use in the drafting of legislation of male pronouns—he, his
and him—in context where the individual referred to might change
from time to time and might be either a woman or a man. The Statement
said:</hs_para>

as the Statement expressly recognised, the drafting practice of using
an apparently gender-specific pronoun to apply both to men and to women
had received the imprimatur of Parliament by the enactment of Section 6
of the Interpretation Act 1978. Section 6 of the 1978 Act provides
inter alia
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121276000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000298">“In

23(1) of the 1978 Act made it clear that Section 6 was applicable not

follows from Section 6 that the use in both primary and secondary
legislation of apparently gender-specific pronouns is a use of pronouns
that are in law, subject of course to the context, gender-neutral. They
are no longer in their effect
gender-specific<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:48:12"></hs_TimeCode>.
None the less, the obvious purpose of the 8 March 2007 Statement was to
discourage the use in legislation of the masculine pronouns—he,
him and his—except, of course, where the individual was known
and was
male<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:48:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000202">There
are, however, two objections to the drafting instructions given to
government officials pursuant to the 8 March 2007 Statement. The first
is an objection  
<?notus-xml column=1005?>of principle. The 1978 Act is not an ancient Act that could be regarded
as out of date or overtaken by obsolescence. Section 6 represents
Parliament’s considered guidance to the use in legislative
instruments of gender-related words. The guidance was followed for many
years. It avoided ambiguity in the construction of legislative
instruments and brought clarity to the identification of the persons to
whom the legislative provisions in question were intended to
apply.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13121276000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000203">It may
be that the drafting habit of using in legislation pronouns importing
the masculine gender and relying on Section 6 of the Act to enable the
pronouns to apply also to persons of the feminine gender as well
offends some people’s notions of gender equality. However, it
was never more than a habit. That habit could, of course, be adjusted
and remedied. If the officials who draft legislative instruments were
to be instructed to use from time to time the feminine
pronouns—she, her, hers—instead of the masculine
pronouns, relying therefore on Section 6 of the 1978 Act to include the
masculine, context permitting, why not let Section 6 have the
gender-neutralising effect that Parliament intended in enacting the
section in
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T17:50:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000204">In
principle it is inappropriate and, indeed, objectionable for government

surely ought also to stand as models for the correct use of the English
language. To prostitute the English language in pursuit of some goal of
gender equality is, I suggest, unacceptable. Moreover, it is quite
unnecessary. Section 6 makes all apparently gender-specific pronouns in
law gender-neutral, context permitting. In any event, there is no
reason other than habit why it should always be male pronouns that are
used when both men and women are intended to be referred to. By all
means let those who do the drafting sometimes use feminine pronouns,

is regrettable that this practice has taken place because statutes and
statutory instruments have now become a very fundamental part of our
law. I see no reason to suppose that that is likely to reduce to any
extent in the future—rather, the opposite seems to be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T18:01:16"></hs_TimeCode>. That means
that ordinary people, not just the courts and lawyers, have to try to
understand these instruments. I would have thought that the cardinal
principle is that the instrument should be reasonably clear and written
in language that ordinary people would normally use in common speech. I
am not sure how many of our statutes really come up to that degree of
clarity. Indeed, if one approaches one of the current Bills without any
knowledge of its antecedents, the task of trying to find out exactly
what it means is quite formidable. To make it more difficult by using
rather contrived constructions seems to be contrary to the best use of
the statute

in grammar, like many other languages, English lacks an epicene third
person pronoun that can have anaphoric reference to an ungendered
antecedent—that is putting it in plain language. For literally
hundreds of years, we have vacillated between solutions that partly fit
the bill, especially “he”, which is third person and
singular but not, of course, epicene, and “they”, which
is third person and epicene but not, of course, singular. It is the
danger of this “they” creeping into legislation that
concerns the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, among many
others.</hs_para>

with an example from the policing Bill that is currently going through
this House. In one of the Marshalled Lists, Amendment 56LG reads as
follows:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13121276000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000304">“The

course, far more of the amendments employ the traditionally approved
solution, using “he”, as in Amendment 58, which
says:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="13121276000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000305">“A

fact, gender neutrality is only one part of the grammatical problem. We
lack also the means of expressing number neutrality. After all, when we
speak of “anybody” or “everybody”, we are
not concerned with specifically singular entities but, well, with
everybody. This is another factor tempting us in the direction of
“they”. It is not surprising that many of us avoid the
singular/plural mismatch by opting for the plural in both antecedent
and anaphora, as in, for example, “Persons who live in glass
houses are asking for trouble if they throw
stones”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000225">The
second problem issue is political history. When the whole world was
solidly male dominated, as large parts of it still are, few people were
concerned about the casual assumptions implicit in the generic
“he” and kindred expressions such as
“mankind” or the Musée de l’Homme in Paris.
After all, the word “woman” proclaims that she is merely
a subcategory of man, as surely derived from him linguistically as
Genesis tells us that Eve was derived from Adam biologically. However,
in the past century, when women got jobs outside the home, and then
better and better jobs, they started exerting themselves and they
increasingly convinced most of us that their grievances included
linguistic ones. With striking rapidity, we got used to hearing
sentences such as, “Our doctor and her husband were at the
meeting”, and we abandoned “policemen” and
“firemen” for “police officers” and
“firefighters”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000226">Of
course, languages frequently embody glimpses of the past and past
beliefs— even the noble Lord, Lord Rees of
Ludlow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T18:09:28"></hs_TimeCode>, might
speak of “tomorrow’s sunrise”—so, too, with
sexist expressions, including our very own salutation, “My
Lords”. If the English, brazen “Every man for
himself” sounds particularly blatant, we should not forget that
in “Chacun pour soi” “chacun” is not
“chacune” and that in “Jeder für
sich”, “jeder” is spelled with the masculine
“r” and not the feminine
“e”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000227">In
my view, it was perfectly reasonable for Jack Straw in 2007 to call for
an end to any such male stereotyping in our use of English,
specifically rejecting the Interpretation Act 1978 and its reiteration
of the convention that masculine pronouns are deemed to
include feminine reference. If it ever worked, that convention no
longer does, and there have been convincing psycholinguistic
experiments showing that sentences such as “Anyone parking his
car here will be prosecuted” predominantly call up images of a
man doing the illicit
parking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000228">To
return to the policing Bill, we find that most amendments are
thoroughly sensitive in this respect, with anaphoric reference
employing “he or she” or repetition—“a
person … that person”. But among the 
<?notus-xml column=1010?>minority using the traditional “he”, there are striking
cases, especially in Amendments 93 to 95, where the singular masculine
pronoun is used no fewer than 18 times. In all of them, the
antecedent of “he” is surely a tell-tale phrase:
“the judge”. Since we do indeed have a judiciary that is
largely manned by men, it is hard to believe that the use of
“he” in these amendments really means
“he or she” rather than endorsing one particular male
stereotype as a fact of
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000229">At least
the amendments show reassuringly little intrusion of the controversial
“anyone … they” formulation. Of course, we hear it
daily in this House and read it daily in the press, but it has no place
in the language of statute, where its comfortably colloquial
imprecision is seriously
unwelcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T18:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_12_PT_1/6648BCC9654E7D2AE7F36894699463C4D5AEAE82" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 December 2013">Thursday,

preparation for this debate, I asked myself: what is the English
language? As noble Lords will be aware, English is a Germanic language
and is one of the most widely used languages in the world. It is spoken
as the first language by majority populations in the United Kingdom,
the United States of America, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Ireland
and a number of Caribbean nations. It is often widely chosen to be
learnt as a second language, and is one of the official languages of
the European Union and the United Nations. In terms of numbers of
people speaking English as a first language, it comes third in the
world behind Mandarin Chinese and Spanish. However, when combining
native and non-native speakers, it is definitely the second most
commonly spoken language in the world, if not the most commonly spoken.
It is the required language of communication in seafaring, aviation and
many other fields.</hs_para>

spoken by the early Germanic settlers from what is today the
Netherlands, north-west Germany and Denmark is different and has
evolved over the years into the language that we have today. Our
language has developed with influences from Old Norse. A number of
English words drew their construction from their roots in Latin, as
Latin was the lingua franca of the Christian church and European
intellectual
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000236">The
Norman conquest of England in the 11th century gave rise to
heavy borrowings from Norman French. All noble Lords will be aware of
the use of Norman French in Parliament to signify some of the
formalities of Bills passing. Many French words or phrases have crept
into the English language, such as mirage, genre, coup
d’état and rendezvous. The point is that the English we
all speak today is a beautiful language that has a wonderful, rich
literature for us all to enjoy, but it has evolved over time. That
evolution is a consequence of our development as a nation and as a
people, of our history and the influences that have shaped us and our
history. It is not a stand-alone, stand-still language. It is growing,
evolving, developing and shaping us into who we are today. That is how
it should

much support the initiative undertaken by my right honourable friend Mr
Jack Straw in 2007. I read with real interest the paper by Mr
Christopher Williams in the <I>Statute Law Review</I>, “The End
of the ‘Masculine Rule’?”. It is clear from the
paper that we are not the first Parliament or institution in the world
to adopt gender-neutral drafting. We follow in the footsteps of both
Australia and New Zealand, which were probably the first

Williams’s excellent paper informs us that as far back as 1983,
the Parliamentary Counsel’s Office of New South Wales adopted
the policy, and on a national level in Australia it was adopted in
1988. Similar reforms happened in New Zealand in 1985. In Canada the
policy was adopted in 1991-92, and with the election of President
Mandela and the ANC Government, gender-neutral drafting was adopted in
South Africa. Looking at international organisations, the United
Nations adopted gender-neutral drafting during the latter half of the
1980s. The International Labour Organisation began drafting its
conventions in a gender-neutral way at around the same time. The
European Union began the switch in 1998, though you can find examples

parliamentary counsel, who draft legislation, relied on Section 6 of
the Interpretation Act 1978, to which my noble and learned friend Lord
Mackay of Clashfern and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott of

masculine gender include the feminine, and vice versa. In practice,
this means that male pronouns such as “he” were used in
contexts where a reference to women and men was intended. This indeed
aided brevity, but many people believed

the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott, that we are not abandoning the
Interpretation Act. The 1978 Act is still needed for amendments to old
legislation that predates the move to gender-neutral drafting. The
noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, referred to that. Parliamentary
counsel sometimes still use gender-specific pronouns when amending old
legislation to ensure that it remains coherent. The 1978 Act enables
masculine or feminine words to be used in legislation to cover both
genders but does not contain drafting guidance about how to
draft.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13121276000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000247">Even
before the move to gender-neutral drafting in 2007, there was no
requirement to use gender-specific pronouns. There are plenty of
examples of old provisions that were drafted in gender-neutral terms
and without reliance on the 1978 Act. Interestingly, the 1978 Act was a
consolidation and may be traced back to legislation first enacted in
1850. I know that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott of Foscote,
referred to the 1978 Act as not being ancient, but 1850, while it may
not be very ancient, is quite a long time ago.</hs_para>

gender-neutral drafting brought us in line with other jurisdictions
which use the English language, where it had been the norm for many
years: Ireland, New Zealand, Canada, parts of Australia and the United
States of America, as well as the three devolved legislatures. The
noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, included South Africa in that
list. With the change to gender-neutral drafting, a range of drafting
styles was developed: for example, omitting the pronoun, repeating the
noun, replacing the noun with a letter such as the letter P, using
defined terms or using “he” or “she”, and
so on. Parliamentary counsel have tried to simplify drafting so that it
is not ambiguous or too
lengthy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121276000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-0003.htm#13121276000249">In
places, the move caused drafters to reword propositions so that they
indeed became shorter and clearer. For example, “the Secretary
of State may, if he thinks fit” could become simply, “the
Secretary of State may”. Before the change, the drafting may
have said, “A person commits an offence if he drops litter in a
public place”, but now it could be simplified to, “A
person who drops litter in a public place commits an offence”.
However, we recognise that there are some techniques that people find
easier to follow than others, and I have much sympathy with people who
do not like techniques such as the use of
letters—“P” and so on—to identify different
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T18:25:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lordships will be pleased to note that the Office of the Parliamentary
Counsel has agreed to revise its drafting guidance to recommend that
the approach of using letters to identify people is used sparingly,

may disagree but the guidance from parliamentary counsel provides that
some terms are to be treated as gender-neutral. These include
“testator”, “manager” and
“actor”, although they have female equivalents. There are
also some terms that have always been gender-neutral—for
example, Secretary of State and Prime Minister.</hs_para>

pronouns are still sometimes used in legislation that amends older
legislation, as it is important for the amended Act to remain coherent.
For example, if there is a list of conditions each of which begins with
“he”, it would be confusing to start a new condition
starting with “the
person<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-12T18:26:25"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

recognises that there must be some flexibility and that there will be
some Acts where only gender-specific drafting can be usefully applied.
In a case where a person has to be of a particular gender—male
or female—gender-neutral drafting does not require drafters to
avoid referring to the gender. I think your Lordships would agree that
that would be the case for legislation about

points raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Scott of Foscote, in
his detailed account of various provisions in subordinate legislation.
I hope that he will forgive me if I do not engage in what I would call
the intricacies of what he has quite rightly outlined, but I reassure
noble Lords that the Government remain committed to producing
high-quality legislation that is clear, accessible and free from
ambiguity. We believe that gender-neutral drafting is perfectly
compatible with that objective. It ensures that our law is expressed in
a way that clearly covers all citizens without requiring people to

centuries. However, the noble Lord, Lord Quirk, referred to the risks

enable them to advertise the fact that they meet a certain set of
criteria on cyber security. This provides them with an obvious
competitive advantage in a marketplace that increasingly demands better
cyber security from suppliers. To reinforce this and give the standard
a kick-start, we will be mandating its use in government procurement.
Its adoption will be subject to proportionality and relevance,
particularly in relation to SMEs, as this is not designed to impose
costs on business but rather to boost cyber security while improving
the security of the government’s supply
chain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13121264000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131212-wms0001.htm#13121264000023">In

elsewhere. ISPs will assist and empower their customers to protect
themselves by offering tools and security solutions, or indicate where
solutions can be accessed. If their customer does experience a problem,
ISPs will support them by providing clear information about how to
report the incident. They will also inform them of a potential

the start of the Interior day the Commission (Reding) introduced its
Communication on the free movement of persons, which came as a result
of UK pressure over recent months. The Communication noted that whilst
free movement was a right, that right did not include moving to another
Member State to claim benefits. The Commission noted that appropriate
safeguards and tools were available under EU law to combat fraud and
abuse and committed to work with Member States on these issues. The
Commission believed that the five actions set out in the Communication
represented concrete tools to maximise and protect the benefits of free
movement. In particular, the Commission committed to finalise the draft
of the sham marriage handbook and, together with the
Committee of the Regions, agreed to organise a conference of Mayors on
11 February 2014.</hs_para>

acknowledged that freedom of movement was an important principle of the
EU, but it could not be an unqualified one. Whilst recognition in the
Communication that pressure had increased at a local level was welcome,
it was disappointing that the Commission had failed to take seriously
the evidence provided by Member States. The UK believed the Commission
needed to accept that fraudulent claims for social welfare were a
growing problem, and that current rules on social security coordination
prevented Member States from taking the necessary steps to ensure that
only those migrating to work and contribute to a host country’s
economy could access welfare benefits. On the sham marriage handbook,
the UK and others were not in a position to accept the draft given its
narrow focus. The Home Secretary also highlighted the domestic changes
to tighten the UK’s implementation of free movement rules and to
protect local communities, which had been announced by the Prime
Minister. In conclusion, the UK said the EU of today was different to
the EU of thirty years ago and the Prime Minister had recently been
clear that transition to free movement for future accession countries
could not be done on the same basis as it was in the past. The UK
believed that abuse of free movement must also be part of the next
Justice and Home Affairs work programme.</hs_para>

Member States thought the Commission’s response to the abuse of
free movement was insufficient and ineffective, by failing to clarify
Member States’ legal powers or proposing new actions to protect
the freedom of movement from abuses such as benefit fraud, document
fraud and sham marriage. If the Commission was not in a position to
support, Member States would consider working together outside the EU
structures. Free movement rights came with responsibilities, and
tackling abuse would increase public trust in the EU and the national
authorities. Others noted that free movement was a fundamental right
and that the overwhelming majority of citizens move to work. However,
abuse, where it existed, needed to be tackled. The Presidency noted
that the Council would return to these issues in the future.</hs_para>

European External Action Service (EEAS) drew attention to the fact that
not every European who travelled to Syria was driven by extremism and
that humanitarian motives played a significant role. Eurojust noted

that cooperation with countries of origin and transit was the key to
preventing migrant deaths and illegal immigration flows. Ministers were
more cautious about further sea operations in the Mediterranean, and
the Commission’s proposal to open more legal migration channels
was met with scepticism by some Member States. The UK broadly welcomed
the proposed measures, but shared others’ concerns about
proposals for more protected entry and legal migration routes to the
EU, which were unlikely to have any significant impact on the problem.
The focus of the EU response should instead be on preventative work
upstream, particularly in Libya and Tunisia; this activity was also
important in the context of Syria. The Presidency confirmed that it

UK supported development of a short, strategic set of priorities and
reiterated that tackling free movement abuse, reducing illegal
immigration, action against human trafficking, return of foreign
offenders and improved exchange of criminal records should be the most
important priorities for action. The UK also argued that the JHA
Council should play a leading role in developing future guidelines. The
Commission noted its priorities would include better integration
policies, implementation of the Common European Asylum System,
solidarity and contingency planning, credible policies on tackling
irregular migration and return, strengthening internal security, and
preventing cross border crime, tackling trafficking of firearms,

Elliott’s report recognises the leading role of the food

consumers which is safe, resilient and free from crime, firmly on food
businesses. EU food law makes it clear that it is the responsibility of
food business operators to ensure that the food they sell is safe and
is as described. The need for a more effective audit process and a
balance between random and routine testing, reflect concerns expressed
during the horsemeat fraud incident. The food industry undertakes a
rigorous testing programme to ensure food authenticity. For horsemeat
alone, the results of over 31,000 tests have been reported to the Food
Standards Agency over the past nine months, none of which post incident
have tested positive. During the incident less than 1% of tests of beef
products in the UK were positive for horsemeat, compared to over 4% in

This is on top of the £900 primary schools currently receive for

previous UN OCHA estimate of 450,000 people has reduced, as
verification and registration has shown that the numbers initially
reported when displacement occurred were inflated. It is more difficult
to obtain data on the total numbers killed in Darfur in 2013. This is
due to the different groups involved (including peacekeepers, Sudanese
Armed Forces, members of rebel groups and civilians) and the various
