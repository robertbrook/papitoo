Wright:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend refers to the report that has
been produced today. As he knows, a significant point in it is that
there is not currently sufficiently good connection between offender
management that takes place inside custody and that that takes place
outside. As he will also recognise, our transforming rehabilitation
proposals intend to close that gap, so that offender management
involves the same provider from the closing months of someone’s
custodial sentence, through the gate and out into the community.
Transforming rehabilitation will start to address exactly the points
that this report

important and valid point. That is why we concluded after the simple
cautions review that cautions should not be used for any offence that
can be tried only in the Crown court. Indeed, going further than that,
certain offences that can be tried either in the Crown court or in a
magistrates court are also not suitable for cautions, including, in
particular, possession of a knife.</hs_Para>

specifically about the youth estate, but he is absolutely right that
education is just as important in the adult estate. Too many prisoners
cannot read and write properly, which means that their chances of
securing employment on release are much reduced. Under our reforms of
rehabilitation, we will expect providers to ensure that someone is
supported not only through the gate, but in the community for at least
12 months. One of the best ways of supporting them to stay free of
crime is to make sure that they get employment, so I would absolutely
expect them to be interested in literacy as well as many other
things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121744000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0001.htm#13121744000161"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13121744000373" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0001.htm#13121744000373">Mr

September last year, Sir Howard Davies agreed  to chair an

how the UK’s status as a leading global aviation hub can be
maintained, and this morning it published its interim report. I have
deposited copies of that report in the Library, and it is available on
the Airports Commission’s website. I know this issue is central

UK is a leader in aviation, with the third largest aviation network in
the world. The sector contributes £18 billion per year to our
economy, and employs around 220,000 workers directly and many more
indirectly. We need airports that put our country at the front of
global competition and allow people to get to where they want to go. We
also want airports that are quieter and meet our carbon commitments.
Today’s report is an important step towards both
goals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121744000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0001.htm#13121744000230">Many
Members of the House and their constituents hold strong views about the
right outcome, and it is right that we respect that. I will be writing
to invite Members to a briefing session early in the new year, when Sir
Howard will explain the contents of the commission’s report in
more detail. I take this opportunity to thank Sir Howard and his fellow
commissioners—Sir John Armitt, Professor Ricky
Burdett, Vivienne Cox, Dame Julia King, and Geoff Muirhead, who stood
down in September—for the care they have taken. Their interim
report is a detailed and professional piece of work based on careful
research, and it merits the fullest
consideration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121744000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0001.htm#13121744000231">It
may be helpful if I provide a brief overview of the key issues that
have been addressed. First, the interim report provides the
commission’s advice on the level of future airport capacity this
country will require, which is based on new evidence about a rapidly
changing industry. The commission has also consulted a wide range of
people and organisations, and as a result it offers a clear
recommendation that there is need for new runway capacity in the medium
term to support continued competitiveness and prosperity. We will, of
course, be looking carefully at that recommendation and at how best we
can take decisions that are in the long-term economic interest of the
country, while respecting the environment and quality of life. Sir
Howard is also clear in his report that there is no crisis of capacity
now. He does, however, conclude that we will need one additional runway
in the south-east by 2030, and in all likelihood a second by 2050. The
commission is clear that those recommendations can be consistent with
the UK’s climate change obligations.</hs_Para>

commission has announced which long-term options it intends to take
forward in the second phase of its work. The first option is Gatwick
Airport. The commission will consider a new runway spaced 
<?notus-xml column=622?>sufficiently south of the existing runway to permit fully independent
operation. The second and third options are for Heathrow Airport. The
Commission will consider, first, a new full-length runway to the north
west of the existing airport, as proposed by Heathrow Airport Ltd,
spaced sufficiently to permit fully independent operation; and
secondly, an extension of the existing northern runway to the west, as
proposed by Heathrow Hub Ltd, which would allow it to be operated as
two separate runways, one for departures and one for
arrivals.</hs_Para>

for the construction of a new airport in the Thames estuary have not
been shortlisted by the commission at this stage. However, the
commission intends to carry out further analysis of the feasibility and
impacts of  a new airport on the Isle of Grain and aims to
reach a decision in the second half of 2014 on whether this constitutes
a credible option for further development and detailed study. If this
option is then added to the shortlist, it will be subject to a process
of appraisal and consultation similar to that proposed for other
shortlisted options.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T12:40:53"></hs_TimeCode>In phase two of
its work, the commission will undertake detailed analysis and
consultation on each of these locations, in partnership with promoters.

the third key issue, the commission also recommends action to make
better use of our existing aviation infrastructure, particularly over
the next five years. I welcome this fresh thinking, much of which is
aimed at industry as much as the Government, about how we can make
improvements to our already strong aviation sector. The commission has
produced some interesting ideas including: the better use of airspace
to improve resilience at London airports; trials at Heathrow airport
to  smooth the early-morning arrival schedule to minimise
stacking and delays and to provide more predictable respite for local
communities; and an independent aviation noise authority to improve
decision making on noise issues. These are important recommendations
that merit a response in advance of decisions on longer-term

turn briefly to a second issue. Hon. Members will also be aware that
today the Office for National Statistics announced that from 1
September 2014 Network Rail will be reclassified and appear on the
Government’s balance sheet. As the Treasury and the Office for
Budget Responsibility noted when my right hon. Friend the Chancellor
made his autumn statement, this includes the company’s net debt

Rail on my Department’s website and placed copies in the

with Network Rail until its reclassification in September 2014. This
independent, statistical decision will not affect Network Rail’s
investment programmes, plans for High Speed 2 or the franchising

Commission appears to be recommending another runway at Heathrow, which
is exactly where we were  10 years ago. The proposal on Gatwick
appears to be “in addition to” rather than
“instead of” the proposal at Heathrow. I notice that the
Secretary of State studiously avoided expressing an opinion and I
understand that he wants to await the outcome of the commission.
However, could he tell us whether or not the Government think that the
commission is on the right track? Clearly if it is not, it would be
better to tell it now, rather than wait until 2015. I join everyone in
this House who believes that, 50 years after the Government first
looked at what should happen to London airport, we need to make a
decision, and we should do so as soon as possible. If we do not, we
will fall behind the rest of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121745000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0001.htm#13121745000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr McLoughlin" PimsId="1832" UID="13121745000107" xid="398" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0001.htm#13121745000107">Mr

Things have changed hugely in aviation over the last few years, which
is why it was right to set up this commission. The right hon. Gentleman

to that. How will that be achieved? The Government state in the mandate
that they expect NHS England to be able comprehensively to identify
levels of access to, and waiting times for, mental health services in
the community. Again, that is welcome, but let us take a moment to look
at the current ways in which performance in mental health services is
measured. The NHS outcomes framework is the mechanism, and it is
working well to cover physical health outcomes. When it comes to mental
outcomes, however, the picture remains
incomplete<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:49:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000056">What
I am seeking is an improvement in the range and depth of information. I
am after quality, not quantity. Why? It is because I want to see
developing in our local communities mental health services that
genuinely reflect local need. I welcome the publication this month by
the Minister, who is in his place, of the mental health dashboard,
which brings together existing information about mental health
provision. I note that in that document there is an acceptance that the
range and type of information available will have to develop, but there
is a concern that consistency and stability in what the dashboard
measures are
maintained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:50:31"></hs_TimeCode>. My

further welcome the creation of the mental health intelligence network
by NHS England and Public Health England. It sounds a bit James Bond,
but it is a practical means which will be launched next year to devise
more effective ways in which quality information can be gathered.
However, unless more work is done to fill in the gaps in relation to
mental health outcomes, I fear that important opportunities will be
missed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:51:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000058">What
measurements do we have so far? We have mortality rates of adults under
75 with severe mental health conditions. That information is being
collected and it is relevant to the first part of the NHS outcomes
framework. Those statistics reveal that life expectancy is 15 to 20
years shorter than the average in England; they also reveal the extent
of co-morbid physical conditions. Already, we can see how such
information is crucial to making the right interventions and tackling
those appalling statistics. There are also measurements related to
improving 
<?notus-xml column=643?>access to psychological services, which have helped to drive the
commissioning of more and more services at a local level. I warmly
welcome that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:51:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, like the proverbial Swiss cheese, gaps both in the range and
quality of measurement remain. I believe that mortality data should be
broken down further to clinical commissioning group level, which would
help to identify particular local needs—not just mental health
needs, but physical
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:52:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000059">Part
3 of the NHS outcomes framework aims to measure how well NHS services
help people to recover from illness or injury. A useful measurement of
recovery is the number of people who have or have had mental health
conditions who are able to gain employment. There are national
measurements, but they are not reflected in local indicators. If we are
to drive more locally based employment support services, that needs to
change. The outcomes framework is very much focused on acute services,
so measurement of their use by mental health patients, broken down
locally, would be very useful in helping to determine the extent of our
community services or where, to put it bluntly, firefighting is taking
place, as opposed to interventions in the
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:53:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000060">Part
4 of the outcomes framework deals with how well health services provide
a positive experience of care, so measures of psychiatric in-patient or
secure services have to be made. In-patients at acute hospitals
undergoing treatment for physical conditions are rightly asked for a
lot of information, all designed to make services more attuned to
aspects such as age and gender, for example. We owe this to mental
health patients using acute services too. They are among the most
vulnerable people in our society and a service that is  
<?notus-xml column=644?>better attuned to their individual needs will yield better results. At
present there is no collection of information about the duration of
untreated psychosis—in other words, the length of time it takes
between someone presenting with a psychosis and their treatment. How
will we comprehensively identify problems with delays in referral and
treatment if this is not
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:54:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000061">In
relation to people detained under the Mental Health Act, let us not
forget that we still have far too many people, including children,
being detained in police cells, rather than in an appropriate place of
safety. The number of incidences is recorded, but not the outcome. That
is another example of how a lack of quality information prevents this
issue from being properly prioritised and prevents local analysis of
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T13:54:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000062">One

health is an artificial one which must be removed. They need—we
need—commissioned services that are truly responsive to our

public service delivery being built before our eyes, and not just the
changes in local authorities that I have identified, but wider changes
such as the troubled families programme and welfare changes,
particularly the introduction of universal credit. They are all looking
at connecting spending across the country. It is astonishing that the

point becomes increasingly relevant as Government policy cuts across
departmental silos as fresh patterns of local delivery develop and
local authorities commission services from, and develop partnerships
with, an ever wider range of providers. The ad hoc Bill Committee that

that the Bill should provide an unambiguous basis for insight into
spend across central and local government, but as it stands it does
not. Would it not be sensible—I ask this again in the hope that
the Minister will change his mind at the eleventh hour—in the
management of audit contracts if two authorities working together
substantially and significantly could appoint a lead audit for a
particular set of services, rather than having two separate auditors

services, perhaps even reaching different

would rather have auditors work together to reach a shared view on
whether services represent value for money and whether public money is
being spent effectively, so an audit presented to a relevant authority
might contain sections that had been prepared jointly and appropriately
with other auditors of local spend, perhaps those from other relevant
authorities or the National Audit Office. That audit would then be much
more valuable, and not only to the council, but to the public and
Parliament, in showing whether money was being spent well. For example,
in my area there is an arrangement for shared services between
Northamptonshire and Cambridgeshire county councils. There are
questions about whether that genuinely delivers value for money. I am
concerned that an audit in which they are each treated entirely
separately and reported on separately will not give us a real sense of
whether the partnership is delivering the value for money that I and my

Given that they are responsible for such significant amounts of public
money, and given the pace of change in LEPs across the country, the
Minister’s response was simply inadequate. He could make a
simple amendment to schedule 2 that would allow us to treat LEPs as a
relevant local authority so that not only can we look at the local
spend, but we can consider how the national spend will be accounted for
as it goes into those LEPs in a way that does not mean having to look
at the separate audits of a whole range of different Departments and
agencies. If the Minister is not minded to accept our amendment to
schedule 2, that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:09:41"></hs_TimeCode>
could be addressed by simply accepting new clause 1, which would allow
integrated audit, because LEPs are precisely the kind of area where
integrated audit is much needed. Whether he chooses to accept new

Government’s main counter is that transparency increases costs
and is not necessary because councils can already be subject to the
Freedom of Information Act 2000. However, that is not sufficient given
the travel towards ever greater outsourcing of services. Local
government controls about a quarter of all public spending and
contracts out an increasing amount of services to private providers. It
is responsible for making decisions about a number of matters where the
interests of private companies are often in tension with the wishes of
the electorate. For all those reasons, local government is inherently
exposed to corruption risks. On the whole, it navigates and mitigates
those risks admirably, and we should recognise that and keep in
proportion the level of concern. However, the public will want to know
that we in this place have done our very best to ensure that there is
transparency in how local authorities mitigate the risks and manage
contracts.</hs_Para>

their conduct and standards in public office, including that of elected

can save money. Some of the work of the Audit Commission has saved
billions of pounds of public money. There is evidence from local
authorities around the country of how transparency can at times shine a
light on areas of public spending that leads to savings to the public

should not be auditing themselves.  As I have said, councils
are increasingly outsourcing contracts to the private sector. When a
company, be it PricewaterhouseCoopers, Deloitte and Touche, KPMG, Ernst
and Young or some other provider—perhaps a smaller firm or even
a new entrant to the audit market, as the Government hope will
happen—provides services other than audit to a council, it
should not then audit those same services. That is a simple but very
important principle, because there is clearly a conflict of interest

carry out the audit so as to bring a measure of independence when
looking at areas of spend and operation for which that self-same
company is responsible. We listened to those arguments, which were made

uphold professional standards of conduct and that in the private sector

not now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>. It is,

believe—this is why I tabled new clause 3—that we need to
address that. Central Government need to be clear about how often it is
happening in local government and about the scale of its use and
whether it is being used appropriately. They also need to address
whether they have a role to play in providing further and better
guidelines on how part 2 items should be addressed and on how items
should be deemed to be commercially confidential or otherwise for the

relates to the overall system. Under the previous Government’s
local government reforms, which I opposed, we now have quite a
centralised local council system whereby the leader is elected and then
appoints the cabinet. They are all on a relatively high income these
days. I do not begrudge anyone being paid the rate for the job, but the
leader of the council in my area is on £65,000 a year and is
appointing other members of the cabinet on salaries of between
£45,000 and £55,000 a year. That gives the leader
extremely wide-ranging powers of patronage and it is the leader who
decides which items go into the confidential part of the cabinet
agenda. They do so after being given some advice, about which I also
have concerns, which I will come to.</hs_Para>

corrupt decision-making. That level of centralised control is part of
the problem we now have. One of the issues thrown up by Transparency
International’s report is that, structurally, we have opened
ourselves up to decisions being made by a very limited number of
councillors, with limited scrutiny by others. Whatever people thought

but those committees work only if they are properly resourced and can
scrutinise decisions with an element of detailed research and

scrutiny. There is not sufficient investment in officers to support
such committees, and patronage in relation to them exerts a role in
preventing its members from having independence of

the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford) suggests that that should be left
to local government, but that is the problem. In areas such as mine,
which is increasingly becoming a one-party state, there is no way to
enable a proper independent examination of scrutiny practices or to
know whether scrutiny structures are operational. If the Audit
Commission is no longer to exist, there does not seem to be any other
body, other than the Secretary of State, with the power to instigate an
investigation into whether scrutiny is working. I am sure that it works
extremely effectively in some areas, but in others it is poor to the

new clauses are about transparency and scrutiny, but my new clause 5
relates to Transparency International’s concern about the lack
of resource to investigate corruption in individual councils. I am
concerned because it is very difficult to find information anywhere
about the scale of local authority investment to ensure full probity.
For example, with the latest round of cuts in local government, I am
anxious about cuts to areas involving the management of accounts and
their internal audit in finance departments. Because cuts in staffing
have been so large, there is vulnerability in local government in that
staff are not available for councillors to be able to ensure proper
investigation or to bring to book corrupt elements. The new clause
therefore suggests that the Secretary of State should prepare and lay
before the House a report on the adequacy of resources and staffing
levels, but also on the structures and procedures that individual
authorities have put in place to detect and investigate fraud. At the
moment, there is fragility in local government in relation to the
investigation and detection of
fraud<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:33:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000142">My
new clause 6 is about compromise agreements. I have asked questions
over the past year about the use of such agreements within local
government, and the response has been that it is not monitored by the
Department for Communities and Local Government and that, therefore, no
information is available. We have to go back to anecdote, which is the
problem in this debate. As Transparency International has highlighted
in its report, the vast majority of council officials leaving in my
area do so on the basis of compromise agreements. I do not understand
why such agreements are used to ensure that there is a gagging clause
to prevent an official from commenting on their local
authority’s activities, efficiency and other
matters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000143">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:35:01"></hs_TimeCode>
can understand to a certain extent the use of compromise agreements in
the private sector, but their use in the public sector seems to
undermine the structures and procedures we put in place for
whistleblowing. To cite my own area again, officers seem to disappear
time 
<?notus-xml column=657?>and again, particularly after criticising the local authority or
individual councillors—their desk is suddenly vacated and they
have gone—and we then discover that they have left under a
compromise agreement. They do not gain their full benefits until that
has been negotiated—often, I have to say, at the door of the
tribunal—but a compromise agreement is signed, so they get their
pay-off, but they are not allowed to comment on the issues that may
well have been what resulted in their leaving the authority. I doubt
that that is peculiar to my own local authority, but I think that it
flies in the face of openness, transparency and
accountability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000144">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:36:49"></hs_TimeCode>
am simply suggesting that the Secretary of State should investigate
what is happening in relation to such matters. It would be helpful to
know how frequently compromise agreements are used across local
authorities. It would also be useful to know how often confidentiality
clauses are incorporated into such agreements and, frankly, why there
is any need for them. I can understand their use to a certain extent if
there are strict matters of commercial confidentiality involving a
contract between a local authority and an individual company, but their
use seems to range much further and even to cover any element of
criticism of a local authority and its
actions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000145">My

within individual local authorities, and they have produced cuts that
have cut the very officers needed to maintain levels of probity and

suggest that the Government need—the Minister should take this
upon his shoulders—to have a close watching brief on these

compatible with the principles of public service provision. Such
stealth and secrecy cannot be allowed to continue. It is only right
that as more and more public services that were once the sole preserve
of local and national Government are contracted out beyond the public
sector, steps are taken to ensure that the same access arrangements are
required of private and voluntary sector providers. To do otherwise is
unfairly to insulate the Government, the Department and favoured
contractors from adequate scrutiny and
accountability<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T14:50:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000169">One
of the major risk factors that flow from a position of secrecy is the
potential for fraud and corruption. Other Members have addressed that
point in more detail. In public service provision, that is a crime
against each and every taxpayer, and the public should be granted
protection against such transgressions by all providers of public
services being made subject to the requirements of the Freedom of

the market. It is important that those are subject to appropriate
scrutiny, and we must therefore ensure that instruments are available

to the Treasury, up to £20 billion will be spent by local
enterprise partnerships, and proper scrutiny and auditing arrangements
must be in place to ensure that that money is expended properly. The
public demand nothing less, and if the Government do not support this
measure it is incumbent on them to explain how that scrutiny will take
place. If scandals are uncovered in the future because of a
lackadaisical approach adopted by the Government, they will not be able
to say they were not warned. I hope the Minister will sleep easy in his

it to examine all or groups of relevant authorities. That will enable a
more end-to-end view on the use of public money. It will not enable the

The Bill maintains local people’s current extensive rights to

“Fighting Fraud Locally: the Local Government Fraud

fraud, realise cash savings and work together to prevent future fraud

over the next two years. We have also committed to working urgently

the counter-fraud landscape. Of primary importance is the national
fraud initiative which, since it began in 1996, has helped to identify
over £1 billion potentially lost to fraud, error and

announced that the initiative and associated data-matching powers would

39 will give the Secretary of State the power to dictate when and how
councils can publish communications to local citizens. Of even more
concern to us is the fact that the Secretary of State is taking a power
of censorship to direct what issues and information councils can talk

the examples given by the Minister and his Back Benchers included not
allowing elected leaders of a local authority to publish a comment on
the effect of central Government funding changes—so furious are
the Government that councils are letting their residents know the scale

State could force councils to use pro-government terminology such as
the benign-sounding “spare room subsidy” rather than the
“bedroom tax”, which betrays how unpopular and unfair the
policy is to many of the 
<?notus-xml column=674?>poorest and most vulnerable people—including many disabled

Government argue that the power is needed because local authorities are
breaching the current voluntary code on local authority publicity. Yet
they have managed to find only one example of a breach; Tower
Hamlets’ publication “East End Life”, which seems

that the Government have failed to take any action, using the powers
they already have, in more than three years since they became aware of
the level of concern, including that reported by Labour councillors in
Tower Hamlets. We agree with the Secretary of State that that
publication is a problem, but we ask again why the Government have
taken no action—no action at all. In fact, the Minister
attempted to explain to me in an answer to a parliamentary question
that it is because the Secretary of State has not done anything that he
now believes that he needs to give himself these dictatorial powers. It
is so extraordinary that one might assume that if councils knew the

Sawford:</Member></B> My hon. Friend, who chairs the Select Committee,
is right. I think that there is often a complementarity between the
newspapers, news sheets and magazines published by councils and other
local papers. There is often a considerable spin-off in the form of the
relationship between the communications that councils promote through
their papers about local events and community organisations, and how
vibrant local newspapers are able to become in terms of, for example,
the advertising revenue that they can create in relation to such
community events and
activities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121751000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0002.htm#13121751000281">The
Minister has claimed that the advertising in the <I>Nene Valley News
</I>is the problem. First, it is not included in the code; secondly, I
would gladly facilitate a meeting between the Minister and the local
small businesses and traders who use the low-cost space in the <I>Nene
Valley News</I>, and who are now extremely worried about how they will
get business. I quoted one individual at length in Committee, but for
brevity I shall merely say now that he concluded his remarks to me on
this matter by saying, “Aren’t the Tories supposed to be
a party that likes business?” He is very sceptical about the
motivation for, and is concerned about the effect of, this crass,
uninformed and undemocratic clause.</hs_Para>

damage community groups, scout organisations, local charitable
organisations, small businesses and the food banks which, sadly, are
needed in our communities, as they will not be able to publicise their
activities through the local free sheet—through the local
council. Many of my constituents have contacted me to tell me that they
object to what the Government are doing. I hope that all hon. Members

the Government are seeking to put the Secretary of State in the

releases praising the Government. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:53:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Corby said, as long as local government is praising the
policies of central Government that is okay, but if it has the temerity
to point out that in some way what the Government are doing might have
a negative impact on the communities that they represent, then woe
betide them; that is not acceptable. When the Secretary of State seeks
to take that kind of power to himself, we have to ask what kind of
country we want to live in. This is completely wrong. Just look at the
document—it could be a Tory hand-out. It has even suggested the
headline that the local authorities might like to put on their press
releases. It reads, “Pickles praises troubled families

many local authorities and the newspaper in their local area. It is a
significant overstatement of the truth to suggest that local
authorities producing their newspaper are in any way responsible for
the decline in the local newspaper industry. Many other factors, not
least access to online information, are responsible for the decline.
What the Government seek to do will not arrest that decline and might
make matters worse. The truth is that, where there is a partnership
with the local newspaper serving the local authority area, limiting the
number of times the council can produce information through its
newsletters will diminish the local newspaper’s income stream.

decline. I hope the Minister will reflect on

Cunningham:</Member></B><B> </B>I rise to support
amendments 14 to 16. Nothing is more likely to get the blood rising in
the body of a journalist, even one who has not worked in mainstream
journalism for half a lifetime, than the idea that someone wants to
interfere in the message they are trying to deliver to their readers.
That was my reaction when I first heard about the Secretary of
State’s ambition to become editor-in-chief of all council
publications, from city authority newspapers to parish council
newsletters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000026">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:09:35"></hs_TimeCode>
spent many a happy year working as a journalist in the local and
regional media and then in the communications industry for a blue-chip
company. I never experienced any real interference, and certainly
nothing like the level that the Secretary of State wants. Likewise, in
my 20 years as a councillor, first for Cleveland 
<?notus-xml column=683?>county council and then for Stockton-on-Tees borough council, I never
saw the abuse of power through publications of which the Secretary of
State appears to be so terrified.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:09:35"></hs_TimeCode> will
therefore come as no surprise that, as a former journalist and
councillor, I have particular concerns about clause 39, which gives the
Secretary of State the power to direct local authorities to comply with
a specific code of conduct relating to their publicity
materials.</hs_Para>

the Bill passes in its current form, as other Members have said, the
Secretary of State will be appointing himself editor-in-chief of Local
Government Inc. and assigning himself carte blanche to intervene,
irrespective of whether he believes a local authority is complying with
the code of practice. So that we are clear about the extent and reach
of the proposed powers, I will explain that clause 39 would apply to
all local authority publicity material, including newspapers, such as
the quarterly <I>Stockton News</I> in my constituency which is
delivered to so many residents across the borough to keep them informed
about services and what is going on in the local authority area. It
would apply to posters advertising the many events, schemes and
projects that local authorities promote for the benefit of their
citizens. It would also apply to the social media updates that local
authorities provide to ensure that residents have up-to-date
information.</hs_Para>

an aside, I would be fascinated to know how the Secretary of State
plans to monitor the thousands of communications emanating from
councils across the country every day. Does he have plans for an army
of Twitter monitors, Facebook spies and online assessors to ensure that
there can be no challenge to his authority? Of course not, so perhaps
the Minister can explain just how that brave new world will be
policed.</hs_Para>

proposed in clause 39 are entirely disproportionate and represent a
stubbornly heavy-handed response, as the Government have identified
only one example of a local authority apparently abusing its position.
Even in that instance, as other Members have said, the local authority
involved has denied the accusation of contravening the
Government’s current code of recommended practice. I agree that
any political bias would be unacceptable in local authority publicity,
and the code of conduct requires objectivity, even-handedness and
appropriateness. That much is beyond contention. It was with that in
mind that we encouraged the Government to take action in cases where
possible breaches are identified in order to ensure neutrality and
fairness. However, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:08:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford) has said, the Government have not
even written to the local authority in question about the publication.
I must therefore question whether the Secretary of State truly believes
that a breach has been committed.</hs_Para>

is also worth repeating that, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:08:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Corby said, through a series of freedom of information
requests it has been established that, since coming to power in May
2010, the Government have not contacted a single local authority to
express concern about potential breaches of the code. Perhaps they can
tell us how many they expect to contact in the future under the new
proposals. Assuming that the Government are implementing the current
code of practice in full, we must take it from that that few councils,
if any, are 
<?notus-xml column=684?>breaking existing recommendations. All of that begs the following
question: why fix something that is not
broken?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000031">When
we bear these factors in mind, the context of the Secretary of
State’s attempted power-grab politics becomes abundantly clear.
With the lobbying Bill currently seeking to limit the campaigning that
third sector and voluntary organisations are able to undertake, it
appears that the unpopularity of the Government’s policies has
begun to sink in. Is the Secretary of State really heading up a
damage-limitation mission to control how local authorities communicate
the politically toxic effects of the Government’s policies to
their local communities merely by explaining the changes and cuts that
they need to
make<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:10:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000032">We
know from copies of the template press releases that the Department has
issued to local authorities’ press teams that they encourage
bias as they frame Government policy in what could only be described as
positive terms. Does this mean that the Secretary of State will have to
punish one of his own Conservative-led councils for being politically
biased for printing material from his own Department? This illustrates
the absurdity of his proposals and reveals an outrageous double
standard, if ever there was one.</hs_Para>

39 not only grants to the Secretary of State the ability to determine
when and how local authorities can publish communications to local
residents but assigns to him the ability to dictate the issues and
information that they can communicate as well—perhaps an ideal
set of circumstances that would put him on a par with the Rupert
Murdochs of this world. Why does he not just ban all the newspapers,
ban all the publicity and ban all the posters? It would have
the same effect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:11:17"></hs_TimeCode>.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:11:52"></hs_TimeCode> that were not
extreme enough, he is similarly assigned the ability to
control the language and phraseology that local authorities will be
permitted to use. Perhaps the Government will manage to rid the public
of the bedroom tax after all, but changing the words will not change
the devastating effects that his policies are having on some of our
most needy
people.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:11:36"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

am sure that the significance of this move, coming as it does so soon
after the intense debates that have been had on the topic of press
regulation and the need to remove the risk of political interference
and maintain the sanctity of free speech, will not be wasted on Members
on both sides of the House.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:11:52"></hs_TimeCode>I am minded to
ask the Secretary of State whether, were he to assume these new powers,
his reformulated role would be compliant with the spirit of the royal
charter in providing the public with better protection from press
abuses while upholding the freedom of expression that is so central to
our democracy. Surely those provisions should apply to him as well. A
new term has been coined for him this afternoon: the
censor-in-chief—which is certainly what he will be with these
powers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:12:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000035">In
short, such wide-ranging powers will disfranchise local authorities,
removing any semblance of their discretion over communications with
residents. Let us not forget that local authorities have a
responsibility to represent those residents and to provide services for
them, and that transparency and accountability are fundamental
cornerstones of that duty. Were an authority unable to protect the
interests of its residents, it would unquestionably be failing in its
duties.</hs_Para>

Lewis:</Member></B> First, let me be clear that good communication
between a local authority and the public is important. Let me also be
clear that what clause 39 delivers is a manifesto pledge by both
coalition parties. Local authority publicity can be expensive and it
can be controversial, so it is important that local authorities get it
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000045">In
Committee I outlined our intentions and explained exactly what the
clause seeks to achieve. We should be conscious of the fact that
localism is about empowering local people to be able to challenge and
see, transparently, what their local authority is doing. This is about
true localism and making sure that we are also able to do our bit to
defend the independent local
press.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000046">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:18:24"></hs_TimeCode>
code of recommended practice on local authority publicity ensures that
publicity is, among other things, cost-effective, objective,
even-handed and appropriate, and Labour Members have agreed in
principle with the voluntary code. It ensures that taxpayers’
money is not wasted on issuing inappropriate publicity or publicity
that political parties themselves should be issuing, rather than a
local council using taxpayers’
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:18:47"></hs_TimeCode> to do it.

Lewis:</Member></B> I suspect that deep down inside,
the hon. Gentleman—we almost became hon. Friends in
Committee—probably realises that there is a world of difference
between a template press release sent to independent local journalists
and a municipal taxpayer-funded newspaper that takes away the
competition of a local independent press. None of the provisions in the
Bill makes any changes to the publicity
code<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:19:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000049">Let
me give a very clear example of how the process might work for a local
authority publishing a weekly newspaper—such as <I>Nene Valley

direct competition to the local independent press that is so important
in holding councils to account. Under the provisions, the Secretary of
State, after advising the local authority that he intends to do so and
giving it time to make any representations it wishes—such as
that there is no other 
<?notus-xml column=687?>local paper—may, if he thinks fit, issue a
direction requiring that the local authority comply with some or all of
the code, but particularly, let us say, the part advising local
authorities that council newsletters should be issued no more than
quarterly. If the Secretary of State considers that a group of local
authorities, or even all local authorities in England, should be
required to follow the guidance in the code, he must of course make an
order, which would need to be debated and agreed by both Houses of

16 seeks to remove the provisions to ensure that a group of local
authorities, or all local authorities in England, comply with the

necessary, by all local authorities in

were happy to amend the Bill to give effect to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:22:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Amendment 16
would quite wrongly undo the power and the recommendation, leaving a
ridiculous situation in which if the Secretary

15 would place a very simple expectation on the Secretary of State:
that he would act on the receipt of evidence, that he would share that
evidence with the local authority and that he would ask it to comment.

discretion as well as to national direction. The Secretary of State
would simply have to say, in taking enforcement action against a local
authority, that he had found a breach of the code. It would be

Lewis:</Member></B> Our amendments are precautionary measures to remove
the risk of local authority budgeting being adversely impacted in the
event of a delay to the Bill taking effect. Clause 41 currently
provides that the council tax referendum calculations will take account
of levies from 1 April 2014. The referendum principles, which we intend
to publish in draft very shortly, will be put to this House for
approval in February as normal. Those principles will take account of
levies, but will be subject to the will of Parliament and the Bill,
which will have come into force by
then<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768000598">The
amendments have a relatively simple effect. Together, amendments 6, 9,
10 and 11 provide that if the Bill is passed by 5 February—the
likely date by which the referendum principles must be laid before
Parliament—the provisions in clause 41 will take effect
immediately and the changes to the referendum provisions will take
effect for the 2014-15 financial year. Otherwise, the changes will take
effect by order from 2015-16. There is no reason to believe that the
provisions will not be in force before the referendum principles are
approved, but we are tabling this group of amendments to give local
authorities advance certainty over timings so that they can be
confident that any delay in Parliament would not impact on their
budget-setting

7 is a minor amendment clarifying that the clause does not alter the
existing discretion of the Secretary of State when determining
categories of authority for 2014-15. Amendment 8 addresses the ability
of the Secretary of State to determine categories of local
authorities on the basis of whether their 2013-14 council tax increase
would have been excessive had levies been taken into account. The
clause puts this existing ability beyond question and does not extend
it further. Similarly, the amendment does not extend that existing
ability, but updates the references to increases in 2013-14 to include
references to increases in 2014-15, should the provisions take effect
from 2015-16<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>.

protection for authorities still exists if levies are to be included

was signed, there had been no discussion about changing the rules on

the poorest and most vulnerable people are the most exposed to flood

area was touched upon on Second Reading and debated in more depth in

content to take away and consider the clarifications and assurances I

this amendment has been tabled, I am happy to repeat some of the points
discussed in Committee and to provide hon. Members more widely with any
further expansion I can give. Although the amendment would have a wider
effect, I understand that its intent is to address a single specific
case—that of the Leeds city region deal— where there are
plans to create a transport investment fund that would allow about
£1 billion to be raised from grants, contributions from
stakeholders and borrowing. Repayment of that borrowing will be met by
the constituent authorities via modest increases in the transport levy
over the next decade. This arrangement is novel. It will provide
much-needed investment in the region and remains an arrangement that
the Government are committed to and happy to support.

often passionate critique put forward by the Opposition in the course

that outdated legislation. The measures to open up local council

transparency of local decision making. I am pleased that we have
achieved consensus on that as it shows that in this digital age, as the
way the public consumes information changes, it is no longer right that
decisions should be made out of the sight of local taxpayers. We will,
of course, work closely with interested parties to ensure that, as we
agreed in Committee, we strike the right balance in the regulations

Bill is the culmination of a great deal of work with a number of third
parties, particularly the Audit Commission, which I would also like to
thank for its support and healthy challenge throughout this process.
During the Bill’s passage through the House, we have made, as
has been noted, a number of amendments to strengthen it. In addition to
the two new measures we have added, we have also made amendments to
enable the sector to set up collective procurement arrangements,
through which relevant authorities can choose to have an auditor
appointed on their behalf. That has been welcomed by the Local
Government Association and we will continue to work with it in
developing the regulations that will set out the approach in more

prompted by debates in the other place, we have amended the Bill to
extend the purposes for which data-matching exercises may be used. That
will enable the future owner of the national fraud initiative to
continue to undertake data-matching exercises on the detection of
errors and inaccuracies, as the Audit Commission can under its existing
powers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:17:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768001166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768001166">In
addition, we have made a number of other technical and clarifying
amendments to several of the local audit provisions, which will ensure
the smooth and effective operation of the new audit regime after the
Audit Commission’s demise. In addition to the amendment we have
made today to support the transparency of the auditor appointment
process, we have also clarified how the provisions apply to parish
meetings, the qualifications and eligibility criteria for local
auditors and how local auditors will recover costs for undertaking all
their statutory

have had a lengthy debate about the local government publicity code. I
think it is safe to say that we are all agreed on the content of the
code, but that there is a difference of opinion about how that code
should be enforced. I say again that it is right that action should be
taken when authorities are failing to comply with the code. By ensuring
compliance, the Bill will support local accountability by protecting
the local free press from unfair competition and preventing
taxpayers’ hard-earned money from being squandered on propaganda
and competing with the local independent
press<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

further protects the taxpayers’ pound by ensuring that levies
will be included within the council tax referendum principles. No
longer will a local authority be able to raise council tax through back
door levy increases, making taxpayers pay more for services that
councils down the road do in-house and within the referendum
principles. That levels the playing field for local authorities and the
amendment we have made today will provide certainty for those

conclusion, the Bill is another important step in delivering the
Government’s localist agenda. It deals with some of the
fundamental principles of good governance and good government, it
promotes responsible and robust public accounting, it drives decision
making down to the local level and it protects local taxpayers and
defends local democracy. To return to my opening remarks, it is an

we know, this is a Bill that arises from a very early decision that the
Secretary of State took, which was to abolish the Audit Commission.
When we heard from him on Second Reading, he was convinced that it was
the right thing to do. We all recognise that the commission is going,
but only time will tell whether it was right for the Secretary of State

is striking about the Bill, however, is that the quality of some of the
content we have debated at length has not benefited from the length of
time it has taken the Government to bring it forward, in part because
of the complexity of what has been removed and therefore the need to
construct arrangements to replace it. I acknowledge that the Government
moved on the issue of joint procurement, and I am grateful to the
Minister for listening to the arguments made by local government and by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:22:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Corby, but I am genuinely sorry that the Minister either
has not wanted to get the arguments that we made or has not properly
understood the consequences of the Bill failing to anticipate the new

important that the public have the right to understand what is
happening and have access to information. Listening to the Minister
this afternoon, the more he protested that our amendment was not
necessary, the more puzzled I became. Then there was a moment of what I
hope was conversion. I am delighted by what he had to say when pressed
by my hon. Friends. We will hold him to what he said about ensuring
that the public has exactly the same right as it currently has using

am very sorry that the Government have not made provision for auditing
that will be fit for purpose for the years ahead. The
Minister did not do justice to the argument that we advanced. We did
not suggest that the Bill prevents local authorities from working
together with each other or with central Government—for example,
through the troubled families initiative. That is not our argument. Our
argument is that when the Whitehall and the local pound are brought
together to provide services at a local level, there will continue to
be different audit arrangements.</hs_Para>

say to the Minister, and I hope he will reflect on it even when the
Bill has become an Act, that that does not make sense. An audit,
especially when the Bill gives us a chance to set it on a new footing,
must take account of the changing way in which public money is spent,
particularly as community budgets develop. It does not make sense if
there is a community budget for different bodies, with the NAO trying

certainty on which financial planning has to be based, and undermine
the confidence of those who will negotiate with them in future, who
will ask themselves, “Hey, look what happened to the Leeds city

for Corby (Andy Sawford) has been very apparent. It would be remiss of

Bill has pluses. It was right to abolish the Audit Commission. Having
gone through the whole passage of the Bill, we have got to a pretty
good place as regards auditing. I feel reassured by the Minister on the
remaining issues. I am particularly pleased that he will
continue  to work on regulations with the Local Government
Association. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:33:39"></hs_TimeCode>I
applaud the modernisation of parish polls, 
<?notus-xml column=710?>which I am sure will be a great relief to parishes in my constituency. I
welcome more openness in the recording and publication of council

have discussed the publicity code at much length today. Clearly, there
is agreement on the code itself across the House, but following its
implementation and impact will possibly be an interesting experience. I
can see the point of including levies in the referendum principles,
thereby preventing unaccountable levying authorities from exerting
pressure on council tax, but there is more talking to do about the
potential unintended consequences. The Minister indicated that he would
continue to listen to people’s
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768001193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768001193"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:34:31"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
the Bill does not repeal the duty on local authorities to publish
statutory notices in their local newspapers. I accept that the
Government feel that this is not the right time to do that, but I urge
them to keep looking at the issue. It is a burden on local government,
given the tightness of its finances, and it is also the most
ineffective way to communicate very important information to local
residents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:35:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13121768001333" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768001333">5.35

radium-226 were dumped on the Dalgety Bay foreshore by people on behalf
of the Ministry of Defence. It is now just under a quarter
of a century since the Ministry accepted that the contamination existed
and posed a potential safety risk. It is now three years since the
discovery of large amounts of contaminated particles that, as a result
of coastal erosion, had risen to the surface, with some particles
having a level of radiation that is judged to be a risk to health and
thus completely unacceptable. It is now nearly two years since the
Ministry of Defence committed itself to a plan that required the
polluter to clean up the area. It is now six months since the Committee
on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment and Public Health
England, the relevant health body advising the Ministry, called for the
clean-up to be agreed and to happen as soon as

more than 50 years of contamination, nearly 25 years of the Ministry of
Defence knowing about the risks, two years of knowing the seriousness
of the risk and the likely escalation of such risks, and two years in
February since a plan was agreed with the Scottish Environment
Protection Agency, there has been no clean-up, no agreement to fund a
clean-up, no agreement on a plan for a clean-up, no agreement even on
the options for such a plan and, as yet, no presentation of the options
for a clean-up plan or the promised consultation on those options.
Indeed, the Ministry of Defence has yet to agree to what it promised in
February 2012 to do by May this year—publication of the options
for remedial action, acceptance of responsibility by the polluter for
the pollution and a plan to fund the
clean-up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:41:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768001219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768001219">It

issue of the contamination and its significance cannot be wished away.
Dalgety Bay is already the first and only area of the United Kingdom
where a radiation risk assessment has had to be done to measure the
extent of the contamination. It is also the first and only area of the
country to be the subject of what is called an appropriate person
report—a report under the legislation dealing with radiation
contamination—which has been produced through very detailed
research by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. It has
concluded that, without any doubt in the matter, the polluter of the
area is indeed the Ministry of
Defence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768001224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0003.htm#13121768001224">Dalgety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T17:44:24"></hs_TimeCode>
Bay is therefore not only the first area subject to such a risk
assessment and to the naming of a polluter, but it is still at risk of
being named by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency as the only
radiation contaminated area in the United Kingdom, which has never
happened to areas where there are nuclear weapons, nuclear
power stations or nuclear waste storage. If it had to be imposed on the
area, which is a scenic part of the Fife coastal walk, such a decision
would blight the foreshore, harm the environment and cause difficulties

have to ask you, Mr Speaker, for a fifth debate before the responsible

without identifying where any significant health risk might emanate on
the site, the precedent could cost hundreds of millions of pounds in
extensive and unnecessary remedial work across the country. Statute

the right hon. Gentleman made his remarks, a scoping risk assessment
was undertaken by the Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental
Hazards in 2012. It took account of the two high-activity objects found
in late 2011 and two subsequent objects found in April 2012, and,
together with the current management measures, concluded that the risk
of attributable cancer from Dalgety Bay was actually less than one in
10 million. That is less than the risk that informed the
right hon. Gentleman’s 1998 reassurance by an order of
magnitude. In addition, the most recent cancer report collated by
COMARE found no evidence of the occurrence of cancers in the local
population that would ordinarily be attributed to the presence of
radium-226<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T18:06:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121768001272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/debtext/131217-0004.htm#13121768001272">The

needs to be very careful indeed about raising fears in his local
population. He knows full well that the Government will comply with
statute, but I have told him that we will go beyond that. We will
voluntarily play our full and proper part in protecting public health,

be under any other impression—that it was only in 2010 and 2011
that the scale of the particles appearing on the surface became so
great that we had to have the extra investigations, to find out what
needed to be done. The main point, which should not be evaded when we
are talking about all the other issues in this debate, is that this
clean-up will have to happen. The engineering options will have to be
set out, and the Ministry of Defence will have to accept
responsibility. When the Minister presents the options paper in
January, will he narrow down the options to those that are realistic,
and then have an immediate public consultation on them? Will he then
agree to set a timetable under which he will agree to fund the chosen
option? We have agreed that he wants to dispense with lawyers whenever
possible. Let us now have a sensible timetable so that we can get this
done. We must not go through another winter with this contamination

Minister, as I think he misunderstood me: when he publishes his options

mean another few months of delay. Can he not narrow down the options by
January, so that we can then set a realistic timetable to get the work
done, and proper funding for it, as well as the public consultation

am pleased to have secured this debate on the Tomlinson report prior to
the Christmas recess, because it is important and touches on a lot of
my work on interest rate swap mis-selling. The report’s scope is
wider than just the interest rate swap mis-selling scandal, and it
looks at how a certain part of the Royal Bank of Scotland, namely the
global restructuring group, has been operating in relation to small
businesses. It is important to place on the record that Lawrence
Tomlinson’s findings reflect what I have seen both as a
constituency MP and in my work on interest rate swap
mis-selling<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T09:31:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000009">Prior
to the report’s publication, Lawrence Tomlinson spoke to the
all-party parliamentary group on interest rate swap mis-selling, and it
is fair to say that many Members in that meeting were shocked by what
they heard about banks’ behaviour. What should concern 
us more than the fact that Members were shocked by Mr
Tomlinson’s comments is that many of them were not surprised.
When some of the report’s findings were highlighted, it was
concerning to see that such activity was recognised by Members from
their constituency casework. If MPs are not surprised by allegations of
behaviour that verges on the criminal, there is cause for significant
concern about banks’
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T09:32:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000010">Since
the publication of the report and its findings, there has been a
certain degree of blow-back. Elements of the press have suggested that
Mr Tomlinson might have a personal agenda or vendetta against RBS. I
therefore want to place on the record that I have never banked or had
any banking facilities with RBS, and have no vendetta whatever against
it. My concern lies with the numerous constituents who have been
treated in a manner that I find unacceptable. It is important to
highlight what the report found and how it resonates with those of us
who have dealt with businesses that have been badly treated by their
banks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T09:32:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000011">The
report was met with a significant degree of sympathy when originally
published, but concerns have been highlighted since then. I want to
examine three key issues of concern today; other Members may have
different issues to discuss. First, I want to concentrate on the
report’s findings in relation to whether the bank deliberately
attempted to engineer situations in which businesses defaulted or
breached their banking covenants. One of the report’s key claims
is that businesses often found themselves in difficulties due to the
bank’s deliberate efforts to ensure that that happened,
including through revaluations. Once banking covenants were breached,
businesses were placed in the so-called supporting hands of the global
restructuring group.</hs_Para>

question that deserves consideration is about the
nature of the support that businesses receive once
subjected to the support structure of the GRG. Is it really trying to
get businesses back on track, or—as in many cases that I have
seen, and in many cases highlighted by Lawrence Tomlinson—are
businesses subject to unfair and penal rates of interest and charges,
and often asked to pay for reports and valuations that are almost never
in the businesses’ interests?</hs_Para>

third question is about the impartiality of the whole insolvency
process. The report asks significant questions about whether the
process and all the professionals involved actually operate in an
independent manner. I have seen a number of cases of valuations
changing dramatically because valuers have been instructed to undertake
a second valuation by the bank. That raises significant concerns about
the independence of those valuations. Consultants, solicitors and
accountants have been asked to undertake work, paid for by the
business, on the instruction of the banks. Time and again, that work
has been less than helpful to the survival of the
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T09:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000014">When
I conclude my remarks, I will touch on the selection of Clifford Chance
to conduct an internal review of RBS. I have no doubt that Clifford
Chance is a reputable firm of solicitors, but I have concerns about
whether it will pass the smell test of being impartial enough to
undertake such a review, given its links to

RBS and the global restructuring group been guilty of engineering a
default or a breach of covenant? There are examples. A constituent of
mine had a quarry with landfill rights that was valued at £9.5
million. The bank decided to enforce a revaluation of the asset, which
came back at £2.5 million. As one can imagine, the impact of a
£7 million reduction in value was an immediate breach of the
banking covenant. After long and hard-fought efforts by the company,
there was a final agreed valuation of £4.5 million. The company
agreed to that simply because it was desperate and wanted to try to
keep trading. How can a £7 million reduction in value occur when
the company undertaking the revaluation was the same one that made the
original valuation only a few months previously? That question needs to
be answered. Also, why did the company have to pay £14,000 for a
valuation that it successfully

one flat is sold for £45,000 in excess of the bank’s
valuation, one must question why the whole portfolio is not re-examined
from a banking perspective. The business is paying penal rates of
interests on the basis that it breached its loan-to-value covenant, yet
the one sale that has been achieved shows that the asset’s value
was much higher than the value that the bank placed on

example, of a hotel in north Yorkshire, landed on my desk because the
business has also been affected by interest rate swaps. The hotel was
independently valued by Matthews &amp; Goodman at £3.4 million,
but the bank was clearly unhappy with that valuation, which gave the
business a healthy loan-to-value position, so it instructed the
business to get a second valuation within two months. The business was
charged £3,500 for the privilege, and the second valuation came
back at 
<?notus-xml column=149?>£1.65 million. The result was that the
business was in breach of its banking
covenants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T09:38:55"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
unsurprising that the business feels hard done by: an independent
valuation suggested a value of £3.4 million, but less than three
months later, another valuation, done on the instructions of the bank
but paid for by the business, was less than half
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T09:39:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000018"><Member ContinuationText="Glyn Davies" PimsId="13" UID="13121743000193" xid="1129" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000193"><B>Glyn

have a fourth and final example of businesses finding themselves in
difficulty due to decisions taken by the bank. A company that contacted
me recently had net profit of £272,000 on turnover of
£3.5 million in 2008, net profit of £281,000 on turnover
of £4.4 million in 2009, and net profit of £268,000 on
turnover of £3.9 million in 2010. Those are all
healthy figures. The company employed about 40 members of staff. In
late 2010, however, an agreed overdraft facility with the bank was
withdrawn, because a loan agreement under the EFG—enterprise
finance guarantee—system was declined. The company was therefore
put into GRG support, and the group proceeded to disallow a payment of
£14,000 in corporation tax, on which basis the company found
itself in difficulties and ended up going into administration. The
final set of management accounts for the nine months before the company
went into administration showed a net profit of
£190,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T09:42:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
The company would argue that its difficulties were caused by the bank
refusing the corporation tax payment, even though the final accounts
showed a profit.</hs_Para>

about that. Furthermore, the businesses often have no say whatever in
who the reviewers will be. There is a question about the conflict of

other thing that I have seen time and again is payments by suppliers
not being prioritised. There  is almost never a case in which a
payment to suppliers would be allowed if that took the business beyond
the terms of its overdraft or facilities, and yet I have never seen a
case in which charges due to the GRG have not been taken because they
will take the business over its overdraft limit. That is a fair point
to make, because if a business can go over its agreed limit in order to
pay the bank charges, why on earth will the bank not allow a payment to

£2,000 was now acceptable. I get the impression that the reason
why  it was £4,000 to start was that the bank thought
that it could get away with it; the fee was subsequently £2,000,

businesses” into the GRG as an opportunity. That is a key point.
If the head of the GRG considers that distressed businesses coming into
his organisation are “opportunities”, his view is that
the group is there not to support businesses, but to gain commercial
advantage on the back of those businesses. Furthermore, if any Members
present represent a shipping business, they should be concerned,
because Mr Sach also emphasised that he sees significant
“opportunities” in that sector, because shipping is going
through a difficult period—in other words, the GRG vultures are
hovering, waiting for a further supply of distressed businesses of

of the relationship between Clifford Chance and RBS over the past
couple of years. Clifford Chance worked on the sale of £80
billion of toxic UK commercial real estate by RBS, which was called
Project Isobel internally; it acted on behalf of RBS on the sale of RBS
Aviation Capital; it was instructed by RBS to deal with the recent IT

on the review, but businesses up and down the country genuinely feel

the bank is taking their concerns seriously. I would argue that the
impression given of a conflict of interests between
Clifford Chance and RBS is enough of a reason for RBS to think again
and appoint another firm to undertake the review. I welcome the fact
that RBS is willing to undertake an internal review, and it has argued
that it is creating an independent internal review; but that
independence must be beyond reproach. Given the commercial relationship
that I have highlighted between Clifford Chance and RBS, it is
difficult to make the case that the review will be truly independent
and will be able to gain the confidence of the business community. I

that that means we really have to look at the whole banking sector. The
Banking Commission has done a good job of starting to expose some of
these malpractices, but they are very worrying. The issue does not
affect just RBS, and it needs to be looked at more widely.</hs_Para>

is really worrying is that RBS would, arguably, not exist if not for
the fact that it was bailed out, and is 80% owned, by the taxpayer.
However, some of the practices exposed by Tomlinson represent a double
whammy for the taxpayer. I can cite examples of RBS using the GRG to
take money out of bank accounts that businesses had set up expressly to
pay Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. The bank was, therefore,
not just taking taxpayers’ money so that it could continue to
exist, but taking money from accounts specifically set up to pay
HMRC.</hs_Para>

started to get involved in this issue as a result of constituents
coming to see me about interest rate swaps. One particularly big
example involves a man who owns care homes, which are
disproportionately affected by  
<?notus-xml column=155?>interest rate swaps. He was a solvent customer running a successful
business, but RBS bullied him into taking on loans that included
interest rate swaps. He wanted to refuse, but RBS bounced his cheques
until he took the loans on. He is now involved with the GRG, even
though it was expressly set up for severely distressed customers. He is
not in severe distress now, but he soon will be, because the money he
has to use to pay back the interest rate swaps RBS forced him to take
on should be going into investing in his care home business.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T10:02:28"></hs_TimeCode>In addition,
when RBS first forced him to take on the loan, the exit fee was
£10,000. Only a few months later, it was £150,000. Given
the amounts involved, we really need to start taking a serious look at
what RBS is doing.</hs_Para>

accusation. However, what I would like to hear about from the Minister
is the reverse: what makes him confident that systematic fraudulent

what the Tomlinson report focused on, but also because RBS is more than
80% state owned. What makes him confident that the bank is not forcing
people into the arms of the GRG, with the result that perfectly solvent
businesses are not solvent any more, and asset stripping them at the

my constituents, which was bought by another of the bank’s

distressed sale, but what happened afterwards. Worse still, the sale
happened as a result of interest rate swap mis-selling, but there is
another interest rate swap agreement with the new company, so something

to the bank—ha, ha! The engineering of loan defaults allows a
company to be put into the GRG. What we find, and what we see in the

complexities of the banking system that has been operated for
businesses for a considerable time. The lack of understanding that MPs

the media do not understand the problem, means that light has not been
shone on the issue in the way that it deserves to be. Stuck in the

operated 
<?notus-xml column=157?>caravan parks in four parts of the UK: one was in my constituency, a
couple were in the south Lake district, and one was in the Yorkshire
dales. The company was encouraged, by almost a separate arm of Barclays
bank, to look at investment in the business; the offer came in that
guise. It was told, “We have set up a special arm of the bank to
assist you; we can do some good business here and develop your business
further.” The end result was the bank shifting products; it
asked its client to sell one product back to it and to take out
another. It ended up with three of the parks having to be sold so that
the company could retain one, which continued to operate in Dumfries
and Galloway for a period.</hs_Para>

businessman was reluctant for me to create any kind of a storm, because
he could see that the first thing the bank would do was immediately
move to close the business down. However, time passed and eventually
administrators moved in. It all happened at and around the time of the
LIBOR scandal and the involvement of <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> and
Guardian Care Homes. That very much drew the issue into the spotlight,
and as a result, I had a closer look at the case that my constituent
had brought to me. I went to the administrators and said, “Quite
clearly, this is a case of mis-selling. If this is mis-selling by the
bank, and you are conducting business on behalf of this bank, you are
doing nothing more than driving this business to the wall.”

signed off. However, anyone else who was owed money was left waiting in
the wings. The administrators and anyone dealing with the insolvency
are absolutely guaranteed their money, despite the plight that many
businesses are in. The shocking thing about the business that went down
was that it did so owing £1.2 million, of which £900,000

wary of the bank’s promises that what it was selling him was
good for his business. The value of that business has fallen

need valuations—and, by the way, you’ll pay for them at

the charges levied by banks on businesses that are already struggling

is making the situation worse. I also recognise that Tomlinson
highlights, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr

themselves to be in crisis until the moment they entered the process.

Given that the report has come from the heart of Government, I imagine
that he must be pretty clear that such fraud existed. I do not want to

Friend focused on businesses being driven into distress. He said that
RBS was 80% state controlled. Although RBS is state owned, it has
become clear under successive Governments that the bank is not state

said, we share many of Mr Tomlinson’s concerns and conclusions,
and I now turn to the areas on which we agree. The Tomlinson report
recognises the fundamental faults of the lack of competition in the
British banking system, on which the Opposition wholeheartedly agree.
Some 89% of small businesses are locked into the big five banks. The
report also speaks of the need to change banking culture so that banks
see small businesses as partners rather than merely cash cows, and so
that the two can grow locally together. Such a model would not only be
good for small businesses but lead to a stronger and more durable
overall economy. That is why Labour proposes a new generation of local
banks based on the Sparkassen model to add genuine competition on the
high street. That would create a major new player that would not
operate according to the same lending models as all the other banks,
and would boost local decision making.</hs_Para>

lending has fallen every year during the crisis, our biggest European
competitor, Germany, has seen an increase in lending over the same
time. After the crash in 2008, a crisis occurred in bank lending, and
far from being improved in the years since, it has continued to
constrict. Tomlinson is right to say that we need greater competition.
Alongside the new local entrants to the banking market, we are calling
for greater bank account portability to ease the path into the market.

that the culture of selling additional products and services alarmingly
supersedes that of best serving customers’ needs, as was
demonstrated by the interest rate swap scandal. Britain is currently
facing a mutual crisis of confidence in small business lending, and in
the relationship between banks and businesses more widely. A survey of
members of the Federation of Small Businesses found that more than half
of small businesses believe that banks do not care about small
businesses, and, similarly, banks fear lending money to businesses.
Such mutual distrust is one of the reasons why we have had the slowest
recovery for 100 years. The Tomlinson report will, indisputably,
further damage the confidence between banks and businesses. The
Government have a grave responsibility to ensure that, when such 
<?notus-xml column=163?>damaging criticisms are made, every possible step has been taken to
verify and scrutinise those criticisms before the Government endorse
them.</hs_Para>

context, we have significant reservations about a report that contains
such serious allegations of systematic and widespread corporate fraud.
There are concerns that, at best, the Tomlinson report will not be seen
as being truly impartial. We have reservations about the

been in office when the issue came to prominence, we would not have
been as quick as the Secretary of State has been to rush out this

am told that if Tomlinson had chosen to speak to RBS, he could have
been referred to companies such as Samsonite, Fairline, Independent
Slitters Ltd and many others, which would have told him that the GRG
process was positive for them. He chose not to do so, and as a result
the report represents serious concerns but does not reflect all points

been in office, we would have ensured that the FCA, which is the
appropriate body to investigate such grave allegations, was immediately
commissioned to conduct a full and proper inquiry before the trust

not exist or that we have not been pushing the banks to identify where
they have failed their business customers, but we consider that the
anecdotes in the report provide a pretty tenuous basis for such serious

Secretary of State aware of Mr Tomlinson’s ongoing dispute with
RBS when he was commissioned to produce the report? If so, what
assessment 
<?notus-xml column=164?>did the Secretary of State make of any potential conflict of interest
before giving it the departmental stamp of approval? Why did the
Secretary of State trumpet the report as independent when it was
produced in his Department by someone with a close interest in both the
party and the issues under discussion? Why were earlier references to
malpractice at Lloyds removed from the final version of the report so
that it focused purely on RBS, the bank with which Mr Tomlinson is in
dispute, and why was RBS not shown the final report, nor given a chance
to submit evidence to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T10:40:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000106">The
report is sadly lacking in detailed referencing and evidence. Given
that the basis of the report seems to be that many of the businesses
will have collapsed—presumably, that is on the public
record—will the Department be publishing detailed citations for
where the allegations have come from? Is the Minister personally
satisfied that due diligence was carried out by his Department before
it promoted the report? Does he agree that if the report’s claim
that RBS was systematically involved in deliberately distressing
businesses that would, without its intervention, have thrived, that
would be a matter of corporate fraud on a huge scale, and such an
allegation should be thoroughly investigated before being produced in a
Government-backed report? Does he think that the appropriate level of
scrutiny was given to the report prior to
publication<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T10:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000107">Finally,
as we head towards a general election, I suspect we will hear from
Ministers why they think the way in which the Secretary of State
operated was not the way things would have been done under a
Conservative Government. If we had a purely Conservative Government,
would they have handled the report in the same way? If not, in what way

Caroline Spelman</B> (Meriden) (Con):</Member> I am very grateful to
have the opportunity to raise this subject in Parliament. It was first
brought to my attention by a constituent; I will obviously keep her
name confidential, but she is content for me to discuss her
experiences, which are not unusual. Hypothyroidism is not a small or
niche illness; it is estimated that up to 3.5 million people in the UK
may have a thyroid problem. It disproportionately affects women
compared with men, by a power of 10, and the effects of the disease can
be really debilitating, with the many symptoms including tiredness,
aches, weight change, coldness, memory loss and depression. Even more
seriously, the disease can impact on the functioning of the heart.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>The problem is
that many of these symptoms are not unique indicators, and therefore
they may be hard to pinpoint or describe.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13121743000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000142"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>When
someone is suspected of having an underactive thyroid, or
hypothyroidism as it is known, their GP will usually do a blood test to
check the levels of the thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. This test
is called the TSH or FT4 test. In the UK, an abnormal test result will
only come back for someone who is above the “over” levels
of the TSH bell curve for the population. That means that some people
may have sub-clinical levels of hypothyroidism but they are not flagged
up for treatment. Once again, there is a disparity between the number
of men and women with sub-clinical levels of hypothyroidism; three
times as many women as men suffer from those sub-clinical levels.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>The opposite can
also be true. Doctors have to consider how to treat patients with
abnormal results who otherwise show no clinical signs of
hypothyroidism. Therefore, it is accepted that GPs might face many
different problems when trying to treat a patient with
hypothyroidism.</hs_Para>

because that is an excellent suggestion; it is what I would describe as

that should be a very strong indication for the GP to be proactive in
monitoring the possibility of it appearing in subsequent generations
within the family.

constituent who first brought this issue to my attention a couple of

which has been contacted by 19,000 thyroid sufferers. There was

matter debated and this disease being better dealt with.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:03:56"></hs_TimeCode>Therefore, I
want to take this opportunity to raise awareness of this serious
disease, the methods of diagnosing it and the ways of treating it. I
also want to question the broad range of GP responses to diagnosis.
More training is required to ensure that GPs respond consistently and
are ready to test a patient fully for thyroid problems, so that a quick
and full diagnosis can be made. That should include checking someone
who has a family history of the disease, which was the excellent point
made earlier.</hs_Para>

hypothyroidism is left undiagnosed, it can affect heart health, as I
said before. It can also be a risk in pregnancy for a younger woman. If
they are undiagnosed, sufferers have to live with unabated symptoms.
Wrongly diagnosed patients spend time and money on visiting different
specialists, as they try to find an answer to the symptoms they know
they have. That is obviously a waste of both the patient’s time
and the doctor’s time, as well as a waste of precious resources
within the NHS<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:05:01"></hs_TimeCode>.
Effective and quick diagnosis is needed. There are many stories of
misdiagnosis, for example where depression or fibromyalgia is
diagnosed, and therefore the patient is given the wrong prescription,
which can include anti-depressants and other hormone-altering
drugs.</hs_Para>

is also an argument that in the long term correct diagnosis and
treatment will cost the NHS less. In addition, a healthy, active
working patient will cost the state less in benefits. My constituent
had to give up work during a period of five years, and she very much
regrets that her symptoms necessitated her having to do that. The
disease obviously has a huge impact on someone’s life and on
their overall earning capacity within their working lifetime.</hs_Para>

is imperative that all GPs are trained in identifying this condition,
and that they are reminded to consider that certain symptoms might
indicate hypothyroidism even if someone’s TSH test comes back as
normal. For example, could it be that the patient is still affected by
sub-clinical hypothyroidism? Should the range for those considered
“normal” be reduced to bring in these borderline and
sub-clinical patients? In the UK, the test considers anything above 10
ml of TSH in serum in the blood as abnormal. However, given that 10 ml
is an average figure, there will be individuals who may be hypothyroid
with TSH levels below the 10 ml figure. So there may be an argument for
reviewing the 10 ml level. At the very least, there should be
assurances that the tests are standardised, with reproducible
performance in different laboratories. I have discovered that in
Germany the threshold is, in fact, 3 ml, but I have to say that it is
measured in a slightly different way from the way that we measure it
here. However, one question that I put to the Minister is this: why
does there seem to be a more sensitive threshold in another
well-developed country such as Germany, which might allow a doctor to
be alerted sooner than might be the case here?</hs_Para>

a normal result is shown but symptoms are present, why is it not
regular practice to carry out a T3 test, in case the problem
is caused by a malfunction of the pituitary gland rather than a
malfunction of the thyroid gland, or a lack of conversion from T4 to
T3? A consistent and sympathetic approach to hypothyroid diagnosis by
GPs and specialists is necessary, putting the needs, experience and
concerns <hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:07:12"></hs_TimeCode>of
patients first.</hs_Para>

is also an inconsistency in the prescription medicines that are
offered. Guidelines from the National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence clearly state that levothyroxine should be prescribed in the
case of overt hypothyroidism, and that might be why the 10 ml level is
required by the test. NICE also states that T3 should not be used in
conjunction with levothyroxine.</hs_Para>

it should be made clear that the test to see if the disease is present
should not be set at a level solely for identifying the level needed
for prescription and a curative drug. The threshold perhaps needs to be
different to ensure that there is early and correct diagnosis. People

own direct responsibility, in respect of their patient’s health.
Therefore they are rightly under no obligation to prescribe it. The

right hon. Friend the Member for Meriden (Mrs Spelman) on securing a
debate on this issue. This is, as she says, an opportunity to highlight
something that we do not discuss often in Parliament. I hope that the
debate will prove informative for those who wish to learn more about
the condition, and will be useful to those who  are affected in
the way that she so ably described.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:13:31"></hs_TimeCode> will mention
the help and support that is available and  will try to respond

my right hon. Friend said,
hypothyroidism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>
describes the general effects of a severely underactive thyroid gland,
where not enough hormones are produced to keep the body functioning
properly. The condition can be congenital, but most commonly occurs as
a result of an autoimmune disease that attacks the thyroid gland and
impairs its function. The condition is not uncommon, as she said. In
the UK, the annual incidence of primary hypothyroidism is 3.5 cases per
1,000 women, and 0.6 per 1,000 men, so there is, as she
said, a disparity between men and
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000162">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:14:19"></hs_TimeCode>
effects of hypothyroidism can be pronounced and debilitating, as my
right hon. Friend said. Often, the condition goes untreated, because
symptoms are frequently subtle and non-specific—she highlighted
some—and may be wrongly attributed to other illnesses. Fatigue,
weight gain, dry skin, lethargy, memory impairment and tiredness are
all likely to be present. In elderly populations, symptoms such as
memory disturbance, impaired mental state and depression may also be
seen. However,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:14:44"></hs_TimeCode> good news is
that, for the vast majority of patients, once the right dose of hormone
replacement treatment is given, they will return to a healthy state.
Continuous medication is usually required to maintain that correct
balance, and patients needing it are entitled to receive their
prescriptions free of
charge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000163">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>,
to get the right treatment and to restore the balance of health and
well-being, a prompt diagnosis is, of course, crucial. My right hon.
Friend focused on that. A range of guidance is available to improve
awareness of the condition among both members of the public and health
professionals. NHS Choices provides comprehensive advice on the causes,
symptoms and 
<?notus-xml column=174?>treatment of the disease, and more detailed clinical guidance is
available on the NHS clinical evidence
website.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000164">Best<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:15:29"></hs_TimeCode>
practice on the identification and management of hypothyroidism has
been set out by the Royal College of Physicians in its guidance,
“The Diagnosis and Management of Primary Hypothyroidism”,
which was developed on behalf of key organisations, including the
British Thyroid Association, the British Thyroid Foundation and the
Society for Endocrinology. The guidance is endorsed by the Royal
College of General
Practitioners.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000165">Clinical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:16:00"></hs_TimeCode>
symptoms and signs alone are insufficient to make a diagnosis of
hypothyroidism, so the RCP guidance makes it clear that the only
validated method of testing thyroid function is blood testing, which
must include measurement of the thyroid-stimulating
hormone—TSH—and free thyroxine, or FT4, in serum. There
is no evidence to support either the use of body fluids or the
measurement of basal body temperature as a means of testing thyroid
function. However, the guidance recognises that different methods of
testing blood can give differing results, as my right hon. Friend
mentioned. Highlighting in Parliament the RCP’s support for a
helpful international initiative for greater harmonisation of reference
ranges, and of the units used in expressing results of thyroid function
tests, reinforces its thinking in that regard. My right hon. Friend is
right to highlight
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:16:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000166">Once<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T11:16:43"></hs_TimeCode>
patients have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism, the vast majority can
achieve successful management of their condition with a synthetic
hormone replacement treatment. My right hon. Friend focused on the fact
that some people do not get on with that treatment. The RCP guidance
sets out that overwhelming evidence supports the use of thyroxine T4
hormone replacement—usually prescribed as levothyroxine
tablets—alone in the treatment of hypothyroidism. The guidance
does not recommend prescribing additional T3 hormone in any presently
available form, including natural desiccated thyroid treatments, such
as Armour Thyroid. This is because it has not been definitively proven
to be of any benefit to patients and may be harmful. However, that does
not prevent clinicians considering other forms of thyroid hormone
replacement, if appropriate.</hs_Para>

patients, as my right hon. Friend highlighted, the wider availability
of NDTs is a concern. It is worth making it clear that although this
treatment remains unlicensed in this country, because the evidence base
for its efficacy is unclear, GPs may prescribe it on a named-patient
basis. I appreciate the push-back on inconsistency, but that is
probably because it is unlicensed, so people have to find a GP willing
to prescribe it on that
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121743000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121743000168">To
ensure that patients with the most severe and complex endocrine
problems receive appropriate care and support, NHS England has

been developed by clinicians and commissioners, with expert patient
input. Certain patient groups have been calling for specialised

Education England has responsibility for promoting high-quality

hypothyroidism, we should be thinking a bit more about prevention. When

precipitate a test, so that the hypothyroidism does not go undetected

diseases strategy; and the development and dissemination of guidelines
and standards for best clinical practice. The UK PID registry has been
supported by the Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership, and has
engaged the participation of 95% of UK centres since its establishment

A first report on the matter is at the presses, and we will soon have
the opportunity to read it. Perhaps the most pressing point that has
been raised is that there is a need for meaningful national and
international collaboration on both research and development of
clinical practice to ensure maximum benefit for patients. Let us not
disregard international collaboration: if something good is being done
in France or Germany, it would be good to exchange expertise, so that
we can all improve and move forward. Groups such as UKPIN can take the
lead in some of these matters. The UK has already led in the
development of novel treatments—for example, with gene
therapy—and in implementing novel technologies such as
next-generation sequencing. It is crucial that there is ongoing

into the treatment of conditions that affect large numbers of people.
Research and development must be enhanced to provide hope and an answer

Specialised Healthcare Alliance has sent me some helpful information.
It refers to highly specialised services for the rarest conditions,
some of which we may never have heard—apart, perhaps, from a
mention on TV, which will probably have been the first we have heard of
it—but unfortunately they are occurring more often. There are
some 500 patients in England and some 600 patients across the whole UK.
Such illnesses and diseases are complex and need the highest level of
expertise and knowledge to address. The alliance
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13121750000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121750000099">“Many

goes back to a point that I made in the beginning: we are dependent on
England being the driver for the issue, and on NHS England as the
organisation that we follow in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.
The alliance also refers to “properly funded administrative
support”. These are issues that it would like to see taken
forward. It also says that the problem of capacity in the system has to
be addressed to ensure that resources are there and that opportunities
for specialised services are and can be delivered.</hs_Para>

the need to work together in the regions can be found in the fact that
there is a regional variation in post-bone marrow transplant care.
Patients who have received a transplant will face a range of severe and
debilitating late effects, as well as life-threatening infection, due
to the nature of their therapy. Those complex needs have to be managed
by a transplant clinician in a late effects clinic, in which the
co-morbidities can be considered with a full range of treatments by a
specialist team. Without security of funding, a transplant centre
cannot provide that service, so variation will creep in where follow-up
care is commissioned by clinical commissioning groups.</hs_Para>

numbers of people receive transplants—1,440 in 2011. A nephew of
mine has received a transplant, which transformed his life greatly. We
are thankful to the donor for making that happen. It was not always
plain sailing; sometimes there were backward steps. Has the organ been
accepted by the body? Was there medication to ensure that that
happened? At the end of the day, he is a bright young man today, and
doing very well due to his kidney transplant. Many years ago, it would
not have seemed possible, but we now have the opportunity to see a
young man who has done extremely well through a transplant. There is a
clear argument for NHS England to foot the bill to ensure the security
of the service. Furthermore, it should ensure that the right type of
care is available by drawing up national guidelines on what constitutes
a late effects clinic to eliminate variation.</hs_Para>

going to go into any further detail on the issue. Although the key
commitments are welcome, there are fears of how they will work in
reality. The Department must work with other Departments regionally to
ensure that not only are those commitments realised, but that there is
no longer a regional disparity in service provision. I commented on
regional disparity yesterday in relation to the debate in the Chamber,
and there is also a clear regional disparity on this topic. How can we
achieve this funding and heart? The rare disease groups have shown that
there is heart in abundance.

congratulating the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) on securing

neuralgia is a relatively rare condition, thought to affect less than
0.1% of the population, and that has included me. I secured an
Adjournment debate on TN in 2010, seeking, among other things, to raise
awareness of the
condition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121750000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0001.htm#13121750000046">It
is important that the rarity of that or any condition does not exclude
it from research, funding and the search for treatments or even a cure,
as the hon. Gentleman referred to in his excellent opening remarks. One
vital corollary of such research is in getting to grips with
misdiagnosis, which is a particular problem when dealing with rare
diseases. We need to break the chain of rarity leading to lack of
research and knowledge leading to misdiagnosis. Such a chain can mean
ongoing misery for the sufferer, when it might otherwise be
possible  to make breakthroughs that could bring hope and
relief to the afflicted.</hs_Para>

importance in the case of rare diseases is the existence of support
groups and networks. They are important for all sufferers, as one often
finds that the very rarity of a condition serves only to exacerbate the
sense of isolation felt by the sufferer. If people do not know what
they are talking about, and do not know anyone among their family or
friends who suffers from a condition as rare as, for example, TN, it is
crucial that one can link up with fellow sufferers, not only to
overcome the sense of isolation, but, in practical terms, to share
experiences, advice and the latest developments in that field of
medicine, surgery and so on.</hs_Para>

initiated an inquiry into headache services in England. We have had a
number of written submissions and one oral evidence session already,
with another to follow in January. Evidence submitted to the inquiry so
far indicates that there is significant misdiagnosis and subsequent
mismanagement of primary headache disorders throughout England.
Sufferers of rare headache disorders, such as cluster headaches, are
further disadvantaged by the lack of medical awareness and access to
specialists in the UK. The inquiry is looking into the current

figures before coming into the Chamber, I saw that there were about
6,000 rare diseases, which is a shockingly high figure. I do not think
that many people realise just how many different types of diseases
there are. As a parent, one has only to watch a programme such as
“Children in Need” to see how many diseases are out
there, to see illnesses that we have never even heard of, but that are

much work still needs to be done in the area. If the debate helps to

want to focus on two aspects: first, the families and voluntary groups
that work in this space and secondly, some of the academic research
that is being done into rare diseases. So much of the work in this area
is done by families who have been affected by a child or a family
member who has been unwell. The work that they then do to raise funds,
either to support other families or to carry out research, is an
incredibly important part of the equation.</hs_Para>

refer to two examples. The first, Charlie’s Challenge, was named
after Charlie Boutwood, a constituent of mine, who was 20 months old
when he was found to have a brain tumour. He survived thanks to
incredible medical attention, but his parents set up the
Charlie’s Challenge charity to put money into brain tumour
research, particularly relating to children. Although brain tumours are
the biggest single killer of all the cancers of children and young
people under 40, less than 1% of the research into cancers is into
brain 
<?notus-xml column=186?>tumours and particularly the effect on young people. The work of
Charlie’s Challenge is to see how it can provide additional

When I left the Government in September last year, one thing that gave

work that is being done in this area—not in the part in which I
am involved, which is the business school—particularly by the

only about the role of world-class research, which I think Edinburgh

benefactors, because the work of the university of Edinburgh has been
made possible by a small number of extraordinarily important
contributions. The Euan MacDonald centre for motor neurone disease
research is funded by an immense donation by the family of Euan
MacDonald, but that in turn led to an even bigger donation by J. K.
Rowling for the Anne Rowling regenerative neurology clinic. It is
through the work of the university—of examining how it can bring
together its extraordinary genius in looking at the challenges that
have been presented by these rare diseases—and tying that in to
extraordinarily generous benefactors that offers us a really great way
to address some of the issues. The work being done in Edinburgh is of

written to me just this week about meningitis and a drug that has gone

only being made available to people who can pay for it at the moment.
It seems to me that when treatments could be made available, expediting

an objective of its own. I absolutely agree with what he said in that

Hendry:</Member></B> That is exactly what I am saying. The other thing
that we owe tremendous credit to the Teenager Cancer Trust for is
highlighting the way in which teenagers are dealt with in hospitals.
The issue is that sometimes they are put in children’s wards,
which  is clearly not suitable for somebody who is in their
late teens, and at other times, they are put in wards with people who
were in their 80s and 90s, who are dying or are ill with other
conditions. Someone who is a teenager is at a particular vulnerable
time of transition in their life, and it is incredibly important that
their needs are dealt with in a specialist way and that they are
surrounded by as many people of their own age group as possible. I
think that is an important part of the treatment and recovery
process.</hs_Para>

closing, I want to touch on the question raised about the trials
process for drugs and treatments. I met a mesothelioma
sufferer—a very brave young woman who had picked the disease up
through contact with her father’s clothes. She had to travel to
Germany for treatment. She lived many years longer than she was told
she would, and that was, without any doubt, because of the treatment.
She had a good quality of life, but we had to battle hard to get any
support for the cost of the treatment. NICE was particularly difficult,
even though this tried-and-tested technique was being used in Germany.
The problem was that there were not enough people in the pool here to
justify NICE giving the treatment the all-clear so that this young
woman could use it, and we really need to look at that. When medicines
and treatments are available in America or Europe, where there are high
standards of testing, there should be more flexibility than currently
exists.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_17_PT_1/C48F151569D19594A5EE238F813DCEC374609506" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="17 December 2013">Tuesday

The group expressed the concern, which has been voiced in the debate,
that some of the changes that are afoot could imperil some of the good,

the UK level, to get better co-ordination between NHS England and the
various devolved health services. Besides each responsible health
service area doing its bit, there is a need for real collaboration that
transcends those areas. 
<?notus-xml column=191?>Indeed, I see that happening beyond the UK; I see it spanning the whole
of the British-Irish Council, which includes the Republic of Ireland,
the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. There are people with rare
conditions in isolated parts of these islands, and the idea of
combining our efforts on rare diseases and trying to achieve an economy
of effort that would not be possible within one jurisdiction or health
authority is important. The British-Irish Council is ready made to
bring added emphasis and commitment to such
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:21:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121750000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121750000085">It
is important to do more than just pledge greater co-ordination and
prioritisation for rare diseases; another issue to be dealt with is
resources. As individual health authorities find it harder to guarantee
a competent concentration of commitment to rare diseases, we must find
critical mass at a higher level that transcends the health authorities
and the devolved health service areas. That is why the UK strategy is
an important concept. The 51 commitments are strong and sound, but
there are questions about whether they will, in practice, add up to a
full strategy, if they are left to the interpretation of each area
individually. At times, there seems to be confusion about when NHS
England is driving for the UK as a whole, and when it is in the lead
simply as a matter of quantum—because it is the biggest. I am
not sure whether there is a full strategy and co-ordination plan, and
we need to continue working on

some of which depends on the skilled and dedicated leadership of

diseases. People progress professionally and move on, and sometimes the
services that they leave are not sustained and maintained with the same
quality. That is why—to return to the idea of co-ordination and
co-operation across the UK,
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:25:19"></hs_TimeCode> more widely

faculty. Then the clinicians who provide treatment for, or do research

Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) said, few of the rare
diseases we have been considering have outright cures or treatments;
for many with such diseases, the approach is supportive therapies and
coping support. My remarks have concentrated perhaps more on clinical
leadership, but care and support are also hugely important. I know that
the Minister will be conscious of that. Aspects of what I mean include
setting good models and examples 
<?notus-xml column=192?>of practice and experience; helping individuals—particularly the
young people who are sufferers of so many of the rare
diseases—and their families; and thinking about improving care
networks and the meshing of services, so that
people who provide services, whether in education or family support,
understand better what rare diseases may entail, and their possible
life-cycle variation during the life of a child. People who provide
social and education services cannot readily make themselves experts in
the conditions in question, and often they confuse conditions whose
names sound the same, although they are very different in character,
and give rise to different demands and behavioural consequences. Wider
support is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:26:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121750000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121750000089">Finally,
the Government need to take account of the context of welfare reform
and changes to several benefits, and the fact that every so often,
people must reapply and prove their case for benefits again. That is
particularly hard when people have rare diseases. Those people and
their families should not have to spell out their condition again, in
all the medical jargon, and explain it. They should not be made to jump
through those hoops. We should find a better way in the social security
system of showing understanding about rare
diseases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:27:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121750000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121750000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13121750000127" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121750000127">Jim

applicant’s condition is deemed very rare or complex, instead of
their case being given added attention and urgency, it is allowed to
silt up. That can happen with medical treatment and the opportunity for
further diagnosis, which often requires travel outside the

real test of whether a strategy is coherent and effective is what
happens when it comes to funding. We can have many good statements of
intent. There are  51 commitments, which are very strong and
sound. It all sounds great, but does it translate into money being
available for support and treatment or, as happens with approving new
drugs, does the finance test get in the way of support and treatment
reaching people? The cost-effectiveness criteria used either by the
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence or by the Joint
Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation raise questions. Particularly
in relation to rare diseases, if the test is almost that a possible new
treatment has to throw two sixes to start, in circumstances in which
people do not even have any dice, it is a serious problem. Although the
rare disease strategy is a good start, it is only that—a good
start. It will need more work and more resources, and will need to be

Members, illustrate the fundamental issues that arise when we try to
establish a coherent, comprehensive and useful long-term strategy
through which to deal with the problems that they present. Some rare
diseases will be very similar and advancements in medical sciences and
research in one area can greatly benefit another, but some classes of
diseases can be extremely different from others and the treatments for
those can be wildly different, not sharing any empirical research base.

huge difference in dealing with each disease highlights a problem in
trying to gear the system with the tools and resources necessary to
make advances. With limited resources, any improvement in one area of
research can sometimes be at the expense of another. These are
difficult calculations and choices. Research and development must be
rewarded. Certainty and predictability of funding for this work are
essential. Some research—potentially a good deal—will
yield no tangible or quick benefit at all. Supply chains, researchers
and research and development environments must be identified,
supported, grown and nurtured. The loudest voices will not always be
the most
deserving.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000010">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>

commissioning of services in England will be able easily to co-ordinate
the commissioning of research and the commissioning of what are often
expensive treatments for rare diseases and, as we have heard, orphan
and ultra-orphan conditions with the NHS in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. Where is the guiding mind with which to achieve
economies of scale and critical mass in
research<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:38:50"></hs_TimeCode>, which

is clear that NHS England has a leading role to play in ensuring that
the new strategy is implemented and implemented well. The benefits of a
national body taking a lead on that are plentiful, but how does that
fit with the idea of creating local areas of expertise, such as the
centre at Newcastle university and the centres elsewhere in the
country, to steer innovation? Is the driving force behind innovation
and new treatments coming from NHS England or from experts on the
ground, and how will that work in practice? Of course we need to allow
innovators to flourish, but we also need to co-ordinate. Where does the
responsibility for that co-ordination

brings me to my final point. As in any debate on matters relating to
health issues, we must always focus on the patient. If patients are not
seeing improvements in their care, or they do not experience any easing
of the symptoms associated with their disease, the
Government —any Government—will have failed.
Innovations are 
<?notus-xml column=196?>meaningless if the patients who rely on them see no benefits. Without
the resources to back them up, strategies are little more than
meaningless words. For any of us to claim success, patient access to
treatments must improve. Many groups, as we have heard, are calling for
a form of adaptive licensing to be implemented with regard to
treatments for rare diseases. Have the Minister or any of his officials
had any contact with, made representations to or received
representations from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency with regard to adaptive drug licensing for treatments of rare
diseases?</hs_Para>

treatments raises several issues from the perspectives of the patient
and the manufacturer. First, bringing drugs to market is difficult and
expensive. Encouraging drug companies to manufacture drugs and
treatments that will benefit a relatively small number of patients is
an important and challenging task. In the case of motor neurone
disease, for example, no new drugs for the treatment of the disease
have been approved since riluzole more than 20 years ago.</hs_Para>

always ensure that drugs brought to the market are safe and effective.
That means that even if the new UK strategy is effective in encouraging
greater innovation in the field for developing treatments for rare
diseases, those treatments will not be available to help patients for
several years. That is not a problem that has arisen solely under the
current Government—nothing could be further from the
truth—but it is a difficult, sensitive issue. To that end, what
are the Government doing to ensure that new treatments are available to
improve the quality of life for patients with rare diseases as soon as
possible?</hs_Para>

patient’s perspective, the issue is often cost. Prescriptions
for those with rare diseases can amount to a significant financial
burden. The previous Government put in place a framework that would
have resulted in those with long-term conditions becoming exempt from
prescription charges. Can the Minister explain why the coalition
Government chose to scrap that? Enabling greater access to treatment is
essential, and I hope that the Minister can explain why that has not
been given more prominence in the strategy.</hs_Para>

said, rare diseases affect millions of people. The impact on sufferers
and their families is immense, so the cost of getting the strategy
wrong is high. More importantly, no matter how difficult it is and
whatever our political allegiances, we are morally obliged to get this
right. When the Minister gets to his feet, I hope he can give those
people some confidence and help to resolve the contradictions I have
outlined. Finally, if the Government can produce a coherent, integrated
and effective approach to resolve the problems that they seem to have
caused, and to progress those issues in a meaningful and timely manner,
they will have my support and that of my
colleagues.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_17_PT_1/7E9A979A8CC70BB854E444DAF5C1272EDADD5FAD" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="17 December 2013">Tuesday

Minister of State, Department of Health (Norman Lamb):</Member></B> It
is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Bayley. I thank the
shadow Minister, the hon. Member for Copeland (Mr Reed) for his
generous offer of support, and I am sure that we will be able to
deliver his preconditions for that support. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) on securing the debate. He is, as
the shadow Minister has said, one 
<?notus-xml column=197?>of the most assiduous attendees at health debates and a consistent
contributor on a whole range of different issues. We all welcome his
contributions. He always makes the case for better co-ordination and
collaboration between the different nations of the United Kingdom, and
I completely share that aspiration. There is great value in a bit of
diversity in the development of our health systems, because we can
often learn things from the innovation and experimentation taking place
in other parts of the United Kingdom. In opposition, I visited Northern
Ireland because I was fascinated by the way in which Northern Ireland
commissions and provides health and social care together. I wanted to
learn more about the experiences in Northern Ireland, good and bad.
Such diversity is to be valued and we should not have a
one-size-fits-all approach, but I agree with the hon. Gentleman about
the importance of collaboration. The Government’s strategy is an
example of where that can be really strong and
effective.</hs_Para>

Lamb:</Member></B> I was not aware of that, but I am interested to hear
it, and the hon. Lady makes her case powerfully. Before I respond fully
to the points made by the hon. Member for Strangford, I want to deal
with some of the other issues that have arisen during the debate.
Several hon. Members, including the shadow Minister, asked whether the
new architecture of the NHS had damaged the co-ordination of work on
rare diseases. In many respects, I can reassure hon. Members. There is
a danger that if one was coming into this place from afar and hearing
the debate, one might think that we were moving from an idealised,
perfect scenario into something more troubling. We all know, however,
that that is absolutely not the case. The treatment of rare diseases
historically has been far from optimal, and the greater involvement of
clinicians in the commissioning of care can have real benefits for
patients. Until 31 March 2013, far from being a simple
matter, specialised commissioning was fragmented across a range of NHS
organisations including regional specialised commissioning groups, a
national specialised commissioning team and local primary care trusts,
which remained ultimately responsible for the specialised health care
of their populations. From 1 April 2013, under the terms of the Health
and Social Care Act 2012, NHS England became the sole direct
commissioner of specialised services, which provides a greater
simplicity in the commissioning of
services.</hs_Para>

Lamb:</Member></B> I will continue, because I am conscious of the time.
The hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) made a
valuable contribution. I learned something about trigeminal neuralgia,
from which I think I understood him to say that he suffers. He asked
whether it would be possible to meet once the report that he referred
to is complete, and I would be happy to 
<?notus-xml column=198?>agree to that, diary permitting. I am sure it will be possible to do so
at some point. He made some important points about misdiagnosis, and
about the importance of support groups and networks. The internet now
provides incredible assistance to people with rare diseases, because
they can link up not only with those in their neighbourhood but with
people and clinicians globally who can guide them in the treatment of
their condition. He also spoke about unnecessary referrals to hospitals
and the mental health implications of some rare diseases, and I
completely agree with him.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) made powerful points
about the extraordinary work of so many families, and he mentioned in
particular the work of Charlie’s Challenge and Tildy’s

hellbent on producing a really valuable legacy from their experiences.
His point about the Department helping to co-ordinate the work of so
many such groups was well made. He also referred to the fantastic work
that is going on in Edinburgh university, and I applaud all those

Member for Plymouth, Moor View (Alison Seabeck) made the point that
there is extraordinary variability of service around the country. That
is something that the strategy can absolutely address, and I believe we
will get powerful results. She referred to her constituent, young
James, who suffers from Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and she talked
about the importance of transition to adulthood. I focus a lot on
mental health, and that transition is often a complete disaster. We
need to do far more to improve it.</hs_Para>

Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) made some important points about
collaboration. He referred to the British-Irish Council, and although I
have no idea whether his suggestion is possible, I am happy to look
into it. He talked about the funding challenge. We are in very tough
financial circumstances and often—the contributions of many hon.
Members this afternoon have emphasised this—the question is how
the money is used, because it is frequently not used effectively. A
misdiagnosis usually results in an inappropriate referral to hospital,
and a patient goes down completely the wrong track. An enormous amount
of money is wasted, and the patient receives very poor care. It is
essential to improve the way in which the system works to extract
better value. We recently announced integration pioneers in 14 areas of
the country. None has had extra money, but they demonstrate that, by
co-ordinating their efforts more effectively, they are producing much
better results for
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
shadow Minister was absolutely right that the one thing we should all
focus on is the patient—the individual citizen—and their
experience of the system.</hs_Para>

is fitting that this debate should happen so soon after the launch of
the UK strategy for rare diseases. This strategy is an overarching
UK-wide framework, setting out a shared UK strategic vision for
improving the lives of all those with rare diseases. It is owned by
each country in the UK and commits them to more than 50
actions—I think it was identified as 51—that will deliver
better outcomes for those with a rare disease.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:50:50"></hs_TimeCode> means that
for the first time we are in a position to make a tangible,
co-ordinated difference to those suffering with a rare disease. That is
something we can all be really positive about.</hs_Para>

we have heard, one in 17 people will experience a rare disease at some
point in their life, with the majority of diagnoses made in childhood.
That amounts to some 3 million people in the UK. A disease itself may
be rare, but having a rare disease is, alas, not unusual, because there
are so many of them—a point made
by<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:51:19"></hs_TimeCode> the hon.
Member for Plymouth, Moor View. They are a major cause of illness and
make considerable demands on the resources of the NHS and other care
services.

strategy for rare diseases is based around the more effective and
efficient use of services—a point I made earlier—with
better links to research and innovation. As the NHS constitution
states, no-one should be left behind because of their condition, be it
rare, very rare or yet to be diagnosed. To achieve this, England,
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have agreed to deliver the 51
commitments that focus on five
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:51:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000037">The
first is empowering patients—perhaps the most significant of
all—making sure that they are listened to, informed and
consulted every step of the way. No one knows the condition better than
the person suffering from it; too often, they are ignored in a rather
paternalistic system. We will continue to work closely with patient
groups and others to improve services for rare disease sufferers. We
will improve access to knowledge and support networks at UK, European
and international level, and we will help patients to participate in
rare disease registries. We will look at how those might be developed
in England to better capture the patient
experience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000038">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:52:40"></hs_TimeCode>,
we want to develop more effective methods for identifying and
preventing rare diseases. Carrier testing, preconception and antenatal
care, along with newborn screening, all play a part. Rare diseases are
often genetic in nature, and so can affect more than one member of the
family. This makes it important that testing of other family members,
where appropriate, becomes more
routine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000039">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>
third area is better diagnosis, which has been raised during the
debate, and earlier intervention. Too many people still wait far too
long to get an informed, correct diagnosis. There are several things we
need to address. We need to ensure there is better awareness of rare
diseases. That is important across all aspects of health care. Not
everyone can be an expert, but ensuring that the possibility of a rare
disease is considered when a diagnosis is proving difficult can help.
We need to ensure that all doctors are alert to the possibility of a
rare disease when they see patients, even if they are not able to
diagnose specific diseases. This means including better training on
rare diseases in university courses and in professional development at
work.</hs_Para>

training and education of clinicians is critically important. Health
professionals do not need detailed knowledge of every rare condition,
but all medical specialties and multi-professional care teams should
have a general awareness of rare diseases so that they can make rapid
referrals to specialists in the appropriate field.
Making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:54:30"></hs_TimeCode> genetic
testing more mainstream, harnessing the potential of genomic
technologies and focusing on what our DNA can tell us will also help us
to reduce the time to
diagnosis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000041"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:54:42"></hs_TimeCode>Perhaps
the most important commitment is to develop clearly defined care
pathways between primary and secondary care and regional and specialist
centres. Health

we want to see better co-ordination of care. Building on the fantastic
NHS genetic services that already exist—this country is well
recognised internationally for that—we want to see the
development of centres of excellence in rare diseases, providing
one-stop-shop services to patients through co-ordinated consultation
and treatment schedules. The centres should also be knowledge and
skills hubs—concentrating the skills together—that
support local delivery of services and facilitate clinical trials and
other research
projects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000043">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T15:55:37"></hs_TimeCode>
last area of the strategy, but by no means the least, is recognising
the absolute importance of research, which several hon. Members have
touched on today. The Government are committed to supporting research
into rare diseases. Such research holds the key to improved
personalised and targeted approaches to health care. These have the
potential to improve the effectiveness and safety of treatments, the
speed of diagnosis and patients’ quality of life.</hs_Para>

the strategy at Great Ormond Street hospital last month. The hospital

research centre that continues to lead on experimental medicine,
including the discovery of diagnostics and new treatments for childhood

Nandy</B> (Wigan) (Lab):</Member> My constituency is  home to
two excellent sixth-form colleges, St John Rigby college and Winstanley
college. Like so many of the 94 sixth-form colleges in the country,
they do an excellent job, not only for their students but for the wider
community. It is deeply unfair that they must pay VAT while school and
academy sixth forms do not. In other types of free 16 to 19 education
provision, funding is diverted to the front line. Why not for students
in sixth
forms?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000052">Following
recent changes to the funding formula, the anomaly has become
unjustifiable. That view is shared by at least 74 other Members of

unfair situation is exacerbated by the cuts made to sixth-form colleges
in recent years. In 2010, enrichment funding was reduced from 114 to
just 30 hours a year. Subsequently, the new 16 to 19 funding formula
cut their budgets further—the average was 6%, which masks much
more serious cuts for some. Last week, out of the blue, sixth-form
colleges were told that 18-year-olds would no longer attract the same
level of funding. Ministers argued that it was because those students
have already received two years of funding, which completely misses the
point that they are often the young people who most need and benefit
from the additional help that we can

servants originally estimated that creating a level playing field for
sixth-form colleges in relation to VAT would cost £20 million.
They have since revised that upwards on several occasions, arriving
most recently at a figure of £150 million, which includes other

approach, given that the Government have accepted in principle that
treating sixth-form colleges differently is wrong, to refuse to right
that wrong for them because they do not want to do so for

for sixth-form colleges are exacerbated by the fact that, unlike school
sixth forms, they cannot cross-subsidise their 16 to 19 work with
funding from pre-16 provision, which is more generous. Principals and
teachers across the sector are taking agonising decisions about
dropping courses, cutting staff or reducing activities. A survey last
year found nearly half of colleges had had to drop courses, eight out
of 10 had had to cut staff and an astonishing 71% had removed or
reduced enrichment activities such as sport, music, drama and dance.

I wrote a letter to the Secretary of State for Education. It is a
shame, notwithstanding the great respect that I have for
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:11:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Exchequer Secretary to the Treasury, who is a deeply distinguished
member of the Government, that we do not have a Minister from the
Department for Education here to answer questions about what is
essentially an education matter.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:12:04"></hs_TimeCode>That letter was
co-signed by 73 MPs from across the House, and it made the
point that the unfair treatment of sixth-form colleges as far as VAT
goes made no sense and was, in fact, untenable. The good news is that
the Government agreed, fundamentally, that they could not defend that
treatment. The bad news is that they do not plan to do anything about
it. That is a shame, because Government policy is to create a level
playing field for 16 to 19 provision, and they are right to do so. If
anyone wants to play party politics, I will point out that the
Opposition were wrong to leave the position uneven when they were in
power. However, the Government have set out their aim, but now they are
not fulfilling it. They have moved in that direction, but there is a
real opportunity to take action on this issue. In the overall scheme of
things, it would not be that expensive to do so; for sixth-form
colleges, it is estimated that it would cost no more than £30
million.</hs_Para>

reasons why sixth-form colleges could be treated differently from
further education colleges, if one wanted a stepped programme. To say,
“This is wrong, but we can only afford to rectify some of it, so
we will rectify none of it” is illogical. It would be better to
do the right thing by sixth-form colleges, not least because, as has
been said, they are the most successful 16 to 19 providers that we
have. If the Government’s education policy is about anything, it
is about raising 
<?notus-xml column=206?>standards across the board and, of course, closing the gap between rich
and poor. Well, guess which the most successful institutions are in the
16 to 19 sector at doing both those things? You’ve got
it—sixth-form colleges.</hs_Para>

probably be cross with me for speaking up for sixth-form colleges so
often. However, the whole point of the Education Committee is that we
look at the evidence and try to work out what is the best thing to do.
Well, guess what? Sixth-form colleges are peculiarly successful in
addressing the Government’s two key aims on education, so it
makes no sense to penalise them in the way that is happening
now.</hs_Para>

VAT penalty that sixth-form colleges face is worth an average of
£250,000 per college, and as has been said, the problem is
worsened because, unlike other institutions, they cannot
cross-subsidise. If that money were to be provided to sixth-form
colleges, it would help them to save courses that are being lost,
including less popular courses such as further maths. Ministers are
quite right to identify the need to encourage science, technology,
engineering and maths subjects. Sixth-form colleges can play a positive

so.</hs_Para>

basic feature of VAT is that businesses are able to reclaim the VAT
that they pay on their inputs. However, this does not apply to
purchases, acquisitions or imports made in relation to non-business
activities, such as the provision of free education. This means that
bodies such as schools can end up with VAT costs on the goods and
services that they buy
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000099">Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is always an option to meet these costs by increasing the funding
made available to schools, for example. However, there is a risk of the
burden of that funding falling on local taxation, as the state
education system in England and Wales has historically been delivered
by local authorities. To deal with that, in 1973 the Government
introduced a scheme, now under section 33 of the Value Added
Tax 1994, allowing local authorities to recover the VAT incurred on
goods and services purchased relating to non-business activities. Local
authority maintained schools are able to recover VAT under the umbrella
of the local
authority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000100">Since<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>
then, there have been extensions to that scheme, in particular to cover
the position of academy schools. The Finance Act 2011 introduced a new
VAT refund scheme, under section 33B of the 1994 Act, to ensure that
funding for academy schools’ non-business VAT costs was
consistent with that for local authority maintained schools. The
specific purpose of the scheme is to ensure continuity in the funding
of institutions that are leaving local authority control to become
academies, so that they are not put at a financial
disadvantage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000101">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:22:18"></hs_TimeCode>

historically. Schools have been treated one way, in part, because of
the relationship with local authorities and funding at local authority
level, whereas other elements of the public sector do not get funding
for VAT in the way that local authorities do. Sixth-form colleges and

colleges were incorporated, they had the same VAT rights as
schools, because they came from the same part of the womb, as it were,
but that was changed at the point of incorporation. Given the way that
the landscape of education has changed, it is odd that new provisions,
such as university technical colleges or 16 to 19 free schools, are
entitled to the VAT, whereas sixth-form colleges are not. That anomaly
was created on this Government’s watch. It would be better if it

affordable housing of higher quality to meet the demands in a community
such as ours. It is not that the local authority has not played a
fundamentally important part; we have the largest local authority
housing stock in London and one of the largest in the country. There is
also significant housing association housing, and we have one of the
highest proportions of shared ownership in the country. We have also

the Minister and everybody in London knows perfectly well, however, the
legacy that this Government inherited has meant that we have seen
relatively less housing being provided to meet the need in London. I am
happy to give credit where it is due. More local authority housing was
built under the Governments of Mrs Thatcher and John Major than
thereafter, but we then had a period when, although money was spent by
Government on bringing homes up to a decent standard, we did not build
new local authority housing. We therefore have an accumulative deficit
in housing

other self-evident factor is that London has the greatest gap in the
country between average family income and the average cost of a home.
Both rental costs and purchase costs are far greater relative to income

the Government to do more and to come up with specific proposals. In
particular, I am here to place on the record in Parliament some of the
recommendations of a report, which the Minister has now seen,
commissioned and worked on by my colleagues in the Greater London
assembly, who put forward proposals for how we can increase not only
the number of properties built, but also the number of jobs created as
a result. There is no better way to increase jobs and apprenticeships
than through the construction industry. My constituency, like all

initiated an Adjournment debate in the summer on the issue of foreign
purchases of properties in London. We have seen growth in the number of
people purchasing from abroad and in the number of properties built and
offered for sale abroad before they are offered for sale at home. That
has caused particular anger and frustration. It has driven up prices,
because if properties are opened up to the global
market—Malaysia, Singapore and other places—and
advertised to people who see London as good place to invest in housing,
the general price goes up because sellers can get higher prices for
sales abroad. If local people cannot even get access to bid for
properties until after they have been sold—on-plan or
off-plan—to someone far away, that is a double frustration. That
has been a real cause of grief and frustration to my constituents, in

pleased, however, that the Chancellor responded specifically to the
issue in the autumn statement as a result of, I hope, my debate, but
also the propositions of others, and announced that, in the following
financial year, any non-UK purchaser of residential property who sells
a property will pay capital gains tax on that sale, as everybody else

the new homes bonus; my local authority has received
£10,845,251, according to the letter—I do not doubt the
figure. This is a good initiative of the Government, and we welcome it.

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000146">I

again, and more boldly, at the housing revenue account and the way in
which local authorities can deal with it. I ask the Government not only
to take the welcome steps in the autumn statement—allowing
shared spend of money up to the housing revenue cap—but to scrap
the housing revenue account borrowing cap, allowing London boroughs to
invest in affordable housing under prudential borrowing

want, too, the Government to increase their investment in affordable
homes, shifting the balance of spending from housing benefit to bricks
and mortar. We are in a 
<?notus-xml column=215?>nonsense position in this respect at the moment: for the four financial
years of the current affordable housing programme, £4.5 billion
is being invested by the Government to support the creation of
affordable homes; over the same period, however, the Government are
also spending an estimated £95 billion on housing benefit. In
London, in 2011-12, £5.9 billion was spent on housing benefit
alone; about half of that, or £2.6 billion, would provide
111,000 extra affordable
homes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000148">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-17T16:54:05"></hs_TimeCode>
appreciate that we have to have the homes first, before we can move
people from privately rented accommodation, where the rents are high,
into much cheaper accommodation, which is their own. Of course there is
a cycle, but it cannot be beyond the wit of Government to think of ways
in which to forward finance that, so that we can build more quickly,
move many more people into affordable housing and reduce the housing
benefit bill, which I am sure that colleagues in the Department for
Work and Pensions would wish. Only 11% of the annual housing benefit
spend in London for four years would seem to be enough to fund 111,000

the benefit for jobs in London, the reality is not only that all the
house building would produce extra jobs in the construction sector,
which has the capacity—housing associations, too, have capacity,
because I have spoken to them and they have confirmed it—but
that there is opportunity for full-time employment and for apprentices.
Eighteen per cent. of all small and medium-sized enterprises in London
are in the construction sector. In the first quarter of 2013, however,
the balance of construction employment in SMEs fell faster in London
than anywhere else in the UK. Less than 20 years ago, more
than two thirds of homes were built by companies employing fewer than
500 people; by 2012, only 27 companies were responsible for 70% of the
housing starts in London. SMEs in construction have been squeezed,
therefore, and some have left the market

last benefit of such a programme is the apprenticeships. The Government
have done a huge amount on apprenticeships, which I welcome, as the
Minister would expect, but he knows about the capacity to recruit and
retain other people as apprentices, who would then go on to the
construction industry as a whole. In Southwark, we are bidding to have
a university technical college in Bermondsey to specialise in
construction skills, as well as in health service-related skills,

will end with one encouragement to the Minister. I understand that the
Treasury rules always make such issues difficult, because the Treasury
counts local authority borrowing as public sector borrowing. I have,
however, talked to the housing associations in London, which have been
extremely helpful—there are 16 big ones and more than 300
smaller ones—and they are beginning to find ways of expanding
the amount of social building. By and large, they are not simply
building conventional, rented affordable homes; they are building homes
that they sell at market rates and that they rent at market rates,
allowing them to use private finance in their associations and so to
cross-subsidise the affordable rented accommodation—so much so
that associations such as London &amp; Quadrant are now beginning to
be  
<?notus-xml column=216?>able to relet and let their new affordable housing not only at the
Government’s affordable rent—up to 80% of market rent, or
even 60%—but even at target or social rents, which really meets

Government the request that they should look at liberating local
councils to do the same sort of thing, so that they can access not only
the Treasury and public money, but the private sector, and lead in the
regeneration of London’s housing. If we could get house building
going in London, the land accumulation is waiting and ready. If we
could add more incentives to the tax system so that people do not sit
on land, but develop it, there would be huge benefit socially, to
family life, relationships and mental and physical health, and
economically. I hope that the Minister can be encouraged, but also
encouraging, and go back to his Department to say, “We must do

hectares of land from the Homes and Communities Agency, and it is vital
that a significant part of that is used for new house building. The GLA
is already utilising land and property assets to drive economic growth
and housing supply of all tenures. Much of that land has already been
developed. Around 130 hectares have been released so far, with a gross
development value of £3.6 billion. For instance, in recent
months, contracts have been exchanged in the Silvertown quays and Royal
Albert dock area, with a capacity for 1,500 homes and 29,000
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000164">The
GLA is also driving regeneration schemes  through grant funding
and infrastructure investment at Greenwich peninsula, Barking
riverside, Kidbrooke in Greenwich and Woodberry Down in Hackney. Those
four developments will provide in excess of 30,000 homes of
all tenures. The GLA is using, and will continue to use, its public
land holdings to deliver new homes in
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000165">My
right hon. Friend suggests that the Government should scrap the housing
revenue account borrowing cap, enabling London boroughs to invest
further in affordable housing through prudential borrowing rules. I
must stress that the Government’s first priority is to reduce
the national deficit. Allowing councils unlimited borrowing would
increase that. With the introduction of self-financing in April 2012,
London boroughs collectively had about £1.4 billion extra
headroom to invest in housing if they chose to do so. We recognise that
some councils may need additional borrowing, which is why we announced
in the autumn statement an additional £300 million of borrowing
capability, which individual authorities may use on housing if they so
choose. We expect that to support around 10,000 affordable homes over
2015-16 and 2016-17. The provision will be allocated through a
competitive bid
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121753000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/halltext/131217h0002.htm#13121753000166">I
reiterate that the Government are committed to building more affordable
housing. More than 170,000 new affordable homes have been delivered in
England  
<?notus-xml column=218?>over the past three and a half years. In comparison, between 1997 and
2010, under the previous Administration, the number of affordable
rented homes fell by 420,000, as my right hon. Friend pointed out. Our
affordable homes programme is making almost £20 billion of
public and private investment available to deliver 170,000 new
affordable homes between 2011 and 2015. Some 98,700 affordable homes
have been delivered through the affordable homes programme since it
started in 2011, which is more than half way towards delivering the
170,000 new affordable homes we expect by 2015.</hs_Para>

Government are playing their part in improving demand through schemes
such as Help to Buy equity loans. Some 87% of builders out of the 939
registered with the scheme are small builders building 40 units or
fewer. We are working with the Department for Business, Innovation and

support employers of up to 1,000 employees taking on a new young
apprentice aged 16 to 24. The Government fully fund the training costs

proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council

“orientation debate” guided by a paper and two questions

measures concerning the European single market for electronic
communications and to achieve a connected continent. (First Reading -
EM13562/13 and 13555/13 + ADDs 1-2). It asked member states to indicate
which of the actions contained in the proposal they regard as
priorities; and whether it was appropriate to carry out such actions at
EU or member state level. Commissioner Kroes opened the debate by
noting the difference in pace between the Council and Parliament in
discussing this file and expressed concern that there had been little
progress in Council since the October European Council, compared to
that of the European
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000044">There
then followed an extensive debate in which all member states
intervened. All began their interventions by welcoming the overall
objectives of the package in terms of completing the telecoms single
market and the associated growth opportunities. However, France,
Portugal, Czech Republic, Denmark and Sweden, called for the
prioritisation of other, more advanced, legislative proposals over the
connected continent package, in particular the proposals on electronic
identification, broadband cost-reduction and network and information
security. France, along with others, also forcefully questioned the
speed 
<?notus-xml column=85?>with which this proposal was drawn together and called for the
Commission to re-examine the rationale and evidence

package.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000045">There
were mixed responses to the individual components of the package. Many
member states, including the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy, did
not want to see Commission gaining any further competency over spectrum
management, especially national auctions, although there was
recognition, that there were some gains to be made from closer
co-ordination between member states. On the roaming proposal, many
member states supported the reduction of EU roaming charges, but noted
that the current proposal was too complex, unlikely to achieve its
desired effect and may have a negative impact on competition. Opinion
was mixed regarding the net neutrality proposal. Spain and Hungary
supported the draft proposal, while UK and Latvia did not. Similarly,
member states views on the consumer protection elements of the package
were also mixed. They were supported by Spain, Portugal, Hungary,
Luxembourg and UK, while Germany Austria and Ireland were concerned
that the current draft would erode their currently high-level of
domestic consumer protection. France added that the proposals did not
add any value to their domestic regime and were opposed on this basis,
while Malta and Luxembourg were concerned about the effects of them on
smaller electronic communications
operators.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000046">The
second question considered the conclusions of the October European
Council that covered several aspects of the digital economy—for
example, cloud computing, big data and digital platforms—that
are currently either unregulated or rely on “soft”
regulation. The presidency asked if any regulatory framework was
required and whether regulation should be at member state or EU-level.
The major focus of this discussion was on big data and cloud computing.
All member states began by recognising the importance of these two
areas and the need to make progress. However, responses about how to
achieve this were mixed, with some calling for further regulation and
others pressing for a light-touch approach. Germany, Italy, Slovenia
and Slovakia supported further work in this area, including the
development of specific European frameworks. However, Sweden and the UK
called for a light-touch approach and did not support further
regulation on cloud and big data. However, it was recognised that the
use of standards could help form any common
framework.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000047">During
summing-up, Commissioner Kroes stated she saw the debate as a turning
point. She suggested that Council supported an extensive examination of
the connected continent proposal under the Greek presidency, and that
there was high-level consensus on the need for action on spectrum, net
neutrality and consumer protection, while acknowledging that roaming
may be more difficult to reach agreement on. However, she also called
for further progress under the current Lithuanian
presidency.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000048">The
presidency largely agreed with the Commission’s assessment,
although felt that the views of member states on parts of the package
were more strongly held and differed from those that the Commission
suggested. They would therefore hand this file over to the Greeks to
begin detailed work on the file. However, in a procedurally unusual
move, Commissioner Kroes challenged the presidency’s
conclusions, as she believed that member states’ were calling
for work to begin under the Lithuanian presidency. The presidency
disagreed with this view, which was supported by an intervention from
France.</hs_Para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Mr Shailesh
Vara):</Member></B> Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunals Service
(HMCTS) has prepared a trust statement providing an account of the
collection of revenues which are due to be paid to HM Treasury. The
statement includes  the value of fines and confiscation orders
imposed by the judiciary; fixed penalties imposed by the police; the
value of collections; the balances paid over to third parties including
victims of crime, the Home Office and HM Treasury; and the balance of
outstanding
impositions.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000087">We
welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General’s (C&amp;AG) report
on the trust statement which recognises the improvements in financial
reporting made by HMCTS. The C&amp;AG has, for the first time and

statement shows that we have continued the year-on-year improvement in
the levels of collection. During 2012-13 more than £495 million
has been collected from offenders, an increase of £11 million
compared to 2011-12. Almost £59 million in compensation was paid
to victims of crime—of which £25 million was funded by
criminals’ cash and assets recovered through confiscation
orders. In addition, following a change to the victim surcharge HMCTS
is able to report increased receipts for victim support with £11
million being collected and paid in the year to support this
work.</hs_Para>

orders are one of the key mechanisms available to the Government
to deprive criminals of the proceeds of their
crimes. The value of the order imposed, which is often very high, is
based on the criminal benefit attributed to the crime and may,
therefore, exceed the value of realisable assets that are known to the
court at the time of imposition. Crucially, an outstanding order stops
the criminal benefiting from the proceeds of crime and ensures that, if
the assets are discovered in the future, they can be
seized.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000090">Confiscation
orders comprise 70% (£1.4 billion including interest) of total
outstanding impositions. All available actions and sanctions are taken
to recover this debt and bring it to account as expeditiously as
possible. However, around one half of this amount—excluding
interest—cannot be collected as it includes £109 million
(8%) relating to individuals who are deceased, deported or who cannot
be located, £84 million (6%) relating to orders which are being
appealed and cannot be enforced while under appeal; and £136
million (10%) relating to orders where all the assets have been
assessed as hidden following the conclusion of financial forensic
investigations. In addition there is a further £339 million
(24%) of interest accrued on confiscation orders which are outside
agreed payment
terms.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000091">Cracking
down on those who do not pay is an absolute priority. The agencies
involved in the enforcement of confiscation orders, including the
Ministry of Justice, the Home Office, the Serious Fraud Office and the
Crown Prosecution Service take every step to tackle outstanding debt
including the addition of interest and imprisonment for those who do
not pay. In relation to the outstanding fine debt the sanctions include
taking deductions from offenders’ benefits or their earnings and
seizing and selling their property and goods. Those who do not pay can
also be
imprisoned.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000092">Criminals
go to extraordinary lengths to hide the proceeds of their crimes by
transferring funds abroad and concealing them with friends and family,
but we are succeeding in recovering more money every year. The agencies
responsible for enforcement are building better relationships with
overseas authorities and engage specialist forensic teams to track down
hidden assets. The 2012-13 trust statement analyses the confiscation

out a programme to implement the use of direct debit payments which can
be used where outstanding fines are paid in instalments. The direct
debit payment process will be easier for enforcement staff to

rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13121747000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/wmstext/131217m0001.htm#13121747000095">HMCTS

Today the Office for National Statistics announced that, following a

the public sector. This is an independent statistical decision taken by

Government welcome the ONS review and have always been committed to the
transparent reporting of public liabilities. The change in Network
Rail’s classification will mean that the company’s net
debt, currently some £30 billion, will appear on the

noted in its “Economic and fiscal outlook” published on 5
December, that this will likely increase public sector net debt by
about 2% of GDP and public sector net borrowing by 0.2% of GDP on
average. The Government remain committed to their plans to reduce the
deficit and will continue to do so by taking difficult decisions to cut
public spending and prioritise investment in infrastructure to deliver
a stronger economy and fairer society. The new classification will be
implemented from 1 September 2014 and will apply from April 2004. Until
then Network Rail remains in the private

offices have been located in the same building as the police. The
central records cover buildings where the CPS has entered into a formal

holds a commercial lease and the building is also occupied by the

other help including carers allowance for parents or guardians and the

Truss:</Member></B> The Department for Education does not routinely
collect data on the number of children who are cyberbullied in the UK.
However, a number of expert organisations-such as the Diana Award and
NSPCC-have undertaken surveys to try to measure this problem. These
surveys reveal wide variation in reported incidence, which could be
because personal interpretation of what constitutes cyberbullying
varies.</hs_Para>

an evidence review carried out by the Childhood Wellbeing Centre (at
the Institute of Education, University of Kent and Loughborough
University) for the Department in 2011, found that between 8% and 34%
of children and young people in the UK have been cyberbullied. Evidence
from the 2010 Longitudinal Study of 15,000 14 to 16-year-old people in
England (LSYPE), which is funded by the Department, found that
cyberbullying was the most common form of abuse along with
name-calling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121778000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/text/131217w0002.htm#13121778000237">We
are also funding a series of questions about bullying in the 2013/14
and 2014/15 Crime Survey for England and Wales. One of the questions
asks 10 to 14-year-olds about whether or not they have experienced
cyberbullying in the last 12 months. This will give us a baseline
estimate of prevalence and will help us to track trends over
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121778000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/text/131217w0002.htm#13121778000238">We
believe that schools, parents and internet providers all have a role to
play in keeping children and young people safe online. Every school
must have a behaviour policy, which includes measures to prevent all
forms of bullying. Ofsted hold schools to account for how well they do
this. Since January 2012, school inspectors have had to consider types,
rates and patterns of bullying and the effectiveness of the school's
actions to prevent and tackle bullying, including
cyberbullying.</hs_Para>

teachers a specific power to search for and, If necessary, delete
inappropriate images or files on electronic devices, including mobile
phones. From September 2014, pupils in all four key stages will be
taught about e-safety as part of the new curriculum. This will empower
young people to tackle cyberbullying through responsible, respectful
and secure use of technology, as well as ensuring that pupils are
taught age-appropriate ways of reporting any concerns they may have
about what they see or encounter
online.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13121778000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131217/text/131217w0002.htm#13121778000240">The
Government expects all social media to have simple mechanisms for
reporting abuse, to take action promptly when abuse is reported and to
make it easier for users to turn off anonymous posts. The Government

programme for 10-16 year olds was launched in April 2013. MMR coverage
is routinely collected at two and five years. Baseline coverage for
children aged 10-16 years was estimated from annual coverage data at
five years collected between 2002 and 2008 and adjusted for any MMR
vaccination received subsequently. This provided a baseline estimate of
between 92 and 93% in April 2013. Preliminary data until the end of May

Monthly data: As from 21 July 2010 the Health and Social Care
Information Centre has published provisional monthly NHS work force
data. As expected with provisional statistics, some figures may be
revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and resolved. The
monthly work force data are not directly comparable with the annual
work force census; they only include those staff on the ESR (i.e. they
do not include primary care staff or bank staff). There are also new
methods of presenting data (headcount methodology is different and
there is now a role count). This information is available from
September 2009 onwards at the following
website:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">www.hscic.gov.uk</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
Data Quality: The Health and Social Care Information Centre seeks to
minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data but
responsibility for data accuracy lies with the organisations providing
the data. Methods are continually being updated to improve data quality
where changes impact on figures already published. This is assessed but
unless it is significant at national level figures are not changed.
Impact at detailed or local level is footnoted in relevant
analyses.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source</I>:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">Health
