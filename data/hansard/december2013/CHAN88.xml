Government of the Philippines, in particular, on disaster resilience.
For some time now, the country has done work in preparing itself to
cope with these natural disasters, because it is in a part of the world
that is particularly prone to them. The size of the typhoon would
clearly pose challenges for any country, however prepared it was. There
are still lessons to be learned about better preparation, not only at
national level but at local level too.</hs_Para>

It may be some time before homes that are able to withstand such
natural disasters are built. In the meantime, the United Nations,
working alongside the Government of the Philippines, is co-ordinating
an effort to make sure that we can provide shelter for people who need
it. I should also say to him, as I have been clear with the House, that
this is a real challenge because many of those people live in

allocated £8 million to a variety of UK non-governmental
organisations who, as part of the facility, quickly responded with what
they felt was needed. We have allocated all the money that they have
requested 
<?notus-xml column=899?>so far. Clearly, they will then go through the process of making sure
that the supplies that the money purchases get out to people on the

Pledges of more than £40 million were made to that event. The
focus is on going beyond the obvious things we can do to create safe
spaces for girls and women, such as making sure that when we deliver
food aid we do not increase risk to women. Simple things include
lockable toilets so that women are able to go out safely, lit areas and
solar panels that also act as mobile phone chargers so that girls can
stay in touch with their families. It is a very practical agenda, but

lead to the current situation in which Conservative-controlled
Hammersmith and Fulham council is threatening to close the successful

“good” by Ofsted—in the face of overwhelming
opposition from parents, governors, pupils and local residents, in

the documents provide an update on the projects that have been
delivered to date—I am sure that we will return to that later.
Secondly, the documents update our plans to improve future delivery.
The updated pipeline provides the most comprehensive overview of
planned and potential infrastructure investment ever produced, which
gives investors the long-term clarity and certainty they need to put
their money into our infrastructure. The NIP also includes changes
relating to legal and planning practices, including reforms to judicial
review, for example, the creation of a special planning chamber to

documents published today update some of the details of our previous
infrastructure plan. Let me give the House a few details. First, we set
out changes to the strike price regime for renewable energy, and they
have a number of components. We have reduced slightly the support being
offered in the future for onshore wind and large-scale solar
production. We are also increasing substantially investment in offshore
wind. In particular, we think that the strike prices we have announced,
with the increase in 2018-19, are likely to lead to at least 10 GW of
investment in offshore wind between now and 2020—more if the
prices can come down. This is about meeting our growth commitments and
our green commitments as cost-effectively as possible.</hs_Para>

out decisions on the future of the renewable heat incentive and the
prices that we pay for different technologies under it. The plan also
sets out a few changes to some specific transport schemes. We have
listened carefully to the public response to the consultation on the
tolling of the A14 and we have decided not to go ahead with that
tolling, but not at any cost in terms of the time taken to deliver that
very important project. We have decided to provide new investment in
the A50, a crucial road link where there are many delays and
bottlenecks. We are working closely with Staffordshire county council
and the local enterprise partnership to work through the delivery of
that. We have decided to contribute £30 million to the
development 
<?notus-xml column=918?>of the proposed “Garden bridge” in London. We have also

such as the A1 to Scotland, the A303, the A27 and the trans-Pennine
routes, are well under way and that full plans for each of those routes

Sir Howard Davies in advance of the interim report by his airports
commission, we have set out plans to improve surface access to airports
around London—in particular, £50 million will be
contributed to a new Gatwick airport railway station. The subject of
rural broadband was mention in the earlier Question Time, and we are

today’s publication lays out the commitment made today by a
group of insurers to work with Government and regulators and invest
£25 billion in UK infrastructure over the next five years. I am
sure that hon. Members on both sides of the House will agree that that
represents a massive vote of confidence by some of our most important
companies in the UK economy. The plan also draws attention to the new
agreement signed with Hitachi and Horizon this morning, which commits
us in principle to offering a guarantee for their new nuclear power
station in Anglesey. I am sure that hon. Members who have had a chance
to look through the document will recognise that this is real evidence
that we are making real progress on delivering infrastructure fit for
our country’s future. The NIP demonstrates a long-term vision
for our energy, transport and digital networks. It is a plan that is
helping to secure long-term investment and that will lead to
sustainable, strong long-term growth. As such, I look forward to the

Let me address it briefly. On Royal Mail, he will know that 10% of the
shares are owned by the employees, which I think is an extremely good
step that has not been taken before in the sale of national assets. The
Government should not own assets that they do not need and in which
investment could be made more effectively in the private sector,
particularly when their sale would release receipts that could then be
used to invest further in our critical national infrastructure. That is
why we are raising our target for sales from £10
billion to £20 billion. I think that we have been
under-ambitious in the past. There are assets that could be sold, such
as the Government’s stake in Eurostar. No final decision has
been taken on that, but we are working towards ensuring that we can put
those assets into the private sector, where they can be better run and
better managed, and use the resources for the infrastructure projects
contained in the plan.</hs_Para>

Secondly, the availability of a lower rate from the Public Works Loan

for key local infrastructure projects—is being extended from
local enterprise partnerships in England to local authorities in

Gentleman, who until recently performed a fantastic service to Northern
Ireland in his role as Finance Minister in the Northern Ireland
Government. He and I worked closely together in that regard. I would
have thought that that work alone gave him confidence in the plans that
I have set out. I do not think that his claim about the £18
billion for Northern Ireland is factually accurate, for reasons that he
and I have discussed many times and, I am sure, will continue to
discuss long into the future. As for the rest of the plan, he can be
confident in it for the reasons set out in the document, which I very

MPs are aware of just how strained the relationship between people and
power has become. We have reached a depressing point in our history

worries me is how low that issue is on the Westminster political
agenda. There is a sense that it is just a passing problem and that, in
time, people will come back to the fold because there is no real
alternative. Some even blame the expenses scandal, as if everything was
okay before 2009. We know that it was not. Voter turnout has been
decreasing for years. The memberships of political parties have
plummeted to miserable levels. Among voters, there is an overwhelming
sense that politics has become so detached and remote that, no matter
how they vote or even whether they vote, nothing can change. I think
that we are at an important turning
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000017">Democracy
has evolved in this country, on the whole without too much violence. We
should consider the first Reform Act of 1832, when the vast social
transformation that had been brought about by industrialisation meant
that politicians had no alternative but to yield to society’s
demand that they broaden the franchise and give more people more
ownership of their democracy. That happened again in 1867, when reforms
were brought in that effectively doubled the number of men who were
able to vote. More reforms followed in 1884. In 1918, the first women
were allowed to vote, albeit only those over the age of 30 and with
property to their name. That changed in 1928, when everyone over the
age of 21 could vote, whether they were a man or a woman. In 1969, the
voting age was lowered to 18. In one way or another, each of those
steps has involved Parliament, sometimes reluctantly, handing power to
people and edging us towards a purer democracy. Today, no one questions
the wisdom of any of those reforms. I believe that it is time for us to
take another step towards a purer
democracy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000018">In
the past few years, our world has changed beyond recognition. We have
access to instant news from tens of thousands of different sources.
Anyone can create a media platform and become a media baron. We no
longer depend on a small handful of newspaper proprietors to inform our
politics. Whereas voters used to rely on the odd newsletter and
occasional newspaper report to find out about their MP, today’s
voters can see in real time what their MP is saying and doing, and
whether and how they are
voting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000019">While
those vast changes have taken hold, the way in which we do democracy
has stood still. We still have a system in which, once elected, an MP
is almost entirely insulated from any pressure from his or her
constituents until five years or so later in the next general election.

<?notus-xml column=938?>There is no mechanism that allows voters to sack their MP. An MP can
switch to an extreme party, systematically break each and every promise
that they made before the election, refuse to turn up in Parliament or
refuse to engage in any meaningful sense with their electorate, but
unless they are jailed for more than 12 months an MP is effectively
unmoveable. It is therefore no surprise that, from the moment an
election is over, the pressure is all top-down from the party, not
bottom-up from the
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000020">In
the heat of the expenses scandal, the leaders of all three mainstream
parties seemed finally to understand the full extent of the public
disillusionment with politics. Perhaps in a panic, they came up with a
powerful idea: they promised to bring in a system of recall that would
allow voters to hold their MPs to account at all times. That was a
straightforward promise and recognition of the problem that showed a
willingness to trust voters and to treat them as
grown-ups.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000021">However,
now that the Deputy Prime Minister has been asked to produce a recall
Bill, he has come up with an idea that is so far removed from genuine
recall that it is recall only in name. It is an attempt to convey an
impression of democratic reform without empowering voters in any sense
at all. I am yet to find anyone inside or outside Parliament who
supports the Government
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000022">True
recall is a very simple mechanism. If a percentage of
constituents—usually around 20%—sign a petition in a
given time frame, they earn the right to have a referendum in which
voters are asked whether they want to recall their MP. If more than
half of the voters say yes, there is a subsequent by-election. By
contrast, under the Government’s proposals, power will move up,
not down, and to a parliamentary Committee, not to voters. The
Committee on Standards—whose Chairman, incidentally, has already
said that he does not want these extra powers—would determine,
using extraordinarily narrow criteria, whether an MP qualified for
recall. If that happened, there would be no recall referendum in which
Members could defend themselves against whatever charges had been
raised. There would effectively be an immediate by-election, fought in
the national context. No Member, good or bad, would stand a chance
under that process, not least because no association would be crazy
enough to reselect a Member once the Committee had pointed its
finger.</hs_Para>

bringing in reforms to empower people to hold this institution to
account, which was what all three parties promised, the Government want

independent-minded MPs who are here on their own without the protection
of party. Let us be clear that under the Government’s plans, an
MP could refuse to perform any one of the functions required of them
and still not qualify for recall. If the Government push ahead with the
proposal, it will merely confirm all the prejudices that people have

Minister has explained why the Government want a form of recall that is
not actually recall, repeatedly expressing fears about what he
describes as kangaroo courts. However, he must understand that, under a
recall system, the only court is the constituency and the only jurors

attempts to collect enough signatures to get rid of a decent MP, but in
the average constituency the threshold would be about 15,000 voters. By
contrast, most local parties would consider themselves lucky if they
had more than 500 members. If 15,000 of my constituents signed a

is worth pointing out that recall already happens all over the world.
It is not a novel idea, and it happens in its purest form. As far as I

we boil them down, are arguments against democracy

voters, of course recall makes sense. It would allow them to keep their
MPs on their toes, even those in safe seats, and give them a
much-needed sense of ownership over their democracy. However, I
maintain that true recall is in our interest too, because it would
begin the process of healing the broken relationship between people and
power. In a true democracy, it would make no sense for voters to
dismiss Parliament with the sweeping generalisations that are so normal
today, because in such a democracy people would truly have the MP they
deserved. If they were unhappy with their representative, they would

nitrogen. Under that directive, plants that do not fit clean-up
equipment will from January 2016 be subject to a 17,500 hour limit on
their operation, after which they must close, or, from mid-2020 be
limited to just 1,500 hours of operation a year. The intention behind
the amendment is to use the EPS as a regulatory tool for limiting

equipped with carbon capture and storage. The EPS is, therefore, about
ensuring no new unabated coal, and is a clear and unambiguous

coal fleet is old, having mainly been built in the 1960s and
’70s, with only one plant, Drax, under 40 years old. Most of
these ageing power stations are now expected to retire completely
between now and the mid-2020s. As I have explained, if a station is not
to face restrictions and/or closure under the directive, it will need
to invest in clean-up equipment. That would require a multi-year
programme of investment in the order of several hundred million pounds.
Over time, with the carbon price floor and a strengthening emissions
trading scheme, the economics of coal generation will deteriorate
further compared with gas. Furthermore, as more low-carbon generation
comes on to the system through new nuclear and renewables, it will
result in higher-carbon coal generation being increasingly displaced.
The combined effect is that the economic outlook for coal generation is
poor.</hs_Para>

is consistent with that outlook and shows that unabated coal generation
will make up just 7% of total generation by 2020 and 3% by 2025, and
probably 0% by 2030. There is no evidence at the moment of a large
number of operators planning to upgrade their coal plants, but we
should not rule out the possibility that one or two might do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000205">We
have heard the argument that the amendment would merely make available
a tool for future Governments to use, if necessary, to limit the
emissions from existing coal stations, but we believe the very
existence of such a power would create an additional regulatory risk
that could deter the small number of our most efficient stations that
might otherwise choose to upgrade. As I have set out, under the
directive stations that do not upgrade will be subject to limited hours
and/or forced 
<?notus-xml column=944?>to close. If the amendment were accepted, therefore, we would risk more
coal stations closing earlier than might otherwise be the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000206">I
have also considered the argument that the amendment would provide
greater certainty to investors looking to build the new gas plant that
we all agree will be needed. However, the amendment would do so in a
way which could create risks for our security of supply and increase
costs to consumers. We already face a significant investment challenge
with an estimated 16 GW of new gas plant, and about 45 GW in total of
all forms of generating capacity, needed over the decade from 2015 to
2024. We are acting to facilitate that new investment through other
measures in the Bill, notably with regard to the capacity market.
However, we cannot be 100% certain about exactly when all that
investment will be delivered. We need a managed transition to a
lower-carbon future, in which our existing assets are managed prudently
to avoid unnecessary costs to
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000207"><Member ContinuationText="Dan Byles" PimsId="5598" UID="13120494002014" xid="1199" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494002014"><B>Dan

Greatrex</B> (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It is
a pleasure to take part in the debate this afternoon, which may be the
long-awaited final part of our deliberations on the Energy
Bill—or maybe not. The House will not need reminding that we
have had long, and at times detailed, discussions on this Bill. Indeed,
I noticed while listening to the Minister’s opening remarks that
the hon. Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry) is present, which reminded
me that when the Bill was first published and subject to
pre-legislative scrutiny, it was in his hands, and it has since passed
through the hands of the right hon. Member for South Holland and The
Deepings (Mr Hayes) before his promotion to the heart of the Prime
Minister’s office, and then on to the current Minister. We have
been addressing this Bill for some time, therefore, and a 
<?notus-xml column=945?>couple of weeks ago we debated extending its time limit. During that
debate, we made it clear that the Opposition do not wish to delay the
Bill unduly because it is an important piece of proposed legislation,
but although the extended deadline of the end of the year is fast
approaching, we think there are some issues before us today that merit
further serious consideration.</hs_Para>

issues are before us today only because of consideration of the Bill in
another place and, as the Secretary of State made clear when asked
about his attitude to this particular measure, it is not necessarily as
simple as sometimes portrayed by Members on the Government Benches.
There have been a number of improvements to the Bill in relation to
nuclear transparency, community energy and other areas, and much of
that still needs to be done through secondary legislation and
regulation, which will undoubtedly follow. In part those improvements
have been prompted by amendment and debate instigated from both sides
of the House and in both Houses, and it is in that context that I
believe we should also give due cognisance to amendment 105 passed in
another
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000213">Many
of the Members present have faithfully stuck with this Bill through all
its stages, and they will have heard me make the point that it is my
personal belief that confession is good for the soul. I therefore wish
to begin with a confession: I remain somewhat confused by the attitude
of Liberal Democrats Members on this issue. A number of Liberal
Democrat Members have taken part in our proceedings on the Bill, and
have demonstrated their desire to see an improvement in our energy
infrastructure and a commitment to decarbonisation. Indeed, if one
refers to the speech made by the mover of this amendment in the other
place, those were exactly the concerns expressed. Lord Teverson, the
Liberal Democrat’s energy spokesman in the other place, is a
conscientious and diligent contributor to discussions on energy policy,
but I understand that the distasteful realities of coalition mean that
Ministers are constrained.</hs_Para>

displayed by the Minister today suggests that on this matter he has won
the battle with his coalition colleagues in recompense for other
measures we have heard about in the recent past. I wonder, however,
whether this, like the 2030 decarbonisation target, is a Liberal
Democrat policy that Liberal Democrat Back Benchers feel unable to vote
for, or a Liberal Democrat tactic to keep those in the other place
distracted. If they vote with the Government against Lords amendment
105, do they intend to vote for it again in the other place? If that is
the case, the rest of us could simply leave it to the Liberal Democrats
to decide between themselves, and between both Houses, which way they
wish to face, or whether they wish to face both
ways.</hs_Para>

have heard, and I anticipate we will hear more in the time available,
about coal generation. Some in this House are hostile to coal-fired

unconventional gas cite its ability to use less coal as part of their
case for shale. There are others who are supportive of the remaining 
<?notus-xml column=946?>indigenous coalfields and have strong constituency associations with
coal-fired generation. A number have previously worked in that industry
and I have a huge amount of respect for their knowledge and expertise.
For my part, I think that coal-fired generation remains an important
part of our generation mix. We are currently using, as my hon. Friend
the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) pointed out, a significant amount
of coal generation, particularly in the winter months. Earlier this
week, the UK achieved a new generation record for wind, but coal is
currently the predominant part of our generation mix.</hs_Para>

for coal as part of that mix is not born of any historical romanticism
about the industry so much as the positive opportunity presented by
carbon capture and storage for a bright future for clean coal. That
important point has been recognised by the joint industry and trade

about the limited and slow progress on CCS in the past three years.
That is an important point when we take comparisons into account. If
Members have not had the opportunity to do so, I would ask them to
consider the significant progress made in Canada on CCS. My hon.
Friend, a member of the Select Committee on Energy and Climate Change,

we had a rehearsal in a Westminster Hall 
<?notus-xml column=947?>debate this morning. I have also read the report compiled for the
Department of Energy and Climate Change on coal-fired power stations in
Germany that he had in the Library yesterday. He will know from the
report that the plants were sanctioned in 2007-08, which was pre-EU
2020 targets, pre-withdrawal of free allowances and pre-renewables. The
trigger for German investment in coal was the first nuclear phase out,
and the slow build of the plants commissioned in 2007-08 were the
result of a number of plants using defective steel. They are likely to
operate at a loss. They are completing commissioning to make less of a

Member for Bexhill and Battle (Gregory Barker) laugh, but I did not
mean fetishisation in any unclean sense. The deployment of renewables
in Germany has been significant and has expanded, with more community
and diverse ownership of capacity. We can learn a lot from that, but,
as a German academic expressed it to me this week, with the amount of
coal-fired power currently being generated in Germany, one might think
that the people who hold up Germany as the green case for the future
cannot read statistics. The German view of CCS has been born of
opposition to storing carbon underground, and the UK is more likely to
store carbon under the sea. The German decision to accelerate the phase
out of nuclear was perhaps not the wisest, given the emissions targets
that it too has to meet.</hs_Para>

some of the projects were kicked off a few years ago. The report also

his substantive point, he is right on Germany’s trajectory in

point I wanted to make on CCS is that the Minister’s colleague
in the other place, Baroness Verma, referred to no more coal without
CCS. That is also the position of CoalPro, the Confederation of Coal
Producers, which said, in correspondence with the Minister, that
coal-fired power had to have CCS in the long term in order to meet our
long-term admissions targets, and encouraged him to accelerate the
demonstration projects on CCS. So there is unanimity among those with
an interest in coal that CCS is the long-term
answer.</hs_Para>

Greatrex:</Member></B> I agree with my hon. Friend about the need for
progress on CCS, which is why I have continued to press the Government
on it over the past two years. The Minister might correct me, either at
the end of this debate or on the next set of amendments, but my
understanding is that there should be some news on the two shortlisted
projects, if not towards the end of this year, early next year. I am
concerned, however, that with just two demonstration projects, in
isolation, without the continuing regime of contracts for difference
and other support, CCS will become almost a curiosity, rather than a
continuing and integral part of how we reduce and minimise emissions
from the peak in capacity we will require for many years to
come.</hs_Para>

energy companies have made in correspondence much the same point as
CoalPro. That was why we proposed an amendment, adopted by the
Government, to provide flexibility in the early stages of CCS projects,
in the commissioning period, to maximise the chance to achieve what we
need to on CCS. That amendment was tabled alongside another one,
similar to this amendment, that we discussed in Committee, one part of

clear about what the amendment would do and what it would mean for coal
plant. Coal plants operating in 2013 effectively have three choices.
The first is to leave the plant as it is, without investment, in which
case it would close some time before 2023, depending on how quickly it
used the permitted hours of operation to which the Minister referred.
The second is to upgrade in order to conform to the industrial
emissions directive, as has been done at least once, at
Ratcliffe-on-Soar, and as others are considering doing. The third is to
upgrade more significantly to extend the lifetime and meet the IED
stipulations.</hs_Para>

coal-fired power stations in the first category would be unaffected by
the amendment. If they burned through their allowances quickly,
operating at 55% load factor, they would still run until 2020, and
because of the likely profitability of the capacity market being
introduced, I suspect that many would choose to run at slightly lower
load levels until 2023. The Government’s emissions performance
standards, already in the Bill, will apply to the third category of
plant—those that extend their lives through investment. The
amendment would impact on the second group and take effect,
effectively, from 2023.</hs_Para>

limits on carbon emissions are expressed as the amount of
CO<Sub>2</Sub> per kWh, but they limit the amount produced not per hour
but per year. A typical power station, therefore, would be limited to a
40% to 45% load factor without lowering its emissions rate. That means
running at a low load factor, to manage peaks in demand or in winter,
or becoming serious about CCS. Neither choice is the end of coal
generation in the UK.</hs_Para>

and second groups. On the third group, so far there has been relatively
little investment, but I know that a number of companies are actively
considering making it. They are waiting, partly for the completion of
this Bill and regulations arising from it and partly for the detailed
work on the capacity market, before making those investment decisions.
As I said at the outset, that is why it is important we get the Bill

points.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000237">The
Minister gave several reasons why the Government were against the
amendment. The first, which he referred to almost in passing, was on
technical and drafting grounds. In that regard, several points have
been made by those anxious to ensure that existing investment is not
disregarded, but I think that those points could be properly reflected
in the regulations that would arise were the amendment to be
successful. The second was that the amendment was unnecessary, because
existing price control policies, notably the carbon price floor, had
the same impact in effectively limiting coal plants to about 40% to 45%
load factor. If so, perhaps the Minister, whose antipathy to the carbon
price floor has been well-rehearsed—he has been reminded of it a
couple of times recently, including this morning, so I will not
embarrass him by doing it again—could help to persuade the
Chancellor that the unilateral, untargeted measure of a carbon price
floor is not needed because the Government could use the approach in
the amendment
instead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000238">The
third argument was that the amendment would present a risk to security
of supply. As the Minister is aware, the amendment would not bite until
2023, and if his boast earlier today in Westminster Hall—on
investment decisions about to be announced for the enabling
process—are accurate, that would give scope for any gap to be
filled. I say that not least because we would continue to have that
coal capacity operating in winter and at peak times through the
capacity mechanism the Government are introducing.</hs_Para>

argument concerned costs. The Minister neglected the point that the
price of electricity was pegged to the price of producing energy from
gas. However much coal is in the system, coal generators sell at the
gas price, so bringing more coal into the system would not necessarily
mean lower energy costs for consumers. It is worth restating that the
EPS goes no further than the Government’s own prediction for
scaling back coal in the energy mix. It is effectively a back-stop or,
with some intelligent thinking, possibly an alternative to what they
anticipate will happen in response to the EU emissions trading scheme
and carbon price floor combined.</hs_Para>

the Minister spoke in a debate, which I thought was a very good debate,
about issues of balance in energy policy. He also spoke earlier this
week, to a slightly different audience, about the order in which he saw
the elements of the balance: security of supply, affordability, climate
change, in that order. He is right to talk about balance, investment
and impacts, and the very purpose of the Bill is to ensure we strike
that 
<?notus-xml column=950?>balance in the most affordable and sensible way in order to secure a
diverse and balanced energy supply for the future, while recognising
the realities of climate change and the measures we need to take to
address it, and to protect us from the vagaries of the volatility
inherent in globally traded commodities. He will have seen this
week’s figures from the International Energy Association on
global energy demand projections over the next few years. Contrary to
the impression he gave, the amendment is in line with the
Government’s stated aims. It is proportionate and sensible and
is certainly worthy of further consideration for inclusion in the
Bill.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_04_PT_1/4E32627850366E4DF5441C2B00BE1B0D8088DAF7" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 December 2013">Wednesday

in his disagreeing with Lords amendment 105. This country has always
had a balanced energy policy, with several things feeding into the mix,
and I think it important that we continue that. The problem is,
however, that we have not built enough capacity over the past
15 or 20 years. The changes under the Thatcher Government to
the grid and the electricity market were successful in maintaining
relatively low prices, but there has not been the same investment in
capacity. That was made substantially worse by the last Government, who
managed to produce a White Paper without mentioning nuclear power as
part of that important mix.</hs_Para>

difficulty. At some point, we have to close the Magnox stations. In
addition, we have policies that are making coal less attractive, so
that capacity is going off and needs to be replaced. Although there are
plans and many firms are talking about building capacity, it is not
being built. If we are not careful, we will have a gap, in that we will
lose capacity and then have to either import or face the genuine risk
that the lights will go out some time in the next several years. That
is a serious thing. We can have all sorts of debates in this Chamber
about the economy, quantitative easing, funding for lending and
everything else, but if we cannot generate enough electricity to keep
the lights on and industry running, that will be a poor indictment of
the British economy.</hs_Para>

making amendments that make our current coal-fired stations less

Normally, that is when the grid starts getting a little nervous. In the
years ahead, the grid might have to be a lot smarter about managing our
assets and resources to ensure that we can provide electricity.
Renewables have their role, but they are sometimes less predictable
than nuclear or coal-powered stations. That is one reason why, as the

light mothballed or deep mothballed are not coal-fired but gas-fired
plants. About six of them are mothballed—even though those
operators could operate perfectly efficient gas plants for their own
operations—not because they cannot produce on a reasonable
basis, but because of the spark spread for gas and electricity prices.
Therefore, it is not a capacity crunch because there is no capacity; it

operate relative to each other.</hs_Para>

Whitehead:</Member></B> Indeed. There is the question of what happens
to the carbon dioxide subsequently and how it is injected. In Canada,
it is injected into additionally drilled wells on land; there is a
different process of injection offshore. At the Saskatchewan power
station, the process involves the use of carbon dioxide for enhanced
oil recovery, although most of it stays on the ground after the process
in any
event.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000275"><B><Member ContinuationText="David Mowat" PimsId="5728" UID="13120494002051" xid="1167" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494002051">David

Gentleman’s argument about the acceleration of CCS as a
consequence of accepting the amendment. Notwithstanding the
Saskatchewan case, CCS is still an unproven technology in this country.
For clarity, is he saying that the amendment would result in those
stations being converted to CCS in time to prevent them from being
switched off? It was implied from the Front Bench earlier that they
would be replaced by gas power. Which of those two options does the
hon. Gentleman consider to be more
likely?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000276"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Whitehead" PimsId="4585" UID="13120494002052" xid="628" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494002052">Dr
Whitehead:</Member></B> Some of those plants could well be replaced by
gas, and some could well close down. Indeed, some could well close down
whether the amendment were passed or not. The problem for capacity in
the market is that the signals being sent out at the moment are so
varied and uncertain that a number of people who might otherwise invest
in plant are holding back until, for example, the capacity market comes
on stream or until there is more certainty about CCS or about coal
generation. As we have seen already, there is a possibility that plants
will close down by accident rather than by design. They could end up
being mothballed because of market circumstances, rather than because
of long-term planning based on capacity.</hs_Para>

would improve that certainty tremendously by making it absolutely clear
what was expected of coal-fired power in the future. Coal-fired power
would not cease to exist; it would be able to run at certain levels per
year, and any existing coal-fired power station that wished to run
continuously after the early 2020s would have to have CCS attached to
it. The amendment would send a simple, straightforward
message.</hs_Para>

run, and what hours would be attached to them—a process that has
already been undertaken under previous directives—during the
period up to the early 2020s. The question for those power stations is
not the point at which they switch over or at which they stop; it is
whether they can continue unabated past the early 2020s. That is the

other Members, I have received many postcards and e-mails from people
urging me to support the Lords amendment, but those e-mails seem to
have been based on a misunderstanding or a misapprehension, based on
misinformation. That has been either wilful or accidental, but it is
certainly there. They start by saying that, although the Government
said that they would be the greenest ever, we are now burning more coal
than we have done for many years. Those two statements need to be
examined.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120494000284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000284">This
Government are the greenest ever. We have seen an increase in
renewables generation from 5% in 2010 to 16% now. We have seen the
biggest investment in nuclear power for a generation, and we hope to
see more coming through. We have also seen an added impetus being given
to the renewable heat incentive today. All those factors demonstrate
our direction of travel.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120494000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000285">The
suggestion that the Government have somehow been promoting an increased
use of coal is fundamentally wrong. We are using more coal than we were
just a short time ago. I looked at the figures just before the debate:
39% of the electricity being used in the UK as we sit here today comes
from coal. That equates to 18 GW of the 46 GW. That is happening for
two reasons. First, the price of coal is historically low compared with
that of gas. The shale gas revolution in the United States has meant
that the coal that used to go into the US market is now being deposited
in the European market at a low price and people are therefore burning
it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120494000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000286">Secondly, the
owners of the coal-fired plants know that they have only a limited
number of operating hours left, and they want to use them while the
carbon floor price is lower, rather than as it continues to rise.
People should not see this as a fundamental shift to coal; it is a
short-term increase in its use and, as we have heard, those plants will
be closing down in the near future. Some are closing this year, and
more will close throughout the decade. The concern expressed in those
e-mails by those who support the amendment has therefore been based on
a misunderstanding.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120494000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000287">I am
concerned about the implications of the amendment for several reasons.
The first relates to political risk. This is another measure that would
increase the political risk attached to investment in the energy
sector. We know that we need many tens of billions of pounds of new
investment in the energy sector, right across the electricity spectrum.
The people who own the plant that would be closed down by the proposal
are the same people who we are asking to build new gas plant, new CCS
plant and new renewables plant. If they see the UK becoming more
unpredictable, that will make it harder to secure the levels of
investment that we need. We must be wary of going down that route and
adding further political risk to the issue.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=957?><hs_Para UID="13120494000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000288">My second
concern relates to the coal industry in the United Kingdom. When I was
a Minister, I tried hard to increase the proportion in the mix of coal
from UK mines. It had been one third, and we got it up to over a half.
I suspect that it is now below one third again, and probably falling.
If we want to achieve the necessary investment in British mines to
enable them to provide coal to the power stations—or indeed to
ensure their existence at all—when CCS plant comes on line in
due course, the investors will need to know that there is still a
reason for them to invest in the sector. The Lords amendment would make
it more difficult to secure that investment and therefore more likely
that our own deep and shallow coal mining facilities would close down,
which is something we would regret. We should not deliberately put
ourselves in the position of being more dependent on imports than we
need to be.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120494000289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000289">My final
point relates to CCS. We are trying to send a message to people around
the world that this country has the aspiration to lead the world into
carbon capture and storage, and we have every reason to be positive and
confident that we can do that. We have the expertise, and we have the
depleted oil and gas reserves in the North sea that can be used for it.
We should be going out and saying to all those people around the world
who are interested in this technology that the United Kingdom is the
place to do it.</hs_Para>

disagree with the hon. Member for Southampton, Test (Dr Whitehead) in
that I do not think that the amendment would make investment in CCS
more likely. I think that it would make it much less likely, because we
would be seen as having a general hostility towards coal in the mix and
we would therefore struggle to make the case for that investment. Given
the challenges that we are facing, do we really want to link ourselves
to a policy that would bring forward the closure of plant while doing
nothing to speed up the opening of new plant? The amendment would be
bound to enhance the energy security challenges facing this country,
which would make it more difficult to decarbonise. That, in turn, would
push up prices. For those reasons, I hope that the House will reject
the Lords amendment.</hs_Para>

if we vote today to put common sense and climate science above the
special pleading of the coal lobby, the EPS will not be strong enough.
The Energy and Climate Change Committee has called the EPS “at
best pointless” and the Committee on Climate Change warns that
allowing unabated gas-fired generation right through to 2045 carries a
huge risk that there will be far too much gas at the expense of
low-carbon investment, which would bulldoze the Government’s
climate objectives. It is therefore a shame that the Lords amendment
does not go further and that the official Opposition are not yet
accepting the need to leave existing coal reserves in the ground,
unlike their sister parties in places such as Norway, whose Labour
party this month proposed banning the country’s $800 billion
sovereign wealth fund from coal investments. I have some reservations
about the level of the EPS, but none the less I firmly support the
amendment as a step in the right direction.</hs_Para>

honest and equitable approach to the UK’s climate commitments

that my hon. Friend said. He gave the impression that although he
thought that the late Baroness Thatcher’s energy reforms, which
were very radical, were broadly good, they created a problem in not
leading to substantial investment. As the person who advised her on
those reforms and worked with the very good energy Ministers at that
time, I assure him that that system not only transformed our energy mix
in a way that cut CO<Sub>2 </Sub>on a scale that even the hon. Member

prices down by encouraging huge investment in the so-called
“dash for gas”. It has been the most successful policy

difficulty people are already finding with their power bills. The main
reason those bills are surging is that we are deliberately changing
over from relatively cheap energy generation to dear energy
generation—that is the whole point of the policy. The policy is
cruelly deciding that it wishes to decarbonise at the expense of the
poor and of our industry. The deindustrialisation facing Britain and
wider Europe is now intense. We are losing our aluminium industry, our
petrochemical industry and many of the high-energy-burning industries,
which, of course, are going to the United States of America or to Asia,

capacity often is not genuine capacity because there is no wind, and
the margin is far smaller. I do not wish to live in a country like

that the lights might go out in places, and where, at times when people
most need heating, there is not enough power left. It is a grave folly
of the European Union and the former Government—I hope our

plants before anybody has built replacement plants. What kind of person

frame the problem. We have 23 GW of coal right now. I think we can all
accept that about 8 GW of that will be turned off because of the large
combustion plant directive, leaving potentially 15 GW subject to the
amendment. I asked the shadow Minister what his figure was and although
it may well turn out to be a little lower than that, it is of that
order. We are talking about a huge amount of power to be replaced, yet
we are doing this at the same time as our nuclear stations are coming
off stream. Let us put this into context. Replacing 15 GW with wind
power, which I guess is the direction that the hon. Member for
Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) would take, would require about
five times as much wind generation as we currently have
commissioned—onshore and offshore—leaving aside the

have a security of supply issue. To be clear, the debate is not about
pollution, nitrous oxide or sulphur dioxide control, or even about the
long-term plan to phase out coal. We intend to be at 3% by 2030. Our
European partners, by contrast, do not have such an ambition. The
debate is not about the Kyoto targets, which we have not met, but about
the need to replace a vast amount of capacity, and to accelerate such
replacement. We are unique in that our nuclear stations and our coal
are so old. We also intend to use more electricity as we decarbonise
the transport sector. If we are to meet the 
<?notus-xml column=961?>climate change budget targets, it will be about not just electricity
generation but transportation. We are talking about more electric cars,
which means yet more electricity. The task is absolutely enormous, and
we are currently sitting here with a capacity surplus of around 4% or
5%. To accelerate that further would be folly.</hs_Para>

a great deal last year. Across the world, they went up by about 30

of coal across the world went up by three times as much to 100 million
barrels of oil equivalent. Such increases are not just happening in
Asia and China. Germany and Holland are moving ahead with brand new
unabated coal power stations that will run for 20 or 30 years. In this
country, we already have among the lowest carbon emissions per head and
per unit of GDP of any EU country. The only major country that performs

reality is that the Opposition are co-operating with the Government
Front Bench and the Liberal Democrats to fix prices for 20 or 30 years
across vast swathes of our electricity generation capacity, and to fix
prices at two or three times the current market price. That will drive
costs

degree. As an economist, I understand that in a competitive market,
which I fear that this increasingly is not, marginal cost tends to
equal price. There is a difference between the gas that is already
there, where the development costs and capital costs are
sunk—which, in terms of marginal costs being set to price,
should be discounted for a rational person in a competitive
market—and new gas, which is not coming on stream. It is partly
not coming 
<?notus-xml column=963?>on stream because the Minister has said, “If you bring it on
stream, we will give you a great subsidy as long as you wait for a few

coming on-stream for that key period of a few years. It is a key
period, because we are looking at an increasing crunch. DECC tells us
that it has run the scenarios with Ofgem and has considered what will
happen if the demand for electricity is a little greater than assumed.
DECC assumes that energy demand will fall and so, to cover sensitivity,
it has run a scenario in which it does not fall. All that does,
however, is keep demand flat. What happens if—due to the success
of the policies of this coalition, what the Chancellor is doing and the
resurgence of growth in the British economy—energy demand
increases? I dread to think, because of the lack of preparations that
have been made—or, when preparations are being made, because of
their extraordinary expensiveness. At the same time, we are proposing
to cut the coal-fired plants, many of which are completely depreciated

under that directive, but the plants are still there and could
potentially be brought back on stream to generate cheap and reliable
electricity for our constituents. However, the Opposition will not let
them. Government Members will not let them, either. Not even the
European Union will, even though the directive contains article 3(4),

as I said, this is a judgment. Is it right now to accelerate the
closure of coal and to force all coal off the system by 2025? In my
view, that will add to the risks to security of supply and—I
must say this to my hon. Friends on the Liberal Democrat
Benches—will certainly add to the costs for our constituents. We
estimate that if coal disappears by 2025, there will be an
increase in domestic bills of about 3% to 4%, or about £22 to
£28, and an increase in non-domestic bills of between
4% and 6%. A large number of Members from all parties
attended the debate in Westminster Hall this morning and complained
about 
<?notus-xml column=965?>the costs being imposed on energy-intensive industries, and we estimate
that their costs will increase by between 5% and 7%.</hs_Para>

Government have also been briefing about the sale of significant public
sector assets. The list of things that might be sold includes Eurostar,
the Royal Mint and Channel 4, and yet the Government have not produced
a document. Is that in order? Could you advise us, Madam Deputy

first set, amendments 1 to 15 and amendment 90, extend the
decarbonisation provisions to Northern Ireland in order that any
decarbonisation target range would cover the whole of the UK power

seek the agreement of the Northern Ireland Executive before making
these amendments. The Assembly has since passed a legislative consent

substantive change, Lords amendment 25, gives the Secretary of State
the power to issue and revise standard terms for contracts for
difference. Lords amendment 27 provides for the Secretary of State to
set out how the system operator will run the allocation process,
particularly through an allocation framework. Lords amendment 29 gives
the CFD counterparty the power to agree minor and necessary
modifications to the standard terms prior to contract signature. Those
three new clauses provide clarity on how the contracts for difference
will operate. In doing so, they ensure that appropriate flexibilities
are in place to manage CFDs for the years to come at least cost to
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000917" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000917">Several

amendments 50 to 53 relate to the important matter of access to market
for independent renewable generators. They allow the Secretary of State
to establish a scheme to promote the availability of power purchase
agreements, which could provide generators with access to an off-taker
of last resort. That mechanism aims to benefit both investors and
independent renewable generators by providing a guaranteed backstop
route to market at a specified price, and is intended to enable
independent generators to use a wider range of possible off-takers and
to contract for shorter-term PPAs. We expect it to result in greater
competition among PPA providers and to support smaller suppliers, as
generators will not have to rely on large incumbents with strong credit
ratings to sell their power in the market. Ultimately, the off-taker of
last resort aims to help level the playing field, bringing more
competition and innovation into both the generation and off-taker
markets. The Government are committed to consulting on the introduction
of the mechanism and, subject to that, we intend the scheme to be in
place by the time the first CFDs are
signed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000921" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000921">Lords
amendments 54, 58, 91, 92, 94 and 97 provide the Government with the
power to close the renewables obligation to new capacity in Great

the planned renewables obligation closure will take place consistently

amendments 55 to 57 remove the power for regular reviews of support

earlier, fossil fuel plants with a complete system for carbon capture
and storage will be exempt from the emissions performance standard for
three years, starting from the point at which a project is brought into
operation. The matter was raised early in the Bill’s passage

part 3 of the Bill on nuclear regulation, Lords amendments 64 and 65
respond to a suggestion from the other place to define
“associated sites”. Lords amendments 66 to 72 are in
response to recommendations from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee, and provide greater parliamentary oversight. The
remaining amendments to this part—Lords amendments 73 to 75 and

amendments 76 to 86 relate to the important matter of domestic tariffs
and the need to ensure that consumers are put on the cheapest tariff
that suits their preferences. The amendments make it clear that the
information that suppliers will be required to include on bills must be
clear and easily understood. They make the order-making power in clause
127 subject to the negative resolution procedure. They also give the
Secretary of State the power to require energy suppliers to provide a

(a) to Lords amendment 76, which was tabled by the hon. Member for
Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), would give the Secretary of State
the power to require suppliers to supply customers with a breakdown of
their fuel mix for electricity generation, and to provide details of
the corporation tax that they have paid relative to their profits. On
the first of those suggestions, I hope that she will be pleased to hear
that suppliers are already required, through their licence conditions,
to provide their customers with a fuel mix disclosure that sets out the
sources from which the electricity that they supply has been generated
and the environmental impact of generating electricity from those
sources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000927" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000927">On
the corporation tax proposal, the level of corporation tax that is
payable by a supplier is not directly related to the volume or price of
the electricity and gas that are supplied. It will be affected by other
things, such as the treatment of any tax losses that are carried
forward from earlier periods, group tax arrangements and group funding
structures. Attempts to link the corporation tax that is payable in a
certain period with energy bills are therefore likely to be misleading.

the Bill of those three new areas in the other place. We are committed
to tackling fuel poverty. Lords amendments 87, 93 and 95 amend the Warm
Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000. Under those amendments, we will
put in place a new statutory target for tackling fuel poverty in
England. That target will be supported by a new strategy that is
informed by the improved definition of fuel poverty that we are
adopting, which was proposed by Professor Hills in his independent
review of fuel
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494000930" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0002.htm#13120494000930">That

amendments, and those tabled by other hon. Members, seek to put some
detail into that strategy and make the commitment for which we are

the House on amendment (g) to Lords amendment 87. Like my noble Friends
in the other place, I agree that it is vital that the Bill contains a
commitment for a fuel poverty strategy that is effective and can be
used to hold the Government to account for their success or failure in
pursuing it. Fuel poverty is a serious problem in this country and
something on which we must improve. I am sure that the whole House was

Government have serious questions to answer about the implications of

poverty-related components of ECO—the community obligation and
the home heating cost reduction obligation—had not been reduced.
However, many Members will be aware that most of the larger-scale
retrofits that have been carried out in their own constituencies under
ECO, whether by local authorities or registered social landlords, have
been schemes that contributed towards the third strand of ECO, which
has been substantially reduced—the carbon emissions reduction
obligation, or CERO—because the other components of ECO allow
much easier and cheaper measures to be installed. By reducing CERO, the
big local area-based schemes, mainly in the poorer parts of the
country, will be reduced.</hs_Para>

targets. The industry believes that the 100,000 minimum installations
that have been specified for solid-wall measures up to 2017 will now in

also thank my hon. Friend for highlighting the health impact of fuel
poverty. That is addressed in his amendment (e), which I and my
Front-Bench colleagues have also signed. As I have previously
mentioned, there were more than 31,000 excess winter deaths in England

classed as living in fuel-poor households are likely to suffer from
heart problems, strokes, mobility issues and poorer mental health,
including severe depression. There is also a social cost: for example,
children in fuel-poor households often perform worse at school, and
there is a marked increase in a child’s performance once they
are taken out of fuel poverty. The stress faced by people managing
household bills on a stretched 
<?notus-xml column=977?>budget should not be underestimated. We should all recognise that there
could be significant health benefits from an ambitious fuel poverty

way that we can make a difference in addressing fuel poverty is by
having a programme that is ambitious in its aims and clear in its
target for improving energy efficiency. Amendment (g) will ensure that
this Government and any future Government cannot side-step their

Government will support us on that. If they do not, I will seek to

to say a few words about my amendment (a) to Lords amendment 76, which
concerns the information that energy companies provide to their

would make some modest additions to that welcome proposed increase in
transparency. First, in relation to profits, it would allow customers
to see how much UK corporation tax their energy supplier has paid in
the past three years as a total and, crucially, as a proportion of its
profits. The Minister said that that was not necessarily fair because
there was not a direct correlation between corporation tax paid and
overall turnover, but none the less it would be useful for people to
have that figure when deciding to switch between energy
companies.</hs_Para>

Government make big play about the importance of information to
enabling customers to switch and use their power of choice. If they are
to have that power of choice, they need information, and I think that
this would be a useful and easily accessible piece of information for
them to have. Earlier this year, the Energy and Climate Change
Committee uncovered the disturbing reality that some of the big six
were paying little or no corporation tax at all, despite making major
profits, and other hon. Members on both sides of the House have made

redundant, but there is no point hiding away this

bottom line is that people want information. They are being encouraged
to switch between energy suppliers, but to do that they need

only are the Government failing, but in my view their response has been
pretty shameful. They have changed the definition of fuel poverty,

Conservative Government used to fiddle with the unemployment statistics
in order to reduce the numbers. The Government have cut the funding to
tackle fuel poverty and capitulated to the big six energy companies.
There will be no energy price freeze under this Government, just
£50 back, so energy bills will go up for everybody across the
country—just not by as much as they might have otherwise. It is
a bit like stealing someone’s shoes, giving them back the laces
and then telling them to rejoice. On top of that, this Government have
scrapped the Warm Front scheme, cut the winter fuel payment and mangled
the energy company obligation.</hs_Para>

Bill as it stands, without a clear and unambiguous commitment to
eradicate fuel poverty, is a bit like passing a death sentence on
thousands of people who are living in cold homes across our country.
That is why I tabled the amendments that are before us: it is essential
that we set meaningful targets for 2020 and 2030. I know it is a lot of
money—bringing the housing stock up to energy performance
certificate band B by 2030 for all low-income households is estimated
to cost £47 billion—but the money, or a large proportion
of it, is there. For example, something over £1 billion in the
energy company obligation could be used for that purpose. Simply
refocusing that ECO money would remove 70% of the fuel-poor from fuel
poverty by 2020; I therefore think that should be done.</hs_Para>

to be another £1 billion or so. It would be very sensible to
reduce the costs on the national health and to allow that money to be
refocused on paying for the required investment in tackling fuel
poverty. If we can reduce the demand for energy, that could also reduce
the cost of upgrading our energy infrastructure. We know already that
£100 billion is being talked about to subsidise new nuclear
energy in this country. We would not have to spend quite as much if we
could manage down the demand for energy. There is also around £4
billion in carbon taxes that could be focused on tackling fuel
poverty.</hs_Para>

legal obligations, as set out in the Climate Change Act 2008. If we are
serious about delivering on those obligations, it seems pretty clear

of the amendment, as the Minister briefly told us, is to close the
renewables obligation throughout Great Britain. That is important,

of the renewables obligation and, in particular, the time scale were
debated at some length in Committee, and I do not intend to repeat all
that was said at that stage. However, the Minister said that the
Scottish Government had full knowledge of the date when the Government
intended to close the renewables obligation. I am sure that that is
true, but the Government did not have the power to force the closure in
Scotland, because it was a power that lay with the Scottish Government.

remove a power from the Scottish
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001001" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001001">Successive
Scottish Governments have used their devolved powers to advance
renewables generation across Scotland, and the removal of that
discretion has caused concern, particularly as there has been no prior
consultation with the Scottish Government about its removal or about
the introduction of this provision, especially at a time when the
Scottish Government are conducting a live consultation on the closure
of the renewables obligation. The Scottish Government have also used
the renewables obligation to provide greater support for hydro schemes
and higher renewables obligation certificate bands for floating
offshore wind turbines.</hs_Para>

recognise that the Secretary of State has today published more details
of the contract for difference strike prices, which include greater
support for hydro and increased strike prices for offshore wind. That
is welcome, but it is unclear whether there will be increased support
for floating offshore wind in particular. Will the Minister clarify
that point? I also note that the Minister has proposed a consultation
on the renewables obligation grace periods, but it seems to propose
only limited grace periods. This is particularly important in the
Scottish context in relation to floating wind turbines. They are
important in the Scottish sector because they operate in much deeper
waters than the traditional offshore turbines that are fixed to the sea
bed. There is a strong possibility that it will be necessary do this
differently in regard to the RO grace periods, but all those powers
have been taken away.</hs_Para>

striking that when the matter was previously discussed, this Government
said that no new law was needed to close the renewables obligation.
Suddenly, however, when the Bill got to the House of Lords, it was
decided that it was necessary. Call me a cynic, but it seems to me that
the Government, having found out that they could not implement this
measure because the power already lay with the Scottish Government,
have slipped this provision in through the other place. That is
unacceptable. They are taking away a power that the Scottish Parliament
and Government had, and they are doing it by the back door. We had not
even discussed it in this House; it has been proposed in the other
place. I oppose Lords amendment 54, and given the chance, I would like

Walley</B> (Stoke-on-Trent North) (Lab):</Member> I want to try to put
this matter into context. In my constituency, 6,110 households are in
fuel poverty. The Lords amendment  
<?notus-xml column=983?>would drastically change the definition of fuel poverty. At the moment,
about 3.2 million people are classified as being in fuel poverty, but
that figure would go down to about 2.7 million under the new
definition. There is real concern about the proposed change. I am also
concerned about the change in the Government’s ambition, which
was previously to eradicate fuel poverty and now appears to be merely
to address it. That is no longer a strong commitment. The Minister will
have to do an enormous amount if he is to convince the House that fuel
poverty is really going to be addressed.</hs_Para>

cross-cutting issue. It is not just about what is going on in the
Department of Energy and Climate Change; it is also about the cost to
the health service and the implications for skills and employment.
There are now 7,000 fewer people in the construction industry working
on insulation than there were in December 2012 and, in a double whammy,
we have had the announcement this week that the energy company
obligation is to be cut back. There are households that desperately
need investment in their insulation, but that investment is now going
to be cut back. To make matters worse, the goalposts have been moved
and, instead of having to complete 100,000 measures in one year, that
work can now be completed in four years. Connecting all that together,
we can see that there will be huge reductions, making it more difficult
to address fuel poverty precisely when we should be stepping up the

<?notus-xml column=984?>for cooking the supper. I will have some vegetables, which will also be
ready to address the strategy of cooking the supper.” She would
probably conclude that we would be having a takeaway this evening. That
shows the central problem with Lords amendment 87: it would
not ensure, whether in relation to the previous definition
or the Hills definition of fuel poverty, that there will be
a strategy in the future to bring about changes that move towards the
eradication of fuel poverty.</hs_Para>

amendments to the Lords amendment 87 would simply replace that lack;
they would put in targets to ensure that we can address the eradication
of fuel poverty through a requirement on Government to act over the
next period, rather than suggesting that they may or may not act,
depending on how they wish to proceed. Let us not forget that this
Bill, when enacted, will bind not only this Government, whatever their
intentions, but future Governments on what they need to do about fuel
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001012">One
central point about the amendments to Lords amendment 87 is that they
make an explicit link between the imperative of moving forward on
energy efficiency and the imperative to eradicate fuel poverty. We know
that through radical measures to improve the energy efficiency of our
homes, we undertake radical measures to eradicate fuel poverty, because
of the congruence between people living in fuel poverty and people
living in the least insulated homes in our country. It is a singular
fact that the price of energy in this country is by no means the
highest in Europe, but the bills we pay are among the highest in
Europe, simply because of the overall energy inefficiency of our homes.
Setting targets and underpinning them with an explicit assault on fuel
poverty over the period is a win-win in terms of the move towards
greater energy efficiency in our homes, the investment that that
requires and the attack on fuel poverty that results.</hs_Para>

Government are, as they state, serious about continuing to make an
assault on fuel poverty, they have to do better than simply produce
amendments that talk about “addressing” a position. The
amendments to the Lords amendment seek to do better, and I hope that
the House will support them this afternoon.</hs_Para>

me come briefly to the heart of the issue and the problem with
amendment (g). It calls again for the eradication of fuel poverty and
the independent review by Professor Hills made it clear that
eradication is no longer the right approach. By focusing on energy
efficiency, which is what we intend the target to do, we can make a

across the House is exactly the same. We want to reduce the extent to
which people are suffering the problem of fuel poverty. The new
definition is relative. The number of households in fuel poverty is
unlikely to change significantly from year to year although the depth
of the problem, as measured by the fuel poverty gap, will. We agree
with Professor Hills that this is the right way to measure the problem
and a more accurate one. As standards improve, a relative measure will
also ensure that the fuel poor are not left behind. Given that, we
think the best way to make progress is to improve the energy efficiency
of people’s homes, as that will make a lasting difference to
those struggling with their energy bills. We have therefore suggested
that the target should be set on that basis. A reduction in the number
of persons implies an absolute definition, which is not what we have
proposed. However, we will continue to publish numbers setting out the
headcount and the depth of the problem as well as progress against the
target in our annual fuel poverty statistics report. For those reasons,
if the Opposition choose to press amendment (g) to a vote, I urge the

the challengers of tired orthodoxies and the drivers of social
mobility, small businesses share one nation Labour’s values
completely. In fact, we could say that small businesses and one nation
Labour share the same DNA. That is why my right hon. Friend the Leader
of the Opposition said that one nation Labour would be the party of
enterprise and small business when he became party leader back in 2010.
Just as there is a lineage from owners of small businesses through to
one nation Labour, the Conservative party, the party of old money and
vested interests—it has an average age of 67, I am
told—is inextricably linked to the defenders of the status quo.
That is why Labour has led the running on the No. 1 cost of doing
business issue, business rates, and why we have brought forward this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001609" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001609">Today
is not the first time that Government policy has suddenly changed in
the run-up to a Labour party Opposition day debate. Let us be
honest—barely a day goes by when this Government’s policy
does not change. The Chancellor’s pre-announcement today that
business rates would go up by only 2% this year will be met with a
mirthless smile by the thousands of small firms that told the Forum of
Private Business, among others, that business rates is the No. 1 cost
of doing business
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001610" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001610">A
measure of how detached the Government have become from the realities
faced by businesses away from the City is that after three and a half
years of small business rate relief, which is a valuable support for
the very smallest, and with business rates still the No. 1
issue—13% of all firms say that the tax they pay on their
business premises is greater than the rent, and many more find that it
is pretty much the same—they announce that they are locking in
that unfairness by capping rates at 2%. It is absolutely pathetic. Only
the Government, who tried to sell an extra £70 on
people’s energy bills as a cut, could think that a 2% rise in
business rates is a cause for celebration—they could not be more
out of touch.</hs_Para>

Government’s policies seem to be dreamed up at a moment’s
notice, but the announcement on business rates comes 71 days after my
right hon. Friend announced the action that Labour will take on
business rates. It is not even a rapid rebuttal. After all the

more, and their shops are a vital part of towns and villages in every

average earnings last year equated to less than the minimum wage, yet
the average store has a rateable value of £14,000. So go and

policy also contravened the Treasury’s own guidance on

reams of complex paperwork every year. In 2009, Labour Ministers
blocked a Conservative-supported private Member’s Bill from the
hon. Member for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff) that would have
simplified the relief. This Government have changed that—the
Localism Act 2011 made it far easier to claim—but we have gone
further: with central Government funding, we have doubled business rate

Clive Betts</B> (Sheffield South East) (Lab):</Member> This is an
important debate because business rates are clearly an important
cost—and a rising percentage cost—for 
<?notus-xml column=1009?>many businesses, particularly small businesses, in the country. Business
rates have gone up faster than turnover during times of economic
difficulty. They are important for local councils because they comprise
more than 50% of their revenue. If the Minister had until the end of
the debate to explain the whole system to us, he would still need more
time for the details. There is the retention of rates by local
authorities, the provision of resources to the Exchequer which are then
redistributed to local authorities, the set aside that the Treasury can
keep, and the safety nets and the levies that go on to authorities that
are in different positions. It is an incredibly complicated
system.</hs_Para>

thing that the Minister mentioned is a review of the appeal system. It
is completely unacceptable that it can take up to 18 months or longer
for appeals to be held. First, for the businesses themselves, they do
not know how they will be placed when they are waiting for their appeal
to be determined. Secondly, for the local authorities, an appeal casts
doubts over their income stream. One thing the Minister could do before
the review is announced and then carried out is to ensure that next
year the element of hold-back for local authorities is removed.
Ministers could take on board any uncertainties about the valuations
and how they will work out through the appeal system, rather than
leaving the problem for the local authorities to
bear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001748" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001748"><Member ContinuationText="Andy Sawford" PimsId="6000" UID="13120494003311" xid="1241" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494003311"><B>Andy

to look at the way in which valuations are carried out. The Local

support it. It should form part of a wider review of local government
finance, and the Select Committee, which I chair, will now be carrying
out a review of fiscal devolution to cities on the back of the London
Finance Commission, which the Mayor of London has commissioned and
which Labour and Tory London boroughs and the core cities have
supported. I will not come to a view about whether its proposals are
right, but it is interesting that there is now a call for a wider look

which it can be devolved down to local
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001751" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001751">Were
the Chancellor to make any changes tomorrow to business rates for next
year—and we hope there will not be a commitment to increase
business rates by RPI, as has been the case for the past few
years—any reduction must not come at the expense of local
councils, which are very hard pressed at this time of austerity and
restraint on their spending. Any commitment must be made clear. We need
to know the impact of lower business rates not just on councils as a
whole but on each individual council in the country— I ask the 
<?notus-xml column=1010?>Minister to put the details in the Library—once the levies and
safety nets are taken into account. That must be made explicitly clear

benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001752" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001752">Business
rates are a real problem for firms up and down the country. The
percentage of their turnover paid in business rates has increased, and
that is putting real pressure on small businesses in particular. If the
Government recognise that, and recognise the need for action, why are
they so mealy-mouthed as to say, “No increase in line with
RPI—we will simply reduce that increase to 2%”? If there
is a problem, which the Chancellor might recognise tomorrow, why not go
that bit further and at least freeze business rates or, even better,
take up the suggestion of my hon. Friend the Member for Chesterfield
(Toby Perkins) and cut them? If there is a problem, why not address it
properly? If there is not, why go for a 2% increase? The Government
have a fundamental question to answer on this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001753" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001753">The
Government must also deal with the disproportionate impact of business
rate increases. Firms in different parts of the country are suffering
in different ways. In parts of the country where demand has not
recovered, where growth has not increased and where there is poverty

have addressed precisely that.</hs_Para>

areas are doing better than others. The areas that are doing less well
have businesses that are struggling and that is why revaluation would
have been
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001756" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001756">The
Minister says that a revaluation would somehow affect businesses
adversely. No, it would not. A revaluation should be a zero-sum game as
far as businesses are concerned. The Minister said that there was no
benefit to the Treasury. Every previous revaluation has had dampening
put in to protect firms that are likely to see a significant increase
in their rates. There has always been a net cost to the Treasury as a
result of any revaluation, particularly when there are big
changes—as there could well have been if a revaluation had been
carried out. The cost of any revaluation would have been borne not by
businesses but by the Treasury, and I suggest that that is why the
Government did not go ahead with it in the end. It was another stealth
saving by the Chancellor to try to ensure that they did not have to put
in the costs of protecting firms from large increases. At the same
time, of course, he has caused additional costs for firms that are
struggling in the less prosperous parts of the country, which has been
the real disadvantage of not going ahead with
revaluation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001757" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001757">I
will also be critical of the previous Labour Government, who did not go
ahead with a revaluation of council tax. In the longer term, delaying
valuations has had major disbenefits. There might be short-term
advantages, as it does not cause problems for the Government in
explaining to some people why their taxes have gone up, but in the
medium and longer term it is always a disaster to put off revaluations,
because when they are eventually handled they become even larger, more
difficult to deal with and more difficult to explain. That is the
simple reality.</hs_Para>

thinking about the retail sector, we must consider the greater benefits
that the postponement of revaluation allows for out-of-town shopping
centres. When we consider revaluation and the whole system in future,
we must consider the fact that the value of rates for out-of-town
shopping centres, compared with those for smaller shops in the high
street, is not fair at all. Were we to have a revaluation now, I would
suggest that we took account of the fact that an increase in empty
properties on the high street would likely see the valuation of shops
there go down. If the planning system works as the Government intend
and we have a town and city centre-first policy, the constraint on
future out-of-town developments should put a premium on the existing
developments and cause a relative increase in the rateable value of
such properties. Postponing the revaluation has had a disadvantage for
the high street and an advantage for out-of-town centres, and we should
take account of
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001759" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001759">There

business. The Chancellor, in particular, has done his bit. With the cut
to 20p, we now have the most competitive rate of corporation tax in the
whole G20. Also, let us not forget that the first £2,000 of an

second point relates to RPI uprating. Last September RPI was running at
3.2%. In Mid Suffolk, where my biggest town is Stowmarket, the full

the average business rate bill after reliefs is £12,865 and a
full-whack increase of 3.2% would jack up business rates by
£411, so we are not talking about inconsequential sums of money.
If we cannot have a 0% increase, I hope that the CBI’s proposal
of 2%, which has been costed at around £327 million, would go

which it currently enjoys, beyond April next year or make it permanent
would cost the business, with the 3.2% increase, an extra

Blenkinsop</B> (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) (Lab):</Member>
I thank my hon. Friends the Member for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins) and
for Sheffield South East (Mr Betts) for their excellent speeches
detailing a lot of the problems that are very familiar in my local
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001771" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001771">Like
many colleagues, I am looking forward to small business Saturday on 7
December, when we will celebrate and support local small businesses on
one of the busiest shopping days of the year. For the rest of the year,
though, many of those businesses will be struggling because of
inflation, with business rates increasing by an average of over
£250 next April and the north-east seeing some of the steepest
hikes outside London and the south-east. The average business rates
bill in the north-east will increase by about £360, on top of an
average increase of £1,500 since the 2010 general election. How
do small businesses cope with these hikes? They face the tough choice
of trying to pass on the increases to customers through higher prices,
adding to the cost of living crisis, or absorbing the cost, squeezing
their 
<?notus-xml column=1013?>finances until they can no longer afford to stay in business. No wonder
our high streets are littered with empty
shops.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120494001772" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001772">I would like
to put on record my thanks to Redcar and Cleveland borough council,
which bent over backwards in relation to the new SSI steelworks in
Redcar. The council was owed to the tune of £20 million in rates
and gave the company a lot of slack to make sure that we could keep
steel production in Teesside—something very close to my heart.
Having heard about that today, we also heard about job losses at the
Lotte chemical site. In summer 2009, the former Labour Government,
alongside One North East, the regional development agency, took the
former company out of a position of administration and got a south
Korean company called Lotte to come in and purchase it, and it got the
polyethylene plant running again in April 2010. There are good examples
from the past for the Government to look at, irrespective of which
party was in power.</hs_Para>

factor in my constituency—I raised this in a debate last week
and the week before that—is female unemployment. Long-term
female unemployment has risen by 144%, and that is having massive
consequences on the high street. One element is weekly wages. Female
average gross weekly earnings are down by £12.30 a week since
the last general election, and that will have frightening effects on
small
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001774" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001774"><B><Member ContinuationText="Alison McGovern" PimsId="5702" UID="13120494003318" xid="1170" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494003318">Alison
McGovern:</Member></B> Does my hon. Friend agree that those statistics
are all the more concerning when we consider that food price inflation
has gone up by 18% since the
crash?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001775" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001775"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tom Blenkinsop" PimsId="5585" UID="13120494003319" xid="1125" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494003319">Tom
Blenkinsop:</Member></B> I keep coming back to that point time and
again. This is not just about incomes but the availability of jobs and
their levels of pay. As my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield South
East detailed, the number of jobs for women is limited, and that is
particularly so in the north-east. In my area, the public sector, which
was a large employer of females, has been haemorrhaging jobs, and 16%
or 17% of workers are care workers, many of whom are women on
zero-hours contracts. This has an effect on small businesses further
down the supply line.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120494001776" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001776">Every penny
counts for smaller businesses who are constantly watching the bottom
line, but when the worst comes to the worst—when a business is
forced to close its doors for the last time—that leads directly
to a decline in employment. Tackling soaring business rates would limit
the number of shops closing, and this in turn would help to prevent
unemployment rising. This Government set the business rates that so
many are struggling with. At a time when the Government should be
backing small business, they appear once again to be on the wrong side.
Large companies will have already had about £10 billion in tax
cuts by 2015. It is right that we should have a globally competitive
corporation tax rate, and we have supported those tax cuts, but the
next priority should be cutting business rates, supporting small and
medium-sized businesses, and relieving the pressure on our high
streets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001777" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001777">Small
businesses are integral and, in many cases, long-standing institutions
within our communities, but business rates keep going up and up. Our
high streets and town centres need a blend of independent shops
alongside bigger well-known retail stores. That mix is really important
for a vibrant and thriving local economy.</hs_Para>

Tomlinson</B> (North Swindon) (Con):</Member> I completely agree about
the importance of the high street. I am proud to be vice-chair of the
all-party town centre group and the all-party retail group. One of the
other big threats is internet sales—for example, an internet
sports store may undercut traditional independent sports stores. What
would the hon. Gentleman do in the business rates system to protect
those
outlets?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001779" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001779"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tom Blenkinsop" PimsId="5585" UID="13120494003321" xid="1125" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494003321">Tom
Blenkinsop:</Member></B> In my area, going back to pre-1997 when the
Major Government established the Teesside Development Corporation, we
saw the birth of out-of-town shopping developments, which had a far
more profound effect on creating new shopping habits in, for example,
Stockton high street in my home town of Middlesbrough and in the market
towns of east Cleveland. I take on board the hon. Gentleman’s
comments: the situation is difficult. We need small businesses to
absorb that new internet market, and rural broadband and other new,
inventive technologies will be important for them in doing
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001780" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001780">This
month the Forum of Private Business conducted a survey of its members
on the cost of doing business, and the No. 1 demand of small firms was
action to tackle the rising cost of business rates. Understandably, I
am proud that my party is taking the lead where this Government are
failing and that it is standing up for small business owners by
announcing a cut in rates in 2015 and a freeze in 2016. That action
could save small businesses such as pubs, shops and start-ups an
average of nearly £450 over two years, while some firms could
save
£2,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001781" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001781">It
is worth reminding Government Members that VAT was a Tory invention and
that every time a Tory Government come into power they increase it,
while Labour never increases it, but decreases it. Air passenger duty
is another Tory indirect tax, as is the fuel duty escalator of John
Major’s Government. I repeat what I said last week: the
Conservative party has an addiction to keep increasing indirect
taxation on the individual and on
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001782" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001782">Unfortunately,
2015 will be too late for some businesses. The Government need to take
action now, and tomorrow’s autumn statement seems the perfect
opportunity to do so. Now more than ever small firms need our support.
High streets are suffering due to pressure from high energy bills,
rising business rates and a lack of bank lending. To get our economy
growing at a respectable rate, we must support small businesses that
have so much potential to deliver the jobs we need not only in the
future, but right now in my constituency and high streets and town
centres across the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13120494001853" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001853">6.21

Griffiths</B> (Burton) (Con):</Member> It probably will not surprise
you to know, Madam Deputy Speaker, that I rise to talk about a specific
type of small business, namely the pub. As chairman of the all-party
beer group it is, of course, my role to promote and support the needs
and aims of our brewing and pub industries. I think we all recognise
that 80% of pubs in our constituencies are small businesses. On
average, they employ 16 people. They are the lifeblood of our
community—we meet there to socialise, have fun and hold public
meetings—but they are also important drivers of the economy
locally. They are important businesses in our communities.</hs_Para>

the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my
hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis) is present,
because he is both the pubs Minister and the Minister for the high
street. I think that few in this House have done more than him to stand
up for and represent our pubs and to understand the issues that affect
them. He has been a fantastic advocate for the industry in other
Departments. I think that this is the most pub-friendly Government for
many years, but there is more to do, because our pubs, as small
businesses, are
struggling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001785" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001785">Pubs
are important not just for our communities, but for our high streets,
which are changing and adapting. I think the Minister could do three
things to support and help these vital small businesses in our
communities. Something we could all do for small business Saturday is
support a small business by having a pint of British beer in our local
pubs in our
constituencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001786" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001786"><B><Member ContinuationText="Yasmin Qureshi" PimsId="5523" UID="13120494003323" xid="1016" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494003323">Yasmin

first thing the Minister could do relates to small business rate
relief, which my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St Edmunds (Mr
Ruffley) has spoken about. Small business rate relief was introduced in
2005 and is hugely important for pubs. It is a very good thing and was
extended to 2013-14 by the Chancellor in the 2012 autumn statement. It
offers 100% relief for small businesses and is worth £1,000 a
year to pubs. For pubs that are struggling and trying to cope with
changes in the economy, £1,000 a year is hugely important.
Sixteen thousand pubs across the country benefit from small business
rate relief and that is worth £27 million to the industry in
total. The Minister could pick up the telephone to the Chancellor this
evening to ensure that he listens not only to me but to all the hon.
Members who have signed early-day motion 599. Let us extend small
business rate relief for pubs in our constituencies to 2015, or
permanently, as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St Edmunds has
suggested.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001789" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001789">My
second point is about discretionary rate relief. As the Minister will
know, local authorities can offer it in relation to assets of community
value, a fantastic thing brought in by this Government. Assisted by
changes that came in earlier this year, local authorities can claim 50%
of the discount back through the Treasury and the Department for
Communities and Local Government. Will he do all he can to ensure that
local authorities across the country take advantage of the scheme by
offering it to their small businesses and helping pubs in their areas?
I urge all right hon. and hon. Members to talk to their local authority
about implementing the
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001790" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001790">My
final point is about flexibility in relation to business rates. For
commercial premises, business rates are assessed on square meterage,
but for pubs, they are determined on turnover. Under previous
legislation, if a pub’s turnover changed
materially—“materially” is the important
word—a concession could be offered. I urge the Minister to
consider reintroducing such a provision to offer some relief to pubs
that have a big change in turnover for the
worse.</hs_Para>

Perkins:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making an important point
about the significance of business rates for pubs. I am sure that he
knows this from his perspective, but will he give us an idea of how
many pubs have a rateable value of more than £50,000? I would
think that there are very few, so virtually every pub would be able to
drink to Labour’s business rate cut for all businesses below
that £50,000 level. Will he support that policy for the sake of
British pubs?</hs_Para>

point. I also agree with those made by the hon. Member for Sheffield
South East (Mr Betts) and, interestingly, by the hon. Member for Corby

two thirds of pubs have appealed their business rates, and half of
those decisions are still outstanding. Such delays can have a massive
impact on small businesses that are really on a knife edge in terms of
profitability and
sustainability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120494001795" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120494001795">As

in my constituency is the place where I grew up. It is a lovely place.
Last Saturday, we had the Christmas event that is organised by the
Bromborough village community association, which is led by local
traders. Back in 2010, the village was becoming like a ghost town and
shops were shutting left, right and centre. Local traders decided that
up with that they would not put. They came together and worked with
me to reshape the local parking arrangements and to organise
market and community events that would bring life back into the
village. They have been incredibly successful. They pre-empted small
business Saturday by having their event last week. They deserve the
biggest congratulations for what they have
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0003.htm#13120511000014">Heswall

listening to businesses talk about the problems that they have had with
business rates and, more specifically, with appeals. I am interested to

set out. I have made representations before about that process and

de Bois</B> (Enfield North) (Con):</Member> Let me first make it clear
that I believe that the business rates system we have essentially
inherited over the years is fast becoming disproportionate for local
shops and, frankly, it is an unfair tax. We inherited an appalling
deficit, so we have to recognise that there is no easy fix. The
Chancellor 
<?notus-xml column=1021?>will inevitably want his £27 billion raised from business rates.
However, the fact is that it is a property tax on business that is
rightly perceived to be disproportionate for many, delivering no value,
and unfair. Also, businesses cannot negotiate it, unlike just about
everything else which is in their control. Shockingly, our business
rates are a more significant tax on business property than comparable
taxes in other European countries. Indeed, the Office for Budget
Responsibility forecasts that business rates receipts will exceed
council tax and fuel duties receipts in financial years 2014 and
2015.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000043">There
is a strong consensus—even in this House, I suspect—that
the system is no longer fit for purpose, but we are in extremely
difficult times, so there is no pretending there is an easy fix. I
would like to see reforms that would have economic benefits, including
a boost to jobs, which I believe will ultimately drive revenues through
having more profitable businesses. There are serious concerns about the
level of the tax on business, and there is a serious case for a review
of the entire structure. I have lobbied publicly and privately for a
commitment to that review and I think the case is overwhelming. The
present situation means that businesses are at the mercy of an uprating
system that is flawed and, to cut through the politics, the reality is
that this has been going on for a long time. This is not a problem
created by the Government parties.</hs_Para>

to the British Chambers of Commerce, an uprating of 3.2% would drive

Opposition Members have been quoting the British Retail Consortium in
support of their arguments, but they have not mentioned that the BRC
said today that if speculation of a limit to a 2% rise is true, it
would welcome that, as would its members, and that it sees see that as
a clear indication of a direction of travel for business rates. As we
on the Government Benches know, the key for businesses is as much the
direction of travel of a tax—and having a sense of certainty as
to where it is going—as having immediate relief. A real-terms
cut is what will matter.</hs_Para>

seem to be met with universal approval by Opposition Members. I cannot
understand why Opposition Members do not believe that local authorities
should be challenging their expenditure and looking to apply
discretionary relief by any means, supporting any sector of their local
economy that they wish to support at a level that will attract 50%
support from the Government. It is ludicrous that they do not embrace
that and urge their councils to do it. I would welcome an intervention
from anyone on that.</hs_Para>

intervention and for drawing his local council to our attention. My
council has spent £100,000 on conferences and, I understand,
£106,000 on magazines, no doubt to promote a good message. That
£200,000 in Enfield could have been subsidised by another 50%
from the Government. If £100 million in rates and business rates
is collected in our borough, and £3 million of discounts applied
to the retail sector, or specific areas within the retail sector, that
can translate into a significant cut to businesses. The council might
not use those means, because it realises that there is a business
audience scrutinising councils’ spending decisions and wondering
why they do not manage the money they gather from taxpayers as if it
was their own. That is what drives a business. Uncollected council tax
seems to run year on year with no reduction. Enfield council is
averaging nearly £1.5 million each year. Why is no effort made
to improve that and divert those funds to support local businesses? The
answer is that councils do not treat the money like it is their
own.</hs_Para>

That is not a high take-up rate. There is part of me that wonders about
the motivation for councils not doing so: they simply do not want to do
so, which I do not understand; they are unaware of it; or there has not
been sufficient knowledge and lobbying in constituencies to drive it. I
can think of reasons why a council might not want take such action: it
might not want to hold itself up to scrutiny or make a decision that it
feels carries less political weight than supporting its businesses.
However, it is key that MPs take the campaign to the streets to make
councils, of whatever colour or persuasion, implement a plan that can
deliver savings to our businesses. That cannot be done alone.</hs_Para>

rates, important as they are, will not be the only measure to help high

involves parking and encouraging a culture where people support their
local shops and spend a bit of money locally where previously they

and probably one of the most repulsive taxes on business at
the moment is the fixed high charge of business rates, and local
councils could do something about that now.</hs_Para>

They and other businesses, particularly small businesses, suffer from
high levels of business rates. When I travel round my constituency and
meet small businesses, they raise the issue of business rates more than
any other. Small businesses want to see action. The hon. Member for
Enfield North mentioned the 2% freeze and the fact that the BRC and

that, but they see it only as a first step—as something that is

growth in the number of small businesses. We now have 4.9 million
businesses in this country; 40 years ago the figure was only 1 million.
Of those 4.9 million, only 200,000 employ 10 or more people, while the
vast majority employ a small number of people or are sole traders. For
those businesses, a few hundred pounds makes all the difference and is
a huge contribution. We were talking earlier about the difference that
a small amount of money invested by a local authority makes, and the

Anne Main</B> (St Albans) (Con):</Member> I am pleased to be able to
speak in the debate. There are many small businesses in St Albans, and
I think that there is consensus in the House that business rates impose
an onerous task on them in particular. As was pointed out by my hon.
Friend the Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois), they are a tax on
properties, and they are indeed onerous. However, there are many other
strands to the stresses and strains suffered by business, and many of
my local businesses have welcomed the Government’s initiatives

stability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000070">It
is no secret that under the last Government many people running small
businesses—including a number who spoke to me—were unable
to renew their loans or the terms with which they were being presented,
because of the fragility of the banking sector and the economic crisis
into which the country was sinking. Because of the onerous conditions
that were being placed on their loans, they were being forced to lose
members of staff, not to expand, or even to go under.</hs_Para>

the position in the round. Many small businesses were approaching a
tipping point under the last Government because of the crises that they
were being pushed into. We must deal with that now, although nothing
can be fixed overnight. When the Secretary of State for Education came
to St Albans, my local chamber of commerce welcomed, in particular, the
fact that the Government were providing the apprenticeships and
education that most small businesses had been crying out for.</hs_Para>

though Labour’s proposals may be, I do not understand how
robbing Peter to pay Paul can possibly be a good idea. I also notice
the sheer lack of figures. We have been discussing which businesses
would be caught or not caught, supported or not supported, by
Labour’s proposals, but I can inform the House that the average
rateable value of commercial property in St Albans city centre is
£48,811.51, and the average in Hertfordshire as a whole is
£40,216. The city contains very few large premises; the
valuations are high because we have such high property

plea to the Minister. St Albans is not inner London, and many small
businesses there do not benefit from the small business rate relief for
high-value areas. That problem was drawn to my attention a few weeks
ago, long before the debate was scheduled, by Luisa and Oliver Zissman,
who run Dixie’s Cupcakery in St Albans. I think we all agree
that small businesses feel that they are being taxed and are receiving
very little value in return for the business rates that they pay. That
is exactly what Luisa Zissman said, but she also said that if other
measures were introduced, business rates would not be so onerous. Some
businesses, such as Dixie’s Cupcakery, produce a lot of
packaging. Perhaps their recycled rubbish could be included in council
recycling targets, because at present that is just a direct cost to
their business.</hs_Para>

owner of one of the longest street markets in the country—some
say in Europe—which is open on Wednesdays and Saturdays. Since
2010, with the Government’s encouragement, it has frozen council
tax each year. I pay tribute to the leader of the Conservative-led

coffee machines that used to be given to councillors. I urge the
council to go one step further and get rid of the council election
“thirds” that many of the councillors seem to like, thus
saving £90,000 per election. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Enfield North said, if councils made such savings they might have a bit
more money to put towards businesses. However, I pay tribute to my
council for cutting waste and keeping the services in St Albans. If it
is possible for some recycling collections for small businesses to
contribute to local targets so that they can save on overheads and
other costs, so much the better. Our Christmas market—the first
that we have had in St Albans—adds vibrancy to the city centre.
All those things help other small businesses to survive.</hs_Para>

now at its 2008 level. Bank lending for investment is down 32% and the
share of small businesses in business lending is down from 42% to 27%.
That is appalling for small business. Royal Bank of Scotland is the
Government-owned bank, in essence, and its share of small business
lending has fallen from 40% to 33%. It has double dealt and all the
rest of it.</hs_Para>

issue. I made some of these points last week and Mark Carney, the
Governor of the Bank of England, has switched the focus of the
direction of business away from mortgages. Productivity is still 5% in
Britain whereas it is up 8% in the USA. That is why people are poor and
cannot afford to deal with the cost of living crisis, which is why
Labour is talking about energy and business rates. Labour is in touch
with the reality for small businesses.</hs_Para>

Marie Morris</B> (Newton Abbot) (Con):</Member> The Government are
focused on small businesses and have a tremendous record. In
regulation, we have the red tape challenge, with 6,000 regulations
scrutinised and 3,000 to be given a severe hair cut. On tax, we have
cut corporation tax and the employer allowance is 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>extraordinarily good news, well loved and well liked. On access to
finance, funding for lending has been one of the best success stories,

Friend the Member for Northampton South (Mr Binley) identified,
business rates have been with us for a long time. They emanate from the
Poor Laws in the 1500s and the Rating and Valuation Act 1925
was the origin of the modern tax, most recently affected by the Local
Government Finance Act 1988. It started out very simple: rateable value
times multiplier. It is absolutely right to say that over time it has
become incredibly complicated. The issue is not only about
affordability, although I certainly hope that the Chancellor can do
something about that in his autumn statement, but about fairness and
lack of transparency. Why is it unfair? It is unfair because rateable
value is not calculated in a simple way. It can depend on whether a
business is in town or out of town. It can depend on its gross internal
area or net internal area, or whether it has a car park. For a large
out-of-town store, for example, a car park is not included. The
situation is different for pubs, because in the 1800s they were deemed
to have a monopoly, so their rates were based not on rateable value or
rent, but on turnover. These days, they do not have a monopoly, so that
certainly needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000115">The
reliefs are equally confusing. The small business rate relief is
fantastic, and it is to the Government’s credit that they have
doubled it in their time in office. Hopefully they will consider an
extension. Charities still have 80% relief and it really does not
matter what rateable value they have. There are special reliefs for
some obscure businesses in rural areas. For example, pubs and petrol
stations in rural areas get 50% relief, but up to a rateable value of
£12,500. There are many other areas that are completely
inconsistent.</hs_Para>

transparency, because businesses do not understand how their rates have
been calculated and cannot see what benefit they get. Redress is
limited, because appeals can take months and, unfortunately, local
authority discretion, which we welcomed in the Localism Act 2011, is
not being used, as has been mentioned. With revaluations every five
years, there can be a long time to
wait.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000117">However,
there are solutions. The Government have a fantastic record, but there
is more to do. In the short term, a small cap of perhaps 2%—that
figure has been mentioned in the media—would be brilliant. I
would welcome any extension of the small business rate relief, and I
certainly agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Bury St Edmunds (Mr
Ruffley) that it should be made
permanent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000118">In
the medium term, we need to review the statutory reliefs and consider
whether we could revalue every other year—from my conversations
with the valuation office, I think that would be possible—which
would ease the burden of appeals. If we are serious about allowing
businesses to see that they get some value, because half of the money
from business rates goes back into the local community, why do we not
state on the back of the bills exactly what the council has done for
businesses? We might also look at reviewing the use of the multiplier,
which currently is used only to distinguish between the different
countries that make up the United Kingdom, but it could be used to
better target reliefs.</hs_Para>

is simply not fit for purpose. We need a review. We need to look at it
in the context of the importance of retail, the high street and small
businesses in this country. Let us review the methodology and make it
simpler and fairer. Let us look at how we calculate rates for each
individual business payer so that they can understand it. Let us look

needs of small businesses and to help them. Let us make the process
easier so that the system

contribute to the debate on behalf of businesses in my constituency. We
are obviously focusing on small businesses this evening, and this is a
pertinent debate for them, but it is also pertinent for the mighty
Trafford centre in my constituency. It is perhaps not surprising that
the debate covers the whole range of businesses in my constituency,
when we consider that the average increase in business rates in
Trafford has been considerably higher than the English
average.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000122">I
want to pick up, in particular, on the Minister’s welcome
comment about the Government’s intention to review the Valuation
Office Agency’s performance in the system of appeals, because
that is an area of great concern to businesses in my constituency. The
long delays before they can see appeals resolved are putting some
businesses under huge cash-flow pressure and others at risk of
insolvency. Although the Minister claimed that the Valuation Office
Agency’s performance has improved in recent months, it is not
good enough for us to be in any way complacent. At this point, in
relation to the 2010 list, performance in clearing appeals is
considerably worse than it was at the same point in relation to the
2005 list, so clearly there is real pressure building up in the system
and we need to unblock that and identify the drivers of those
pressures. It is worrying that the data that enable us to judge the
VOA’s performance are apparently being suppressed. We were
receiving quarterly performance data, but now we are to receive it only
six-monthly, apparently on the basis that that will enhance the service
to users. It is difficult to see how less frequent reporting can do
that. I hope that the review will have a comprehensive and honest look
at the difficulties in the system.</hs_Para>

highlight a few issues that I hope Ministers will be able to pick up
when they embark on the review. First, the VOA repeatedly expresses
concerns about the actions of agents in relation to the handling of
appeals, and sometimes suggests that they are one of the drivers of
delay. In fact, many of the processes that businesses have to go
through are extremely complex, and so any opportunities to simplify the
appeals process would be very welcome. I think that agents themselves
would say
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000124">Secondly,
the VOA often argues that in many cases submitted to appeal, there is
no change in the assessment at the end of the appeal process. Let us
remember, 
<?notus-xml column=1034?>however, that those cases include quite a number that never complete the
process because there is a protective appeal or because the business
becomes insolvent before the appeal can be resolved, which is obviously
not good and may be because of delays in handling it or because the
case has been re-appealed. It will be important to understand what is
driving these no-change decisions and to be clear that we are focusing
on the real issues and not just taking a broad-brush
approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000125">The
whole ethos of what the agency is seeking to achieve needs to be part
of the scrutiny that I hope the Government will undertake. Its role is
not simply to protect the list, as sometimes seems to be the case, but
to ensure true and fair business rate assessments. It is very important
that that purpose is put absolutely at the heart of the
review.</hs_Para>

the Minister will look at some of the recent changes to statements of
practice and guidance, which seem to have led to an unwillingness on
the part of the agency to enter into constructive and meaningful
negotiations in order to arrive at the right level of business rates
for a particular business. There are serious concerns about the
agency’s ethos and approach, and I hope the review will be able
to uncover
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000127">Of

Wise Owl Toys in Worcester and from Greenway Landscape Architects, who
say that if they were asked to pay 
<?notus-xml column=1035?>business rates on their office they would have to close it down and work

gain to the Treasury or to local government from allowing the relief to

should do more to help small businesses, but helping the smallest
businesses should not be the limit of our ambition. We should also be
seeking to help businesses as they grow and create more jobs. One of
the perverse consequences of the generous system of relief that the
coalition has offered is that it creates a shelf that affects
businesses when they wish to move to new premises or expand. In an
ideal world, we should seek a more tiered system of business rate
relief that works on a banded basis so that no business would be hit
with a huge increase to its business rates bill as it grows. I accept
that that might be difficult to achieve in the current fiscal climate,
but we should consider whether we can delay businesses having to pay
higher rates when they are creating new jobs or taking on large numbers
of trainees and apprentices. That would be consistent with other
Government initiatives, such as the employment allowance designed to
encourage job creation. We should also consider the case that has been
made for targeted rate relief for pop-up shops and malls, which can act
as retail incubators and support
entrepreneurs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000134">Those
steps would be a start, but they do not touch on some of the greatest
problems with the current system of rates, including the valuation
system, which many hon. Members have already touched on. Put simply,
our system of property taxation on business was designed for the 1980s,
but we are trying to apply it to a 21st century world. Nowhere is that
more apparent than in the retail

of the death of retail have been greatly exaggerated. The Business,
Innovation and Skills Committee’s inquiry has heard evidence of
a thriving sector that is creating many more jobs and opportunities,
even as it undergoes radical change. However, the rise of the internet
and competition from online-only retailers creates additional pressure
on the high street and the so-called bricks and mortar sector. Such
competitors are unburdened by business rates and there is a risk, if we
leave business rates unreformed, of creating a vicious cycle whereby
business rates contribute to the declining retail footprint by putting
shops at a competitive disadvantage and adding to their cost base and
then, in order to generate the same revenue, rates have to be steadily
increased on that declining base, which could end up killing valuable
businesses. I hope the Government will consider the strong case being
made for a freeze or a cap on business rates and to break the cycle of
inflationary
increases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000136">Of

Collins</B> (Folkestone and Hythe) (Con):</Member> Throughout this
debate, the Opposition have promoted an idea that seems to suggest that
big businesses live in a totally separate world from smaller
businesses. When the major employers in my community, such as Saga,
Dungeness power station and Eurotunnel, do well, do the small business
community say, “What’s that got to do with us?
It’s no concern of ours.”? They do not, because they
understand that the employees of large businesses are the customers of
small businesses, that large and small businesses have a
customer-supplier relationship and that the strength of the whole local
economy is vital. That is why we take issue with a “rob Peter to
pay Paul” exercise whereby the revenue for a very small,
temporary tax cut for one sector of the business community is raised
from another area of the business community. That is what the Labour
party proposes to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000139">As
I said earlier, the cut is small. A cut in business rates that is worth
barely more than £1 a day will not answer business
people’s concerns about the business rating system. Members
across the House have made good calls for a sensible look at reform. I
was pleased to hear the Minister say that the Government are about to
launch a review and are looking at the appeal system. I hope that we
will be able to welcome news from the Chancellor of the Exchequer of
smaller increases in business rates for the years ahead. As the
structure of the economy changes and more businesses become part of the
digital economy, with smaller industrial footprints and a different
business model from that of the past, it is of course right that we
look at these systems
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000140">The
Chairman of the Communities and Local Government Committee made the
point well in his very interesting speech that we should look at the
town centre economy and how we can have a system that encourages
investment and businesses to go back into the town centres. They may
never be what they were in the 1950s—a purely retail environment
where people did all their shopping—but we can get different
types of businesses back in
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000141">The
Government’s reforms to the business rating system, which
encourage local authorities to promote more business activity in their
areas and give them for the first time a financial stake in the success
of the local business community, must be a good thing. Asking local
councils to use the powers that they already have to create what are
almost micro-enterprise zones and to give more discretionary relief to
businesses in town centres and encourage more activity is exactly the
right thing to do. We would support any measure that seeks to extend
and look at other opportunities to reform business rates in that
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000142">The
hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson), who has great knowledge of
the economy in Northern Ireland, said in an intervention that business
rates are an important issue but that they must be seen in the round of
the balance of other measures as well. The Government have introduced a
series of measures that will help the small business community, not
least the £2,000 cut in employers’ national insurance,
which starts next April and is worth more than four times the Labour
party’s proposed measure on business
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000143">Labour
Members have almost completely ignored the investment coming into
regional economies through the 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>regional growth fund. In east Kent, the £40 million regional
growth fund is making a big difference to the local economy. Grants
made through the county council to large and small businesses mean that
they are employing people today. Grants are also helping businesses
that are otherwise struggling with bank lending to get to the next
stage and invest in their future
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000144">Such
measures, alongside targeted ones to support small businesses, are
making a big difference, as is the ability to look creatively at how we
can encourage more incubators for businesses, support more pop-up shops
and give people starting their own small business the chance to get on
to the high street and into physical premises sooner. All those
initiatives are welcome, and taken in the round, they are strengthening
our economy. For Labour to pick one very small measure and pretend that
that makes it the party of small business is
absurd.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13120511002200" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511002200">7.45

is clear that businesses are facing a cost-of-doing-business crisis,
alongside the cost-of-living crisis that is hitting families across
Britain. Unless the Government change course tomorrow, businesses will
be hit by an average rise in business rates of £430 next April,
at a total cost to business of £700 million because of the
impact of inflation. Business rates have already gone up by an average
of £1,500 under this Government. The reality is that many
businesses—in fact, more than one in 10 small ones—are
now paying more in business rates than in
rent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000155">Up
and down the country, including in my constituency, businesses are
being put in an impossible situation: either they pass on the increase
in rates to their customers, or they continue to face a squeeze until
they can no longer afford to stay in business. The pressures small
businesses face are stark. Unless things change, business rates will
have risen by an average of nearly £2,000 by the end of this
Parliament. There are 40,000 empty shops in the UK—one in seven
shops are empty—which is blighting the UK’s high streets
and town
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000156">The
British Retail Consortium has estimated that the business rate increase
from April next year will mean an increase of £242 million per
annum for retailers. It has also said that the increase is likely to
put 19,670 full-time jobs at risk, owing to potential shop closures and
reduced investment. Our economy can afford neither
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000157">Why
does this issue matter? Small businesses are the engine of our economy.
Of the 4.9 million businesses in the UK, 99% are small or medium-sized
enterprises. Between them, they employ nearly half the UK work force.
Nearly 90% of the people who go from being unemployed to having a
private sector job work for a small business. Small businesses are
therefore making a huge contribution to tackling unemployment in this
country. Small businesses are the driving force behind jobs and growth.
They account for more than half the economy. Most of the new jobs in
the next 15 years will be created by businesses that do not yet exist.
Growth and small businesses go hand in hand. We cannot deliver
excellent public services without the contribution that they make to
the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000158">The
cost-of-doing-business crisis that has been delivered by the Government
cannot go on. Our small businesses deserve better. That is why at our
annual conference in September, we announced that the next Labour
Government would cut business rates in 2015 and freeze them in 2016.
That pledge would give businesses a much-needed boost and would mean an
average saving of nearly £450 for more than 1.5 million business
premises.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000159">Some
Government Members have said that that amounts to small beer. That is
doing down the needs of businesses, particularly given that action on
business rates is the single biggest thing that has been requested by
businesses. I wonder whether the small beer phraseology will be used
tomorrow if the Chancellor announces a cap of 
<?notus-xml column=1039?>2%, as is expected. No doubt, they will trumpet that saving of a couple
of hundred pounds, even though our cut would deliver a saving of
£450 on
average.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000160">Politics
is about choices and priorities. It is right that the UK should have a
competitive corporation tax rate, but it is also right to take
decisions that help small businesses. We will cut business rates on
properties with an annual rental value of below £50,000 in 2015
and freeze business rates for those properties in 2016. We will pay for
that by reversing the additional cut in the main rate of corporation
tax from 21% to 20% in 2015. The main rate of corporation tax is paid
by companies with profits of more than £1.5
million—essentially, the larger multinational companies.
Companies that have profits of less than £300,000 and that pay
the lower rate of corporation tax will not be affected. By contrast,
the Government have thus far failed to rise to the scale of the
challenge. They have provided temporary relief for the very smallest
properties up to a value of £6,000 and partial rate relief for
properties up to a value of £12,000. Those measures do not go
far
enough.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000161">As
with energy prices, since our announcement in September, the Government
have come under increasing pressure to listen and take action. We heard
this morning that they have finally given in and that the Chancellor
will announce tomorrow that business rate rises will be limited to 2%
in England and Wales next year, rather than rising by 3.2% in line with
the retail prices index. That still falls far short of what firms that
are suffering from the cost-of-living crisis have been crying out for.
Just as energy bills will still go up under the Government’s
plans, business rates will still go up under this proposal. Firms will
still see business rates rise by an average of more than £250 in
April next year, and that comes on top of the £1,500 by which
they have already gone up under this
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000162">By
contrast, under our plan, 1.5 million start-ups, workshops and shops
would benefit from a cut and then a freeze in business rates. If the
Government are going to change course, they should do so in a
comprehensive and decisive way that would see rate bills cut. They
should adopt Labour’s proposal. Nothing less than that
comprehensive action will do because our small businesses deserve
better than what the Government have delivered. I commend the motion to
the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13120511002201" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511002201">7.53

drive growth and make Britain’s economy work for everyone. We
have done so in spite of the need to reduce the massive deficit that
was left by the last Labour Government. This debate is focused on
business rates, but as the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson),
the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my

Government’s ambition is for the UK to be the best place in
Europe to start, finance and grow a 
<?notus-xml column=1040?>business. We have therefore identified barriers to growth and the
measures that need to be taken to overcome them. To that effect, the
Government will introduce a £2,000 employment allowance for all
businesses in 2014, to reduce their national insurance contributions
each year. Up to 1.25 million businesses will benefit, with about
450,000 of them being taken out of paying employer national insurance
contributions altogether. More than 90% of the benefit of that
allowance will go to small businesses with fewer than 50
employees.</hs_Para>

a further 1% reduction in the main rate of corporation tax from April
2015 was announced in the Budget. The rate will be reduced to 21% in
April 2014, and then fall to 20% in April 2015. Based on current plans,
the UK will have the joint lowest corporation tax in the G20 and by far
the lowest rate in the G7 by 2015. That will increase return on
investment, incentivise activity across the economy and make the UK
more attractive to multinational companies and foreign investors. Those
actions will help our economy continue to
grow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511000166">We

That is not all. We have frozen the multiplier in real terms, so it has

this House acknowledges that this Government is taking decisive action
to back business and make Britain’s economy work for everyone;
notes that the Government has cut business rates, National Insurance
and corporation tax for small firms despite the need to tackle the
deficit left by the last Administration; observes that the value of
small business rate relief has trebled since the general election and
small business rate relief will be considered in the Autumn Statement;
notes how the overall multiplier has been frozen in real terms;
applauds the abolition of the unfair port taxes; welcomes the Localism
Act which has made small business rate relief easier to claim and
allows councils to introduce local discounts; notes with approval the
rate relief in 24 enterprise zones; further welcomes the new
empty rate relief for new build in contrast to the last
Administration’s increases in empty rates; endorses the way in
which local rate retention now gives councils new incentives to support
local enterprise; and rejects the policy proposals from Her
Majesty’s Opposition on rates which would involve increasing
corporation tax on all firms, undermining British jobs and
businesses.</hs_brev></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-12-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_12_04_PT_1/75060A83B143D14596CDDB31018CAEC30D0D978A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 December 2013">Wednesday

Madam Deputy Speaker. Have you been made aware that a Minister is to
come to the House and make an urgent statement, given that Sky News has
been reporting all evening that tomorrow’s autumn statement will
refer to a 1% cut in departmental budgets other than those that are
protected? It is not an “if” or a “maybe”,
but a definite. It is not the first leak of this kind, and the
Chancellor must be mortified. I wonder if he will come to the House to
announce a leak
inquiry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001172"><B><Member ContinuationText="Madam Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="243" UID="13120511003237" xid="484" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511003237">Madam

Barclay</B> (North East Cambridgeshire) (Con):</Member> There is a wide
discrepancy in sports funding between cities and rural communities, far
in excess of what can be logically explained by population levels or
other factors that can produce spikes, such as national centres of
excellence in specific sports. I hope that the Minister will clarify
her Department’s understanding of that variance, and tell me
what action will be taken to address it. Since 2010, North East
Cambridgeshire has received on average £120,000 a year from
Sport England, from its annual budget of £322.6 million. That
represents just 0.03% of Sport England’s budget, and I am keen
to hear from the Minister why officials feel that that figure is
justified, given the Government’s sizeable contribution to
sports funding.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120511001183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001183">The Library
confirms that, since 1995, North East Cambridgeshire has received a
total of £2.9 million compared with, for example, Hammersmith,
which has received £56 million. That could partly be explained
by the fact that the GB rowing team is based in Hammersmith, but does
that really explain that massive discrepancy? We should also take into
account that some areas are getting double funding. Some are getting
Olympic legacy funding as well as awards from Sport England, for
example. Hammersmith received awards for tennis and sailing in
September.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120511001184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001184">I wish to
draw the House’s attention to three issues that are driving this
discrepancy, which has existed for some time. My parliamentary
neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for North West Cambridgeshire (Mr
Vara), was highlighting in parliamentary questions in 2009 his concern
that communities such as ours were not getting an adequate allocation
of taxpayer funds.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120511001185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001185">Three factors
are particularly fuelling the current issue, the first of which is the
complexity of the number of bodies that are allocating funds on behalf
of the taxpayer. Sport England itself has 11 different grant schemes,
and my constituency has never had a grant under nine of them; we have
only ever qualified for two of the 11 schemes. There is no yearly
breakdown of how much Sport England allocates under the schemes, and
there are different time scales for the spending envelopes, so they do
not run in a holistic way that fits together. Sport England’s
staff costs this year are £13.5 million, which, given that a
sizeable proportion of its budget is outsourced to national Government
budgets, is not inconsiderable in terms of administrative costs.
Indeed, its chief executive earns more than the Prime Minister,
although that seems not uncommon in the sports
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001186">In
addition to the 11 grants that Sport England gives, 46 national
governing bodies are also given grants, and each of those has myriad
schemes. For example, the Lawn Tennis Association makes a split between
capital investment and a separate revenue fund, and within those the
criteria frequently change. Those who get involved because they love
sport, and not because they want to be accountants or to fill out
forms, are often confronted with an alphabet soup of grant-making 
<?notus-xml column=1052?>bodies, and that is before they get the match funding of local
authorities, charities and the other bodies that they must deal
with.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001187">The
second issue driving this problem is the confusion in, and frequent
changes to, the criteria applied. Some criteria appear actively to
discriminate—for logical reasons—against rural
communities. Participation is, understandably often a key
criterion—bodies want people to play if they are giving a
grant—but that tends to drive funding purely to cities, often on
the basis of flawed research. For example, all the eight priority areas
identified by the LTA were in cities; it did not sample one rural area,
so its criteria are distorting the basis on which it makes its granting
decisions.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120511001188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001188">We also
encounter a remarkable lack of consistency, which is not just a rural
issue. Let us consider boxing in London. It is funded by the Mayor of
London, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Department for
Education, the Department for Communities and Local Government and
local authorities, all of which have different criteria and assess in
different ways. I am curious as to what is being done to simplify and
standardise the way in which these grants are being
allocated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001189">The
third issue is the lack of transparency in awards. Of course we see
individual awards—the £5,000 awarded to X or the
£10,000 awarded to Y—but who is looking at whether all 46
national governing bodies are allocating in the same concentrated
areas? Who is looking holistically to see whether some areas are
underlapping and other areas are overlapping? Where is the
accountability for those areas that are not directing funds to needs,
such as the needs in my constituency? How do we get transparency on
that issue?</hs_Para>

Shannon</B> (Strangford) (DUP):</Member> I spoke to the hon. Gentleman
earlier to seek his indulgence in allowing me to intervene. Helpfully,
all the sporting projects in the countryside in Northern Ireland are
funded by the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure and by councils.
However, because of social isolation and the need to have sporting
projects in rural communities, we have also sought help from Europe and
through the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development. We have
used that money to help rural communities. Does the hon. Gentleman feel
it would be helpful if the Minister considered that as an option to

Barclay:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes an important point,
which reflects the complexity of the different bodies and the role of
the Department in drawing this matter together and producing data that
he and I can use to scrutinise how effective the taxpayer pound is in
getting to the front line. He is right to draw attention to the
isolation in rural communities where there are not the same options as
in the cities. That is why it is important that we do not miss out
across the 46 different governing bodies.</hs_Para>

There is a real irony here. If we look at elite sport—at British
cycling for example—we see the power and accuracy of real-time
data. Those data enable us to understand what is happening across the
full activity, and yet for the Department and the national governing
bodies, it is unclear how that is being demonstrated to Members of
Parliament so that 
<?notus-xml column=1053?>we can accurately see whether the £120,000 we are getting, which
is a fifth of what Cambridge gets—and Cambridge is just down the
road—is actually the right level. The Minister’s
assistance on that point would be
appreciated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001193">I
want to bring my argument to life with a few local examples. Let me
take the complexity of the various bodies. Wisbech tennis club in my
constituency currently has 130 members, which is a 14% increase on last
year, and yet it has only grass courts and no lights. The club is very
restricted as to when it can play, in terms both of times of year and
times of day. If it rains, play must be suspended. The Lawn Tennis
Association advised the club in 2012 that its bid for two courts and
lights was too modest, and that to win LTA support it had to put in a
bid for four courts. Sport England then changed the funding of the LTA,
which led the LTA to withdraw its support. It was a classic example of
two sporting bodies giving conflicting advice, which meant that the
bid failed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120511001194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001194">The club then
put in a second bid. It still followed the LTA’s advice of four
courts, but took out the lights. Sport England turned it down. This was
logical to a certain extent, because without lights the club could not
get the same numbers of people playing. The club was therefore
penalised a second time for following a national governing
body’s advice on securing funding from another body, Sport
England, which strikes me as a pretty illogical process.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13120511001195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001195">A third bid
is now proposed for next week. The club has already spent £8,000
to £9,000 on planning and other things to get to exactly where
it was at the very start, which is a bid for two courts with lights.
This is a sport in a growing market town with massive levels of
immigration from eastern Europe. Tennis helps to bring people together
in the way that sport does at its
best.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001196">Let
us look now at communication. Coates football has teams of all ages and
11 acres of playing fields, but no changing facilities. I welcome the
fact that Sport England confirmed funding for the club, which
coincidentally came through last week, but unless the funding comes
from the other bodies, there will be insufficient money to deliver the
facilities. Again, we need the different bodies to work
together.</hs_Para>

issue is the challenge to national governing bodies. On Friday, I will
have the privilege of attending March amateur boxing in the Braza club.
Some 40 kids train at the club three or more nights a week, yet the
club has never had a penny of grant from the Amateur Boxing
Association, which is given £4.8 million by Sport England. As
taxpayers, we hand over £5.8 million to boxing, yet only
£1 million of that goes to the clubs directly. The question is:
where is the rest going? The chief executive of the body is on a
six-figure salary, yet the volunteers at March boxing have to pay a fee
to the ABA. The Government are quite rightly allocating significant
funds to the boxing body, but the kids who are training in the club and
not causing trouble and the volunteers are not getting the support that
they need.</hs_Para>

good schemes with Thomas Clarkson in my constituency, but if we look at

the population. How am I, as a Member of Parliament, supposed to assess
whether that is the right level? What is the role of the Department in

about sport, and indeed the hon. Member for Bradford South (Mr

there is an alphabet soup of bodies and there is complexity. Complexity
always drives up costs. We are talking about volunteers in our
community groups doing what we all want them to, yet the system is not
getting the money to them in communities such as mine. I hope that the

England’s open funding programmes, such as Inspired Facilities
and Protecting Playing Fields, do not discriminate according to type of
area—that is, whether it is urban or rural. Applications for
funding are assessed on their individual merits against the criteria
for that programme. Sport England’s Inspired Facilities funding
programme has already awarded grants to nearly 1,400 community sports
clubs across the country to upgrade their facilities. Projects have
ranged from fixing leaky roofs to installing showers and accessible
changing rooms, and even supplying new lights at hockey clubs. I had
the pleasure of switching on such lights in Kent just a few weeks
ago.</hs_Para>

Cambridgeshire has benefited too. In 2011, Sport England ran a funding
workshop for local clubs in the area. As a result, I am delighted to
report that six clubs in my hon. Friend’s constituency have been
successful in receiving Inspired Facilities awards with grants
totalling more than
£300,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001204">Of
course, competition for funding remains extremely high and the quality
of applications is increasing all the time. For example, in the
previous round of Inspired Facilities, Sport England received more than
a 1,000 applications for about £55 million of funding when it
had only £16.2 million
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001205">If
a club is unsuccessful in its application, Sport England offers
individual feedback and support to help it prepare a stronger
application for a future funding 
<?notus-xml column=1055?>round. Sport England engages regularly with North East Cambridgeshire
and has provided advice and guidance about the possible redevelopment
of Ely leisure centre. Cambridgeshire county council has put in a bid
for the Queen’s baton relay, which covers Fenland and my hon.

England is also promoting its Sportivate programme in the fenland area,
where take-up rates are currently low. The programme gives all
secondary school children the chance to experience a range of sports,
from conventional ones such as golf and tennis to wakeboarding and free
running. More than 225,000 young people have so far
benefited from Sportivate, and I look forward to hearing that many more
are enjoying those opportunity in the fenlands, too. The county sports
partnership is also working with the College of West Anglia on a
project for people who are not in education, employment or training,
and that will include
Wisbech.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001207">My
hon. Friend rightly referred to Wisbech lawn tennis club. I understand
that there has now been some good and sensible dialogue between the
club and the Lawn Tennis Association, that a staged approach to
building the new facilities he referred to has been recommended and
that the LTA has provided the club with a loan of £50,000. I
also understand that an application for Inspired Facilities funding is
currently under consideration. I wish the club every success in
securing funding from Sport England.</hs_Para>

Friend referred to participation. We are seeing very positive trends
across the country, with 
<?notus-xml column=1056?>15.3 million adults playing sport at least once a week, which
is 1.4 million more than when London won the bid to host the Olympic
and Paralympic games in 2005. I am also particularly pleased that over
500,000 more women are playing sport regularly since we won the bid.
Over 83,000 Sport Makers are volunteering regularly in their local
communities, 16,000 schools have signed up to the School games
programme, and around 100 county festivals of sport took place across
the country this year. Through the 2012 games and other major events,
we have raised the level of ambition in sport in this country for
people in every community. Sport and leisure activities are vital to
this country to energise young people’s ambitions and transform
their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001209">I
am grateful to my hon. Friend for raising this important issue and to
the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) for his contribution, and
I will write to him about the matter he raised. I hope that I have
provided my hon. Friend with some reassurance about the
Government’s commitment to rural communities and to increasing
participation in sport, regardless of where people live, whether in
inner cities, small towns, seaside resorts or rural communities. If he
remains concerned, I would of course be very happy to meet him. I also
recommend that he organises a meeting with his Sport England regional
representative—those representatives are very helpful and
informative. The Government certainly take sport seriously and want to
ensure that its broader social benefits for all communities are widely
recognised and
enjoyed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120511001210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/debtext/131204-0004.htm#13120511001210"><I>Question

Farrelly</B> (Newcastle-under-Lyme) (Lab):</Member> I thank Members and
the Minister for attending this early-morning debate, which appears on
the Order Paper with the catchiest of titles: “Cumulative
electricity tax burden for energy intensive
industries”—truly a headline writer’s dream. Their
presence speaks volumes for the importance industry gives this issue. I
have been approached in the corridors this morning and in the past two
days by people who cannot be here, but who are closely following the
issue because they have had representations from their local
manufacturers,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T09:30:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120442000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120442000008">I
and other colleagues applied for the debate at the urging of the
British Ceramic Confederation, which represents tableware firms and
brick and tile makers in my area— north Staffordshire—and
across the country. Indeed, on Friday, I am visiting one of
them—Ibstock Brick, in Chesterton, in
Newcastle-under-Lyme—to view first hand its £20 million
investment in brand-new kilns, which use the Etruria marl in the
company quarries just a couple of miles away in Knutton and Silverdale,
in my constituency.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T09:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>The fact that we
are having this debate is also due in no small part to the urging of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T09:31:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith), who has been
cracking the whip for not only her local industry, but the
sector.</hs_Para>

debate is very timely. It comes not only as energy prices for domestic
customers have taken centre stage following the price-freeze initiative
introduced by my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition, but
just a day before the autumn statement. The ceramics industry has
lobbied the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister hard for
measures to tackle rising energy costs. It is not only the ceramics
industry that has done that, but the glass, steel and chemicals
industries—all sectors that describe themselves as highly energy
intensive industries. In short, they are the cream of the UK’s
manufacturing industry.

to m<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T09:32:32"></hs_TimeCode>y local
ceramics industry and the potteries, I am more used to hearing cries of
anguish over gas than electricity, because gas mostly fires the kilns.
Only last week, 13 Members with ceramics interests, from across the
parties and across the country, signed a joint letter to the Select
Committee on Energy and Climate Change ahead of its session last
Thursday on gas storage. A delegation of us also recently met the
Minister to raise issues along the same lines on behalf of the
industry. In our representations, we questioned the Government’s
recent decision not to involve themselves in actively encouraging more
storage to tackle gas price volatility and future security of supply.
We were pleased 
<?notus-xml column=258?>that the Committee’s members took those concerns on board in
their questioning of key representatives of the gas industry last
week.</hs_Para>

debate is about the cost of that other staple and crucial energy

this subject and, in particular, in the effect of Government policy.
These industries are not able to get the grants available to their
competitors in mainland Europe, which is leading to the possibility of
job losses. Does he accept that the Government need to do more in those

Twigg</B> (Halton) (Lab):</Member> Before my hon. Friend comes on to
Scotland, may I congratulate him on securing the debate? He is very
knowledgeable on this matter. Is he aware that the INEOS ChlorVinyls
plant in Runcorn uses electrolysis to manufacture chlorine? As a
consequence, about 70% of the production costs on the site
are accounted for by electricity. Some 1,800 people are

costs for major chemicals manufacturers, as we have heard. Big
international price discrepancies matter, and will matter more if
prices continue their inexorable rise. Like the household bills that we
have put under the microscope in recent weeks, the price that industry
pays for electricity also breaks down into three main components. One
is the wholesale cost, which is rising. Another is climate-related
charges. Hon. Members will have to bear with me while I go through a
short list of what they include: the carbon price floor, the EU
emissions trading system charges, the climate change levy, the
renewables obligation, small-scale feed-in tariffs and, to be added to
that bevy of burdens in the future, contracts for difference under
electricity market reform. The third component is transmission charges,
which are also increasing ahead of inflation, and which also include
climate-related costs in the form of subsidies for offshore wind and
other intermittent renewables.</hs_Para>

There has been a welcome for the announcement in the Budget that
ceramics and other industries would be exempted from the full cost of

the Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt), who chairs the
all-party group on energy intensive industries. Of course Opposition
Members thought that that compliment meant that his political career
was done for, but changes since then have happily proved us wrong. The
reality is that the tax exemption is hardly what the British Ceramic
Confederation calls a game-changer. Welcome though that gesture was, it
will save only an estimated 2% of energy costs for ceramics, mineral
and metallurgical companies. Similar things can be said about the
£250 million package to compensate energy intensive industries
in the 2011 autumn statement—relief that was extended in the
recent Budget—and about the sentiments behind the exemption,
which the industry argues is too limited, from the UK’s new
contract for difference charges.</hs_Para>

further things would those vital industries like from the Minister
today and from the Chancellor, if not tomorrow, then in the
future? One thing is further news on practical implementation, without
state aid complications, of the climate change levy exemption. Looking
further ahead, they would like the compensation package that has
already been announced to be linked to the carbon price floor, so that
it remains for the duration of the policy, and so that its value will
reflect the trajectory of the price floor, if that continues. The
industries would also like a widening of the contract for difference
exemptions, so that there will be help for more companies than the
estimated 10% of the ceramics industry that it is thought will be
helped. They would certainly like a bigger helping hand in relation to
Brussels. There was dismay, a fortnight ago, in the ceramics, glass and
cement industries at the discovery that they would be excluded from
compensation under the EU emissions trading system, even though highly

climate-related charges are already 19% of the base load price, and
that will rise to 47% in 2020. The Engineering Employers Federation
states that the Government’s estimates indicate that industrial
electricity prices will have increased by 70% by 2030. Moreover, Tata
Steel is clear that the green levy with the greatest impact today is
the renewables obligation, which, along with small-scale feed-in
tariffs, will cost £10.50 per megawatt-hour in the year from
April 2014, which is an increase of more than 100% in three years. Tata
also points out that many steel makers in Europe will either be
completely exempt from the charge or have their charge capped at
€0.50 per megawatt-hour. There is clearly a serious problem here

myriad taxes and levies, are threatening our ability to compete, even

the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme said, some of its manufacturers
operate some of the most energy-intensive processes in the UK, and that
several companies have already relocated to Germany and France, with
electricity costs cited as a key reason. Even more worrying is the real
risk that the current tax regime will do nothing to lower emissions
globally if, as the confederation suggests, manufacturing focus is
encouraged by costs to emerge in less regulated and less
energy-efficient factories abroad. Carbon leakage is therefore a real
threat. There is a great irony here, because energy intensive
industries are making a huge effort to improve energy efficiency and
thereby cut their costs. Tata uses 40% less energy today to produce the
same amount of steel as it did in 1975. That is a 40% cut in energy
costs as a result of its energy efficiency measures. Ceramics
industries have been heavily involved in trying to improve their
processes. Naylor Industries in my constituency continually strives to
reduce costs by improving energy
efficiency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120442000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120442000057">In
summary, it is clear that we need reform of the current system of green
taxes and levies, because of  the risk of losing capacity,
either to the EU or elsewhere, 
<?notus-xml column=265?>with the linked risk of carbon leakage. However, let me be absolutely
clear: I have not, as yet, come across one industrialist who
disagrees with the principle of green taxation.
Everyone understands that a well-designed taxation system has a role to
play in stimulating growth of the low-carbon economy, but that process
has to be balanced with the critical need to avoid damaging the
cost-effectiveness of the industrial base.</hs_Para>

intensive manufacturers are important in their own right; I know that
because I come from a family who have been involved in steel making for
at least four generations. Such manufacturers are even more important
given that the industries that we are talking about have a key role to
play in providing components for the low-carbon economy—a point
often overlooked by critics of the industries. Technical ceramics are
used for nuclear, wind and solar generation. Clay pipes are 100%
recyclable and have an incredibly long life. It takes 1,000 tonnes of
steel of six different grades to produce each offshore wind turbine.
The steel exterior for the Nissan Leaf electric vehicle was developed

Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme asked, how should the
Government act to remedy the problem? It is worth listing the array of
schemes in play, or due to come into play soon: the climate change
levy; small-scale feed-in tariffs; the emissions trading scheme; the
renewables obligation; the carbon floor price; the energy company
obligation; the carbon reduction commitment; and contracts for
difference. We also have the aggregates levy and the landfill tax, but
both are well embedded, and nobody would touch them. I might not even
have included all the schemes on that list, but the point is
made.</hs_Para>

the green tax landscape is burdensome in two key ways: there is the
cost, and the bureaucratic tangle involved in ensuring compliance. For
example, one business in my constituency employs a full-time, highly
skilled individual simply to ensure that it meets all its obligations
on green tax. The Government have committed to the red tape challenge;
this is a clear red tape challenge that needs to be dealt with. That
individual could be employed to improve energy efficiency in the plant
instead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120442000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120442000061">I
repeat: what is to be done? Industry has a few ideas and key demands.
First, it wants a level playing field for European and non-European
competitors on climate-related taxes and levies, to ensure that
world-class companies in the UK can remain internationally competitive.
EEF pointed out that an assessment of that could take place within the
context of the fourth carbon budget review.</hs_Para>

industries need to see detail of the promised exemption of ceramics and
other industries from the full cost of the climate change levy from
next year. The autumn statement would be a good opportunity to provide
that detail, as well as detail about how the Government will negotiate
a way through without falling foul of state aid rules. In addition, the
expected change in guidelines means that the Government have an
opportunity to exempt such industries from the renewables obligation
and small-scale feed-in tariffs. EEF and the British Ceramic
Confederation make reference to the impact of those two taxes on their
members. Industries also want the £250 million package moulded
around 
<?notus-xml column=266?>the ETS and the CFP to be in place for the duration of the latter
policy, until 2030, and they want the value of that
compensation linked to the upwards trajectory, as my hon. Friend
pointed out. The contract for difference worries energy-intensive
industries, too. They look for comprehensive exemption for industries,
so that they can remain competitive.</hs_Para>

the steel and ceramic sectors point out that the Government could do a
great deal for their members if capital allowances were increased for a
wider range of energy-efficient technologies, so that a much higher
proportion of the green taxes raised went back into such investments. I
could also make the point about including a wider range of industries
in the state aid guidelines. It is incumbent on the Government to
ensure that they make that case to the EU.</hs_Para>

Government face a bewildering range of choices. They ought to consider
two more radical proposals before making up their mind. Perhaps we need
a consolidation of all the taxes and levies, or to simplify the system
in order to reduce the bureaucratic burden on our manufacturing
companies and make it easier to work out what the cost burden should be
and how best to compensate industries that are at risk of losing that
competitive edge. Transparency and good environmental tax design could
be achieved simply by revising and reforming the complexity of the
current regime. I would like to hear the Minister’s comments on
that.</hs_Para>

taken part in many  
<?notus-xml column=267?>debates on green jobs and how we were not moving fast enough on green
subsidies. It is good to have a debate today on the 900,000 jobs in our
economy in the chemicals, steel, cement and ceramics industries. I will
mention one more industry, which is represented in my constituency: the
aluminium industry. It, too, is affected by high energy prices.
Furthermore, although intensive industry is affected most by high
energy prices, all industry is affected. We are trying to rebalance the
economy back towards manufacturing, and gross domestic product growth
correlates to energy use, so it is nonsense to say that only intensive
industry is affected.</hs_Para>

us look at our competitive position vis-à-vis Asia, the United

to the US briefly, it is worth noting that US gas prices have fallen
from $9 per million cubic feet to $3 per million cubic feet. That is
utterly transformational. It is not the Government’s
fault—it has nothing to do with taxes—but when something
like that happens to an economy, there is a stark transformation. It
affects feedstock prices for the chemicals industry and energy prices
right across the piece. It has had a massive impact on the US’s
competitiveness, relative to ours. Luckily, the US is a couple of
thousand miles away, so the impact will not be felt quite so much as it
would have been had it happened in Europe; but the shale gas revolution
in the US is one of the most important events to have happened in
global politics in the past decade. Members of this House who are tardy
or reluctant to endorse us taking action on shale gas need to reflect
on that fact.</hs_Para>

more worrying issue is the EU. Our big competitors are France and
Germany, and we have already heard about the differential that is
arising. The issue is not so much the differential today—some
may disagree with me—as the direction of travel for all of us.
We have talked a great deal about carbon targets since the Climate
Change Act 2008. We are the only country that has carbon
targets—no other country in Europe has the same degree of
statutory enshrinement of carbon targets. That fact drives behaviour.
We have seen that  in the dismantling of the emissions trading
system in Europe. To all intents and purposes, the carbon
price  in Europe is now €2 or €3 per tonne, but
in the UK, due to the carbon price floor introduced in April, it is
about €20 per tonne. That will be absolutely devastating. At the
margin, power stations will go to Holland, which is now building coal
stations, and supply us through interconnectors. I do not see where
that gets us.</hs_Para>

have assigned £250 million to help intensive industries, but
that will not be enough

the medium term. All of us in this place need to reflect on that. I
do not want to cause discord between the two sides
of the House, but we have a vote this afternoon on energy prices. Some
of the Members asking today that we keep prices down—something I
desperately want to do, both because of fuel poverty and for the
reasons we have heard about industrial competiveness—have the
chance to vote on an amendment brought forward by the Labour party in
the House of Lords that asks that we accelerate the closure of
coal-fired power stations in this country. In my opinion, that will
have the direct impact of raising energy prices by between 3% and 5%. I

may well be about to be told that the Labour party has decided not to

wrap up, in terms of our position on Europe, I believe we need to cut

difficulty is with the idea that we have to cut carbon unilaterally. We
are responsible for 1.5% of the world’s carbon emissions. We
produce two thirds as much carbon as Germany per capita, and per unit
of GDP. That is similar to Holland and lower than the average in the
EU, yet we are pushing ahead with unilateral actions that come with a

look at our tendency to act unilaterally, hemmed in as we are by the
Climate Change Act and the fourth carbon budget and all that goes with
it. I ask that we get away from EU directives on renewables and the

primary heat source in cement manufacture has traditionally been coal,

coming to this place, I spent 30 years in the packaging industry and I

manufacturing industry. It represents companies involved in the
manufacture of paper, board, aluminium, plastics and particularly glass
packaging. We have heard from hon. Members about the impact of
electricity prices on the manufacture of glass and I will refer
particularly to that used for bottles and jars. Manufacturers of cement
and packaging have seen significant increases in the cost of energy.
The British Glass Manufacturing Confederation has referred to a 14%
increase in the past 12
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120442000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120442000109">That
increase has arisen partly as a consequence of the Government’s
objectives on climate change and carbon dioxide emissions. Hon. Members
on both sides of the Chamber today have recognised that the present and
previous Administrations have gone too far and imposed an excessive
burden on those manufacturers. The present Government have recognised
that in their action to exempt the most energy intensive industries
from that burden. The announcement by the Energy Minister in July this
year was welcomed by many energy intensive industries as a start and a
move in the right direction. I am sure, across the Chamber, that we
hope the Minister will tell us that the Government will be able to go
further. However, there are significant concerns that some industries
have not benefited—cement and packaging fall into this
category—because they are not eligible for the compensation that
has been announced.</hs_Para>

sectors have made representations that electricity costs in the UK are
significantly higher than in other countries, and increasingly,
manufacturers are multinational, with plant across the world. CEMEX,
for instance, is a multinational producer, and it knows exactly what it
costs to produce a kilo of cement at any location in the world. It is
able to calculate where the most cost-efficient location is and a
concern, which has again been expressed across the Chamber, is that if
we are not able to provide additional forms of support in terms of
energy costs, manufacturing will migrate to overseas plants rather than
taking place in the UK. It will be an absolute tragedy if, as our
economy recovers and turns the corner, our manufacturers are not able
to take advantage of the growth in the economy and of the additional
effect that that will have on UK employment.</hs_Para>

is particularly important in respect of the cement industry, because
construction has been in a difficult place over the past five years. I
am told that the supply chain is starting to see a renaissance and
increased levels of activity, and I very much hope that our UK-based

huge efforts have been made over the years to improve energy
efficiency, with steel production now being 40% more efficient than it
was in 1975, it is becoming increasingly difficult to find additional
savings. It becomes harder and harder, and one thing I have asked the
Government before—and ask them again—is to take another
look at such things as enhanced capital allowances and renewable heat
incentives in order to try to recognise and incentivise increased
efficiency measures and better use of resources. In the long term, I
think we also need to raise that issue as part of the EU emissions
trading scheme, because when companies have really made a huge effort
to make massive improvements, which is obviously helping us all
globally to get emissions down, we need to try to recognise
that.</hs_Para>

and many other steel manufacturers already recycle waste products in
their factories and reuse a lot of the heat that they produce. Of
course, metals are highly recyclable substances, and, again, those are
the sorts of things that we should be supporting. However, it is a
highly competitive world and we know that if we want to see UK-produced
steel products and other products used in UK infrastructure, we have to
get the price right.</hs_Para>

the use of UK products, I really would like the Government to move
forward with the idea of targets for percentages of local content in
big infrastructure projects, and to look again at developing criteria
on local economic benefits in assessing tenders for major projects.
That has been done elsewhere in Europe, so it is not impossible to do
it and still keep within European regulations. This is very important,
and we could report how much local content was used, which would really
flag up how much we think it matters that UK products are used in UK
infrastructure.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T10:34:33"></hs_TimeCode>However, none of
that can happen unless we get a competitive price. We must have a
competitive price or we cannot even get out of the starting blocks on

is a major component cost, costing Tata Steel some £300 million
last year. That is a huge bill. If we take a conservative estimate and
say that energy costs are 60% more than in Germany—some
colleagues have quoted 70%—the difference even then can amount
to 
<?notus-xml column=274?>more than 10% of the product price. That is the difference between
people being able to sell their product and  not being able to.
It makes a massive difference to competitiveness, and it is virtually
impossible to offset that type of competitive disadvantage.</hs_Para>

the carbon price floor is a unilateral tax. It was introduced in the UK
and now we are in a muddle, trying to sort out the state aid rules in
order to give help, whereas if it had not been imposed in the first
place, we would not have to try and get the mitigation measure. The
carbon price floor is a major disadvantage, putting us at a
considerable competitive disadvantage as compared with places like
Germany and the Netherlands—we are not talking about cheap
labour countries, but comparable countries in
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120442000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120442000119"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T10:36:06"></hs_TimeCode>Having
said that, even if the state aid rules are sorted out, the rebate will
only be 80%, so there is still an outstanding 20% that we will not be
able to get. In addition, the renewables obligation is double what the
Government’s mitigation measures will give back, so there is a
real need to have a complete review of the whole green tax
issue—of the complexity, as has been mentioned, and of the fact
that the renewables obligation is what seems to be causing the most
difficulty. I ask the Government to have a real look at the cost
differential between the UK and elsewhere in Europe, which arises from
the renewables obligation. As has been mentioned, the costs in other
countries are something like 50 euro cents per megawatt-hour, whereas
here we are looking at £10.50 per megawatt-hour. That sort of
difference is creating a huge problem for our manufacturing
industry.</hs_Para>

cumulative impact. It is about looking at the whole picture of all the
different elements of the green taxes, not because the industries are
against them but because the industries want a level playing field and

Fallon:</Member></B> I agree with that, and I will come on to climate
change agreements later. The Government cannot control the volatility
of global fossil fuel prices, but we can help industry to exploit
energy efficiency potential, which will reduce the impact of rising
prices. Some of our incentives are financial ones. The climate change
levy is a tax on business energy use, and the EU emissions trading
system is a cap-and-trade mechanism based on the level of emissions of
energy intensive industries. The scheme is forecast to save the
equivalent of 3,100 megatonnes of CO<Sub>2 </Sub>by 2020. To complement
the EU ETS, we have a domestic scheme, the carbon reduction commitment
energy efficiency scheme, which 
<?notus-xml column=280?>targets large non-energy intensive organisations. That is predicted to
save the equivalent of 4,800 gigawatt-hours per year, which is greater
than the annual energy use of all households in
Manchester.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120442000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120442000156">In
addition to those financial incentives, we are working to incentivise
industry through several other mechanisms. Climate change agreements,
which the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent North (Joan Walley) referred
to, are aimed specifically at energy intensive industries. They provide
a discount on the climate change levy of 90% for electricity and 65%
for gas, in exchange for commitments to achieve energy efficiency. She
is right to remind us that they are a good example of an area in which
Government and industry can work together to agree achievable
objectives. More than 50 energy intensive sectors have negotiated
agreements under the latest phase of the scheme, which are expected to
result in an 11% energy efficiency improvement across participating
sectors by 2020. Looking ahead, we have recently consulted on the new
energy savings opportunity scheme, which will help larger businesses to
identify energy efficiency measures that will result in average bill
savings of £50,000 to £60,000 per year. Subject to
legislation, the first audits under the scheme will be undertaken by
December 2015.</hs_Para>

leg of our reforms is the recognition of the competitiveness problems
faced by some industries as a result of their energy costs, which lies
at the heart of today’s debate. Rising electricity prices are a
real concern for many businesses, which see them as a barrier to
growth. The commitments to tackling climate change that the House has
voted through have contributed to increases in those bills. That is why
we have set aside up to £400 million to offset some of the costs
of energy and climate change policies for the most energy intensive
industries.</hs_Para>

a low carbon economy, it is vital to ensure that the more energy
intensive industries are not placed at a competitive disadvantage in
Europe or across the world, and they are not forced to consider
relocating to other countries. Not only would that have a negative
impact on our economy, but it might result in our exporting emissions
to countries that are not strongly committed to cutting carbon
emissions. Many energy intensive businesses are located in areas that
have been hit hard by the economic downturn, so we have to ensure that
we give them the best support available.</hs_Para>

my constituency, which covers Corby and east Northamptonshire, podiatry
services are delivered through Northamptonshire Healthcare NHS

group and the Corby CCG initiated a public consultation on their
proposal to make changes to the delivery of podiatry services, based on
categorising the needs of patients as high, medium or low risk. I
received letters from constituents and had constituents attend my
surgery. For MPs, multiple contacts from constituents is sometimes a
warning sign that there might be a problem. My constituents were
concerned about the consultation, first, because they regarded it as
ineffective, as it failed to communicate or engage with the users of
podiatry services to any reasonable degree, and secondly because they
thought it token. We know that the public are at times sceptical about
consultation exercises, and with reason. It does not help when they see
them as being more about selling a solution—a predetermined
decision—than about genuinely engaging people in finding the

some of the

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence clinical guidance on
the prevention and management of diabetic foot complications sets out a
foot care management plan to reduce the risk of problems occurring in
those with diabetes. It is the clear view of the Society of
Chiropodists and Podiatrists that there are not enough podiatrists to
comply with the NICE clinical guidelines. We might expect the society
to make that argument, but it chimes with my concerns locally that we
have lost 16 podiatrists in our area. At a time of increasing
diabetes, a reduction in podiatrists gives me real cause for concern,
because the society’s view might be

500,000 hospital beds in England each year are occupied by people with

that podiatry might not be at the more glamorous end of the health

Diabetes UK within the first few weeks of taking on my new job as the

podiatrists. Health Education England is working to ensure that there
is an appropriate balance between supply and demand. We have already
talked about the likelihood—indeed, the certainty—that
demand for podiatry services will grow, because of our ageing
population. HEE looks at the number of training places being
commissioned. In collaboration with HEE, employers are also obviously
keen to ensure that there are sufficient podiatrists to deliver the
services that are needed. HEE will publish the national workforce plan
for England in early December—so, any time now. This year,
providers have forecast their future work force requirements, which are
obviously based on local service demand and which local education and
training boards have moderated, to make adjustments for their education
and training commissions. That piece of work is being gauged
sensitively to look at local demand and the need for service provision.
The assessment will be available in the published plan, which will show
the position right across
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T11:22:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120442000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120442000203">Obviously
that process looks to the future, but we already know that the number
of podiatrists working in the NHS has increased during the last 10
years, from 2,916 full-time equivalents in 2002 to 3,067 full-time
equivalents in 2012, which is an increase of about 5% during
that time. We are also continuing to develop the profession. The hon.
Gentleman rightly highlighted that this is an area in which we need
growing expertise. We introduced legislation that came into force
on 20 August 2013 that enables podiatrists and physiotherapists
to prescribe independently, following recommendations from the
Commission on Human Medicines. That means that podiatrists who
successfully complete education programmes approved by the Health and
Care Professions Council, including conversion courses to allow
existing supplementary prescribers to become independent prescribers,
can begin to prescribe independently in 2014. That is a helpful step
forward. Extending prescribing in this way will also help to support
the key role that podiatrists play in shifting care into the community
and improving the patient experience. It will benefit patients by
making it more convenient for them to get treatment, as well as
hopefully freeing up some valuable GP

we also need multi-disciplinary teamworking; we need people to be
joined up in their thinking. Obviously podiatry services are part of
that. The hon. Gentleman has eloquently raised the concerns of his
constituents and his own concerns this morning. One of the things that
he focused on was the question of who are low-risk patients and how is
someone assessed as low-risk. I understand that the CCGs involved
modified their recommendations for future service provision in response
to feedback received during the consultation, so children and
vulnerable patients will still be able to access community podiatry
services. However, I sense that his concern is that further work might
be needed to flesh that plan out, and I know that the CCGs will have
heard him express that concern; he has put it on the record today,
saying that he is still concerned that those recommendations might
still not be fully understood and that he would like to see more work
done in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T11:27:16"></hs_TimeCode>. I
believe that the analysis carried out by the CCGs showed that only 1%
of low-risk patients move into the medium or high- risk categories, but
I know that he will want to have ongoing discussions about the nature
of that assessment and about that particular figure.</hs_Para>

also believe that the CCGs involved took into consideration the number
of local independent podiatrists who are registered with their
professional body, with regard to the low-level community-based care.
They are also rightly exploring the potential of developing a broader
range of low-level foot care and podiatry services via the third sector
and social enterprises, as part of their emerging health and wellbeing
strategy. That is the right thing to do. Some of these services do not

be delivered more appropriately in another setting. I believe that one
of the advantages of an increasing emphasis on local planning and
integrated service planning at a local level is that people can think
outside the  box about where certain
services—particularly these important early alert services and
low-risk services that can prevent people from becoming a higher
risk—can be
delivered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T11:28:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

However, some of those concerns were based on speculation about what
might happen if this piece of work is not got right, and it is
important that we find the balance between having due concern about
what might happen if services are not got right and if the
commissioning of them is not right, and at the same time sending a very
clear signal to those people who have medical concerns, such as
diabetes or the early onset of other problems, that they must seek help
and that they will receive that help. They must not be put off seeking

Edward Leigh</B> (Gainsborough) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Mr Turner. I am grateful for this
opportunity to debate issues relating to the provision of dermatology
in the NHS. This area has received little parliamentary attention over
the years, given the considerable level of morbidity and mortality for
which skin disease is responsible. Indeed, I think I am right in saying
that this is the first debate in the House of Commons in several
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:30:29"></hs_TimeCode> on
dermatology and how it is treated in the

should declare an interest, because we are always supposed to. I have a
skin condition called rosacea. It is not that serious; I take
antibiotics every day and it is controllable, but it has, of course,

preparing for this debate, I consulted widely among the different
interests in skin disease, and I am grateful for the insights that I
was given. It is noteworthy that the same themes emerged from all
quarters. Skin disease is extensive and has a great impact. It results
in profound psychological consequences for many, especially for those
with severe variants of conditions. It is under-treated in the NHS, and
there are commissioning issues that relate partly to
dermatology’s continuing to be something of a Cinderella
disease. Talking to people, I heard the expression “Cinderella
disease” time and

crucially, there is wholly inadequate training, notably among general
practitioners, to enable doctors to handle the dermatology cases that
will come their way in day-to-day practice. Why is this? There is a
view that dermatology does not matter and that it does not kill. This
is both complacent and wrong. Many skin diseases have horrendous
effects, even when they are not fatal. Skin cancer is a major killer,
and there would be benefits from renewed focus on this disease, both to
help people avoid it in the first place and to identify and treat it
quickly where it

the United Kingdom population experience a skin condition in any

children have had it, and one of my boys suffered badly. Some children
suffer grievously from it. It can affect people of all ages, but is
primarily seen in children and affects up to 20% of children by the age

of course, in their parents. It causes major disruption to family life,

number of cases, acne is widespread and ever-present, producing
feelings of shame, despair and even, I am sorry to say, suicide in some
cases. Acne<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:36:09"></hs_TimeCode> is

is worth saying that serious psychological effects are sparked by skin
disease. We live in a society where we are subjected daily to images of
perfection, selling everything from make-up, fashion and holidays to
ice-cream. Skin conditions are sometimes very visible, and some people
are highly prejudiced against those who have them, and make little
attempt to hide that. That can lead to stress, depression, anxiety, and

the fact that skin disorders are both serious and the most likely
reason for someone to go to their GP, training and knowledge of
dermatology among primary care health professionals is generally very
limited. Perhaps “very” is wrong, but it is certainly
limited. Astonishingly, there is no compulsory requirement for
dermatology training in undergraduate or postgraduate medical
programmes of study. Dermatology is still not included in all
undergraduate medical school curriculums; it is optional in some, and
untested in others. In five to six years of medical training to become
a doctor, the average medical school offers—I found this
incredible— less than a fortnight of teaching in
dermatology. This is often combined with another so-called minor field
of medicine. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:39:20"></hs_TimeCode>
am told that many miss this teaching altogether, not regarding it as
important, and joke about taking a “dermaholiday”. That
is like the NHS employing an army of plumbers who are highly
knowledgeable about boilers and blocked drains but who do not know
how to trace a leak or mend a pipe. By failing to provide
adequate education in dermatology, which is an important field of

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> In a moment I will address the fact that
skin diseases can have fatal consequences. As GPs often do not have
adequate training, they are not able to spot
conditions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:40:38"></hs_TimeCode> that
can be very
dangerous.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000023">Training
is important. In a 2008 survey of final-year medical students, only 52%
of 449 respondents said that they felt they had the necessary skills to
manage skin conditions. A lack of education and training may lead to
fatal errors, and I stress that point because skin disease is not only
about psychological damage. Skin lesions mistakenly taken to be benign
can lead to cancer. Conversely, inappropriate referrals to secondary
care can be costly and are blocking up big parts of secondary care.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:49:37"></hs_TimeCode> awareness of
litigation increases in the NHS, GPs are, unsurprisingly, less and less
willing to take risks, so they refer more and more patients to
secondary care. I understand that the general hospital in

Friend the Member for Chesham and Amersham

exploding incidence of skin cancer, an ageing population and side
effects from new potent drugs are all driving referral rates. It has
been guesstimated that there are 100,000 cases of skin cancer a year in
the UK, but the number is not known for sure because the NHS does not
collect figures for cancers that are not melanomas. Work this year
suggests that the number may be nearer to 700,000; that is what
dermatologists tell me, because they are dealing with such a volume of
cases, day by
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:42:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000025">Studies
show that the skill of GPs in diagnosing skin lesions needs
improvement, and other studies raise concerns about the standard of
skin surgery offered in primary care. In 2012, the Royal College of
General Practitioners updated its curriculum statement on the care of
people with skin problems. The statement goes a long way towards
recognising dermatology as a key component of a GP’s training.
The statement sets out a number of expected key competences within the
field, but crucially, dermatology remains an optional component. For
undergraduates, the British Association of Dermatologists recommends a
two-week full-time attachment to a dermatology unit, with a realistic
assessment at the end of the course. The association thinks that
dermatology should also be taught when undergraduates work with general
practitioners in the community. When trainee GPs are undertaking their
two-year hospital placement, a six-month post in dermatology alone, in
a combined post such as dermatology and general medicine, or in a
combined minor specialty rotation would go a long way towards helping
trainee GPs to take a special interest in dermatology, which is what we

GP training period is likely to be lengthened by 12 months. I urge all
interested parties—Health Education England, the royal colleges,
the General Medical Council and the ultimate employer, NHS
England—to use half or all of that extra time on a proper
dermatology rotation, which would ensure that the GPs of the future are
properly equipped to address their future work load. If that is to
happen, funding must be made available to ensure that there is adequate

recently who said that one of his patients had not dared to go out for

lack of dermatology education applies not only to GPs but to nurses and

General Medical Council, working with the Royal College of General
Practitioners, the British Association of Dermatologists, the Royal
College of Nursing and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, plus Health
Education England and NHS England, has a duty to ensure that urgent
priority is given to the provision of proper dermatological training
for all GPs, nurses and pharmacists. That training should surely
emphasise that most inflammatory skin diseases are long-term conditions
and are likely to need ongoing care, often throughout a
patient’s life. Similarly, the psychological effects of skin
disease should be considered an integral part of any dermatological
training course; I echo my right hon. Friend’s important point
on that issue. There is good evidence for the effectiveness of general
practitioners with a special interest in dermatology working within
appropriate accreditation frameworks. More needs to be done to expand
that group of clinicians, which is still all too small.</hs_Para>

addition to poor training at primary care level, there is also an issue
with the number of consultant dermatologists. I pay tribute to my
consultant, Professor Chris Bunker, who is well known in the field and
is president of the British Association of Dermatologists. Compared
with mainland Europe, the ratio of consultant dermatologists to the
general population remains low in the UK, at 1:130,000. It is
estimated that there is a 20% shortfall in consultant numbers in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000033">Furthermore,
there are significant issues related to vacancies in dermatology
consultant posts—there were some 180 consultant vacancies at the
last count. That is due both to an inability to attract people to posts
in remote areas, and to the widespread problem of funding being
available for a post but the relevant deanery refusing to provide a
training number that allows the post to be filled by a
trainee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000034">As
well as being unpleasant and demoralising for patients, some skin
conditions kill; that must be emphasised. Skin conditions are not just
a psychological problem. There were nearly 4,000 deaths due to skin
disease in 2005, of which 1,817 were due to malignant melanoma, which
is now the UK’s most common cancer. That is against a background
of 13,000 malignant melanomas each year, a level that has increased 50%
in little more than a decade. Those figures continue to rise, driven by
the wide availability of cheap holidays in the sun, the continued
fashion for using sunbeds, and the inadequate resourcing of awareness
campaigns. We must do more about that; improved public funding for
awareness campaigns, better training and stronger regulation of the use
of sunbeds are some of the most obvious answers to the problem, yet
very little, if anything, ever 
<?notus-xml column=295?>happens. Despite skin disease being very common, the
direct cost to the NHS of providing skin care is relatively modest. The
overall direct cost to the NHS in England and Wales was some
£1.82 billion at the last estimate, in 2006.</hs_Para>

2013, there is no policy lead for dermatology in the Department of
Health or NHS England; I put that point directly to the Minister. The
majority of dermatology services are commissioned by clinical
commissioning groups, but national oversight is necessary to
co-ordinate care across the country and to drive the agenda. Prior to
the April 2013 switchover, primary care trusts were responsible for
commissioning dermatology services, but the Department did at least
have a policy lead on overseeing service provision. No similar post now
exists in NHS England, meaning that no one—I hope the Minister
can reassure us on this—champions this area, spots good
practice, or drives

recently stated in the other place that dermatology would be spread
across the five domains of NHS England, and that it would not, as was
previously thought, sit primarily under long-term conditions in domain
2. That surely only heightens the need for a director to co-ordinate
policy across the five domains. Even if only a junior post were to be
created, patients and health professionals would be given a clear line
of accountability, and a person to whom they could appeal who was above
their local CCG lead for commissioning. Given the prevalence of skin
disease, a national clinical director for dermatology, which is what I
am calling for, would not look out of place among the long list of such
posts at NHS England. I urge it to consider such an
appointment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000037">There
is a lack of sources of peer-group, independent advice for people with
skin conditions. Patient support organisations are mainly charitable
institutions that rely, for the most part, on donations from
individuals and pharmaceutical companies. People with skin disease
place great value on the information and help provided by dermatology
patient support groups. Skin disease is not a well-resourced area, and
such groups struggle to make ends meet. There is no group at all, for
example, to provide support to people with acne, the previous group
having run out of funds some years ago. Given that such charities are
almost certainly a cost-effective way to provide what might be
life-saving support to patients, perhaps the NHS should consider being
a little more generous in its
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000038">I
thank all those who have helped me to prepare this speech,
particularly the British Association of Dermatologists. It is clear
that a small number of important steps would make the greatest
difference in this area of disease, including the appointment of a
national clinical director to co-ordinate learning around the NHS, and
to drive uptake of new ideas and change. More important, however, is
persuading the relevant bodies that I have mentioned to ensure that
undergraduates emerge from medical school with a reasonable grasp of
dermatology, and that newly appointed GPs can recognise a malignant
melanoma, which is probably the most important point of all. Those
changes alone would have far-reaching, positive consequences for
dermatology and for those with skin disease, and I urge the Minister to
consider what can be done to make them a reality. I hope that this
debate will make some

this debate. I have tried quite often and failed, so he obviously gets
on better with Mr Speaker than I do or has better luck in
the ballot system. I also congratulate him on producing many of the
statistics and conclusions that the all-party parliamentary group on

is an important and reclusive area in the national health service, but
I must start by making some declarations of interest, as we are
supposed to do. First, as part of clinical practice, I have seen and
referred patients with a number of skin conditions. The treatment of
some has been urgent—my hon.
Friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:54:01"></hs_TimeCode> mentioned
melanomas—and some semi-urgent, such as basal cell carcinomas.
Such carcinomas are commonly called rodent ulcers and are just chopped
out, but when I was in Palermo a few years ago I saw one that had been
left on the side of a gentleman’s face and that looked something
like a small, underdone McDonald’s hamburger. We do not see such
things here, so whatever we say about the condition of dermatology in
this country, that has gone—thank goodness. There are a number
of common and disfiguring conditions. My hon. Friend touched on acne
and a number of other chronic diseases, such as psoriasis, all of which
some people do nothing about, but for which help is available if they
look for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000041">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:54:52"></hs_TimeCode>,
I am chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on skin. I must
admit that, shortly after the election, I was pressurised, bullied,
pushed and dragged, kicking and screaming, to accept the post. One
problem with many things that we do in this House is that, once close
to something, it is hard not to get drawn in. It is a fascinating and
complex area with a definite recognition problem. It is just not seen
and accepted. My hon. Friend talked about funding but also touched on
his family’s clinical problems; I shall resist doing so as my
sons would never allow me. The area could do with more money, but more
could be done more effectively with what we have. Much improvement can
be made through education, which my hon. Friend touched on, a change in
service approach and, most of all, a recognition of
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000042">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:55:57"></hs_TimeCode>
of the first really quite shocking points that was made to me as
chairman of the APPG was that while skin conditions account for the
greatest proportion of patient visits to GPs, undergraduate education
in such conditions for doctors, including those who will become GPs, is
minuscule. I risk repeating my hon. Friend’s point, but it is
worthy of repetition. Many student doctors spend a few weeks, possibly
only one week, studying skin diseases and conditions. I am not sure
whether it still applies, but I believe that education in skin
conditions is optional in some medical schools. If someone wants to
become a GP and opts not to learn about such conditions, they are in
for one heck of a shock or run the risk of doing their patients a
disservice. It is quite staggering considering that dermatologists are
expected to manage over 2,000 different diseases of the skin, hair and
nails.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000043">Reputedly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:59:45"></hs_TimeCode>,
as has been mentioned, 54% of the population are affected by skin
disease each year, and, as my hon. Friend said, some 4,000 deaths are
attributed to skin 
<?notus-xml column=297?>disease annually in the UK. Generally, the horrendous malignant melanoma
is the main cause. The incidence of
melanomas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:57:11"></hs_TimeCode> has
increased by 50% over the past 13 years. The hot spots are
many and varied and include Glasgow and areas of Surrey. I do not know
why that is and I am not sure that anyone does. Skin cancer is the most
common cancer and is the second most common cancer causing deaths in
young adults. Prevalence of basal cell carcinoma equals that of all
other cancers combined and increased by 133% between 1980 and 2000.
Hand eczema is one of the most common reasons for disablement benefit
in the United Kingdom, yet skin disease hardly ranks in the education
that goes towards the basic medical
degree.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000044">As
has been mentioned, we have
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:57:56"></hs_TimeCode>780 funded posts
for consultant dermatologists in the United Kingdom, which is a
positive. That would be impressive, but, as has also been mentioned,
180 to 200 vacancies need to be filled. To add to the difficulties,
many of the posts are filled by locums who are not fully accredited
dermatologists. Even more concerning is that there are few specialist
facilities, which are not ordinary hospital facilities but those that
provide specialist dermatological treatment, including dedicated
dermatology psychology practitioners. It is little recognised that many
skin diseases are always present or threatening to be present and can
cause devastating effects on a person’s physical well-being and
can lead to serious psychological
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0001.htm#13120461000045">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:58:01"></hs_TimeCode>
all-party parliamentary group on skin has produced evidence that
highlights the extensive impact that skin disease can have on all
aspects of patients’ lives, such as school, work or personal
relationships and, as a result, self-esteem. Such conditions often
affect career choices and even such basic things as where an individual
can go on holiday. Who would want to sit on a beautiful beach or to go
swimming from it when hit by eczema, psoriasis or any of the various
pigment conditions? It just does not bear thinking about.
Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T14:59:36"></hs_TimeCode> conditions
can obliterate what many of us would expect to be normal social, sexual
or leisure activities. According to the British Skin Foundation,
approximately 50% of people who suffer from skin conditions have been
victims of verbal abuse—we can imagine a child with psoriasis in
a school. One in six has self-harmed and 17% have contemplated or
attempted suicide.</hs_Para>

major ask of the Minister, it is that she go to one of the
few—but top—skin clinics, particularly one that includes
psychological treatment as a norm. She should talk to some of the
patients with psoriasis or a number of other such disfiguring diseases.
They are not necessarily death-causing, but they totally obliterate
normal life. She can see how they are handling their conditions, as
well as how modern medicine can improve their lives, in particular if
they get psychiatric help. Most can be helped to keep their conditions
at bay, but part of the package should require psychological
help—we have an APPG paper on this. I ask the Minister to meet
those patients, who range from the very
young—babies—right through to the very old, and watch and
listen to how they cope. That should encourage a national rethink on
how the NHS treats this massive and often unrecognised area of
medicine.</hs_Para>

hope that following our debate and in particular the point made by my
hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough, she will ask some pertinent 
<?notus-xml column=298?>questions about how commissioners draw up local service specifications
for the bidding process for dermatological services. The parameters of
dermatology bids need to be drawn up with expertise and experience,
which many CCGs do not have. I hope that the Minister can encourage,
bully, push and cajole those CCGs to buy in, pull in and seek expertise
when drawing up the specifications. The British Association of
Dermatologists recommends that before carrying out a service tender,
commissioners should undertake a health care needs assessment and a
review of the current service provision and, most importantly, consult

greatest change necessary is to encourage education. That has already
been touched on at some length. The lack of knowledge among
practitioners and clinicians is the problem. We need better
education in the under- graduate curriculum and further improvement in
post- graduate training, perhaps with a continuing professional
development requirement. Training is also required to produce more
consultants, more doctors and psychologists with a professional
interest in dermatology and more specialist nurses. That is not a big
ask, considering the size of the problem.</hs_Para>

area where investing more on education at every level, with
better provision of specialist clinics should, in due course, ease some
of the costs and pressures, in particular on primary care. There would
therefore be a positive payback. I reiterate, however, the importance
of the Minister seeing things first hand. I would be delighted to

and Amersham (Mrs Gillan), but if something good is happening, we
should exchange those ideas to help each other. That is something that
we initiated in relation to dermatology overall as well as skin cancer.
In the past year, the Health and Social Care Board invested some
£1 million recurrently and another £3 million
non-recurrently in dermatology services, including psoriasis drugs.
That is for a population in Northern Ireland, as the Minister will
know, of 1.8 million, which puts the amount invested into some

second son, like the hon. Member for Gainsborough, was born with what I
would refer to as scaly skin, or eczema. I have to say that I did not
wash him very often, but my wife would always wash him morning and
evening up to about the age of six or seven, as well as creaming him
twice a day. What was interesting was that eventually the eczema left
him, but, as that left him, something else took its place: asthma. That
was an unusual reaction, but as the eczema left, the asthma increased,
so there is obviously, as the doctor at the time made us aware, a
medical connection between the two conditions. The interaction was
close and
clear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0002.htm#13120461000059">The

Northern Ireland. The board is working with the others to finalise
their recurrent funding requirements, which are estimated 
<?notus-xml column=300?>to be about £500,000. I mention that strategy of working together
with the trusts because trusts and councils on the mainland could come

those cancers are usually completely curable. One cancer, if caught in

happened. As part of the pilot, GP practices can refer patients with
suspected malignant melanoma or—forgive my Northern Ireland

clinic, which is used to triage the patient, thus reducing unnecessary
out-patient attendances. That pilot can shorten the process and focus

drugs—drugs for the skin—can have severe side effects,

issue of Roaccutane and the need for rigorous up-to-date research to
ascertain why some groups of patients are more vulnerable to its severe
side effects than others. When I say there are severe side effects, I
should point out that there have been some incredibly tragic cases, in
which young people who have been prescribed the drug have suffered
terrible depression, and that has sometimes gone on for many months or
even years after treatment has concluded. A number of young people have
also committed suicide, and that is thought to be as a result of having
taken this drug. Sadly, we lack up-to-date research and scientific
evidence that proves a causal link between Roaccutane and suicide.

would like to take the opportunity of today’s debate to
highlight some points to the Minister. About 13 million
people will present at their GP with a skin condition, and family
doctors spend a significant proportion of their time treating patients
with a skin problem, so dermatology is a significant part of the work
of primary care. Dermatologists are concerned that the time they are
spending on these conditions is not matched by the investment in
research and that dermatology is something of a Cinderella service, as
we have heard.</hs_Para>

overall burden of skin disease is large and growing, and to that mix we
can add a lack of consultants and the drugs that can have a seriously
negative impact on mental well-being, so it is not surprising that
there are real concerns. With the specific case of Roaccutane in mind,
I suggest that there needs to be better investigation of the causal
link between the use of Isotretinoin and depression, self-harm and even
suicide. That research is long overdue, and I have no doubt that it
will fall to the Department of Health to make sure it is funded. I urge
the Minister carefully to consider the case, which I wholeheartedly

would like to take the Minister back to the subject of Roaccutane. It
is a highly toxic drug, intended for use in only the most severe cases,
and requiring very close supervision. It can be prescribed only by a
dermatologist, the very specialism in which as I have explained there
is a shortage; so patient waiting times increase, and the time the
consultant has to spend with each patient reduces, along with the
opportunity to discuss changes in their mood or mental well-being. The
time for follow-up care is inevitably limited. That all comes together
to give patients the impression of long waits and rushed appointments
and results in a greater temptation to find a private consultant and
pay for a private prescription. Among the families of people who
suffered negative effects from Roaccutane, several have emphasised to
me how many young people who had self-harmed were in 
<?notus-xml column=303?>receipt of private prescriptions because the
families were too desperate to wait the six months for an NHS

experience of consultant dermatologists working in the NHS has been
nothing short of fantastic. The professionals with whom I have been in
contact are dedicated and determined to get the best outcomes for their
patients; and they have cut no corners. However, the growing
dermatology case load puts them in an increasingly difficult
position—perhaps particularly on the south coast. In places such
as my constituency there are longer hours of sunshine and high life
expectancy, and the incidence of cases of skin cancer is increasing.
That all adds up to a stretched service. A local consultant
dermatologist wrote to me outlining what he called a work force crisis,
with a national shortage of consultants and considerable variation in
the quality of dermatology provision across the country, as services
are increasingly provided by those without appropriate levels of
training. That cannot go on. The service is demoralised and under
pressure, and is struggling to identify where the next generation of
skin experts will come from.</hs_Para>

personal connection, because after my mum died my father, who was 62,
developed psoriasis. The Psoriasis Association tells me that the
average member has been living with psoriasis for 32 years. The
personal toll of living with the disease and its cumulative impact,
which commits people to lifelong skin care, is enormous. The effects
are felt beyond the individual and reach to people’s families,
employment prospects and participation in society. The painful plaques
are highly visible, which leads to rejection and stigma on top of
everything else. Worse, 40% of people with severe psoriasis will
develop psoriatic arthritis, which can lead to more pain as well as
joint

consultant posts in the UK are unfilled, out of a total of 830. In
Ormskirk, the dermatology service struggles to attract doctors to fill
full-time roles. It has a work load roughly equivalent to that of
nearby St Helens, but whereas St Helens has seven consultants, Ormskirk
has two. We also need specialist nursing capacity, and more space in
the department. Nearby services have several light therapy machines,
but Ormskirk has only one, meaning my constituents have to wait six or
eight weeks for treatment—once they have had their referral, and
on average there is an eight to 12-week wait just to be seen by a
specialist. Ormskirk is an award-winning service, yet the team there do
not have the resources they need.</hs_Para>

showed wide variations in treatment. Access to specialist treatments
such as biologic drugs, specialist nurse support and psychological
services is sporadic throughout the country. Access to psychological
support is a major theme of the new quality standard for people with
psoriasis, yet 80% of the 170 dermatology departments that responded to
the 2013 BAD audit of services reported having no access whatever to
psychological support for patients.</hs_Para>

research that early intervention and appropriate treatment for
psoriasis will contribute to a person’s psychological well-being
and ability to continue in the working environment. It really is not
enough simply to treat the skin. I have seen pioneering dermatology
services where patients have access to a resident psychologist as a
routine part of their treatment. I want and need that level of support
for my constituents. I hope that the Minister will encourage
commissioners and dermatology services across the country to look at
the evidence base and adopt that model.</hs_Para>

mean that we need to find a magical pot of new money; it means using
existing tools to incentivise what works best. That could even save
money in some cases. Commissioning groups are held to account through
the outcomes indicator set; will the Minister encourage the National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence to develop indicators covering
dermatology? As in other areas, in dermatology we need better
co-ordination between primary and secondary care; will the Minister
encourage NICE to create a quality and outcomes framework indicator on
dermatology, to incentivise that? Eventually, it would be great to see
a best practice tariff or a national CQUIN—commissioning for
quality and innovation—payment framework for psoriasis. At the
moment, dermatology is such a Cinderella service that that seems
ambitious, but we must aim for it. We need central clinical leadership
to push dermatology up the agenda, to promote quality improvement and
to reduce local variation.</hs_Para>

Minister will tell us why, when other specialists are getting going
with their strategic clinical networks and have plenty of clinical
leadership from the centre, dermatology does not even have a national
clinical director. From a response to a written question back in May, I
learned that NHS England does not have a single person responsible for
dermatology. Will she tell us whether that is still the case? We must
recognise the burden that psoriasis places on people’s lives,
and ensure that dermatology services are properly joined up and
properly funded. I hope that the Minister will task NHS England with
making that
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0002.htm#13120461000097">Finally,

is a wide-ranging umbrella word covering more than 2,000 conditions of
varying severity, all of which have a detrimental impact on the quality
of life of those who are affected. “Cancer” is also a
wide-ranging word denoting many different types, including basal cell
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, malignant melanoma and others such
as Kaposi’s sarcoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Dermatology
also covers skin rashes, skin infections and acne. Acne and skin rashes
may not seem to be serious medical issues and do not often cause such
serious complications as other skin conditions may do, but they are far
from trivial, as we have heard, and may have a huge impact on the
psychological well-being of the individuals who suffer from
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0002.htm#13120461000102">The
wide-ranging nature of dermatological practice means that episodes of
treatment for conditions are extremely common. Skin cancer is one of
the most common cancers in the world, as we have heard, and the NHS
estimates that there are around 100,000 new cases of non-melanoma skin
cancer in the UK each and every year. Thankfully, through excellent
research and brilliant work by professionals and charities alike, skin
cancer is becoming more and more treatable, but it is not “job
done” and we must continue to strive for even better patient
outcomes. I am sure that all hon. Members

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Jane
Ellison):</Member></B> It is a pleasure to speak under your
chairmanship, Mr Turner. I pay tribute to the hon. Members who have
spoken today and particularly to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:50:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) for securing the
debate. As has been illustrated throughout, this is an under-discussed
area and it seems to be neglected in other ways, too. The debate has
been valuable, and I have certainly learnt a lot during its course and
in my preparation for it. Inevitably, there will be some points on
which I cannot give a full answer today, but I shall endeavour to
follow up with hon. Members if I cannot. I also pay tribute to the
all-party parliamentary group on skin. I have looked at the
recommendations in its recent report, and I pay tribute to the members
of the group who have spoken today.</hs_Para>

have heard from several Members how many people are affected by skin
disease and I shall not go over those numbers, which are very large
indeed. There is a huge range of skin diseases; some are manageable and
others are life-threatening, as we have heard. All have an impact on
people’s lives and, in particular, can affect their personal
appearance, as Members have highlighted in moving terms. In that way,
skin<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:52:02"></hs_TimeCode> problems
perhaps represent more of a day-to-day challenge than many other
conditions. They impact on all aspects of life, such as employment and
personal relationships. It is, therefore, important to ensure that
people with skin disease receive both the treatment and support that
they need. As today’s debate has highlighted, considerable
challenges remain, many of which we have not necessarily bottomed out
during the debate, but we have begun to highlight some.</hs_Para>

me first plug the national framework. Skin disease is a long-term
condition, and through the NHS mandate we have made it clear to NHS
England that we want to see the NHS among the best in Europe at
supporting people with long-term conditions. We want them to live
healthily and independently, with better control over the care that
they receive. Those improvements are monitored through the NHS outcomes
framework, for which ambitious expectations have been set out. In turn,
the NHS will monitor the performance of clinical commissioning groups
through the clinical commissioning group outcomes indicator set, on the
quality of the services and health outcomes achieved through that
commissioning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0002.htm#13120461000119">As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:52:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough highlighted, commissioning for most
dermatology services is a matter for CCGs. They are better placed to
use their clinical insight, local knowledge and local relationships to
do excellent commissioning at a local level than Ministers in
Whitehall, but I take on board the challenge about the more specialist
areas. We are not leaving CCGs to commission without support. NHS
England is working closely with them to ensure high-quality
commissioning, and it has established commissioning support units and
quality surveillance groups across the country. However, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:53:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) said, it is certainly
something that I can raise on appropriate visits when the opportunity
arises. As the public health Minister, given that so much of my
portfolio is localised, I am very keen to draw attention to good
practice where we see it.</hs_Para>

example in the area of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:53:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough, where his local CCG has introduced a
teledermatology pathway, which allows patients to be reviewed at their
own practice. We also heard of an excellent example from
Buckinghamshire, which I was speaking about with my right hon. Friend
the Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan) during the break for
the Division. The pathway in the area of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:53:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Gainsborough is being implemented across 10 practices
from September. If it is successful, it will be rolled out across all
the practices in the Lincolnshire West CCG. I am always interested to
hear about good practice. A number of kind invitations for visits have
been made during the debate and I look forward to following those up
with Members so we can highlight people who are being innovative in a
way that will help other commissioners.</hs_Para>

mentioned, with some highly specialist dermatology services for
conditions that cannot be treated locally, it is appropriate for NHS
England to commission them directly. NHS England has set out detailed
service specifications for the services that it directly commissions. I
realise that a number of Members have made points about the national
clinical director, and that issue has been raised in other contexts,
too. It is a matter for NHS England whether it appoints a national
clinical director. I understand, from asking it the question, that
there are no current plans to introduce an NCD for dermatology, but it
is continuing to discuss with the British Association of Dermatologists
the best ways to improve outcomes for patients.</hs_Para>

has been said, aspects of treatment of people with skin conditions can
be considered under any of the five domains. That change in the new NHS
focuses on 
<?notus-xml column=310?>people as individuals rather than on their conditions, which is why the
patient pathway and not the organisations that treat them is given the
closest attention. Many of the national clinical directors have
cross-cutting roles—I have come across that in other areas of my
portfolio—rather than roles that are related to individual
medical conditions, so it is not the case that dermatology is being
singled out. Clinical directors often cut across.</hs_Para>

is interest in the research—points have made about
it—that is going on to get better results in dermatology and to
come up with new treatment, so I shall touch on that. I reassure the
Chamber that investment by the National Institute for Health Research
in skin research increased from £4.7 million in 2010-11 to
£8.7 million in 2012-13. That includes the NIHR
investing £2.6 million over five years in the biomedical
research centre at Guy’s and St Thomas’ and the
King’s College London centre, which is leading the way in
research on cutaneous medicine. The NIHR is dedicated to translating
these scientific discoveries into improvements in treatment, which we
hope will benefit patients at the earliest opportunity.</hs_Para>

NIHR has also awarded nearly £2 million to Salford Royal NHS
Foundation Trust to undertake a programme of research on psoriasis. The
studies will look at crucial issues, including individual patient
experience, difficulties faced by service providers and identifying
levels of risk in populations. I hope that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T15:57:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for West Lancashire (Rosie Cooper) will take particular comfort from
that, and I am sure that she will be interested in the outcome of that
programme. The NIHR is also investing nearly £1 million in a
trial of silk therapeutic clothing for the long-term management of
eczema in children.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Gainsborough will know that NICE has also
published guidance on a range of dermatological conditions, including
atopic eczema in children and psoriasis, and it has issued quality
standards on those topics. NHS England is statutorily required to have
regard to NICE quality standards, and we expect health and care
professionals to take NICE guidance on the treatment of relevant
conditions fully into account when deciding how to treat a
patient.</hs_Para>

has also recommended a number of drugs for the treatment of
dermatological conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Patients have a
right in the NHS constitution to access drugs and treatments

want to prescribe.</hs_Para>

I acknowledged earlier, and as has been very much illustrated during
the debate, skin disease can have adverse psychological effects on
patients. The NICE quality standard on psoriasis recognises that and
sets out that people with psoriasis should be offered an assessment of
how their physical, psychological and social well-being is affected
when they are diagnosed and when they undergo treatment. It is the
responsibility of all commissioners, providers and clinicians to ensure
that patients receive the psychological and emotional support that they
need. Hon. Members may be aware of the IAPT—improving access to
psychological therapies —programme, which is an NHS programme
rolling out services across England offering interventions for people
with depression and anxiety disorders. I understand that as part of
that programme, NHS England is looking 
<?notus-xml column=311?>at how best to support people with psychological
problems arising from their physical problems. That issue was raised a
number of times during the debate.</hs_Para>

organisations around the world are asking us to rethink. They fear that
the changes set a dangerous precedent for non-democratic regimes, and
our Foreign Secretary agrees. Why, then, are we going down this road?
True democracies erect a barrier between Government and the press for
good reasons, and there is no excuse for dismantling it. It is claimed
that the royal charter protects press freedom because it can be changed
only by a two-thirds majority in Parliament, but that is illusory. Such
a majority rule was enacted in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act
2013, but a simple amendment would allow a future Government to sweep
it away at any time with a single-vote majority. Even the two-thirds
safeguard is misleading, especially when we consider how an emotive
topic such as Syria nearly persuaded 
<?notus-xml column=315?>the House to take the country to war. Large
majorities are not as rare as the charter would have us believe,

war or cracking down on the press.</hs_Para>

November 2012, he called for “voluntary, independent

from voluntary, independent or self-regulating. The newspapers and
magazines that it covers include the 1,000-plus regional and local
papers that were exonerated by the Leveson inquiry, none of which was

shall take the opportunity provided by the debate to discuss the issues
raised about the royal charter. It is more than a year since Lord
Justice Leveson—Sir Brian Leveson—published his report,
which ran to an astonishing 1,987 pages in length and, I think, 5 lb in
weight. The report covered a vast territory. It examined the existing
self-regulatory structure of the press, as one of its core
themes. It set recommendations—to which the Government
responded—for, I would say, a reformed system of independent
press self-regulation. Let me take this opportunity to remind the House
what those recommendations
were.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13120461000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/halltext/131204h0002.htm#13120461000188">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T16:27:58"></hs_TimeCode>
key elements of the recommendations in the report can be summarised as

was having the maintenance of press self-regulation at the heart of the
new system that delivers the key principles set out in the report. The
third was to have incentives that encouraged the press to use that
self-regulation system and created benefits for those who signed up to
and followed it. In addition, an independent recognition body should be

avoided and why a royal charter was chosen to establish the recognition
function instead. It is important to get the point across that
politicians will not be able to meddle with the charter at whim. There
are clear safeguards built into the charter to ensure that it cannot be
amended unless a very high, strict bar has been surpassed. Any proposed
change must be ratified by a resolution of both the House of Commons

that the royal charter could not be meddled with at will. The statute
states clearly that change would need the unanimous agreement of the
recognition panel, and that both the House of Commons and the House of

stress that the independent self-regulation body that is being set up

entirely a matter for the press whether they choose to seek recognition
for that body. As I have said, the benefits that come through being
recognised by the recognition panel are entirely voluntary. I do not

is a growing issue. I have had a number of cases in my constituency of
Poplar and Limehouse in the past 16 years involving people in very
expensive properties; professional and qualified individuals, residents
who paid large sums of money for the homes that they
inhabit. They are being ripped off and exploited by unscrupulous
property management companies and individuals who have spawned these
management companies.</hs_Para>

own local perspective. However, this is a national issue. As I
understand it, about 5 million people are in leasehold tenure in the
United Kingdom and only one other country has that degree of tenure. A
note on the statutory instrument that we debated last week in
Committee—the Redress Schemes for Lettings Agency Work and
Property Management Work (Approval and Designation of Schemes)
(England) Order 2013—said that 40% of all new properties are
under leasehold tenure. East London, where we have massive regeneration
and lots of new properties and conversions, is I think one of the areas
with the biggest number of properties under leasehold tenure.

we were in government, I know that we tried to address the issue to a
certain extent. We had a number of stabs at it, but sadly we did not
cover it. I am very hopeful that the Minister will be able to say that
the coalition are still very interested in the subject and want to
address it.</hs_Para>

is not just leasehold tenure that is an issue. I have to
declare that I live on an estate that was previously managed by
Peverel, which was previously owned by the Tchenguiz brothers, who were
quite notorious. I know that there is an Office of Fair Trading report
that is due out this Friday; I will mention that later. I am a
freeholder, but because I am on an estate that is run by a property
management company I have a covenant and therefore I am included and
have a role to play. I want to put that on record, so that I am not
accused of any conflict of interest.</hs_Para>

the reforms in the statutory instrument, there are still specific
problems, including unfair charges for repairs, insurance and
electricity supply, and complex procedures for residents to seek
redress; those procedures are supposed to be informal. When residents
get to land valuation tribunals—I know that the structure of
those tribunals is itself being reformed—property management
companies turn up with heavyweight legal teams, including barristers,
and put people under massive pressure. One other difficulty is that,
even where residents win their legal cases, the legal costs incurred by
the property management companies, which were supposed to be 
<?notus-xml column=324?>capped at £5,000 but are not, suddenly appear
on the bills of the residents for the following year as part of their

Fitzpatrick:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend anticipates a point that
I will make later, namely that these problems are not restricted by
class, age or geography. They relate to properties ranging from
pensioner and retirement flats that have a value of only £50,000
through to million-pound properties in my part of east London. However,
when we are talking about pensioners in their retirement homes and
other such communities, the trauma and the stress caused by these
issues is even greater. Although there are some restrictions in the
legislation about the level of fees that these property management
companies can charge, and measures dealing with the ability of local
authorities to prosecute these companies when they see that there is a
transgression, local authorities appear to be unwilling or unable to
respond legally.</hs_Para>

know of a number of cases. In my constituency, I have two high-profile
cases running at the moment: one on the Canary Riverside development
and one on the West India Quay development. Both involve companies
owned by the Yianis Group and are operated by Octagon Assets. They are
in major disputes with residents, who have real problems in getting
their situations resolved. The right to manage estate ballots procedure
is very complex, especially where there are absentee owners who are
sub-letting, and it is also very expensive. At the Kingsmere
development in Brighton, it cost residents £30,000 to take
action and they failed to secure the right to manage their own
properties. An individual in Battersea, Mr Dennis Jackson, entered a
dispute with his property management company about £7,000. He
incurred legal costs of £76,000 and nearly lost his
£800,000 flat, which he now has to sell to pay for his legal
fees. That example shows the level of professional individuals we are
talking about. They have to relocate to deal with the problems they
have had to face.</hs_Para>

fact that something needs to happen to make things fair, to give people
freedom and to avoid what I have called criminal behaviour in leasehold
deals, price-fixing cartels, the cheating of freeholders and excessive
exit fees and fiddles. Opportunist lawyers are playing the system, and
at times the Property Chamber—or the Leasehold Valuation
Tribunal, as it was—has not been led with the determination that
secures justice for people sorting out ordinary disputes between a

would like to invite the barrister Justin Bates, for example, to say
out loud the ways in which opportunist managing agents and freeholders
can frustrate an application to the Leasehold Valuation Tribunal or the
first stage of the Property Chamber, where, as the hon. Gentleman said,
the fee is fixed at £500, yet a lawyer can explain to the
respondent, the managing agent or the freeholder, “You
can make applications to delay the hearing, you can apply to go to the
county court or you can bounce between the two. And, by the way, if you
take the advice of some lawyers and apply for the right to manage, it
can take up to 18 months for the courts to dispose of the fact that you
do not have to have the letters RTM in the name of the proposed
management company that would replace the managing agency appointed by
the freeholder.” As my hon. Friend the Minister will
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T17:02:06"></hs_TimeCode>, the
freeholder appoints and gives instructions to the managing agent, and
the freeholder has every interest in the managing agent doing what the

first became involved in the matter indirectly because of my Worthing
home, which is leasehold. The other five owners and I took up an offer
from the freeholder to buy the freehold. It took us two exchanges of
letters to agree a price. The managing agent appointed by the
freeholder was very good, and we continue to use that managing agent
now. That is an example of how the system is supposed to work. If we
had had a dispute over the price, we could have gone to the Leasehold
Valuation Tribunal and solved it, but we did not need to do

recognised that what it had done was wrong and it offered
£70,000 to the leaseholders, which was accepted. The sum was

leaseholders and others. Since 2010 the Government have become
increasingly aware of the issues in the residential leasehold sector,
particularly to do with the quality of service. The Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Act 2013 gives the Secretary of State for Communities
and Local Government the power to require all residential letting
agents and property management agents in England to be members of a
Government-approved redress scheme. We are making good progress on
implementing those powers, and we expect to start approving such

make as much sense as hon. Members deserve. The leasehold
right-to-manage legislation is designed to be available to as many
private sector leaseholders living in blocks of flats as possible. The
right was designed for use on a block-by-block basis. Applying the
legislation to estates is complex and might result in the right
becoming less, rather than more, accessible. Right-to-manage ballots
can be complex and 
<?notus-xml column=329?>potentially expensive, and the legislation sets out in detail the
procedures that all involved must obviously follow and comply with. The
provisions aim to protect the interests of all parties, including those

part, the question of the ability of property management companies to
recover their legal costs from leaseholders, even in cases where the
leaseholder is the successful party, by adding them on as service
charges for the following year. Whether the landlord can recover his
legal costs, and if so, in what way will depend on the terms of the
individual lease. Even when a lease does allow the recovery of legal
costs as a service charge, the courts and tribunals still have the
power to prevent that from happening by issuing what is known as a
section 20C—of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985—order, if
they judge it appropriate. Of course, to get such an order does require
someone to go through the court or tribunal. Each case will be
determined on its merits, and independent legal advice should be
obtained, but where leaseholders believe that they have grounds to do
so, they should consider applying to the court or tribunal for such an
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-12-04T17:13:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

for Difference are one of the main mechanisms created as part of the
electricity market reform (EMR) programme. EMR is the central component

will stimulate investment in all forms of low-carbon electricity
generation by providing efficient, long-term support. The CFD reduces
the risks faced by low-carbon generators, by paying a variable top-up
between the market price and a fixed price level, known as the strike
price. As well as reducing the exposure to volatile and rising fossil
fuel prices, the CFD protects consumers by ensuring that generators pay
back when the price of electricity goes above the strike
price.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13120478000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/wmstext/131204m0001.htm#13120478000094">The

terminal occupational disease. It kills approximately 2,200 people in
England and Wales each year, with sufferers having a median life

Government have conducted a consultation on proposals intended to
improve the speed and efficacy of the process for claimants to recover
compensation in cases where a liable employer or insurer is traced.
That consultation, which closed on 2 October 2013 and elicited over 100
responses, also incorporated the review required by section 48 of the
Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012

intention that those reforms should apply to all areas of civil

<?notus-xml column=56?>came into force generally in April 2013, although
not in respect of proceedings for mesothelioma claims. Extending the

the Mesothelioma Bill, subject to Royal Assent. Under the Bill,
introduced into Parliament in May 2013 by the Department for Work and

rates in this country have been too high for too long. Last year,
around 600,000 crimes were committed by people who had broken the law

pressing need to drive down reoffending rates means that we need to
look again at the way rehabilitation is organised. This is why, on 9
May 2013, the Secretary of State for Justice announced new measures to
reform rehabilitation services for offenders. Aimed at tackling our
stubbornly high reoffending rates, these measures will ensure that, for

Government are legislating to extend this statutory supervision and
rehabilitation to the most prolific group of offenders—those
sentenced to less than 12 months in custody. We are also putting in
place an unprecedented nationwide “through the prison

continuous support by one provider from custody into the community. We

want to draw on the best services that can be offered by practitioners
across the public, private and voluntary sectors, so that we can

the market to a diverse range of new rehabilitation providers. These
providers, who will deliver services across 21 Contract
Package Areas, will have the freedom to innovate and to focus on
turning around the lives of offenders but will only be paid in full for
real reductions in reoffending. Our plans will also use competition to
drive greater efficiency, which is vital to free up the resources we
need so that we can extend rehabilitation to a wider group of
offenders. The competition to find the future providers of
rehabilitation services was launched on 19 September and will continue

significant change in the offender’s circumstances, or
intelligence received indicates that the risk of serious harm may have
escalated to high. If the National Probation Service assesses the case

birth. On receipt of these details, the BCMS issues a cattle passport,

terms of keeping older people warmer and safer during winter and
reducing excess winter deaths, the health benefits were not quantified
in the impact assessment as there was no robust methodology. The impact
assessment did, however, make assumptions based on a qualitative
discussion about the likely health impacts of providing support through
energy bills to those vulnerable to fuel poverty. For example, it
highlighted that there is strong evidence that inadequate levels of
heating and fuel poverty are linked, in particular, to respiratory
problems in children and an increased risk of mortality in older
adults. Low temperatures create conditions which increase the

The out-turn figures on prisons are based on published data in the
Management Information Addendum to the NOMS accounts. The MOJ
expenditure is from the published MOJ annual report and
accounts.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
The above figures are produced on as comparable a basis as possible, so
they include all direct expenditure at prisons, plus expenditure met at
a regional and national
level.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
The prisons figures are based on the NOMS' Net Operating Costs as per
the CSoCNE in the annual accounts. Expenditure not related to prisons
(such as probation) and extraordinary expenditure (eg impairments) are
not included. MOJ expenditure is net operating costs from the
departmental
CSoCNE.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
The private prisons figure for 2012-13 includes Oakwood, Thameside and
the full-year effect of Birmingham. It also includes some start-up
costs of the new
prisons.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
The private prisons figure for 2011-12 includes half-year operating
costs of Birmingham, which went into private management (operated by
G4S) in October
2011.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
The reduction in public prisons' share of expenditure reflects this
increase at private prisons and is also a result of the programme of
prison closures and efficiency savings that has taken place. There was
an average increase in prisoner places in privately-run prisons by
1,382 in 2011-12 from 2010-11; and a further increase of 1,711 in
2012-13 from
2011-12.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7.
Care must be taken in considering the comparison between private and
public sector costs for the following
reasons:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">(a)
The public and private groups of prisons are not homogenous groups in
terms of prison category, size, or age and these factors may have a
greater impact on average costs than whether the prisons are public or
private
sector.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">(b)
The private sector contracts may have different responsibilities for
provision of health or education services than public sector prisons.
This will affect their relative
costs.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">(c)
The different financing methods of PFI prisons mean that in an
individual year the resource costs of private and public sector prisons
are not directly
comparable.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">(d)
The costs are based on resource expenditure recorded in NOMS annual
accounts. The PFI prisons are on balance sheet, which means that the
element of the private contractors’ charges related to the
capital cost is not included in the unit costs, while depreciation of
buildings is included. Following government accounting rules, the
charge against the resource budget is not calculated in the same
way.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">(e)
The PFI prisons costs include a charge for interest on capital costs.
There is no equivalent charge in the public sector
costs.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_8Question UID="13120493000063" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/text/131204w0002.htm#13120493000063">Prisons:

contract value” varies from prison to prison due to many
different factors, e.g. when the prison was competed, the cost from the
contractor concerned, the footprint and land area of the prison, its
prisoner capacity. PFI contracts tend to be more expensive since the
contractor had to build the prison in the first place. M&amp;M and MT
prisons are less expensive due to having shorter terms,
etc.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. Care must be taken in
considering the comparison between private and public sector costs for
the following reasons:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>a) The public
and private groups of prisons are not homogenous groups in terms of
prison category, size, or age and these factors may have a greater
impact on average costs than whether the prisons are public or private
sector.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>b) The private sector contracts
may have different responsibilities for provision of health or
education services than public sector prisons. This will affect their
relative costs.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>c) The different
financing methods of PFI prisons mean that in an individual year the
resource costs of private and public sector prisons are not directly
comparable.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>d) The costs are based on
resource expenditure recorded in NOMS Annual Accounts. The PFI prisons
are on balance sheet, which means that the element of the private
contractors' charges related to the capital cost is not included in the
unit costs, while depreciation of buildings is included. Following
government accounting rules, the charge against the resource budget is
not calculated in the same way.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>e) The
PFI prisons costs include a charge for interest on capital costs. There
is no equivalent charge in the public sector
costs.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><Question><hs_Para UID="13120493003234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/text/131204w0003.htm#13120493003234"><B><Member PimsId="4801" UID="13120493005897" xid="899" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131204/text/131204w0003.htm#13120493005897">Sadiq

is important to note that performance points are essentially about
operational efficiency, and do not represent a risk to public safety.
At no point has public safety been at risk. There are no significant
historical trends in the attached figures. Privately managed prisons
achieve the majority of their contractual targets with proportionately
low levels of performance points and financial remedies applied as a
result. The data for each contract is closely monitored by MOJ staff
and any emerging or sustained performance failures are discussed in
detail with the relevant provider in order to rectify performance
shortfalls as quickly as

provide for at least two thirds of the custodial term to be served in
custody, with extended periods served on licence on release. It is also
legislating to ensure that all sentenced prisoners will be released on
licence and subject to supervision for at least 12 months. The
