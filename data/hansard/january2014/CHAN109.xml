Miliband:</Member></B> I thank the Prime Minister for that answer. Let
me make just a few points in reply, because this is an important issue.
First, we all agree on the leadership that this Government have shown
in relation to Syrian aid, and I pay tribute to him, the International
Development Secretary and others. On the point about asylum seekers,
they are of course the people who have been able to get here, but we
are talking about the people who are in the refugee camps at the
moment. On his point about whether this can solve the problem, of
course it cannot, but the UN is talking about a small number of the
most vulnerable people, including children who have lost their parents
and victims of torture. I was somewhat encouraged by the end of the
Prime Minister’s answer. We are all proud of Britain’s
tradition of taking refugees. Why does he not look at it again, say
that Britain will participate in the programme, take just a few hundred
refugees and, indeed, set an
example<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T12:08:44"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012279000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000129"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Prime Minister" PimsId="2439" UID="14012279000426" xid="92" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000426">The
Prime Minister:</Member></B> I do not think that there is a
disagreement between us. The problem I
see—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Let me explain. The
problem I see is that some countries are using the quota system as a
way of saying, “Therefore, I have fulfilled my
obligations.” When almost half of the population of 9 million is
at risk of displacement, the fact that the Finns, the French or the
Swedes will take a few hundred people is not fulfilling their
obligations, whereas the massive amount of aid that Britain is putting
forward—the second largest in the world—is playing the
most important role. As I have said to the right hon. Gentleman, I
think that there are individual cases that we should be looking at, and
I am happy to look at those arguments and issues, but let us not
pretend that a small quota system can solve the problem of Syrian
refugees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012279000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000130"><B><Member ContinuationText="Edward Miliband" PimsId="4818" UID="14012279000427" xid="831" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000427">Edward

this issue. Let me be clear about this. It must not be an excuse for
failing to provide aid—of course it must not—but we are

we are talking about doing both. Given the Prime Minister’s
reasonable tone, will he now open discussions with the United Nations

shock collars are worn around a dog’s neck and work either by a
remote control with various settings that, when pressed,
deliver an electric shock to a dog’s neck or by automatically
delivering an electric shock to a dog when it barks. These collars are
intended to train dogs to respond for of further
punishment, with the dog receiving a shock when it does not
perform what is asked of it, rather than out of a willingness to obey.
This is not the type of training method that the Kennel Club endorses
and certainly not a practice to which I would subject my Jack Russell,
Maximus.</hs_Para>

Kennel Club and the Dogs Trust take the view that unwanted behaviour in
dogs is best resolved by positive training methods. As such, my Bill is
designed to ban the use of electric shock collars
as they are not appropriate devices. Scientific learning
theory dictates that if a dog has a strong desire to indulge in what it
believes is pleasurable behaviour, any negative training method
employed to prevent this has to be far more unpleasant for them than
their natural behaviour is pleasant—it has to be extremely
aversive. If an action brings about a positive outcome for a dog, that
action will be repeated, as it is perceived to be
beneficial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012279000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000190">Secondly,
electronic training devices fail to address underlying behavioural
problems in dogs, and seek to alter their behaviour by introducing a
fear of further punishment rather than a willingness to obey. Any
change in behaviour would result only from the dog perceiving the shock
as painful. An electric shock collar hurts the animal because it has
to; if it did not hurt, it would not
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012279000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000191">Electronic
training devices also cause further behavioural problems. Dogs have a
natural in-built flight or fight response when put in a situation that
causes pain and fear, meaning that they either do anything they can to
get away from the source of pain or become aggressive in response.
Shock collars can thus cause further behavioural problems in addition
to the ones owners are attempting to control. As a dog will have no
idea what caused the pain, it is far more likely to associate it with
something in its immediate environment rather than with its behaviour
at the time. This is why there are cases of dogs attacking other dogs,
their owners or other animals close by at the time of the shock, as the
dog develops “superstitious” fears to things in the
environment that were heard or seen at the time of the
shock.</hs_Para>

common defence for using electric shock collars is that they train
dogs to stop chasing sheep. However, it is
important to note that it is virtually impossible to use an electric
shock collar to train a dog not to chase sheep. The theory behind the
training method is that the dog will believe that the sheep gave it an
electric shock and will thus not chase sheep again. Professional dog
trainers claim, however, that success would be based on luck rather
than judgment, as it is impossible to know at which level the collar
should be set when the dog is near the sheep. In order for the dog to
think the sheep shocked it, the trainer would have to wait until the
dog was very near the sheep; otherwise, the dog would think the shock
came from something else in its immediate environment. If the trainer
waited until the dog was very close to the sheep and the setting of the
collar was too low, there would be a high chance that the shock would
not prevent the dog from worrying the sheep. Similarly, the collar
could be set at the highest setting, but have no effect on the
dog’s behaviour because the dog is already so aroused by chasing
the sheep that it will continue to chase, no matter what shock it
received.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012279000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000193">Under
the Dogs (Protection of Livestock) Act 1953, a person in control of a
dog worrying livestock on agricultural land is guilty of an offence.
Under this Act, dogs must be kept on leads or under close control. In
reality, dogs exercised near livestock should always be kept on
leads—it is as simple as that; there should be no need for an
electric shock collar. Other positive training tools and methods can
produce dogs that are trained just as quickly and reliably—with
absolutely no fear, pain or potential damage to the relationship
between dog and

this Bill having had some pre-legislative scrutiny of what we all

recess a mega-Bill was presented, two thirds of which had not even seen
the light of day in public let alone been discussed, analysed or
subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny by this House. That is our job,
but we were prevented from doing our job because this Bill was
presented far too late in the day, one day before a summer recess. Just
to add insult to injury, it was then stuffed into the parliamentary
sausage machine one week after we returned from the summer

story has been repeated throughout the passage of the Bill. One might
have thought that, even if only for the sake of window-dressing, there
would be the odd pause, the odd break, the odd extension, or a gap
between consideration by their Lordships and this House, but not a bit
of it. That demonstrates the way the Government treat this House,

them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T12:46:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012279000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0001.htm#14012279000218">Mr

pause in the other place, which I welcome. Six weeks is not wonderful
and my Select Committee called for six months—we called for the
job to be done properly. We were grateful for those six weeks, however,
but there was no opportunity for colleagues in this House to consider
what their Lordships had said and read it carefully, because, as we
know, amendments were being made up to the very last moment in the
second Chamber. None of us had that opportunity—Front-Benchers,
colleagues who are interested in this issue and above all
Back-Benchers, and, may I say, the Select Committee, which seeks to
represent Back-Benchers and which has the legitimacy of being a Select
Committee elected by Members from all parts of this House in a secret
ballot, with a Chair elected by the whole House. Despite that
legitimacy, none of us was allowed to see any paperwork or the Order

issues. The way the House is being treated is outrageous—again.
We can all get puffed up and annoyed by stuff, but this is serious.
This is about the way in which the Bill will shape the next general
election and how our charities and voluntary organisations will
participate in our political life. This is not a trivial matter. It is
not as though 95% of people vote—the numbers voting creep down

It suggests, for example, mandatory pre-legislative scrutiny of all

any legislation. I believe that in our form of democracy, the
Government should get their business through. The contribution that
Parliament makes is to ensure that legislation is more effective.
Otherwise, we have to come back until we get it right—in this
case, after the next general election. It does not save time to keep
coming back to the House, as we did—infamously—on
criminal justice Bills under the last Government, tinkering year after
year and with Ministers getting the prestige of having a Bill before

The Table Office was open until 10 this morning, which means
about two working hours for colleagues to read the report, listen to
the Government, read the proceedings in the other place and decide
whether to support an all-party view—as expressed in the
report—and to table, as some have managed to do, their own
amendments. The way that we conduct our business helps us to get better
law. It means that what we produce will stand the test of time, rather

an achievement for the Government to get the League Against Cruel
Sports and the Countryside Alliance on the same side and working in
unison. He makes a serious point: there are people out there who can
help us to make a contribution, and they appeared before us as
witnesses, but that process has been completely ignored. At least we
were able to do some serious work on the lobbying aspect of the Bill.
We were able to conjure a consensus between people who came from

in making the lobbying aspect of the Bill effective, but it has

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T13:07:25"></hs_TimeCode>Our main
amendment to this section of the Bill, on lobbying, is amendment (a).
It deals with the question of who is being lobbied. Our original report
found that it was ludicrous not to include senior civil servants among
those who should declare clearly, honestly and transparently that they
had been lobbied.</hs_Para>

remember the debates on this matter well; members of all parties
contributed to them. I will not go over that ground again, other than
to say that a number of us—myself included—said that
people never sought to lobby a permanent secretary. We noted that
although getting in to see a permanent secretary involved a feat of
genius, it would actually not do much good. That was because the
permanent secretary would take the matter to the director-general who,
in turn, would go to the desk officer. If people want to get something
done—on nursery care, for example, or on cycle lanes—they
do not go to the permanent secretary. They certainly do not go to them
if big money is involved. They of course go to senior civil servants,
which my Select Committee defined as being at grade 5 and above, and in
our view those senior civil servants should be included in the group
that is required to make a declaration in respect of being lobbied.
That is self-evident and sensible.

very people who are lobbied the most in the Government will render the

were meant to do—what they said on the tin. They do not deal
with what the public felt outraged about; they do not help to bring

that substantial consultation has taken place on this subject. Indeed,

higher-regulatory model has meant that neither House felt it
appropriate to extend the scope of the Government’s provisions.
That is not to say, however, that each place has not made very real
contributions to ensuring that we deliver robust and effective
provisions for a statutory register of lobbyists. Following the
recommendations of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee
and the Standards and Privileges Committee, the provisions were amended
to ensure absolute clarity regarding the register’s application
to parliamentarians. We also amended the Bill to ensure that the
register does not impose disproportionate burdens on the smallest
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T13:26:41"></hs_TimeCode>.

Tyler’s, amendment, which was agreed to by just 18 votes, would
extend the scope of the register to those who lobby special advisers. I

coalition Government’s view that it would dissociate the
register from the clearly articulated problem that it is designed to
address. The amendment tabled by the Chair of the Political and
Constitutional Reform Committee would further detach the register from
its objective, by extending the scope of the register to those who

internally inconsistent, and that its effect in uncertain. It would
completely undermine amendments that we have made in this regard. Those
amendments are supported by the Political and Constitutional
Reform 
<?notus-xml column=323?>Committee and have been approved by the House of Lords. I imagine that
the Opposition’s intention in tabling amendment (a) is to
require everyone undertaking the business of consultant lobbying to
subscribe to a voluntary code of conduct. We have previously explained
why such a provision is unnecessary and inappropriate, but I will do so
again. Requiring lobbyists to declare whether they subscribe to a code
will expose those who do not abide by the ethical principles that are
essential to the integrity of the industry. It is not the
Government’s intention, however, to introduce a high-regulation,
burdensome regime whereby the registrar is responsible for monitoring
and enforcing subscription to, and compliance with, codes of
conduct<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T13:47:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000043">The

therefore clarifies that in-house lobbyists are not captured by the
part 1 provisions and that it is the consultant lobbying firm, rather
than its employees, that is required to register in respect of any
lobbying activity carried out by it or its employees. As Ministers have
made clear throughout the Bill’s passage, the register is
designed to address the problem that it is not always clear whose

that communication is undertaken by a sub-contractor that the
consultant lobbying firm has engaged. The amendment also provides that
if the individual happens to be an employee—as opposed to a
contractor, for example—the employee is not to be regarded as
making the communication on behalf of their employer, but rather only
on behalf of their employer's client, reflecting the fact that in-house

Nandy</B> (Wigan) (Lab):</Member> The Opposition share the astonishment
of charities, lobbyists, campaigners and members of the public at the
way in which the Bill has been handled. Until this morning, we had been
led to understand that the Government were intent on reversing the
progress that had been made in the other place. This morning, when the
list of amendments was published, we thought that they had conceded on
special advisers. In fact, they appeared to have got themselves into a
position where they were disagreeing with themselves. After listening
to the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T13:53:47"></hs_TimeCode> Deputy
Leader of the House for 47 minutes of the two hours that we have been
given to debate this important part of the Bill, I, like the Chair of
the Select Committee, am none the wiser as to what the Government
propose. From the interventions of Members on both sides of the House,
it appears that the Minister himself is not entirely sure what he is
proposing
either<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T13:54:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000055">It
is important that we understand how we arrived at this state of extreme
confusion. Clause 2—indeed part 1 of the Bill—was drawn
so narrowly that none of the lobbying scandals that gave rise to the
Bill would have been caught by it. The Bill was massacred in the other
place, and rightly so. The decision to include special advisers was
made by a decent margin, and prompted 30 Liberal Democrat peers to vote
against their own Government. There have been three defeats in the
other place on fundamental aspects of the Bill, and it is important
that Ministers and the House ask why. This is a lesson in how not to
introduce legislation. There was a lack of pre-legislative scrutiny,
and no expert witnesses were allowed to be called. After three years of
silence on this issue, proposals landed out of the blue just two days
before the summer recess. We had a two-paragraph response from the
Government to a well-considered Select Committee report. We had the
spectacle of a Government refusing the request from across civil
society to pause the Bill for long enough to make what was branded
“a dog’s breakfast” by the Chair of an influential
Select Committee into a workable and effective piece of legislation.

The reason for that is that the Bill, as the Chair of the Select

fundamentally flawed that it should be put on hold, with sufficient
time for it to be thoroughly revised. If we had had pre-legislative

suggested that it would be practically too difficult to extend these
provisions to special advisers. But as the Deputy Leader of the House
just said in his long contribution, the Government already publish
information about special advisers. They publish details of gifts and
hospitality received, and details of meetings with newspaper and other
media proprietors’ editors and senior executives on a quarterly
basis. There is no obvious reason why this could not be extended
further. The truth is that there is no political will to make this
happen. Ministers have consistently been told by many of us that this
really matters. Many of the scandals that this Government have been
caught up in have involved Government advisers, not the Minister or the
permanent secretary, whom the Deputy Leader of the House is so keen
that the Bill should cover. Let us take the example of Fred Michel, an
in-house lobbyist for News Corp who was exchanging written
communications with Adam Smith, then special adviser to the then
Culture Secretary. In e-mails and text messages exposed by Lord Justice
Leveson, it became clear that that was entirely inappropriate, yet the
Government have gone to great lengths to ensure that no transparency
requirements will be extended to such advisers or to such in-house
lobbyists.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="140122107003313" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107003313">2

question, because it gives me an opportunity to say that, unlike the
Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives when they were in opposition,
we publish details of meetings on a regular basis. In fact, we are the
most transparent Opposition ever. I find it absolutely astonishing
that, three and a half years after the Prime Minister, then Leader of
the Opposition, made a commitment to shine a spotlight on the shadowy
world of lobbying, the Government have climbed down on all the measures
that we have been urging them to accept and the only thing that they
can do is challenge us on our shadow ministerial diaries. The Deputy
Leader of the House’s own argument was that the Government are
responsible for making decisions. My point to him is that the
Government are responsible for making decisions, and for the process by
which they are made. We would like the measures that we have proposed
to be put into the Bill. We can still see no good reason why the
Government are resisting those calls.</hs_Para>

to table their somewhat bizarre and obscure amendments. First—I
echo my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:09:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela
Smith)—what is the difference between what they have tabled and
the amendment proposed in the other place? The answer to my hon. Friend
appeared to be that the Government are simply kicking it into the long
grass. Will the Deputy Leader of the House confirm that that is the
case? Is this a guarantee that it will happen? The Government amendment
states that the Government “may amend regulations”. Why
use “may”?</hs_Para>

Deputy Leader of the House said that there was a need to reach
consensus. I can tell him, because, unlike the Government, I have been
listening to the clamour outside this place, that there is consensus.
In fact, the only people who do not appear to have reached 
<?notus-xml column=328?>consensus on the issue are sitting on the Government Front Bench. If he
looks behind him, I think he will find that many Government Members are
as concerned as we are. Are Ministers planning to introduce the
proposed measure in regulation? Do they have a time frame for doing so?
Why is it not being introduced now? What are the Government worried
about? We urgently need to clear up the lack of understanding about the
definition of special adviser.</hs_Para>

reading of the amendment is that Lynton Crosby would not be covered,
because he does not adhere to the special advisers’ code of
conduct. If that is correct, it is a disgrace. The Deputy Leader of the
House, in answer to an earlier question, did not seem at all clear
about who was covered by his own amendment. I am not surprised, because
it was made available to us only at 11 o’clock this

the Bill’s passage through the other place, I have met on
numerous occasions and worked closely with my noble Friend Lord Tyler,
who has done a power of good to the Bill and improved many of the most
unsatisfactory elements by a considerable degree. He has also done an
outstanding job in terms of the level of his engagement with the
charitable and third sectors. He has worked tirelessly to talk to them,
to understand their concerns, and to try to move things forward. When

proposed a compromise that I am willing to accept. As has been evinced

wildlife. External bodies wanted it, and the Minister and colleagues
from both sides of the Committee were very supportive of it, but the
Minister’s response was, “Well, we need to check the
details.” The only reason we got the amendment accepted was that
we sat down with a special adviser with access to civil servants, and
with the civil servants themselves, to clear every dot and comma so
that when I got up in Committee, with support from all sides, the
Minister said that the Government accepted the principle and would come
back with their own wording—strangely, it was identical

new type of adviser to which the hon. Gentleman is referring exists
only as a recommendation in a report on civil service reform. Such
advisers do not currently exist, so it is impossible definitively to
confirm or deny whether they would be covered by the proposals. If the
new advisers are employed on the same basis as special advisers and are
therefore covered by the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010,
they would be covered. If they are not employed on that basis, but are
employed as civil servants, they would not be
covered<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:31:51"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000128"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="140122107003390" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107003390">Mark
Durkan:</Member></B> In what I have read, Government officials have
said that the new advisers will not be special advisers—they
might be specialist advisers, but they will not be special advisers.
They will advise on policy. We are told by the Ministers who back the
idea that it is about trying to break the logjam in Government and move
policy along decisively. They will therefore have a key role in moving
public policy along. It is Ministers, not Opposition Members, who are
planning to have this new breed of advisers—this addition to the
ecosystem of government and the networks of advice—so if the
Government have not worked out what class of beast they will be, they
cannot condemn the rest of us for asking and wondering. As legislators,
we are meant to think forward to things that are planned and that are
likely to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000129">The
Chair of the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee has said
that the reason he will not press amendment (a) to a Division is purely
to afford the House time to discuss the issues in part 2 of the Bill
that need to be discussed. However, I want to stress the merits of
amendment (a). I hope that in future, Ministers will not abuse the fact
that a proposal is not being pressed to a Division out of courtesy to
the Chamber because it has other serious concerns to discuss to make
out that Members do not care about the issues or that the issues are
not serious, as they have done today. These issues are serious. In my
view, the Government have deliberately used the audacity of their
proposals in part 2 as a human shield to cover the paucity and weakness
of their proposals in part 1, which will apply only to those who
present themselves in the Yellow Pages under the heading
“Consultant Lobbyists”. People can engage in the business
of professional lobbying on any other paid basis, whether it is

the Government must be in a parallel universe if they genuinely think

fine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000135">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:36:24"></hs_TimeCode>

is. It undermines our credibility as an institution if we cannot
organise ourselves better to do justice to the arguments that have been
debated in public meetings up and down the country. I have had more
contact and received more letters on this issue than on anything else,
other than the reorganisation of the NHS. People care about it deeply.
It shows how out of touch the Government are that they think that they
can rush the Bill through and get plaudits from people outside for the

the Bill was last seen by the House, during consideration in the House
of Lords, the Government undertook a further six-week consultation with
interested parties—on part 2 of the Bill—that built upon
the Government’s already considerable engagement with many
campaigning groups. During the consultation, which took place between
Second Reading and the Committee stage of part 2 of the Bill in the
Lords, the Government held detailed, important and
exhaustive—and sometimes exhausting—talks with some 50
organisations.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:55:37"></hs_TimeCode>Those
discussions informed the Government amendments, with which the Lords
agreed. As the House will have discerned from my opening remarks, many
amendments—100 in total, encompassing 20 substantive
issues—to part 2 have returned from their lordships, and we
propose to accept all but three of them. The amendments, agreed in
consequence of our discussions in the Lords, represent a considerable
body of work undertaken in that House, and we are grateful to their
lordships for that work.</hs_Para>

changes are designed to address the practical concerns raised by third
parties, while preserving the important principles of transparency that
underpin part 2. The amendments reduce the burden on smaller
third parties who campaign at elections, ease the transition to the new
regime and clarify the regulatory rules. That last point is important,
because it became clear during the consultation that concerns often
stemmed from a lack of awareness of the existing rules in the Political
Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</hs_Para>

the House will recall, the PPERA established a framework for the
regulation of non-party campaigning at elections, and many of the
representations derived from an objection not to the Bill, but to how
the PPERA rules, in the view of those making the representations, would
have worked.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:57:26"></hs_TimeCode>This debate has
enabled us to introduce amendments that meet many of the concerns
raised, to clarify how charities and campaigners can legitimately
campaign on policies and issues without falling subject to the election

reduce the burdens of compliance and ensure that small-scale campaigns
are exempt from that regime.</hs_Para>

staff costs for political parties and their handling for non-party
campaigning. That was the point I was making: in so far as political
parties have permanent staffing costs, they are not necessarily
included, but it was 
<?notus-xml column=345?>determined in the 2000 Act that we should aim to identify the additional
costs. <I>[Interruption.]</I> They are included in individual
constituency calculations, but not in the total spending limits for
political parties, as applied under PPERA on a national basis.
Otherwise, if a political party had more staff, it would automatically
have less money available to spend at the time of the election. It is
essentially about parity of arms. Where third parties are concerned,
except in relation to the election period, almost by definition they do
not have permanent expenditure on party political campaigning, so what
they spend at election time needs to be

the concerns of third parties about the difficulties associated with
calculating staff time, that is an existing element of the regulatory
regime. Its operation in the last two general elections, alongside
Electoral Commission guidance, shows that such costs can be accounted

Electoral Commission takes a proportionate approach to the calculation
of controlled expenditure, including staff costs, by stating that third

also be noted—Lords amendment 19 is relevant—that with
the proposed increases in the registration threshold, smaller

for any larger organisation that spends only relatively small sums.

such, the Government believe that the inclusion of staff costs is an
important element of the regime. We have none the less agreed to a
review of the operation of the Bill during the 2015 general

next Lords amendments with which the Government disagree are Lords
amendments 26 and 27—adding up to the total of three. These

materials—whether they are addressed to households or otherwise
distributed—and unsolicited telephone calls to households should
count towards those constituency limits. They therefore fail to take
into account the principle that lay behind the introduction of
constituency limits, namely the principle of transparency. It is
essential for members of the public to know when third parties are
campaigning in the constituencies in which they live, and to know how
much money they are spending in doing so if it rises above any

the effectiveness of the constituency limits. The constituency limits
applying to third parties were introduced to prevent candidates and

systems in place to cope with this reduced period. As there is no

It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:29:06"></hs_TimeCode> should be

the hon. Gentlemen’s amendment (a) to Lords amendment 59, third
parties will only have to submit a donations return to the Electoral
Commission where they have received a reportable donation of
£7,500 or more. Where they have not received a donation of this
value, no report needs to be submitted. This underpins the aim of part
2, which is to increase transparency without placing overly burdensome
reporting requirements upon a third party. As is the current practice,
under section 96 of PPERA a third party will have to provide a full
report of reportable donations three months after polling day. This
return is submitted to the Electoral Commission. The Government believe
that the section 96 return provides an important safeguard where a full
record of reportable donations is provided and visible. This will allow
both the Electoral Commission and the general public to ascertain the
amount and source of all reportable donations received by a third party
during the regulated
period<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:22:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government do not believe that this requirement is overly burdensome,
as the information will have already been prepared by the third party.
It also allows the opportunity for the third party to declare any
reportable donations which it has failed to declare previously. This
underpins the regulatory regime. We therefore do not agree with the
hon. Gentleman’s amendment, which requires the same donation to
be reported only
once<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:22:34"></hs_TimeCode> as that

expenditure which would reasonably be regarded as intended to promote
or procure the success of a party or candidate might fall to be
regulated as election expenditure, and it is demonstrable at previous
elections under this regulatory regime that large amounts of
policy-related campaigning has been undertaken by charities and that
has not required to be regulated. The second reassurance, as we will
come on to see with other amendments, is that we are proposing to lift
the registration threshold up from the current level of £10,000
to £20,000. That will allow small-scale campaigning by
organisations not to be part of the regulatory

to the hon. Gentleman’s amendment (a) to Lords amendment 75, a
statement of accounts only has to be provided if the third party has
incurred controlled expenditure over the registration threshold. In
addition, an individual is excluded from the provisions. Those third
parties who prepare accounts under another enactment need not prepare
additional accounts if the commission is satisfied they include
equivalent information. When a third party registers with the Electoral
Commission it must state, using a simple tick box, whether it is an
individual or one of the bodies that can register as a third party.
From this information, the Electoral Commission can ascertain whether
the body provides accounts under another enactment. As a result it
would add unnecessary additional bureaucracy to ask the third party to
submit a subsequent declaration that it is exempt from the provisions,
as the amendment requires. I therefore hope the hon. Gentleman will not

expenses incurred that are reasonably attributable to an

reflects the position of the Welsh language, which is governed by the

Watkinson). Those were set in the Bill at £5,000 for England and
£2,000 for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The amendment
however raises these amounts substantially, from £5,000 to
£20,000 for England and from £2,000 to £10,000 in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. This change is in response to the
many representations this Government have received from campaigners who
spend only small amounts of money and were concerned that the
Bill’s transparency provisions, though essential, would in fact
impose unduly onerous compliance requirements. It is important to
recognise, as many organisations did, that election expenditure should
in principle be disclosed and regulated, but there were concerns that
smaller organisations would be caught by the provisions. By raising the
thresholds to levels that also take into account the extended range of
activities proposed by the Bill, small campaigners can be assured that
they will not suddenly be subject to administrative controls that they
are not resourced or equipped to comply
with.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="140122107003318" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107003318">3.30

amendment 20 increases the spending limits—not the registration
thresholds—for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland by
£20,000 each. This is an increase from the levels set in the
Bill when it went to the Lords. The new limits will be £55,400
for Scotland, £44,000 for Wales and £30,800 for Northern
Ireland. Campaigners have argued that the spending limits for those
parts of the United Kingdom were disproportionately low—so low
in fact, that they might force campaigners to step aside and not
participate in elections. It has never been our intention to prevent
third parties from campaigning altogether. They are a key aspect of the
democratic process and, to ensure they remain so, the spending limits
have been raised to more suitable
amounts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000808" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000808">Lords
amendment 18 relates to coalitions. It is important to recognise that
the Bill did not change the regulatory regime for coalitions, but the
debate on the Bill has enabled us to identify a change that will help
campaigners that do incur small amounts of expenditure. The Government
received many representations on the existing PPERA regime on
coalitions. The concern was that the Bill’s provisions would put
onerous reporting burdens on them. This fear was particularly
pronounced in relation to those who often campaign as part of a
coalition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000809" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000809">This

in as many coalitions as it wishes. When it takes part in this
procedure, it will not have to report for its expenditure, provided it
does not incur total spend above the registration threshold—the
numbers to which I just referred. The third party would take on the
status of a “minor campaigner”. Another third party who
agrees to act as a “lead campaigner” in the
coalition’s common plan would instead report the expenditure it
and the minor campaigner had both incurred. As with the registration
thresholds, this provision is also intended to reassure small spending
campaigners that new burdens will not be imposed upon them. Indeed, it
will reduce the burden compared with the regime in the 2000
Act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000810" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000810">Lords

£5,850. Campaigners may now spend the entire constituency limit

amendments 91, 94 and 96 shorten the length of the regulated period for
third parties. The regulated period is the time before an election
within which only limited expenditure can be incurred, and certain
campaigning rules must be observed. Reports must be submitted to the
regulator. The regulator, the Electoral Commission and campaigners have
argued that they need more time than the Bill would otherwise allow to
understand fully the new rules and their responsibilities under them.
The Government agree about the need to ensure suitable guidance is in
place for campaigners. If the Electoral Commission needs further time
to produce this guidance, and ensure it is relevant, clear and useful,
the regulated period can be shortened to facilitate that. That is why
the regulated period for third parties, for the purposes of the 2015
parliamentary general election only, will be reduced to seven and a

referendum—instead of the usual twelve
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000812" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0002.htm#140122107000812">Let

change has been brought about principally so that disabled candidates

following the creation of the access to elected office for disabled
people fund. The fund was established by this Government to provide
grants to disabled people who are, or who go on to become, candidates
at elections. The fund provides grants to help candidates to overcome
any barriers to elected office that might arise as a result of their
disability. However, electoral law considered those grants to be
personal expenses and therefore deductable from candidates’
election expenses limits at local elections—the one poll where
personal expenses counted towards a candidate’s expenses

take merely a few minutes and it would be absurd to expect small and

Thurso:</Member></B> I briefly repeat a comment I made on the previous
group of amendments: the Bill left this place in an unsatisfactory
state, but went to the Lords and had a considerable amount of work done
to it. A huge number of the amendments made were either proposed by the
Government after listening or accepted by them following a debate. I
repeat that my noble Friend Lord Tyler was central to much of that
process, and the Front Benchers Lord Wallace of Tankerness and Lord
Wallace of Saltaire, among others, did a splendid job in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:19:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to Lord Tyler, he told me that he shared two of my major concerns,
which he expressed very well, about the degree of bureaucracy and the
degree of complexity, and everything he did was to try to remove
bureaucracy or complexity. He made the very good point that the Bill
builds on the PPERA, but that the process of engagement with charities
and the third sector threw up the fact that many of them did not
understand that earlier legislation and were not perhaps compliant with
it. Therefore, if nothing else, this process has helped them to
understand what is
necessary<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000902" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107000902">I
will touch quickly on the Lords amendments that have succeeded. The
fundamental change was raising the registration rates to £20,000
for England and £10,000 for Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. We began with the position that the rates would be halved and
they have now been doubled. That is a significant change. It has lifted
the vast majority of smaller organisations and charities out of the
legislation completely. That is a considerable concession by the
Government and it has achieved a great deal. I make the small point, in
parentheses, that I do not know why the rate for Scotland should be
half that for England, but I shall move on
quickly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:20:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000903" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107000903">Charities
also had a critical concern about coalitions. That has been dealt with
by removing all the burdens from low-spending participants in a
campaigning coalition and allowing the larger campaigners to provide a
single report on their behalf. That has lifted a large potential
burden. That change, along with other changes such as removing the
requirement for nil returns and the review, has changed dramatically
the way in which the Bill can be viewed. It is now much closer to
achieving the principles that I want to see, which are greater
transparency and accountability in third parties. It is also less
heavy-handed with those who are not a target, such as small, local
organisations and charities—virtually all charities are
exempt<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000904" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107000904">This
process has allowed good, informed criticism to be taken on board. It
has also allowed us to flush out some very ill-informed criticism. I
received an e-mail from a constituent yesterday urging me to support
Lord Tyler, which of course is always a pleasure, because he wanted to
continue to campaign against wind farms in our area and because he
wanted to be able to campaign against the building of houses on the
battlefield of Culloden if anybody ever suggested it. I was able to
point out to him with complete certainty that those two things would
never be covered by the Bill. There are many people out there who think
that it does cover such matters. It is important to have the
opportunity to dispel those
ideas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:22:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107000905" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107000905">I
will turn to the two principal amendments that I wanted to discuss.
Lords amendment 108 removes a huge raft of things that were included in
the proposal before their lordships. I took the trouble of finding
schedule 3 in its unamended form. The Lords amendment relates to
sub-paragraphs (3), (4) and (5) of paragraph 1, which
include not only transport costs, but some pretty heavy bits of
expenditure, such as public rallies. Their lordships were right to

Lords amendments 26 and 27, I should explain that subsection (1) of
proposed new section 2A in Lords amendment 26 is an amendment made on
Report by my noble Friend Lord Tyler. It is a clear amendment that does
exactly what it says on the tin, and I have almost complete sympathy
with it. Lord Harries added subsections (2) and (3), which render the
amendment unworkable. If I may paraphrase what Lord Tyler said, the
lawyers have got hold of it and they have gone far too far. In
particular, it is almost impossible to work out how one would begin to
consider policing subsection (3), which is so defective that it has
rendered what was a sound amendment almost completely
ineffective.</hs_Para>

support Lords amendment 45, which was tabled by Lord Harries of
Pentregarth. He outlined some of the issues relating to seeking to
narrow the requirement for third- party campaigners to account for
staff costs, which has come up again and again. Charities in my area
are deeply concerned by the original proposals, and we must address
this. It is beneficial for staff costs to continue to be included in
controlled expenditure in relation to election material, marketing and
canvassing, and when they directly relate to communicating with the
electorate. The simplification of the requirements will make them much
more understandable and workable for charities. I agree with
commentators who say that that will make it easier to comply with the
proposed legislation. One need only

clear that such charities were so small that it made more sense for
them to campaign and fundraise together under the umbrella of rare
diseases while still working for their individual illnesses. The
current situation is working and should be allowed to continue working,
and the amendment goes some way to allowing them to work together to
the benefit of all member groups. It would also eliminate the unfair

Reform Committee, I shall speak in support of the amendments we tabled,
which would further enhance some of the Lords amendments. I welcome the
amendments made in the House of Lords and I want to acknowledge that
the Government have listened to some concerns. In particular, the
Deputy Leader of the House made a visit to Belfast and heard from a
number of groups, large and small, about the range of concerns they
had. He signalled some of the adjustments that needed to be made and
followed through on some of them, but limitations remain on others.
People were pleased to have that direct hearing, but they are not
necessarily satisfied that the Bill’s current shape and scope
allays all their concerns. They are particularly concerned about the
Government’s attempt to overturn Lords amendments 26, 27 and
108. That is what is providing the residual apprehension or concern
about how things will go.</hs_Para>

to the report and to the formal response that the Government must give

appropriate to mention the reactions of some members of the
Government—I will not say everybody—to the proposals.
They were described as “unrealistic” by one
Minister and “unworkable” by another. That is not
entirely consistent with the formalities of the convention that
applies, but I think we will find that we will get a good response, as
the Government have also said that it is a very important

different systems in different member states. As a Government we are
determined to ensure that the modernised data protection regime, which
we need, in part to serve a continental-wide digital economy, is shaped
in such a way as to minimise the regulatory burden on businesses. We

the Prime Minister down, that we believe that such a course would be
wrong and would be a betrayal of the interests of European business, of
European consumers, who would like to benefit from the lower energy
prices that shale development would bring, and above all of the
interests of those who are out of work, where a shale gas industry
would not only provide additional employment in its own right, but, by
maintaining a downward pressure on energy prices, would make it
possible for more companies throughout the economy to hire additional
employees. The UK Government will continue to work closely with the
Governments of countries such as Poland and Hungary, which also have a
clear commitment to the freedom of member states to develop shale gas

but—if I may say so—I think that he oversells his case.
It is true that we can have European regulation, just as we can at
national level, that is overly prescriptive, 
<?notus-xml column=385?>overly complicated and far too costly as far as business is concerned.
Therefore, one of the tests that we have in mind when judging
Commission proposals is whether in the first place the introduction of
a single regulatory regime to govern a European single market would
produce a net benefit for business, compared with the 28 different
national regimes that would be eliminated as a consequence of a single
European regulatory framework. Also, Ministers in this Government have
argued repeatedly that we think the Commission could make more use of
the principle of mutual recognition, which after all was made clear in
the jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice some decades ago in
the Cassis de Dijon case, rather than relying all the time on the
detailed harmonisation of national arrangements, which can easily lead
one into the sort of overly complicated system that my hon. Friend

work programme published on 22 October is shorter than usual, not least
because European Parliament elections are coming up in May and because
the new college of Commissioners will take office later this year. Our
ability to influence the work programme’s direction to achieve
UK objectives and protect our national interest depends in no small
part on having good relationships with our allies in Europe. Yet,
instead of defending our interests in Europe, the Prime Minister all
too often puts party before country, opting for policy positions and
language that appease Eurosceptic Back Benchers and alienate allies in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T17:39:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002211">The
result is that the Prime Minister finds himself in an increasingly
isolated position in Europe. Indeed, the Prime Minister has been
attracting an increasing number of openly hostile comments from crucial
European allies. Germany, Poland, France and Bulgaria are our allies in
Europe, and yet senior figures in their Governments—most
recently the German Foreign Minister, Mr Steinmeier—have given
briefings on their profound disagreement with our Prime
Minister’s views. The political weight of the people in those
countries who have made their disagreement with the Prime Minister
known and the tone in which they have done so are concerning. Once

Prime Minister has promised to renegotiate the terms of
Britain’s membership of the European Union. He said that treaty
change will deliver important opportunities to repatriate a series of

confess that I cannot see a major treaty change in preparation. It is
far from clear that the treaty change on which the Conservative party
is banking is likely to happen soon. If the Minister were to be honest
with the House about that, I suspect that he would say that he is
starting to realise that the game is up. The Chancellor’s recent
plaintive call for treaty change in the context of banking union gave
the impression that he knows that the possibility of such treaty change
is retreating<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T17:41:24"></hs_TimeCode>.

advance, together with others in Europe, a reform agenda that promotes
economic growth across the EU and, as a result, helps 
<?notus-xml column=391?>to tackle unemployment, particularly youth unemployment. That includes,
as the work programme sets out, the need to extend and complete the
single market—I agree with the Minister’s comments on the
digital market—so that British companies can benefit from the
opportunities of trade with our nearest allies. The operation of the
single market in existing sectors must be protected in the face of
potential closer integration between eurozone

economic governance and the banking union. Clearly, the stability of
the eurozone, and sorting out the problems faced by banks in eurozone
countries, is not just of great importance to countries in the single
currency—it has a significant impact on the UK, too. Why it
takes the European Union to clamp down on bankers’ bonuses, when
the Government should be doing it, is a question we are still waiting
to get a sensible answer on from Ministers. In this country, we still
need real reform of competition in our banking sector to help small
businesses get the support they need to grow, employ more people at
decent wages and help Britain earn its way to better living

important theme of the work programme is European co-operation on
justice and security. The Commission is currently negotiating with the
UK on the justice and security measures that we can opt back into. Our
police and security forces are rightly working ever closer with their
counterparts across Europe, co-operating on issues such as
international terrorism, organised crime and human trafficking. For
example, we would not have seen the arrest of one of the terrorists
responsible for the 7/7 attacks in London without help from our
European colleagues. More than 4,000 suspected criminals
have been sent back to other EU countries to face justice, more than
90% of whom were foreign citizens, and while not perfect, the European
arrest warrant has helped to tackle the so-called Costa del
Crime, with 49 of the 65 top UK fugitives hiding in southern Spain
having been returned to face justice. In short, we depend on our
European partners for intelligence and operational support in order to
protect the British public and the freedoms they enjoy. To ensure that

there remains a threat to continued British participation in European

Ignoring warnings from Cancer Research UK, the British Heart Foundation

are several points I want to develop in the remainder of my remarks.
First, on economic and monetary union, yesterday the International
Monetary Fund’s world economic outlook predicted growth in the
eurozone for this year at a mere 1% and for next year at an only
slightly higher 1.4%. At the same time, there are 26.5 million people
out of work across the EU28, and 5.6 million of them are under the age
of 25. That is a youth unemployment rate of nearly 24%. That should
shame all of us. It should represent a call to action for every
politician who has influence to shape the EU’s priorities to
focus on job creation for the next few years.</hs_Para>

the year to last November our trade deficit with the EU rose to
£3.2 billion and the continued low growth in the eurozone area
was one of the main contributory factors to dampened demand for our
manufacturing exports. By contrast, our trade in services, including
financial services, is in surplus. So it is in the interests of
business and workers here in the UK to see the fault-lines in economic
and monetary union repaired by putting in place a strong set of common
institutions like a single resolution mechanism and processes to allow
for the resolution of distressed banks in the eurozone area. The
question of whether there should be a common deposit insurance
guarantee, or commonly issued debt, is certainly a more divisive issue
among the eurozone members, but now that a new coalition is in place in
Berlin, we should at least begin to have greater certainty about
Germany’s intentions on both those
fronts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:08:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002271">We
should also welcome the fact that, contrary to many
expectations—not least from Members on the Opposition
Benches—the eurozone has not broken up. Indeed, Latvia became
its 18th member this month. Nevertheless, in this work programme the
Commission has acted on the widespread sense among peoples in Spain,
Portugal, Greece, Cyprus and Ireland that monetary union lacked a
sufficiently social or democratic dimension, with little regard being
given to the effects on inequality, wages and, most devastatingly of
all, youth unemployment in some of the programmes imposed upon those
member states in the name of deficit reduction. It is interesting to
note that the Commission’s work programme refers to the further
priority for work in this area in the coming 12
months<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:09:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002272">As

for Stone (Mr Cash) referred earlier—eurozone members should not
be left with the only options being internal devaluations or wage cuts
as the means of escape from any future downturns. The price for that
would simply be paid by ordinary working people with substantially
lower living standards. A eurozone with a strong fiscal union component

Government Members visited Brussels in October last year we heard from
the office of President Van Rompuy that eurozone member states now
recognise that sharing a currency and a common interest rate was not
enough to avoid the effects produced by the economic shock of the great
recession. So plans are now being developed to establish limited pooled
resources that could help share out or equalise economic demand when
some states suffer a severe dent in their output. We should welcome
that. It has also been proposed that a revision of some of the terms of
the fiscal pact could allow eurozone states greater flexibility to
boost demand through fiscal policy in times of economic trouble. We
should also welcome those
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002274">In
common with weak lending to small and medium enterprises in this

the European Investment Bank should increase lending to businesses in

of monetary union in the eurozone and the debate that will take place

on justice and security co-operation, recent tragedies in the
Mediterranean have shown the strong need for deeper joint working to
prevent accidents and fatalities at sea, and to target would-be people

ever closer co-operation on enforcing common standards, the UK is
moving in the opposite direction, with its blanket opt-out and opaque,

on the EU’s external strategy, it is worth noting that the queue
of countries seeking to apply to join the European Union is far longer
than that seeking or contemplating the possibility of exit from it.
That must count for something, and the reasons are
clear—unimpeded access to the single market, a rules-based
system governed by the rule of law, and an influence in shaping common
provisions. States such as Serbia, Turkey and Moldova recognise the
greater influence in the world that the EU’s common foreign
policy provides, 
<?notus-xml column=398?>the additional strength when negotiating trade rules at the WTO, and the
sense that they can have another identity without ceding their own
national identity.

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:16:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) has just said, I think he
really needs to take into account the fact that we have a
Queen’s Speech every year at about the time the work programme
comes out. That Queen’s Speech is put forward on behalf of an
elected Government; it contains Government proposals that come from a
democratic process. We are discussing a work programme that comes from
an unelected bureaucratic organisation that lays out its priorities and
expects people to respond to them. There is a serious difference in
character between the two. Many of the proposals in the work
programme—some of which are not legislative proposals but
initiatives—are brought into effect by regulation or
directive.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="140122107002287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002287">The
proposals in the Queen’s Speech, being democratically driven and
debated in the House, are brought into effect by Bills of Parliament.
Those Bills have Second Readings, they are amended and they have a
Report stage. They go through both Houses of Parliament.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:17:39"></hs_TimeCode>However, a
single paragraph in a regulation or directive could have the most
profound effect on us in this country. The provision would almost
certainly be driven through by a qualified majority vote. That could
involve our being pushed into a consensus or being outvoted; it could
also involve a co-decision with the European Parliament. We have less

Commission programme is, as a matter of principle, based on
undemocratic systems. That is why the European Scrutiny Committee
report, which has received quite a lot of attention recently, has put
forward proposals relating to those provisions that could, in the
national interest, be considered for disapplication or—in the
case of the proposals that we do not want—subjected to a
veto<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:18:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002289">In
regard to the Minister’s opening remarks, I should point out
that the Government are resolutely against several provisions in the
work programme, including those relating to the European public
prosecutor’s office, 
<?notus-xml column=399?>and to the single resolution mechanism, in which we will not
participate. That Government also oppose the provisions on free
movement rights, to which they will not subscribe, and to those
relating to the European anti-fraud office. All those matters will
still be produced by the work programme, however, and we will be unable
to prevent them from happening. The hon. Member for Glasgow North East
is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:19:51"></hs_TimeCode> perfectly
entitled to say that he would like to have the single resolution
mechanism—in fact, I recall him saying that he thought we should
have it. However, I can assure him that that is not the view in the
City of London, and it is not the view of many people who have a great
deal of knowledge of these matters.</hs_Para>

constitutional question lies in the difference between the Commission
work programme and legislation that originates in this House, based on

of the European Scrutiny Committee, I know that our job is to look at
all these matters—and point No. 2 is that we do. We do that
diligently throughout the year. Let us leave aside the disapplication
and veto matters to which I have just referred. When I was in Brussels
yesterday, I was told by very senior members of other national
assemblies, “We would give our intense support to anything that
would enable us in our own countries to have flexibility to prevent the
imposition of legislation on banking union and so on.” Their
list is endless, but they just cannot do it because of the way their
constitutions are tied in. Our report recommends that the departmental
Select Committees could be brought in to make

Cash:</Member></B> I am glad to see the Minister nodding, because we
believe our constructive suggestion will help to make more sense of the
proposals in this work programme. Not only would each Select Committee
have a rapporteur who is a specialist in European matters, if that were
agreed by the House, the Procedure Committee, the Liaison Committee and
so on, but the generality of departmental Select Committees would
consider whether they wanted to prioritise proposals that came out of
the work programme and make their own political judgment on whether
they thought it was in the interests of the United Kingdom to go along
with those proposals. They might even absorb some of the ideas and say
they were good. The bottom line is that there should be a proper
democratic discussion about it all, as that would be very
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:22:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002293">The
Minister has referred to a number of initiatives, but I wish to say one
thing about the repeal of legislation. This relates to actions under
the regulatory fitness and performance—REFIT—programme
where we must be realistic. There is far too much of a burden on
British business and, indeed, on businesses in the European Union as a
whole. I hear that view from all my colleagues in the other national
Parliaments when I visit them. I shall be going back to see them in
Athens this weekend, having just come back from Brussels. They all say
the same thing: they want small businesses to be much more effective;
they want more opportunities for entrepreneurship; they want to have
more free trade; and they want there to be the opportunity to make 
<?notus-xml column=400?>money, so that the taxation can be provided for public expenditure. If
not, they find that they have terrible problems with their
economises.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107002294">Finally,
we must all be very pleased about today’s employment figures. It
is a great tribute to the Government that we have seen this dramatic
increase in employment. I just add, however, that a great deal of it
comes from our expansion of non-EU trade. We see that in the premium
selling points of Jaguar Land Rover and the companies where the money
is really being made internationally. We have a deficit on current
account transactions, trade and services, and imports and
exports—the golden criteria. On that principle, we run a deficit
with the other 27 member states of £49 billion a year. We had a
surplus in the figures for the last accounts of £12 billion, but
the figures for the two quarters for the beginning of the next
projected flow are £5.6 billion and £6.1 billion. If that
continues, as I think it will, by the end of this year we could find
that, in one year, business, with the assistance of the
Government—I give them credit for this, because they have been
listening—will have doubled our non-EU surplus with the rest of
the world. That is where the machinery for more employment and the
drive for prosperity for this country will come from, which is why I am
so pleased to have the opportunity to congratulate the Government on
the figures. At the same time, I issue one small word of caution: we
should not put all our eggs in the European
basket.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="140122107003329" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0003.htm#140122107003329">6.25

claim, which shows the diminishing influence—in my view, because
of the internal politics of the Conservative party—of the
British Government on the EU agenda. As we have heard today, the
Conservative party is becoming more and more Eurosceptic and as a
consequence it is losing allies and supporters in the EU and is less

the Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) referred earlier to a
story, which I hope all Members will read, on the front page of the
<I>Financial Times</I>, headlined, “City warns UK over loss of
EU influence”. One point made by people in the City is that that
diminishing influence is resulting in fewer Britons working inside the
European Union institutions in Brussels: the British Bankers
Association says that there has been a 24% decline over the past seven
years. At the moment, Britain accounts for 4.6% of the total number of
people employed in the institutions whereas France can claim 9.7% of
them. In simple terms, that means that we have fewer people on the
ground making the case for Britain’s national interest. That is
bad for

is cited in the FT article. I had a meeting yesterday with the Chemical

its members’ interest for Britain to be fully engaged in
influencing and changing

for Clacton (Mr Carswell) and for Stone (Mr Cash), as there are
examples of regulations that are a burden to business. A business in my
constituency, Premiere Products, has pointed to the impact of the
biocidal products regulation—a brand new regulation that should
have been there to facilitate access to markets across Europe for small
and medium-sized enterprises, increase competition and reduce
authorisation costs, but seems likely to do the exact opposite. I say
to Ministers that the biocidal products regulation is a prime candidate
for inclusion in REFIT, as we must consider whether we can do more to
lighten the burden of regulation, especially on small
businesses.</hs_Para>

cheap energy, not more environmental regulation. We have,
fantastically, regulations on European political parties coming through
from the European Union, so perhaps they will limit what we can say in
future and will not give us any money for it, because the European
Union is taking charge. We have, just as the wonderful Romanians and
Bulgarians have come in to free movement, a labour mobility package, to
which even the Government are opposed, because they do not believe the
scope of EU rules should be extended to cover long-term care, they are
worried about unemployment benefits, etc., etc.</hs_Para>

They have given away so much. They lose so much, yet it is going their

years ago, representatives of News International contacted me to
announce the closure of Convoys Wharf. I met them on site, going down a
narrow street in Deptford through an industrial gate set in high
fences. I came upon a huge area of concrete peppered with massive sheds
stretching to the waterfront. It was a vast, forlorn, windy expanse
with a footprint similar to the whole of the south bank.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:55:14"></hs_TimeCode> immediate
fear was that the site was destined for millionaires’ housing, a
gated community cut off from the rest of Deptford that would continue
the hundreds of years of local people’s exclusion from their own
Thames waterfront. Then I discovered that Convoys Wharf was the site of
Henry VIII’s naval shipyard and the home of the great diarist
John Evelyn. I sensed that this would be an historic battle, and so it
has been, as I, with local people and Lewisham council planners led by
John Miller, have sought recognition of the site’s supreme
importance and of the imperative to secure a development appropriate to
its unique
heritage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002689" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0004.htm#140122107002689">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>
me outline the historical record, which I have taken—often
verbatim—from the Museum of London archaeology report. The
record goes back to the Domesday Book and the manor of Grenviz, the
present-day Deptford. In the late 12th century, the manor passed to the
de Says family, who named it Sayes court. The mediaeval manor house of
Sayes court, which was constructed of wood, was certainly in existence
in
1405.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122107002690" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/debtext/140122-0004.htm#140122107002690">Deptford<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:56:33"></hs_TimeCode>

Tudor storehouse was the nucleus of the shipyard. Erected in 1513, it

Golden Hind was lodged in a specially constructed brick dock, becoming

house on the site, and it remains intact today. It was bought in 1998
by William Richards and Chris Mazeika who are continuously restoring

brick, concrete and timber and were then provided with cover buildings,

1869, William John Evelyn, who was a descendant of the original John
Evelyn, bought back part of the site. His attempts to preserve the park
and museum for the public led him to contact Octavia Hill. Realising
that there was no existing legal form that could secure such
protection, Hill set about establishing the organisation that was to
become the National Trust. Seventeen years later, the gardens were
given to the public, only to face their final demise in 1914, when they
were leased as a horse transport reserve depot. The gardens were built
over and the house was used by the War Office. The last elements of
Sayes court manor house were demolished at some time around 1930. It

1999, Alan Howarth conducted a ministerial review of royal dockyards to
upgrade listing and scheduling. Deptford dockyard was omitted because
it was believed at the time that the only structures of value were the
Olympia and the Master Shipwright’s house. An application was
submitted locally in 2002, which resulted in the scheduling of the
undercroft of the 1513 Tudor storehouse a year later. In 2009, another
application was submitted by local people to list the docks, slips,
basin and mast ponds. English Heritage recommended not to list. There
were many errors in the report and the decision was contested. English
Heritage withdrew its recommendation. The Council for British
Archaeology and the Naval Dockyards Society, supported by local
historians, requested that the case be reopened in 2012. Again English
Heritage recommended not to list. The Council for British Archaeology
then initiated a freedom of information inquiry, which revealed errors
and obfuscation resulting in further exchanges. Last year English
Heritage recommended the statutory protection of the dockyard wharf
wall and the upgrading of the Master Shipwright’s house. Many
features remain without protection and await consideration of the final

for locals, new residents and visitors alike. The development would be
approached through the extensive Sayes court garden, leading to the
horticultural centre and the Olympia building with its myriad
activities, and on to the water basin leading to the Thames. It would
be a place of which everyone in Deptford could be proud, a place that
would sit alongside the world heritage sites that are Greenwich, the
Cutty Sark and the National Maritime Museum, a place offering green
lungs and riverside walks in the heart of the inner city, a place
giving new hope to young people of training and jobs and to
enterprising local artists and entrepreneurs. It would be not just for

brings me back to the proposals that the right hon. Lady has told us
about today. Let me comment on some of the specific questions she put
to me. She asked about the centre for urban horticulture and whether it
should respond to the archaeology and be set within an open space. My
understanding is that English Heritage considers that the proposed
orientation of the blocks does not best reflect the archaeology in
respect of the relationship of Sayes court to its garden landscape. It
believes that the remains of Sayes court and its garden landscape would
be better reflected by making the relationship more legible. The
concept of a centre for urban horticulture, incorporating and
presenting the remains of Sayes court, is a potentially attractive
one—one that better reflects the historic relationship. I
believe it is important to note the views of English Heritage in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady talked about the exciting Lenox proposal to rebuild one of
Charles II’s ships within the Olympia—according to its
plans, but obviously not to rebuild it with the original
material—and to restore or rebuild the great basin in front of
it. Because it has not seen the plans for the scheme,
English Heritage cannot comment on it specifically. Obviously, if the
scheme is viable and it is possible to secure a long-term reuse of the
listed building, and if the impact on the archaeology and the historic
fabric is likely to be minimal, English Heritage could, in principle,
support it, but I understand that the developer thinks that it would be
impossible to rebuild the basin without destroying the
archaeology.</hs_Para>

might be renovated, or whether a new basin might be built within it.
There is confusion over whether English Heritage thinks one thing or
the other, but we understand that it would be able to approve some
treatment of the basin that would not be harmful in any way and would
meet our purposes. I wonder whether I might invite the Minister to
examine that issue further, and then write to

problem came to a head in May 2013 when Barclays announced that it
intended to close the accounts of most of its clients in the money
transfer and remittance business. The decision was delayed, probably
due in part to a debate in Westminster Hall in July 2013, which was

decision on the closure of accounts was delayed, unfortunately that was
of little use to the constituent I mentioned in the 2013 debate, Mr
Anwar Ali, whose business, Trust Exchange UK Ltd, was ruined by
Barclays’s decision. As I said during that debate, that business
was a model of the sort of small businesses that many hon. Members on
both sides of the House would like to see in their constituencies. It

representations to me about the issue. The specific point is that an
inability to transfer money causes not just domestic and individual
family distress. A survey of diaspora communities  in Sheffield
that I carried out showed the important

believe that Barclays should offer to reopen the accounts that it
closed before the court’s decision so that the account holders

the Member for Cardiff West set out brilliantly the
background—how we got here. Barclays made its decision,
following on from decisions that other banks had made, which has led to
virtually no opportunities for money transfer companies to use banking
facilities to carry out their business, and as a result, many have gone
out of business. At this rate, there will not be many left if we do not
get our act together and find an interim solution, as well as a
long-term solution that involves coming up with an international
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T09:55:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012275000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012275000047">Britain
has led on these issues in the past and I believe that it can do so
again. That is my appeal today to the Minister—that he will work
with the Secretary of State for International Development and the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and put genuine effort in during the short
window of time that we have managed to gain, thanks to the injunction
achieved by the company based in my constituency, Dahabshiil, led by Mr
Abdirashid Duale. As a result of that, although other companies have
closed, it is still going. It is virtually the last one standing, but
it is also the biggest company that supports remittance to developing
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012275000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012275000048">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T09:57:11"></hs_TimeCode>

Somalia, because there are almost no other routes to get money in apart
from physically carrying cash, which I am sure no one wants people to
be doing, because of the dangers of criminality, terrorism, extremism
and many other things. We cannot have a situation in which people must
physically transport cash and place themselves at risk of being
criminalised, not to mention being the target of criminals, as they try

me remind hon. Members of the context particularly of Somalia, but also
of many other countries—we have seen this in Pakistan,
Bangladesh and many other countries. At times of crisis, people need to
get money into remote places, so even countries with a banking system
struggle to enable people to get support—to get
remittances—in. That is where money transfer companies play a
vital role. They have intimate—close—networks and trusted
relationships in remote villages around the world, whereby people can
get money to those who cannot travel easily because the infrastructure
is not good enough in those countries or because they live in remote
places.</hs_Para>

companies are also vital in times of disaster, as we saw during the
humanitarian disaster in east Africa, which affected Somalia, the
floods in Pakistan and Bangladesh, the cyclones, and disasters in many
other countries. We need to ensure that there are ways in which
remittances can be given, so that the pressure on humanitarian
assistance does not increase further, which undoubtedly it would do if
remittances were prevented from getting to people quickly and safely.
Global remittance flows are greater in value than all the international
aid budgets put together. We need safe and
legal—legitimate—mechanisms whereby people can get help
to their
families<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T09:59:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012275000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012275000051">In
the previous debate, the Minister himself said that his elderly family
members had received remittances in the past and continued to
do so. I have a similar experience, because my family do the same. It
is a critical way in which people support each other. The British
Muslim community donate millions of pounds in zakat, which also takes
the form of remittances. All those contributions build a vital lifeline
for people in developing countries who might not qualify for
development aid, but who none the less receive support for education,
health care and other costs that enables them to live a decent
life.</hs_Para>

contribute greatly to economic development, as I have seen in my
constituency, where communities have come together to raise money. I
attended a recent event at which some 500 people from the British
Somali community got together to raise money. It was organised by some
of my constituents who are here today: Ayan Mahamoud, Abdi Rashid
Gulaid and many others. They raised nearly £1 million in one
evening by calling on the community to act to rebuild their country, to
rebuild roads and to rebuild infrastructure.</hs_Para>

case in point of communities helping themselves to rebuild their
country, rather than depending on aid. We have heard a lot from
Ministers from the Department for International Development about the
need for self-reliance. I passionately believe that that is what people
want in their own countries, and the best way to encourage that is to
build a system of remittance through which people can send money
legitimately to help rebuild their countries and lift the inhabitants
out of poverty. Such a system can work alongside the important
international aid effort to which we
contribute.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012275000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012275000054">My
hon. Friend the Member for Cardiff West set out the background and
described the inconsistencies inherent in the decision by Barclays. The
Government must act to provide a medium-term and a long-term solution
to this serious problem. The fact that 130,000 people got behind the
campaign and tens of thousands more signed petitions—teenage
Somali girls even went around markets and visited people’s
houses to get them to sign up to the campaign—shows how much
people believe this matters because it affects their lives. People talk
about communities feeling disfranchised, but that is an example of a
community that led the way because the bank’s decision affected
their families and friends so directly.</hs_Para>

that money will absolutely end up in the wrong hands, which is
dangerous for those countries and for our security. That issue must be
confronted. We need a solution that addresses issues of security and
counter-terrorism. The withdrawal of legitimate banking facilities will
open the way for such forces and present bigger dangers for us,

help, and many have cited M-Pesa as a potential example. The reality is
that such technology does not go far enough, however. Not everyone can

there are banking systems and proper infrastructure, it is much easier
to create the possibility of mobile phone transfer, but Somalia is a

The remitters felt that it did not address the seriousness of the issue
and was a superficial exercise. Frankly, going only into Hargeisa is
not good enough. The trusted networks that organisations such as

in my constituency, and elsewhere, have pointed out that if they want
to get remittance in without the proper facility, which has so far been

Add in the cost and it makes it pointless to get the remittance that

they are significant in providing support. The cost of retrieving the
money, however, is too high if there is no direct route via money
transfer companies that can get to remote villages. If there is no

Other countries, such as China or India, are represented in Africa,
while our banks are pulling people out, including the diaspora
communities with strong links that could do more for our trading
relationships in Africa. Remittance is the first route in for our
businesses. I have seen that in countries such as India, Pakistan,

with the issue directly, coming up with an international solution and
paving the way for our international partners. There are also benefits
because for any country coming out of conflict without a proper banking
system, or with one that has been devastated by conflict, the risks of
money laundering and the financing of terrorism will be reduced if the
security dimension is addressed and there are proper facilities. That
is why Governments must step up. Companies such as Barclays, HSBC and
others have said that they will be fined. Companies will have their
motives, reasons and deep concerns about being clobbered with a big
fine by US regulators. I have sympathy for that, but at that point the
Government and the international community must step in to deal with

formal discussions at the G20 and other international summits where the
issues of financial exclusion and remittance can be raised. I know that
that has been done informally, but what plans does the Minister have to
raise such issues more formally in the relevant forthcoming summits? On
the role of other agencies, will the Minister explain how his
Department is working with the Financial Conduct Authority, banks and
other relevant agencies to come up with a solution? What role could the
publicly owned banks play? Could we work with them to come up with an
interim solution, as well as a long-term
one?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012275000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012275000073">I
hope that the Minister will answer the questions that have already been
asked, but I would also be grateful if he set out his plans for an
interim solution, as well as a long-term one, before October. The time
line has been set: if a negative decision is reached in October—

<?notus-xml column=82?>the deadline set by the courts for Dahabshiil, the biggest provider to
Somalia and Somaliland in my constituency—the vital remittance
lifeline for Somalia will be removed. That is dangerous. Will the
Minister be able to press on with a solution before then? If there is
no long-term solution in that time frame, there
must be an interim solution so that, beyond October, where there is a
time lag, Dahabshiil does not face closure once again. That would be
devastating to Somalia and
Somaliland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012275000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012275000074">I

this important issue. It is important that we have been able to debate
it again so that we can get some answers and see what progress has been
made. I pay tribute to my hon. Friend the Member for Bethnal Green and
Bow (Rushanara Ali) and, indeed, Members from across the House. It was
good to see the right hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) in the

want to emphasise the strength of feeling out there in the local
community. Just before the Christmas recess, I attended a packed
meeting in Butetown in my constituency in Cardiff South and Penarth. It
was filled with people predominantly from the Somali
community—young and old, recent migrants to this country and
people whose family had been here for generations.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:19:50"></hs_TimeCode> my hon.
Friend the Member for Cardiff West mentioned, Cardiff has a strong and
long-standing Somali community, as well as Yemeni, Bengali and Indian
communities. This issue reaches across people of many different
backgrounds, countries and histories. That is a hallmark of the
campaign and emphasises the strength of
feeling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000004">One
of the most respected imams in the local community, who does not
normally attend political meetings, was there, which again emphasises
the strength of feeling. My local councillor and colleague, Ali Ahmed,
and many other members of the local community attended. They
highlighted the issues raised in the debate today: the impact on
development, jobs and prospects in countries  
<?notus-xml column=83?>such as Somaliland and Somalia and elsewhere, and
also the impact on jobs and opportunities for small
businesses here in the
UK—m<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>y
hon. Friend mentioned a specific case in his constituency. There were
also concerns about zakat and the ability to fulfil the
responsibilities that many in the Islamic community here in the UK
perform so generously and so well. There were concerns about security
and about how people could be forced underground if we do not find a
solution. As my hon. Friend said, we could find ourselves in a far
worse situation than that which Barclays appears to be suggesting has
forced it into making its
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:21:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000005">I
pay tribute to the huge efforts of the campaign and the hundreds of
thousands of people who have signed the petition and campaigned up and
down the country. I thank the Government—there has been some
effort and some meetings. My concern is the urgency, the detail and the
process going forward, and I want assurances that the concerns raised
by the campaign and by the individuals affected are being
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:21:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000006">It
is important to emphasise the scale of the impact. The UK remits $23
billion annually to third countries. For Somaliland, the figure is
estimated at £500 million annually. According to one estimate,
Somalia receives 50% of its annual gross national income through
remittances, and Oxfam estimates that 40% of the Somali
population—some 3.8 million people—depend on remittances.
We have heard how remittance figures often dwarf international aid
flows, and I think we would see a similar situation if we looked at the
detailed statistics for many of the other countries
affected<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:22:37"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have heard about the implications for development and economic
prospects, and for security and human rights. That is why we need to

have specific questions for the Minister, and I hope he can give some
assurances. First, focusing on the way in which Government Departments
work together on this issue, we have seen statements by the Treasury,
DFID and others, but can the Minister assure us that the Treasury is
playing a key co-ordinating role, given the nature of its relationships
with the financial sector and the ability to achieve change on a global
financial scale? Have the Foreign Office and other bodies for which the
Foreign Office has responsibility been included, and have proper
assessments been made? I am sure the Minister will not be able to share
details, but can he assure us that, for example, the security services
have assessed the implications? We have already seen worrying coverage
in recent weeks about the activities of al-Shabaab in the horn of
Africa, and we saw the terrible events at the mall in Kenya. Can the
Minister assure us that full assessments are being made of the
implications of not finding a solution to the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:23:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000008">I
also want assurances on who is attending meetings. Campaigners have
raised concerns that, although a couple of representatives from DFID
and perhaps the Treasury have been at the meetings, there has not been
cross-governmental participation, so I would like assurances that when
discussions occur—internally and externally—there is full
participation by all Departments, not just the Treasury and DFID,
because the matter affects the Foreign Office, the Home Office and many
others<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:24:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000009">I
want to know about discussions at the international level. Like
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:24:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bethnal Green and Bow, I want to know what discussions
will take place at events such as the G20. The problem is 
<?notus-xml column=84?>being instigated largely by decisions taken by United States regulators.
Until we can address the legitimate concerns that the regulators are
raising, we will not be able to come to a long-term global solution.
Like my hon. Friend, I want to know about the interim solution and when
the action group is going to
meet<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:25:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000010">Can
the Minister tell us about the discussions he has had recently with
DFID about the clear time frame  and action plan for the safe
corridor? There is a lot  of expectation and hope around that,
but also a lot of unanswered questions that members of the community
and campaigners have asked, so can the Minister reassure
us<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:25:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000011">There
is a wider issue of engagement with the many stakeholders out there in
the community, particularly in the diaspora community, and how feedback
is being given at different stages of the process. Some members of the
community rightly feel that they have not had the feedback and
assurances that things are moving forward at the speed and with the
seriousness that we would all like. Is the Minister able to
share—perhaps in the Library—some of the reports into the
wider implications that have been undertaken internally by the
Government? There are concerns that some of the reports have not been
made public, which adds to a sense of doubt about whether anything is
happening or whether solutions will be
found.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012277000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012277000012">Finally,
what is the Minister’s assessment of the legal situation and the
injunction that has been granted? I appreciate that the Government
cannot intervene in the judicial process, but it is a key factor in
terms of the timing and that window of opportunity in which we have to
find a solution. What is his assessment of what has been going on in
that process? To what time scales are we working? Will we get into a
situation in which we arrive at that process—or an earlier legal
process if Barclays continues to challenge the injunction—and
suddenly find that Dahabshiil or other money transfer operators have to
close down, and the millions of people who to rely on such services are
left high and

important to put on the record how much of an interest people have
taken in this topic since the debate in July. Having read the
transcripts of that debate and looked closely at the parliamentary
questions and the responses since then, I suspect it is more with
sorrow than with anger that people have called for this additional
debate today, because, to be fair, there seemed to be a sense of hope
after the previous debate that the Minister had taken on board the
importance of the issue. During that debate he gave a personal account

Ministers would like. Hopefully, however, the continued voicing of
concern even by the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:29:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Cardiff West outlined how important this issue is, not
only for individuals and particular businesses but for the economy,
both here and in Somalia and Somaliland. There is also the relationship
between the moral issues and the economic issues, if you like: people
are trying to provide assistance to individual families and to support
businesses, and if that help is not provided there are dangers for the
whole economy.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>We also heard
some of the history, going back to the previous debate about the
decision that Barclays took at that time and the pressure from
campaigners to make Barclays change that decision.</hs_Para>

understanding on all sides that
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:30:41"></hs_TimeCode>we want to do
everything we can to ensure that when money is remitted or transferred
it is done so legally and safely. I doubt that anyone in any part of
the House does not want tough action to be taken on money laundering or
any other illegality, or in situations where people are perhaps being
unduly and inappropriately pressured over money.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:31:17"></hs_TimeCode>However, the
point was well made in this debate, and indeed in the previous debate,
that some of the smaller organisations and institutions that have been
carrying out money transfers have not been found guilty of any
misdemeanours or wrongdoing, unlike—as was fairly pointed
out—some of our larger financial institutions, which have been
involved in practices over the years that have now been brought into
disrepute and, in some instances, resulted in serious fines.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T10:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>There are still
serious questions to be asked about why there is a problem making
progress on this issue. I would be interested to hear from the Minister
what work has gone on in relation to the National Crime Agency and to

progress.</hs_Para>

hope that the Minister can also answer the important questions put by
my hon. Friends. Some months on from the original debate, during which
the commitment was made to establish a working group to take work
forward, I find it surprising that my hon. Friends still have to ask
who is chairing that group. Has the group met? It has not met. There is
now a date for a meeting, 
<?notus-xml column=86?>but when will it report? Will there be an interim report? What progress
has been made? What discussions have taken place in an international
context with, for example, the US Treasury and State Department? What
discussions have taken place more widely? Are there more reports
commissioned by the Government that have not been made public? What is
the status of the promised discussions with the British Bankers

the legal constraints on discussion of the particular issue with
Barclays and the possibility of accounts being reopened?</hs_Para>

want the Minister to respond to those questions, although he already

question is about the role of the Financial Conduct Authority. Can he
say a bit more about that role this morning?</hs_Para>

given commitments in the previous debate, and because he obviously
understands this subject from a personal perspective, I am sure that
the Minister wants not only to listen today, so that he can give
answers to the questions that have been put, but to ensure that a
degree of urgency is injected into wherever it is in the system that
the barriers to action are found. If that does not happen and if we do
not have a system that is properly set up and regulated, the danger is
that remittances will take place anyway, that the people involved will

context for the debate is the trend in recent years for banks in many

bank is private and commercial, and in accordance with their risk

the Help to Buy scheme. That is a good example of a scheme that is

provision for MSBs. That can work if it is done in a certain way. The
action group is working to produce more guidance on how we think that
can work, with the aim of making the banks more comfortable. That is
why it is important to discuss the matter around the table with
regulators and NGOs, which are also part of the action group. That is

parts to my answer. First, there is a legal dispute, and I do not think
it is sensible for any Minister to give an opinion on any matter that
is before our courts, which would not be helpful to either party in the

targets—I referred to the target that the Somali focus group
pilot would be up and running within a year—but we also have to
respect that there is no advantage in setting an artificial target and
saying that something should be done in six months or a year. This
complex issue requires a degree of international involvement and
co-ordination, so the most important thing is to ensure that we do the
work urgently, but in a way that brings a long-lasting solution. While

odds betting terminals have transformed betting shops into high street

“mini casinos.” He proposes that action be taken to limit
the effect of fixed odds betting terminals and to give powers to local

of taking bets of up to £100 every 20 seconds on touch-screen
games such as

as addictive and engaging as possible. That is why it has always been
restricted to a highly regulated casino environment, until the
bookmakers put it on a machine in 2001, increased the speed of play and
turned it into a solitary activity. The availability of that form of
gambling on the high street has had disastrous consequences in
Lancashire. In my constituency of Hyndburn, in just 13 betting shops,

Lancashire, the poorer areas of the county and Blackpool. My regional
newspaper, the <I>Lancashire Telegraph</I>, has published numerous
articles on the problems of FOBTs in east Lancashire over the past 14
months. Early last year, its concern led to a front page article
titled, “East Lancashire punters spent more than £270m on
gambling machines in 2012”. That highlighted the scale of the
problem in east Lancashire, so much so that many people were simply
staggered by that figure. The paper also carried a story about one

We have to look at all the evidence, as well as adopting the
precautionary principle. We also have to take into account all the
other surveys that contrast with that figure and show that these
machines are highly addictive. The gambling prevalence survey shows
that and, as the hon. Gentleman well knows, it was ended by his
Government; the last one was done in 2010, so the lack of information
is partly down to the Government. I know that Government Members signed
early-day motion 1030 last year, complaining about the
Government’s withdrawal of the survey, which would have provided
an evidential base. It is important that we look at all the evidence

anti-gambling. I occasionally bet on horses and football. There is an
element of judgment to such gambling. Odds rise and fall, and there is
a significant period between the placing of such a bet and the
conclusion of the event. FOBTs, however, are not so much gambling as
gaming. As the name implies, there are fixed odds and an algorithm in
the game designed to ensure that the player loses. The laws in the UK
are weak. When Newham council defended its decision to oppose the
opening of a Paddy Power bookmakers on the basis that FOBTs are gaming
and not gambling, and so require a separate licence, the judge found
with the bookmaker. That is wrong and my right hon. Friend the Leader

Act 2005, which legitimised FOBTs, has three objectives: gambling must
be fair and open, it must not be associated with crime or disorder and
it must not harm young or vulnerable people. It is clear that FOBTs are
in breach of all three. The speed of play is more than five times
faster than in a casino, so players will lose their cash much quicker
than if they were playing live roulette. FOBTs also increase the
accessibility of hard gambling, at up to £100 a spin, to a
demographic that cannot afford to play casino games.</hs_Para>

the Campaign for Fairer Gambling commissioned 2CV to poll more than 500
betting shop customers. It found that the average bet per spin was
£17, and the poorest and those unemployed were gambling
£19 a spin. It also found that the average amount of cash going
into the machines was £55, and one in five was putting in more
than £100 a time. That poll was taken in Newham, one of the most
economically deprived boroughs in London, and provides an insight into
why bookmakers are targeting the poorest areas. The results of that
survey are not dissimilar to those that would be found in Lancashire,
particularly the poorer parts of the county. There are 48 FOBTs in
Hyndburn, but in the affluent Ribble valley—an area with twice
the average income and many times more wealthy people—there are
just 18. In Blackburn, there are 73 FOBTs, while in affluent Wyre there
are just 29. There are 157 FOBTs in Blackpool.</hs_Para>

demographic, poorer people are more likely to start gambling than any
other, but they are the demographic that can least afford to lose, and
the bookmakers aggressively market the most addictive gambling product
to them. Customers will often go into betting shops in Lancashire to
bet on racing or sports, only to be offered £20 free credit or
the opportunity to participate in a tournament on the FOBTs, designed
to get them hooked. 2CV’s polling found that nearly nine out of
10 FOBT users described the machines as addictive, more than two thirds
had chased their losses, more than three quarters had spent more than
they had planned to and 62% had gambled until all their money was
gone.</hs_Para>

illustrates a problem with this particular gambling product, and
empirical evidence based on the two most recent British gambling
prevalence surveys shows that FOBTs are the most addictive form of
gambling. Secondary research based on the 2007 British gambling
prevalence survey found FOBTs to have a stronger association with
problem gambling than any other gambling activity. Professor Jim
Orford’s research, based on the 2010 British gambling prevalence
survey, found that nearly a quarter of the profits from FOBTs came from
people with gambling problems—and that stretches to 40% if
at-risk gamblers are included.</hs_Para>

Government want to wait for research commissioned by the Responsible
Gambling Trust before they restrict FOBTs, but NatCen, which has been
commissioned to carry out the research, has said that the data alone
will not provide conclusions that are an adequate basis for policy. The
data will tell us what but not why, and it is the why that the
Government are interested in.</hs_Para>

there is enough research to justify a precautionary reduction in the
maximum stake on the machines, the research that the Government are
waiting for will tell them nothing about player behaviour. That raises

elsewhere. Based on historical growth, losses on FOBTs in Hyndburn are

local authorities have sufficient powers is often raised in such
debates, but I believe that their powers are sufficient to deal with
concerns. Local authorities can reject an application for a gambling
premises licence or grant one with additional conditions. They have the
power to review a premises licence after it has been granted and can
actually impose licence conditions after review. Many local authorities
have already used those powers to good effect—I congratulate
Newham, which used its powers in November—and the Government
urge local authorities fully to utilise the powers at their disposal to
tackle problem gambling in their

want to pick up on three issues raised by the hon. Gentleman. First, he
mentioned the scrapping of the annual prevalence survey, which was an
expensive way of measuring problem gambling, with over £500,000
of taxpayer money being spent on each survey. The health surveys for
England and Scotland now measure problem gambling rates, which is a
much more cost-effective and efficient method of collecting
data.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman referred to a request made by the university of
Cambridge for a FOBT for research purposes. I am willing to write to
those concerned to assist in the resolution of that matter. Thirdly,
the hon. Gentleman remarked on the link between the location of betting
shops and deprivation, but I understand that such shops are located
according to footfall. To back that up, no significant correlation
exists between the indices of multiple deprivation and problem gambling
rates. That was confirmed by the December 2013 health
survey<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T11:27:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012278000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012278000056">In
conclusion, the Government are undertaking urgent work to ensure the
safety of all users of fixed odds betting terminals. The industry will
be reporting to me next week on its plans for targeted player
protection measures for those at greatest risk. I do not rule out any
action that may be necessary to make machines safer. If the player
protection measures do not prove sufficient, or if the balance of
evidence suggests that precautionary action on stakes and prizes or
other measures is required, the Government will not hesitate to
act.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012278000067" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012278000067">11.28

responsibility at the very top of St John that has to be
held to account<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:34:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
My understanding is that, in recent years, the St John
accumulated reserves have suffered from a near catastrophic 30% loss. I

downhill, with sessions booked from a centralised HQ in Aylesbury that
is out of touch with the rest of the new region. In same area of the
former area, there were 146 trained emergency ambulance crews; in the
corresponding new administrative area, there are only 86. I was told of
headquarters premises sold by St John for £80,000 to

St John, but by members of my local group, for whom I have
always had enormous respect and whose service in my constituency has

of St John. None of the people I have spoken to within
St John is in any way resistant to the idea that the Charity
Commission has some responsibility for overseeing the charity, and they
would welcome any investigation that might be thought necessary. This

local disparities in service might very well be part of the problem,
and that could be an issue when forming a picture of the organisation
and its recent management that is perhaps not as complete as it might
be. We know that the organisation was, in essence, £9 million in
deficit by 2011 and that that deficit was growing. Any organisation has
to face the reality that if it is that much in the red and things are
not getting better, change is needed. I understand that there might be
some objections to how that deficit arose, but it is instructive that,
by the end of 2014, this organisation that was recently
£9 million in the red will be registering a small

Wood:</Member></B> I am grateful for that intervention because it makes
my next point for me. In spite of what has happened, and against that
background, my understanding is that the organisation
nationally—this is certainly my experience locally—has
improved its performance. It is training more people and functioning in
a much more open fashion, and it has listened and taken note of the
report it sought on its governance. As I understand it, the report was
independent and said that the organisation 
<?notus-xml column=108?>was too bureaucratic and complex, that it lacked clear governance
policies and lines of accountability and that, essentially, there were
too many committees and too many roles. Perhaps that is inevitable in
an organisation split over 41 semi-autonomous bodies but, none the
less, St John sought to improve that state of affairs after
hearing the view of the expert body asked to review it. Again, my
group, which is based just over the border into Wakefield, at Ossett,
has welcomed the improved situation in which it now
functions.</hs_Para>

is also important to look at information from bodies such as the Care

about the organisation and management of a St John home in
their area, it is their responsibility to make those concerns public.
Nobody has any misgivings about that, or any opinion other than that
that is exactly the right thing to do. I would have done the same about
something in my constituency, but to extrapolate from that a wholesale

that is not the case for all parts of Kent, but I am talking in the

pro bono to train St John Ambulance volunteers in first aid,
and in particular, as he was a consultant chest and heart physician, in
first aid relating to cardiac arrest. I have therefore had a
long-standing interest in the work of the Order of St John
and St John Ambulance. As Chairman of the Select Committee
on International Development, I was very interested in the work that
they do and continue to do with the St John Eye Hospital in
Palestine. For most Palestinians, Muslim or Christian, I understand
that it is the only eye hospital to which they have access.</hs_Para>

hope that all of us will have seen the work of St John
Ambulance in our constituencies. St John Ambulance clearly
has a vision and an intention that everyone who needs first aid should
receive it when they need it and that no one should suffer from the
lack of trained first aiders. It is a real tragedy and, indeed,
unacceptable that many people have died needlessly because no one was
available to give them first aid when they needed it.

leading supporters of St John Ambulance in my constituency
is Sir Frank Davies, who for many years was chief executive of the
Health and Safety Executive. I know he was very supportive in that role
of the work that St John Ambulance does in teaching people
first aid in the workplace. St John teaches people who
become volunteers for St John Ambulance, who offer their
skills and time to be the difference right in the heart of their own
communities, to be potential first responders at public events, and to
provide back-up to local ambulance services.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>Across the
country, St John Ambulance has just under 40,000 volunteers
providing first aid services in communities. About half of
St John adult volunteers are under 25. St John
Ambulance covered just over 50,000 events in 2012 and treated and
supported about 90,000 people at those events. That. I suggest, is big

John Ambulance is not the only large national charity that, in recent
years, has found the need to restructure. The recent restructuring of
St John Ambulance 
<?notus-xml column=110?>is almost identical to the restructuring undertaken a number of years
ago by the British Red Cross, which also found that a structure of a
number of semi-autonomous county and local headquarters was too
bureaucratic and complex, and did not allow them to tackle situations
as quickly and as efficiently as it wanted to.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:18:43"></hs_TimeCode>The changes
introduced by St John were intended to save lives, rather
than to preserve a former governance structure for its own sake.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:18:59"></hs_TimeCode> is also
important to recognise that as a modern health care charity,
St John is registered with the Care Quality Commission, is
registered in due course with Monitor and has a whole number of child
protection responsibilities. I think the whole House would therefore
understand that it is imperative that St John Ambulance has
clear governance policies and lines of accountability.</hs_Para>

understand that St John went through an independent
governance review, which concluded that St John previously
had too many committees and too many roles. As a consequence, it
decided to change its governance arrangements in discussion with
St John volunteers, as, not surprisingly, everyone wanted
St John to be much more joined-up and to have a structure
that could move as quickly as possible to bring first aid to people who
need it. I understand that, as a consequence, St John
Ambulance has made it a priority to improve the training of front-line
volunteers still further, and many of the St John volunteers
have benefited from a wider range of training opportunities provided
under the new governance
structures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0001.htm#14012282000064">In
addition to governance and organisational concerns, one of the reasons
why the British Red Cross restructured a number of years ago was that
it too was concerned about the financial implications of the previous
structure. It is clear from annual reports that the deficits of recent
years at St John Ambulance arose partly because trustees
decided to invest in new charitable programmes and partly because the
difficult economic environment affected many charities’
fundraising. There was an overall net deficit of £8.9 million in
2011. However, I understand that St John Ambulance is
budgeting for a small surplus this year, and the charity has cash and
investments of about £20 million. It is therefore in a strong
financial position, but—like all charities nowadays—it
looks continually for ways to be more cost-effective in delivering its
charitable objectives.</hs_Para>

activities, such as first aid training in the workplace, or providing
first aid at events where the organisers make a profit, are run to make
a surplus, but that surplus is used to expand St
John’s charitable work such as the teaching of first aid to
young people, or providing first aid at not-for-profit community
events. As the House may know, I am the Commons chair of the all-party
group on carers. Often carers need training, but training for carers is
at present somewhat haphazard. Given the national footprint of
St John Ambulance, I hope that it may be possible to

In addition to youngsters, unemployed young people are going through
the training system. An initiative launched in the past year by
St John called “In their community” enables
youngsters between the ages of 14 and 17, including cadets, to use
their skills to deliver first aid training to others—that is
self-help among young people. In another programme, “Your first

must accept that St John Ambulance, like many other
organisations, needs to remain fresh and vibrant. The Scouts and Guides
have already gone down that path, and so have political parties.
St John Ambulance will evolve to keep in step in society and
to meet changing challenges. St John, facing significant
financial losses that could have brought the organisation crashing
down, tried with the help of operational front-line volunteers and
others to find a way not only to save the organisation but to give it a
future. I suggest that that is what the restructuring has done, but I
think—referring back to the comments of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:29:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Thanet—it needs to find a way to retain the
ethos of localism. After all, that is what all political parties
want—localism is part of their agenda. One way of saving money
is to acknowledge the fact that the semi-independent divisions were
costing money. We all recognise that not everyone welcomes change, but

James Gray</B> (North Wiltshire) (Con):</Member> Thank you, Mr Turner.
I will try to be brief because much of what needs to be said in the
debate has already been said—I will certainly try to avoid
repeating
anything.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000081">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T14:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>
me start with what I believe to be three truths that will be welcomed
by everyone in the Chamber. The first is that over many years
St John Ambulance has done fantastic work for the people of
this country. Every year it attends 52,000 events, many of which would
not occur were St John Ambulance not there. An ambulance and
first aid service have to be available at such events, and
St John provides that at very modest cost to the organisers.
I have been a beneficiary of that
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000082">The
second universal truth is that the very many people who are members of
St John Ambulance and have been trained by the organisation
enjoy their participation greatly. It is a superb volunteer
organisation. I pay huge tribute to the people of Wiltshire who are
members of our extremely active branches throughout the county. Their
great work is much
appreciated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:30:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000083">The
third universal truth, however, is that when any
organisation—whether a voluntary organisation such as
St John Ambulance, a business, a military organisation or a
political organisation—is reorganised, many people in that
organisation do not like it. Those who have been the chairmen or
members of the committees of the 41 separate organisations that
were previously St John Ambulance—or, indeed, members
of the sub-units, or other committees and organisations—do not
like the fact that they are no longer involved in the way in which they
were previously. I understand that very human
emotion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:31:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000084">Let
me put the counter-argument for a moment, however. I have been briefed
on the matter by my close friend, David Hempleman-Adams, who was the
chairman of the Wiltshire branch of St John Ambulance. He
assisted in the reorganisation and is now a trustee nationally. He is
one of those who say, “We couldn’t go on the way we were.
This was not the sustainable structure that we wanted to have for the
time to
come<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:31:51"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000085">Let
us put aside for a moment the question of whether people in the
organisation wanted it to be reorganised, although that is a key matter
of great concern, and I am sure that St John Ambulance will
be listening carefully to the concerns of many local people that are
being raised in the debate. However, as I mentioned in an intervention
on my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:32:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale), that is not a
matter for the Government. It would be wrong if the Government took an
interest in the internal organisation of a voluntary body such as
St John Ambulance, so the Minister is not qualified to
respond to those particular
criticisms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000086">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:32:24"></hs_TimeCode>
subject of the debate is the charity commissioners’ governance
of St John Ambulance, and of course that, to some degree, is
a matter for Parliament and Ministers—or at least it would be if
the charity commissioners were not doing the job that the Government
have asked them to do. The commissioners’ job is to look at the
huge number of charities in the UK—I suspect that there may be
hundreds of thousands if we include all the very small ones—and
keep an eye on them to ensure that they are fulfilling the charitable
functions that they are supposed to fulfil and that they are
sustainable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:33:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=114?><hs_Para UID="14012282000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000087">I think that I
am right in saying that the charity commissioners would intervene only
if a charity was not doing what it was set up to do, or if it was not
sustainable. If a charity were, for example, losing large amounts of
money every year and misusing the funds of volunteers or members of the
organisation, that would indeed be a reason for the charity
commissioners to step in and look that. I was not surprised in the
slightest by the reaction that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:33:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Thanet got from the charity
commissioners—indeed, I strongly welcomed it. They said,
“We’ve looked into this and actually these are not
matters for us; they are matters for St John Ambulance
internally.” I was very glad indeed that the charity
commissioners did not choose to intervene in detail on the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000088">I
suspect, however, that had the organisation continued to lose the
£9 million a year that it was losing until the reorganisation,
that would indeed have been a matter for the charity commissioners. I
understand that St John Ambulance still has reserves of some
£20 million. As it was losing £9 million a year, that
would mean that it would have been insolvent after another two years,
which would indeed have been a matter of grave concern to the charity
commissioners, as well as the organisers of the 52,000 events that the
body attends every year and the 300,000 people who take part in it.
That would be an extraordinarily important matter, and I am glad that
that situation will now not occur following the body’s
reorganisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000089">I
fear that bodies that have existed for many tens or even hundreds of
years often become a little sclerotic and very local. We in the
Conservative party know that extremely well. Some of our branches and
associations are not quite of the great strength and power that was the
case were many years ago. We see such things nationally all the time,
but I very much welcome the fact that St John Ambulance
realised the problem that it was facing. It understood that it would be
in difficulty with the Charity Commission if it did not do something
about it, and it set about saying, “We provide a first-class
service for local people, and local people love being part of it. We
will therefore take difficult steps to reorganise the organisation so
that it remains solvent for the years to
come.”</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012282000150" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000150">3.35

head-on. We ran a balanced revenue budget each year. We had a
successful fundraising programme that paid for capital improvements and
equipment, and our fundraisers knew where the pockets were to be
picked. We had notional reserves of more than £700,000. The
number of cadets and recruits remained steady. We had high standards of
clinical governance, as endorsed by the Care Quality Commission. We ran
the most successful patient transport in the country. Our properties
were in good order and well used. Our senior volunteers were at the top
of their peer group, and St John was widely respected
throughout the
county<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:37:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012282000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#14012282000094">St
John in Suffolk, although not without its challenges, was run well and
was achieving its charitable goals. That said, I am aware that that was
not the situation in all counties across the country and, by 2011, an
£8.9 million deficit had emerged. Yes, there was a
case for restructuring. There were 41 headquarters across the country.
There were probably too many people involved in governance and there
was a need for a flatter management structure. There was a need for
more co-ordination between divisions with regard to fees and charges,
equipment and training. One could argue that the fact that
St John is budgeting for a small surplus in 2014 justifies
its restructuring, although from the feedback that I have received, it
is clear that something has been lost along the

working hard to ensure that the front line is not affected. The

eastern region. However, charges for attendance at events have gone up
and, although I understand the need to maximise earnings, bookings as a
whole are down. Although financial performance across the country as a

The restructuring of St John Ambulance must be seen as work
in progress. The priory must accept that mistakes have been made along
the way and it must not adopt a siege mentality against its critics. It
must listen to criticism with an open mind and move on quickly from the
agenda of suspensions and disciplinary proceedings.</hs_Para>

the debate. I will make some local points about the St John
home in my constituency, after which I will address several of the
national issues that have been raised and debated by people who have
had a longer involvement with the Order of St John than I
have. I should perhaps say that my grandfather was the St
John Ambulance county commissioner for Kent. At the time, he was the
county’s largest employer, so I imagine that the many years of
his time that he gave for free were of some value. That was a long time
ago, but more recently a friend of mine has been involved with the
St John eye clinics in Palestine, and I am constantly
impressed when I see people on the St John

specifically on the St John home in Tankerton in my
constituency. That much-loved home was founded in 1947 and given to the
Priory of England and the Islands in 1955. It was transferred to
St John Ambulance in 1999, and it has always had a separate
governance structure. The people who gave the home its £750,000
in assets did so, almost without exception, because they had a
connection with the home. Had any of them realised that its separate
governance structure had no legal basis and that those assets might one
day be seized by the centre, I suspect that the fundraising would have
taken a very different shape. The capital earns around £30,000
in interest, which bridges the gap between the cost of running the home
and the income that it receives from residents and Kent county council.
The home is small, with only 18 beds, and that money is essential for
its financial viability.</hs_Para>

respect for my right hon. Friend the Member for Banbury (Sir Tony

surprised by his allusion to the restructuring of the Red Cross, and
the fact that he did not pass on—perhaps because St
John had not told him—what actually happened with the Red Cross
reorganisation. When he referred to the St John home in my
constituency, however, I was 
<?notus-xml column=117?>truly staggered to hear him quoting from the letter
of 17 October from the prior, when the
letter that we received only a fortnight later dated 5 November
stressed that the moneys referred to in previous correspondence could
not be regarded as legally restricted. As the separate governance
structure of the home is being broken up, there is nothing to stop the
priory taking those moneys at any notice.</hs_Para>

criticism of the changes in St John has been treated. Of

that illustrates the extent to which governance has broken down in the

John, he had legal training and he was a clergyman. Unfortunately, he
breached the first principle of natural justice, because he had been an

<?notus-xml column=118?>specific question, and I would like to ask another one. Is it right that
the Charity Commission should confine itself to areas in which it has a
specific legal duty to intervene? Might one reasonably expect any

discuss it with elected representatives, something has gone wrong in
the organisation. It may well examine what is going on in the
St John charity and conclude that the whole thing is a storm
in a teacup, although I maintain that the administrative failings of
the process at the centre, and the changing of mind on the
various guarantees paid to the St John home in my

unwilling even to hold a meeting. Of course, since we secured the

if the charity commissioners were to start having meetings of that

charities that might well be in similar disputes throughout the nation,

which the Minister can respond. As we have heard, like many charities,
St John Ambulance has recently restructured. The hon. Member for
Braintree (Mr Newmark) emphasised the fact that the recession has hit
the voluntary and charity sector hard. Last year, 58% of charities

costs.</hs_Para>

one in 10 charities fear that they will not exist in five years’

have a copy here for the Minister—Newcastle council for
voluntary service found that, in the north-east, 30% of charities,
rather than one in 10, fear that they will not exist in five
years’ time. Nevertheless, year on year, demand for services
continues to rise. In Newcastle, 62% of charities experienced an
increase in demand for services last year, and 52% were using their
reserves simply to survive. Newcastle CVS said in its report that, as a
result, charities and voluntary organisations are all having to think

more resilient. We have heard some of the consequences of that in the

The Cabinet Office is currently consulting on whether to extend the
commission’s powers to act where there is abuse of a charity or
non-compliance with charity law. When the Minister responds, will he
tell us whether he feels that the commission is able fully to discharge
its duties, and the proposed new duties, given the 30% cut it is
operating under? Given that its board is picked by Ministers, will the

wherein the charity regulator—a public sector

we have heard much about the concerns regarding the specifics of the St
John Ambulance restructuring, particularly the impact in Kent, but also
elsewhere. The restructuring of a shared service—on a shared
ambulance basis—has apparently undermined local pride and
support for the services on which so many depend. That seems to speak
to a desire to ape what is all too often the private sector approach to
public sector service delivery. However, the strength of charities is
in their local communities, something emphasised by the

As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:03:20"></hs_TimeCode> the hon.

such challenges are faced by a lot of voluntary

relevant to us—it was the laser-like focus of my hon. Friends

the Charity Commission. That role is extremely important and
challenging. We ask the commissioners to be guardians of the integrity
of one of the most important sectors of our society, the voluntary
sector. That integrity and trust mobilises £14.6 billion worth
of our constituents’ money and millions of hours of volunteering
each year, and such integrity and trust is hugely important. There is
no doubt that the Charity Commission is operating under very
challenging circumstances, given budgetary pressures and the high

Charity Commission is under new leadership. There is a new board, which
we have confidence in. The leadership has made it clear that they think
they can perform their role within the existing budget, but our message

role, because of its importance and because we think that in the past
they have gone off-mission. We want them to tackle issues of serious

have a power to intervene outside of a formal inquiry, which is
appropriate only where there is serious mismanagement or abuse. They
can intervene only where there is serious risk of significant harm to
or abuse of a charity, its assets, beneficiaries or reputation, and
where the Commission considers that its intervention is a necessary and
proportionate response to protect those. Otherwise, the law
specifically prohibits the Charity Commission from acting in the
administration of a charity. The commissioners do not want to do that,
because that is a matter for the trustees. Such interference would
conflict with the independence of charities and their trustees
being—this is important—one of the cornerstones of
charity law in England and Wales, provided they act within the law and
the terms of the charity’s governing
documents<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000024">The

worth dwelling on that fact: over Christmas and in the ghastly wet days
that followed, almost the same amount of rain that flooded my
constituency fell in the Netherlands, but there were no floods in the

three points with me. One is about whole-river catchment and additional
house building in Taunton, and whether that is having an effect on
flooding, including making it more rapid. Another issue is pumping, and
my hon. Friend has already touched on that, but I would be grateful if
he expanded even further on the main issue—the No. 1 priority

main roads into Langport, is closed. Aller drove is flooded, which may
be a result of the Environment Agency tinkering with the spillway

capacity so that we can run the pumps and get water away. That is what
people find most offensive—that we cannot get water away. The

also want to say how sorry we are for those people who have had their
homes or businesses flooded, some of whom have experienced re-flooding.
I represent a constituency that has recently experienced tidal surges
and flooding, and the effects are felt not just in the loss of personal
possessions but in the wait for a home or business to dry out and be
fit to live or work in again—flooding is equally devastating for
business owners. It is horrible time for all those affected and our
thoughts obviously go out to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000075">We
cannot prevent flooding completely, as hon. Members have acknowledged.
When the weather deteriorates, there are well practised approaches to
warning and informing emergency responders and the general public of
what is likely to happen. That is why we have local resilience forums,
one for each police force area, identifying the risks faced at the
local level and drawing up plans to ensure a response if such
risks materialise. If local responders are overwhelmed or if an
emergency affects multiple areas, the Government can support the
response.</hs_Para>

emergencies, the lead Government Department —in this case the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs—is
responsible for monitoring the situation on the ground, assessing what,
if any, Government support is needed in the immediate aftermath, and
ensuring that the Government as a whole respond as necessary.
Throughout this entire period of severe weather that England has
experienced, the Department did exactly that, including convening
daily, often twice-daily, teleconferences of officials, and the
Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:32:18"></hs_TimeCode> chaired

want to be clear about what the Government have done to help
communities to recover from these most recent floods. We have been
there in the aftermath: not only have we activated the Bellwin scheme
for emergency financial assistance, but on 17 January I announced a
further severe weather recovery support package that local authorities
can call on over and above Bellwin. We have continued to work with
local authorities in their transition from response to recovery, and
our officials have called the chief executive of every local authority
affected by the flooding so that we are clear about the local impacts.
We are already inviting every local authority leader from affected
communities, along with representatives from the voluntary sector, to
meet me to discuss any further support that may be necessary and to
look at the lessons learned exercise, which some Members have commented
on
today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:33:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000078"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tessa Munt" PimsId="5729" UID="140122104000199" xid="1176" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000199">Tessa
Munt:</Member></B> I wonder whether I might draw the Minister into
looking forward. I appreciate everything that has been done and
absolutely endorse to his comments about those who act in emergencies.
The reality, however, is that if the money paid by internal drainage
boards to the Environment Agency is given back to the IDBs, such as the
Axe Brue IDB in my area, along with some responsibility, then
contractors with expertise and knowledge of the local area can actually
carry out work to prevent flooding in future.</hs_Para>

to the way the Somerset levels and moors are managed, they are designed
to flood, which results in the entire area effectively still remaining
a response phase to the recent flooding—as I said, a major
incident has been declared today—and will remain so for some
weeks. I recognise, however, that the recent flooding in some villages
is worse than that seen in 2012. The full extent of the flooding may
not be realised until the levels and moors are fully pumped out. My
chief fire and rescue advisor has offered additional pumping capability
and the use of local fire and rescue services’ high-volume pumps
to support the local Environment Agency efforts in returning the levels
to a safer capacity for this time of year. They have further supported
Somerset county council by providing a fire boat and crew, to be used

them safely to obtain necessary supplies, and this will remain in

Irranca-Davies</B> (Ogmore) (Lab):</Member> It is a delight, Mr Turner,
to serve under your capable stewardship again this afternoon. I am
delighted to have secured this debate about an issue of direct concern
to not only my affected constituents but, as I have become aware,
several hundred other UK citizens. I am seeking justice for them. I
urge financial institutions such as Rothschild to come clean on their
involvement and to discharge their moral responsibility towards people,
many of whom are elderly and retired, who risk being left destitute.
That has happened primarily because they had good reason to believe
that Rothschild was the reputable and trusted brand behind a financial
product that now looks more and more like a property scam and
mis-selling. Will the Government and the Minister investigate the
matter fully to assess whether victims have been scammed and there is a
case for compensation? Will the Minister speak to Rothschild to make a
moral case about what the bank may end up defending in courts in Spain,
the UK and elsewhere on the flimsy pretext of, “Not me,
guv”?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000099">The
matter resembles nothing more or less than an equity release scam, and
it is not only Rothschild that is linked to it. Other banks, including
Scandinavian and British ones, lured pensioners into gambling away
their lifetime savings and homes on two enticing but ultimately flawed
pretexts: first, that by investing in a loan secured against a mortgage
on a property in Spain, they would obtain a small income additional to
their often limited pension in retirement; and, secondly, that by
registering a mortgage on that property, they could be helped in
eliminating inheritance taxes for their children. Imagine an elderly
couple who have worked hard all their lives, paid their taxes and
contributed to society and the community—a professional couple
who have planned for their retirement carefully, one of whom has
suffered significant health problems in later life. They have invested
all their wealth and savings in one retirement property in Spain. They
do not have other assets or sources of wealth, and they are offered an
enticing double bonus of releasing equity and gaining inheritance tax
advantages regarding their retirement property in
Spain<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T17:10:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000100">Such
an enticing offer perhaps sounds too good to be true, and it certainly
was for my constituents, a retired couple whose lives I have just
described in summary. When that offer is packaged and presented as
being backed by such an eminent and reputable a financial institution
as Rothschild, that is the icing on the cake. They might have thought
twice if they were dealing with some fly-by-night operator, but
Rothschild? Even someone unfamiliar with the financial world would
recognise that name and see it as conferring some prestige and status
on any product being
offered<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T17:11:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000101">Rothschild

who regarded themselves as your clients and not the clients of some

integrity and your values were used as a key selling point.” To
walk away from those hundreds of citizens and to deny not only
liability, but any assistance, and to force them through costly court
actions in Spain or elsewhere, is a stain on Rothschild’s
history<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T17:12:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The

I mentioned earlier, Rothschild is not alone in the firing line. Danske
Bank, Sydbank, Nykredit and others are not only in the firing line over
this, but in the dock, with some people in custody. A warrant was
issued in Spain by the general directorate of police and the Guardia
Civil in Madrid on 26 November for two Rothschild employees, Mark
Coutanche and Stephen Dewsnip, who are directors, to appear in court to
face criminal charges. The warrant relates to accusations that N. M.
Rothschild &amp; Sons sold mortgages to Spanish-based pensioners as a
tool, albeit a legal one, to defraud the Spanish tax office and
deliberately concealed crucial data that would prove that its equity
release product was impractical as an
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T17:14:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000104">Let
us look at the evidence for the case against Rothschild and others.
They completely, unarguably and incontrovertibly provided support,
training, the terms of business for intermediaries selling the
inappropriate products, supportive promotion through glossy brochures
and websites, and much more. For Rothschild to say that it was not
directly involved and that the product was sold through intermediaries,
which distances it from the situation, is akin to a parent saying to
their child, “It’s not my fault that the Christmas
presents are broken or cruddy, it’s Santa’s—sue
him!”, or to a retailer blaming its supply chain for worker
exploitation in Bangladesh when it is selling T-shirts for £2,
or for horse meat in its beef lasagne. It is not good
enough. We all know who should take
responsibility.</hs_Para>

Rothschild has those statistics is because a Rothschild product

Rothschild product, I am sure that after this debate Rothschild will be

Financial Secretary to the Treasury (Sajid Javid):</Member></B> I
welcome you to the Chair, Mr Turner. It is always a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship. I thank the hon. Member for Ogmore (Huw
Irranca-Davies) for making a powerful case on behalf of his
constituents. I assure him that I have listened very

will have constituents affected by these products who now face an
uncertain financial future instead of the comfortable retirement they
thought they had earned. As the hon. Gentleman said, the equity release
products in question were sold to some UK pensioners resident in Spain.
It seems that they were sold by independent financial advisers
operating in Spain who suggested that they release equity from their
houses and invest the loan in a fund, often claiming that that would
have inheritance tax benefits. The products were then provided by a
variety of banks, mainly based in Scandinavia, but including Rothschild
bank.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000138">With
the onset of the financial crisis, those investments did not perform,
so many of the investors breached the terms of the loan they were
given. That has left many expats in Spain, including those from the UK,
with significant financial losses. Some of the banks involved, many of
which were facing their own financial difficulties, have sought to
repossess the properties on which the loans were secured. That has left
some pensioners facing not only large losses, but the threat of
repossession, which is a stark contrast with the comfortable retirement
they had
planned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000139">Of
course, I am sympathetic to the difficulties that these people are
facing. Many of them have lost a great deal, but I am afraid that the
Government’s ability to act in this case is limited. The
products were not sold in the UK or by UK companies and the loans were
not secured against properties located in this country, so the UK
authorities do not have any jurisdiction over that activity.</hs_Para>

said will be frustrating for the individuals involved, but the same
rules allow our own regulators to protect our domestic consumers from
foreign banks operating here in the UK. I realise that some banks in
Europe were involved in providing the products sold by
independent financial advisers in Spain. The hon. Gentleman highlighted
Rothschild bank specifically. It has strong historic connections with
the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000141">I
have looked into the matter further, and I understand that Rothschild
sold around 130 of the products between 2005 and 2008. However, that
activity was carried out by its Guernsey-based entity and, as the hon.
Gentleman knows, the Channel Islands do not come under the jurisdiction
of the UK Government or UK regulators. The Guernsey regulator may have
some jurisdiction over the design and distribution of the product, but
that is not for the UK authorities to establish. I understand that some
of those who have lost out have taken the case up with the Spanish
authorities, and that may be an appropriate option for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T17:30:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122104000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/halltext/140122h0002.htm#140122104000142">I
am sorry to report that the UK Government have limited influence over
this case. I understand that Rothschild has provided affected customers
with some flexibility. For example, it is my understanding that it is
not repossessing the properties of those that have been affected. That,
of course, is welcome. As I said, the UK authorities do not have any
jurisdiction over this activity. However, I appreciate that Rothschild
has major operations in the UK, so I am happy to write to it to pass on
some of the concerns that the hon. Gentleman has raised. I will also
raise the matter with my counterparts in Spain and Guernsey to bring it
to their attention. I will be more than happy to meet the hon.

Gentleman may be interested to know that the UK ambassador to Spain
wrote to the Spanish regulator about this issue in 2012. Following that

registered with the Spanish financial regulator, known as the CNMV. The
publication explains that consumers unhappy with the product should
first complain to the company responsible and that, if they are still
dissatisfied, they can complain to the Spanish financial

concerns have been raised because there are a number of proposals
relating to solar farms within the local area, which have a combined
capacity, if considered collectively, that would meet the threshold
where the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change would
determine proposals under the regime for nationally significant
infrastructure (the Planning Act 2008). An application for a solar
energy development must be considered under the Planning Act 2008 where
the capacity of the proposed station would exceed 50
megawatts. However, at present, only one planning application has been
made and this does not exceed this
threshold.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14012294000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/petntext/140122p0001.htm#14012294000013">Under
the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, local planning authorities have
the statutory responsibility for considering planning applications for
renewable energy developments of 50 megawatts or less. Planning law
requires that applications for planning permission must be determined
in accordance with the statutory development plan for the area unless
material considerations indicate otherwise. These material
considerations include national planning policy. Local authorities will
also take into account relevant representations from the local
community on the planning merits of the
proposal.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14012294000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/petntext/140122p0001.htm#14012294000014">The
National Planning Policy Framework includes strong protections for the
natural environment and requires local councils to take into account
the economic and other benefits of the best and most versatile
agricultural land. The Framework is clear that local planning
authorities should design their policies to ensure that wherever they
are located, the adverse impact of renewable energy developments are
addressed satisfactorily. Planning applications for renewable energy
should only be approved if the impact is, or can be made, acceptable.
National policy statements form part of the overall framework of
national planning policy, and are a material consideration in decisions
on planning
applications.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14012294000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/petntext/140122p0001.htm#14012294000015">New
planning practice guidance was published in July to help ensure
planning decisions reflect the environmental balance in the Framework.
The guidance is very clear that the need for renewable energy does not
automatically override environmental protections and the planning
concerns of local communities. In relation to large scale solar farms,
the guidance sets out a number of factors a local planning
authority will need to consider, in particular,
encouraging the effective use of previously developed land, that it
allows for continued agricultural use and/or encourages biodiversity
improvements around arrays. In relation to heritage assets that
guidance clearly states that great care should be taken to ensure
heritage assets are conserved in a manner appropriate to their
significance, including the impact of the proposals on views important
to their
setting.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="189"><?date 2014-01-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_22_PT_1/70391A4FFA0362A27072FA0F402E6EBE37ACE3EB" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="22 January 2014">Wednesday

give farmers and food processors the opportunity to earn recognition.
As a result farmers who play by the rules are receiving fewer
inspections. For example, 740 members of the Environment Agency's Pig
and Poultry scheme are inspected once every three years rather than
annually and as of this month, our piloting of earned recognition in
egg marketing inspections will reduce routine inspection visits to

detailing the allocations for 2013-14 and indicative allocations for
2014-15. The 33 accelerated projects had already been allocated a
portion of DEFRA flood defence Grant-in-Aid and would have been
delivered in any case, but to a slower time scale. For this reason the
total figures in the table add up to more than £120
million. The additional funding provided in the 2012 autumn statement
means that these projects will be delivered more quickly than would
otherwise be the case allowing other projects to come into the
programme sooner in the
future.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="140122113000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/text/140122w0001.htm#140122113000189"><B><Member PimsId="3065" UID="140122113000547" xid="186" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/text/140122w0001.htm#140122113000547">Maria

species.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122113000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/text/140122w0001.htm#140122113000209">We

The service standards are: 95% of European economic area (EEA)
passengers with 25 minutes; and 95% non-EEA passengers within 45
minutes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>2</Sup> Sampling
methodology: Most ports and airports involved in the sampling aim to
take one queue measurement every hour during passenger arrival times,
where it is practical to do so (but see notes 3 and 4 below). A queue
is defined from when a passenger/vehicle joins a static body of
people/line of vehicles to when they arrive at the UK Border control
desk. To ensure consistency of approach ports are advised to used on of
two recommended methods—either a passenger or vehicle is picked
out as they join a queue and then visually traced (by an officer on
location or by CCTV) until they reach the border control desk or the
passenger will be handed a card with the time of joining queue noted
and they are asked hand the card to UKBA officer on the desk as soon as
they reach that point.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>3</Sup> At
some ferry ports, we measure the median queue length for cars and
coaches as the representative sample of immigration queue length. At
these locations, we measure the time taken for the first car and the
last car to clear the controls and divide this by 2 to calculate the
median queue length. This allows for a more accurate evaluation of the
queuing time that excludes the waiting on board ship for
disembarkation.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>4</Sup> A recent
audit of the methods used to measure waiting times found variations in
the approaches being used. As a result of the recommendations made,
work is under way to implement a more robust and consistent approach
across all ports on entry.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>5</Sup>
From 25 August 2012, queue measures were taken every 15 minutes at
Heathrow. This means that there has been an increase in the number of
passengers sampled.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><Sup>6</Sup> From
28 October 2012, queue measures were taken every 15 minutes at Gatwick.
This means that there has been an increase in the number of passengers

Vara:</Member></B> The Department does not have a pre-defined
evaluation model, however the MOJ develops tailored evaluation
methodologies for all its procurements with the aim of achieving the
best possible value for money for the taxpayer. The Public Procurement
Regulations provide that contracts can be awarded to the bidder
submitting either the ‘lowest priced’ or the ‘most
economically advantageous’ tender. The latter methodology would
include a range of non-price criteria whose selection would vary
depending on the objective of the procurement. To determine what
procedures are used would involve manually scrutinising all
procurements, as this information in not centrally collated; therefore
to provide this information, would be a disproportionate
cost.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="140122113000069" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/text/140122w0001.htm#140122113000069">Work

expected to perform their duties to the highest standard at all times.
Any failure in such standards is taken very seriously. 44 MDP officers
at Atomic Weapons Establishment (AWE) Burghfield are currently subject
to a police misconduct investigation which commenced in late 2013. This
investigation concerns allegations of officers failing to complete
their duties correctly. Seven officers have resigned during the course
of this investigation and a number of changes to practice were put in
place immediately. It would be inappropriate to comment further on an
ongoing misconduct investigation. MDP management standards at AWE
Burghfield are being reviewed as part of the investigation and any
actions considered appropriate will be taken forward as part of a
formal management action programme.</hs_Para>

Gauke:</Member></B> The Government takes the enforcement of national
minimum wage (NMW) very seriously. HMRC enforce the legislation on
behalf of the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills (BIS) and
has done so since the introduction of NMW in April 1999. It does that
by investigating all complaints made to the free and confidential Pay
and Work Rights Helpline about employers suspected of not paying the
minimum wage, and in addition carries out targeted enforcement where it
identifies a high risk of non-payment of the minimum wage to
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122115000686" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/text/140122w0002.htm#140122115000686">This
Government is cracking down on employers who break the law. Rogue
employers who do not pay their workers the minimum wage will face an
increased penalty of up to £20,000. The Prime Minister has
announced that his Government will increase the financial penalty
percentage from 50% to 100% of the unpaid wages owed to workers, and
that the maximum penalty will increase from £5,000 to
£20,000. Regulations introducing these new limits are subject to
parliamentary approval and are expected to be in force in February
2014. The Government will also bring in primary legislation as soon as
possible so that the maximum £20,000 penalty can apply to each
underpaid
worker.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122115000687" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/text/140122w0002.htm#140122115000687">This
Government has also made it simpler to name and shame employers who
break NMW law. The revised BIS NMW Naming and Shaming scheme came into
effect on 1 October 2013 and are part of Government efforts to toughen
up enforcement of the NMW and increase compliance. By naming and
shaming employers it is hoped that bad publicity will be an additional
deterrent to employers who would otherwise be tempted not to pay the
NMW. This is on top of the financial penalties which employers already
face if they fail to pay NMW. We anticipate that the first cases will
be made public very soon. HMRC works across Government in task forces
with other agencies, local authorities, UKBA, and the police with the
specific objective of maximising visibility and impact. Successful
targeted campaigns have been run across sectors such as high
street fashion, interns and social care. In addition 
<?notus-xml column=239?>Employment Agency staff have been seconded to HMRC specifically to
tackle NMW non-compliance by employment agencies and

Truss:</Member></B> Since May 2010 the Department for Education has
reduced the size of its estate from 30 properties under the previous
Government, at a cost of circa £51 million per annum, to just 12
properties costing circa £34 million per annum. This is a saving
of circa £17 million per annum. The Department plans to reduce
the size of the estate further, to just six properties. During 2014 the
Department will vacate Trust Court, realise additional sublet income to
offset rental costs of Earlsdon Park and transfer surplus space in
Piccadilly Gate to another Government Department. These activities will
achieve further savings to the Department of circa £600,000 per
annum. The Department also plans to vacate Sanctuary Buildings at lease
expiry in
2017.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140122115000947" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140122/text/140122w0003.htm#140122115000947">The

the process for appropriate identification, assessment, monitoring and

schools to improve the quality of teaching and learning for all pupils,
