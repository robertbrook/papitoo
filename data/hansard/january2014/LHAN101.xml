a digital future for radio, but we are clear that listeners’
needs are at the heart of the transitional process. We set three
benchmarks: listening via digital should be at 50%; national digital
coverage should be comparable with FM; and local digital coverage
should reach 90% of the population. Once these criteria have been
reached, the Government will be in a position to take decisions on a
potential future switchover and its

a positive momentum is maintained. Indeed, the Digital Radio Action

between what I would call the national network and the local digital

have agreed to put in £7 million each—£21 million
in all—to ensure that the local DAB network is extended so that
a further 200 sites will be in place by the time the programme is

Businesswise, it would be good to know when local radio coverage on DAB
will finally be rolled out across the whole country. In the mean time,
as we head into a truly digital era where any radio station in the
world can be heard on a mobile phone, surely historic and prescriptive
regulations—such as how much music versus speech a radio station
should contain—have become outdated. Therefore, as long as local
news is protected on local radio and taken into consideration in the
huge investment that media companies are putting into DAB, is it not
time that these outdated restrictions were reviewed and
removed?</hs_para>

certainly recognise that many of the more elderly members of the

radio, which is very popular, and if there were any consideration of
switchover we would consider reserving part of the FM spectrum so that
that local community radio could continue as long as was

we need to work on cars. At the moment only one in 10 of our
cars has digital, and it costs about £100 to convert them. This
is one of the reasons why there has been a reflection that this needs
to be consumer-led rather than what I would call Government-imposed. A
number of the points that were announced on 16 December are
precisely to encourage and help with the conversion. The Digital Radio

safeguarding the completeness of the register by using data matching to
ensure that the vast majority of existing electors are reregistered in
the 
<?notus-xml column=664?>transition to individual electoral registration. We
are phasing the transition over two years, with a carry-forward to
allow those not individually registered to vote in the 2015 election.
We are making registration more accessible by introducing online
registration and are providing additional resources at a national and

welcome all the measures that he has described and all the other
measures that the Government have taken to improve the levels of
registration. I also recognise his own personal commitment to that
goal. However, he must recognise that every independent authority has
warned that the approach that the Government are taking to changing the
method of registration carries risks to levels of registration among
particular groups of people—young people, people with
disabilities, ethnic minorities and people living in areas of extreme
deprivation. In the light of that, does he recognise that, in what is
likely to be a very tightly contested general election next year,
levels of registration could significantly skew its outcome? They are
likely to benefit one party alone: the Conservative Party. In the light
of that, will he give an assurance that he will monitor levels of
registration later this year and, if they have declined, will he make
more money available to local authorities to increase levels of
registration<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:17:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="14012297000838" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000838">Lord

just the tip of an iceberg of hidden suffering. Does the Minister
therefore agree that the current 45-day reflection period of support

vulnerable survivors excluded from support and unable to give testimony

potential victims of human trafficking identified through the national
referral mechanism are given a minimum of 45 days tailored support, and
this can be extended if the individual needs ongoing support due to the
level of trauma they have experienced. Specialist support works with
victims from day 1 to ensure that an appropriate reintegration strategy
is in place post those 45 days. The scope of the national referral
mechanism review, which is ongoing, will focus on identification of and
support for victims, and is currently being

My Lords, the Environment Agency and local authorities are in the
recovery phase regarding the recent flooding. This entails restoring
flood defences and working hard on preparations for the next flood
incident. We are reviewing procedures adopted by them and by government
departments to see where our response to flood warnings can be

have had a really tough time, among many others around our country. We
recognise the serious impact that the current flooding is having in
Somerset. The Environment Agency is working with local authorities and
communities in the county to help to mitigate the situation. We are

maintenance activities, including through a pilot scheme on the River
Brue in

communities; it has called customers in flooded areas to offer
assistance; it has deployed loss adjusters to visit affected areas as
quickly as possible to assess damage, begin the drying out of

Lordships are well aware that these are often highly controversial and
sensitive cases. Do we really want to encourage the Secretary of State
to address, after a conviction is quashed, whether she thinks that the
defendant was, in truth, innocent? Far from achieving clarity in the
law, this seems to be a recipe for complex, expensive and highly
acrimonious litigation. The problems that an innocence test would cause

other point. A difficulty with the Government’s approach is that
the European Court of Human Rights has stated in a number of recent
cases that applying a test of innocence would breach the European
Convention on Human Rights. For those noble Lords who are interested in
that, the Joint Committee’s Report, at paragraphs 61 to 64, sets
out the relevant passages in the Strasbourg judgments. I appreciate

that some cases will be on the other side of the line, in which
compensation will be payable, even though there may remain strong
suspicions that the claimant was in fact guilty, even though he has not
been convicted. However, we need a clear and workable definition that
is consistent with legal principle. I repeat: this is a difficult
problem, even though there are only between two and four successful
applications for compensation a year. It is therefore not the case that
a great deal of public money is at stake. For the reasons that I have

way, people who are acquitted of crime do not receive compensation for
being prosecuted. I make that point because of questions asked of me in
relation to this issue before the House. 
<?notus-xml column=673?>People are not compensated. As they leave court, if a judge has
dismissed the case or a jury have returned a verdict of not guilty,

dealing with are miscarriages of justice—situations in which
people are convicted and, at a later date, sometimes years later, their
conviction is quashed. Compensation is paid in some cases, but by no

for an appeal to be successful on a technicality. Our judges are no
pushover and they do not overturn convictions very readily. I say that

decided this issue comparatively recently and, in my view, it resolved
ambiguity by introducing, in the case of Adams, what we now call the
Phillips test. Compensation will be paid only if there is new evidence
that casts the case in a very different light. The new fact has to be
so significant that no conviction could now safely be based on the
evidence taken as a whole. The noble Lord, Lord Pannick, described it
well. There is now a consensus on it between the Supreme Court here in
the United Kingdom and the European Court of Human Rights. Sometimes we
seek to clarify issues in this House when there is some sort of
disagreement between those courts, but that is not the case

affront to our system of law—the common-law system, so beloved
of this House and indeed beloved of me. It flies in the face of one of
our key legal principles, which acknowledges that it is very difficult
for people to prove their innocence. It is very difficult for people to
prove that they are innocent beyond reasonable doubt: “Prove
that you didn’t do it”; “Prove that you
didn’t kill your baby”; “Prove that you
didn’t leave a bomb in the pub”; “Prove that you
didn’t set that fire”. In a few cases, DNA can prove
innocence, and in a few an alibi can be bullet-proof, but I assure your

suicide while she was in prison. It was a tragedy. New forensic
evidence threw the whole case. In that instance, the wonderful
television series that existed then, “Rough Justice”, had
done the hard graft of revisiting the case, finding that the fire could

is no wonder that Sally Clark, who had been a practising solicitor, did
not live long after her convictions were quashed. Again, vital evidence

previous occasion when we discussed these matters the name of Sir Roy
Meadow was mentioned, as though the statistical evidence was the thing
that caused the overturning of that conviction. It was not. It was
about the discovery of a slide showing that there was infection on the
lung of one of those babies and it was felt that knowing more about
infant lungs meant that that baby may well have died of natural causes.
One of the problems we discovered in holding that inquiry was the
shortage of child and infant pathologists—pathologists who were
used to dealing with babies, as distinct from adults. Usually forensic
pathologists had experience in dealing with adults who died rather than
infants, so the expertise was not being
applied<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T15:56:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000085">Cases
go wrong, which is why there is a folly in slashing legal aid which
allows really experienced counsel to conduct the hardest cases. When a
case has gone wrong and new material comes to light which changes the
whole complexion of the case, and it becomes clear that a jury in
possession of all the evidence would have reached a different verdict,
those who have suffered should have some compensation. To expect them
to prove that they were innocent beyond reasonable doubt is to add to
the injustice they have already suffered. Miscarriages of justice lead
to ruined lives. Families are destroyed. People often end up without
partners when they come out of prison. They lose jobs and homes. The
mental despair and anguish is never fully resolved. That is why they
need to have such real help afterwards. People’s lives never go
back to how they were. This is where we find, as a decent society, that
we have to make amends.</hs_para>

there is a situation that could be clarified, which is what Amendment
94E seeks to do. The more serious the crime for which a person is
wrongfully convicted, the longer the sentence that will be imposed,
and, particularly where they continue to protest their innocence, the
longer they will be imprisoned. Where the conviction is wrongful, the
impact on their subsequent life, even if the conviction is subsequently
quashed, will be enormous.</hs_para>

a woman grieving for the terrible loss of her baby will be massive. She
will lose her family life, her place in society, her social life, her
education, her employment, and quite possibly her marriage and her

those where a conviction is secured by fabricated evidence or evidence

confession evidence had been secured through serious threats and other
misconduct. He had lost his youth and his opportunity to gain an
education and build a career, and he was terribly traumatised. When he
was finally released, he had to start to build a new life—not
easy in such circumstances. He was finally compensated, but money can

receive roughly the same amount as they would have missed out on in

would impoverish these wronged individuals and that, surely, cannot be
right. Amendment 94E, which I am glad to support, would instead

the face of it, this is no more than a rule of criminal procedure that
has long been part of our law: the burden of proving guilt is on the
prosecution. Indeed, the Strasbourg jurisprudence recognises that the
primary effect of Article 6.2 is to impose this procedural rule. But
the Strasbourg court has identified what it has described as “a
second aspect” of Article 6.2, which applies to
protect individuals after they have been acquitted in a criminal trial.
Shortly summarised, the second aspect prohibits public officials and
authorities, including courts, from suggesting that a person who has
been acquitted of a criminal charge is, or may be, guilty none the
less.</hs_parafo><hs_time UID="14012297000328" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000328"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.15

second aspect of the presumption of innocence is not one whose

that I may be forgiven if I attempt to summarise the relevant
conclusions of the Grand Chamber very shortly and with a degree of
simplification. When considering a claim for compensation under Section
133 of Criminal Justice Act 1988 by an applicant whose conviction has
been quashed on the ground of fresh evidence, the Secretary of State or
a court reviewing her decision must not use language that suggests that
the applicant was, or may have been, guilty of the offence charged. So
to suggest will infringe the second aspect of the presumption of
innocence in Article 6.2. If, however, the Secretary of State or the
court reaches a decision in language that does not suggest that the
applicant was, or may have been, guilty of the offence in question,
there will be no violation of the presumption of innocence.</hs_para>

the subsequent case of Adams, the fourth section of the Strasbourg
court held that the application of the test of presumption of innocence
approved by the majority of the Supreme Court, which is that
for which this amendment provides, had not involved a
violation of the presumption of innocence. This was because the
Secretary of State and the Supreme Court had been able in Adams to
apply that test without giving any consideration to the question of
whether the applicant was guilty or
innocent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000114">Will
the same be true if the applicant for compensation has to prove that
the fresh evidence demonstrates beyond reasonable doubt that he or she
was innocent of the offence charged? I doubt it very much. It is true
that the test focuses on the cogency of the fresh evidence. Strictly,
the Secretary of State could consider whether the fresh evidence was so
cogent as to demonstrate innocence beyond reasonable doubt without
casting aspersions on the innocence of the applicant, but this will not
be easy in practice and I doubt whether the Strasbourg court will
accept the sophistry that such a distinction involves. For these
reasons, I suggest that the first ground for preferring the amendment
is made out: it is Strasbourg
approved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000115">However,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:17:07"></hs_TimeCode> would find it
regrettable if this were the only reason for preferring this amendment,
for I confess to finding this area of Strasbourg jurisprudence not
wholly satisfactory. It focuses on form and not on substance. In
substance, whatever interpretation is given to miscarriage of justice,
something more than quashing a conviction is properly required, as the
Strasbourg court has accepted, before a miscarriage of justice can be
demonstrated to have occurred. This is because the quashing of a
conviction does not necessarily establish innocence. That is what has
given rise to the present
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000116">So I
come to the second reason for preferring this amendment. I suggest, as
I did in Adams, that Section 133, and Article 14.6 of the
international covenant to which it gives effect, has two implicit
objectives. The primary objective is that an applicant who has been
convicted when he was in fact innocent should be compensated for the
consequences of the wrongful conviction. The second, and subsidiary,
objective is that an applicant whose conviction has been quashed but
who in fact committed the offence charged should not be compensated. No
test will achieve both these objects in every case, but to require an
applicant who has succeeded by fresh evidence in demolishing the case
upon which he was convicted to go further and prove his innocence
beyond reasonable doubt is surely to stack the cards too heavily
against him. This amendment strikes the right balance and it is for
that reason that I support

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, as your
Lordships already know, I was one of the minority of four to five in
the Supreme Court in Adams in 2011, and I support the Government in
their efforts here to give effect to our minority judgment. I recognise
that in the light of the speeches in the House this afternoon I am now
one of an endangered species. However, the truth is that four of us
reached a clear view on this, including the then Lord Chief Justice,
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Judge, who unhappily cannot be in this
place today. As the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, said, this is a difficult
issue and I do not suggest that the majority reached an absurd or
impossible view. I suggest that it was wrong but, right or wrong, that
is not now the question. The question is: what does the House think is
the appropriate approach to the question of compensation for
miscarriage of justice?</hs_para>

in mind that in the course of this debate we are talking not about
criminal justice or the presumption of innocence, or about whether
people who cannot at the end of the day be shown beyond all reasonable
doubt to be guilty should go free. Of course they should and the noble
Lord, Lord Cormack, is right to say that it is better that 10 guilty
men go free than that one innocent man be imprisoned. All that goes
without saying but we are concerned here with monetary compensation.
The obligation under Section 133 of the Criminal Justice
Act, and under the international convention to which that gives effect,
is to compensate only in a very limited and narrowly circumscribed
group of cases. It is not all those who, having been imprisoned, are
ultimately set free and presumed innocent; far from it.</hs_para>

is not paid and even under the amendment proposed by the noble Lord,
Lord Pannick, would still not be paid, for example, to those who have
been in custody, perhaps for a very long time while awaiting trial or
during a trial, and are then acquitted. Nor is it paid to those who are
freed only when an appeal, perhaps many months later even though it was
brought in time, comes to be allowed. Nor is it paid to those whose
appeal comes to be allowed not because of newly discovered facts but
rather, for example, because of some serious misdirection by the judge
at trial or because the judge wrongly admitted evidence, even if they
have been incarcerated for many years. Very importantly, nor is it
paid—and it is apparent to me that not all your Lordships fully
understand this—in cases where an appeal, possibly after many
years, comes to be allowed because the newly discovered
facts have created a doubt as to whether the original jury, with these
fresh facts in mind, would still have convicted the accused. I know
that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, clearly recognises that but certain
things said suggest that others do not.</hs_para>

Human Rights, in its recent second report, published just a fortnight
back, suggests in paragraph 73 that under the test of the noble Lord,
Lord Pannick, compensation would have been granted in Sally
Clark’s case. That is the tragic case, as I wholly accept, about
which the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, spoke so
passionately both today and at Second Reading. Having now read the
detailed judgment in that case, and indeed the commentary on it in the
other case of Meadow, it seems to be entirely plain that
compensation would not—I repeat, not—have been paid to
Sally Clark under the test of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick.
Notwithstanding the doubts about the value of Professor Meadow’s
evidence that emerged quite early in that case, Sally
Clark’s first appeal was rejected by the Court of Appeal on the
basis that the evidence against her remained overwhelming. There then
came to light further fresh evidence—again, as referred to today
by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy—regarding certain biological
tests on one of the two children. That, said the second Court of
Appeal, could—I repeat, could—have affected the
jury’s verdict. It did not say that no jury could possibly have
convicted in the light of it. With the best will in the world, I
suggest that that would not have led to compensation in her
case.</hs_para>

noble and learned Lord. Perhaps reading a commentary or returning to
published facts about the case and reading a shorthand account of it
will not give one the proper understanding of what the evidence was
that allowed Sally Clark’s appeal. I chaired an inquiry in which
that evidence was placed before us. Medical evidence—slides
showing the state of an infant’s 
<?notus-xml column=685?>lung condition—was never disclosed, and it
was never explained why that was never disclosed at the time
of trial. There was no doubt that it put a completely

European Convention on Human Rights, which has already been

innocence. Not one of the nine of us in Adams in the Supreme Court
thought that Article 6.2 had anything of value to say to the case.

compensation claim, the Secretary of State cannot say, “I think
you are guilty after all”, but he can say, “You
haven’t suffered a miscarriage of justice such as qualifies you

quashed, you were set free and you are to be presumed innocent, but to
qualify for compensation you have to establish more”. That
indeed is also the position under the test of the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick. The underlying test of a refusal of compensation,
even under his formulation, is that you cannot show that the jury would
have acquitted you, they might still have found you guilty and indeed
the evidence would have justified a conviction. That is the underlying
rationale on which you still refuse those eventually
acquitted under the test of the noble Lord, Lord Pannick.

interveners in the case—argued for the approach now suggested
and, indeed, that the majority of five reached as a sort of halfway
house, as they felt, in Adams. It was indeed recognised by the Bar that
there was no principled difference between this approach and the
approach of compensating all who eventually succeed on their late

truly innocent. One of the plain troubles with the proposed amendment

are indeed undeserving will be compensated often to the tune of very
substantial sums, hundreds of thousands of pounds it can be. I gave
instances of this at earlier stages of the Bill and I do not propose to
repeat them now. The fact is that there are cases which eventually

Elton (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall begin with an explanation.
I served for three years in the Home Office at the time when Lord
Denning and others were at the height of their powers, and I have had a
very happy hour listening to what is going on. It was very reminiscent
of the past. My sympathy with my noble friend on the Front Bench
deepened steadily throughout, but was slightly reduced during the
intervention of the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Brown.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000145">I ask
my noble friend simply this. First, when he comes to reply, will he
confirm what has been asserted, that if the information described in
the amendment had been available before the case was brought, the case
would not have come to court? Secondly, is there any other
circumstance, except that which has just been discussed, in which a
British citizen is required to prove their innocence in the criminal
law? Finally, am I not right in thinking that if my first question is
answered with a yes—in other words, the case would not have been
brought—surely at least the second leg of the intervention by
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, would fall because no jury
would have had to give an
opinion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:45:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Brennan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, from 2001, I served for 10 years
as the assessor for miscarriages of justice—that is, as the
assessor of compensation. I agree with the amendment proposed for all
the intellectual and legal reasons advanced, but also for a series of
practical reasons. Having given awards in various cases, such as that
of Sally Clark and so on, I was required to read all the materials
which founded the application. So although I awarded compensation by
way of decision, by way of analysis I covered eligibility. This part of
the Bill is directed at the test for eligibility, not for compensation,
so it is a test that the Minister has to determine, not the legal
assessor.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012297000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000147">My
concerns, for practical reasons, about the text of Clause 161 are as
follows. First, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead,
has pointed out, our criminal system is not in any way directed at
establishing innocence; it is directed at proving a prosecution case
or, for the defence, at seeking to undermine it. Therefore, it is
unlikely that during a criminal trial the investigation will reveal a
clear case of innocence for the defendant. It could happen, but it is
unlikely. The appeal process thereafter in the Court of Appeal Criminal
Division is directed at whether the verdict could be sustained: was it
reasonable, safe and so on. That again is directed at the strength of
the prosecution case, not at any question of proof of innocence. At the
end of the criminal appeal, the process is over. It is only
if a campaigning lawyer, NGO or the Criminal Cases Review Commission
digs up new evidence that this phrase, “a new fact or a newly
discovered fact”, is likely to come into play, which
could be years after the original event and may not always be a matter
of science. DNA may conclusively change things or a group of 10 or 12
citizens may prove an alibi where the defendant did not know
that they could prove it for him or something like that, but that is
very rare. Most cases are decided on what the jury think of
witnesses’ behaviour and credibility, not science. So I ask the
question: in relation to a new fact or a newly discovered fact that is
not a matter of science or a compelling factual exposition of what did
or did not happen, how will the Secretary of State or the junior
Minister have any material on which to determine that there is no
reasonable doubt whether there was a innocent man or woman? It is
simply impractical. Not only is it impractical, it is unjust, because
the person who has been in jail for years will have no means of seeking
to advance a case absent the help of third parties. It is therefore
impractical to put this clause into a system of justice for victims of
miscarriages of
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:50:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerned about the variety of cases that come up. Even though the
proceedings are private, it is public that I have the task of deciding
the compensation—symbolic—to be given to the relatives of
Derek Bentley. “Let him have it” was the key phrase on
which the case was determined. That case came back to the Court of
Appeal 50 years later, which overturned the conviction because of the
conduct of the trial judge, particularly in the summing up.</hs_para>

us suppose that Derek Bentley’s case, or that sort of case, had
happened in recent times and, instead of being executed, he had spent
years in jail. The judge dies, the campaigning group get together and
challenge the conviction on the basis of the
summing up and the 
<?notus-xml column=688?>conduct of the trial, and it succeeds. The evidence
is “Let him have it, Chris”. How on earth could any
Secretary of State come to any conclusions about innocence under this
test? You simply could

acquittals, the arms to Iraq affair was uncovered by the revelation of
misconduct by government officials. How could a Secretary of State

perhaps in another department? It does not sound at all
right<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:52:24"></hs_TimeCode>. Failure
to disclose by the police or relevant state authorities, a major reason
for miscarriages of justice, could not possibly usually involve this
point about proving innocence, yet it provides the basis for a genuine
miscarriage of

is given with anonymity to test the propositions of each side. A
complainant says that she was violently assaulted and raped. The
defendant, a man of good character, goes before the jury and says that
she consented: “I never use violence”. He is convicted
and receives a number of years’ imprisonment. It is then
discovered that the victim had made similar allegations on several
previous occasions in different parts of the country against different
young men, about which his defence team did not know and which would
clearly have been relevant to his defence. It might even have resulted
in there being no prosecution. Yes, this is not a safe case to convict,
but I ask: how could any one of us say, beyond reasonable doubt, that
he must be innocent? You simply could not do that. Yet not to
compensate him after years in prison would be an outrage with a history

Cullen of Whitekirk (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall say something
briefly about the reasons put forward by the Government in
the past for the amendment to the law which is sought to be effected by
Clause 161. In fact, as far as I can see, they have put
forward two different explanations for this change in the law.
The first is that there is said to be a doubt as to how
the category of cases recognised in Adams should be
formulated. I mention that in case the point is renewed again today. In
his letter to the chairman of the Constitution Committee of this House,
dated 11 November 2013, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of
Holbeach, said that there was a doubt created by the later decision of
the Divisional Court in the case of Ali in explaining the effect of
Adams. However, the formulation adopted by the court in Ali was rightly
criticised at the Committee stage of this Bill. In any event, if there
were a doubt as to how the category should be formulated, it is odd, if
not extravagant, to deal with that doubt by getting rid of the category
altogether, which is the effect of this proposed amendment to the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:55:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000154">The
second explanation, to which all the speeches today have been directed,
is to do with whether one course or the other should be taken, with the
Government preferring the narrow approach. As the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, said in
Committee:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14012297000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000262">“We

doubt, Parliament can overrule a decision of the Supreme Court, but the

Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the whole House, and perhaps more
importantly, our whole system of justice, is deeply indebted to the
leading lawyers who have addressed us today, noble and learned Lords
who have served in the highest judicial offices and others who have
practised the law in the areas that we are concerned about. We are
equally indebted to the one non-lawyer who has spoken in this debate,
the noble Lord, Lord Cormack. The humanity and power of the case that
he has put has informed the debate in a slightly different way, and one
that I very much
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:57:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000156">The
rationale for the Government’s proposals on compensation for
those who have suffered miscarriages of justice is set out in the

that contained in the
Bill—</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012297000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000313">“is

assertion rests on two flawed premises. The first relates to the term
“unmeritorious claims”, since the effect of
the Bill would be to, and is clearly intended to, render claims
unmeritorious by virtue of failing the very test that the Bill
imposes—that is to say what may now be justiciable ceases to be
so because of the new requirement to prove innocence beyond reasonable
doubt. Thus we have, in effect, a circular
justification.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0001.htm#14012297000158">The
second defect lies in the bland assertion that the test supplies
greater clarity. But as I, and others more learned than I could claim
to be, pointed out in earlier debates on this issue, the law is clear.
It was established by the Supreme Court in the Adams case, albeit by a
narrow majority, and encapsulated in the judgment of the noble and
learned Lord, Lord
Phillips<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T16:58:43"></hs_TimeCode>,
reflected exactly in the wording of this amendment. The Supreme Court
is not conducted on the model of Lincoln’s cabinet, in which it
may be recalled that a proposition which was opposed by every member
save the President passed only on the latter declaring “the Ayes
have it”. The decision was a decision of the Supreme
Court. The Supreme Court has clarified the

Those words were echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Brennan, whose
experience, I respectfully suggest, is particularly relevant to the
deliberations of today and to the outcome of this debate. It is true
that the Ali case offered a somewhat different form of
words, which I found seductive enough to adopt in the
amendment I moved in Committee, but, of course, the formulation of the
Supreme Court takes precedence. Having, as I said I
would, given further consideration to the matter,

the committee stressed that the language used when declining an
application for compensation under the new test did not meet its
concern about the presumption of innocence. Moreover, it rejected the
Government’s argument that in the recent case of K v United
Kingdom the ECHR accepted that the clear innocence test was compatible
with Article 6(2), and concluded that the Government’s argument
that there was no incompatibility between that provision and Clause
161, which we are debating, was not supported. The score on these
matters is effectively, therefore, Joint Committee on Human Rights 3,
Ministry of Justice 0, and that led to the ultimate

addition, however, to the legal principles involved and the violence

principles of our jurisprudence, we need to consider the practical
implications of their policy. To adopt a phrase which, coming from me,
might be thought to be singularly appropriate, they are vanishingly
small. The Government’s assessment of the financial savings
amounts, as we have heard, to all of £100,000—a mere flea
bite compared with the amounts, for example, they are seeking to
recover from their favoured contractors, Serco and G4S, for their
glaring contractual failures. The number of successful cases is equally
tiny—just four cases since the abolition of the ex-gratia

by the Divisional Court in Ali, it is still open to
a range of interpretations. This

this context, the European Court of Human Rights appears to be somewhat
more concerned with form than substance. It is not for the Secretary of

which a conviction is overturned shows that the applicant is
innocent beyond reasonable doubt, they should be, and will be,

the Government remain firmly of the view that the provision in Clause
161 is compatible with the presumption of innocence in Article 6(2) of

thinking on this in our response to the most recent JCHR report, which
we sent to the committee last week. In short, it does not follow that
simply having “innocence” as the touchstone for

Of course, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Brown, said, a number of
defendants have their convictions overturned on appeal in
time—this is out of time—who may have spent considerable
periods in custody, unjustifiably as it turns out. This is a narrow
area. The question of the presumption of innocence goes to whether or
not they are guilty of an offence, but this, which I hope answers the
noble Baroness’s question, is entirely concerned with
eligibility for compensation—a different matter altogether. We,
the Government, consider that the amendment—this is not in quite

It was introduced in England and Wales by Section 47 of the Criminal
Justice Act 1925, which abolished the previously existing presumption
that a wife who committed any offence except treason or murder in the
presence of her husband did so under his coercion and that she should
therefore be acquitted. For these historical reasons, the defence

that time moves on, but Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, the great 19th
century authority on criminal law, described this area of the law as
“irrational”. In 1922, the Avory committee recommended
abolition of any special rule for wives and so did the Law Commission
in its 1977 report. Therefore, it could not sensibly be suggested that

an issue perhaps needs to be addressed. We have now abandoned, rightly,
the law of marital coercion, but there is a question about the
operation of the law of duress. That of course applies only in limited
cases where extreme violence or even death are threatened by one person
against another; if that other then conforms with instructions given
under such a threat, there may be a defence. Those would be very
extreme circumstances, but there is some concern about the position
of—usually but not necessarily exclusively—women in a
situation of, for example, domestic violence and abuse of that kind.
They might be prevailed upon to commit or assist in committing an
offence by a threat obviously much less severe than 
<?notus-xml column=700?>is required by the law of duress. I wonder whether the Government might
look at that, or invite the Law Commission to do so, to see whether
there is a case for providing a safeguard for those who may be

addition to or perhaps separately from that, perhaps some consideration
might be given to those who have responsibility for deciding whether to
charge or to proceed with the prosecution—or, following a

duress it is nevertheless apparent that pressure and threats of
violence or worse have been brought to bear upon the weaker party in
that situation. They might not be parties living together; one can
envisage other circumstances. Perhaps that matter might be looked at.

reiterate what my noble friend just said about the position of women in
the circumstance of domestic violence, where the abuse can often mean
that they are fearful of not participating in looking after stolen
goods or whatever. I have several times recently acted for women who
have failed to inform on their husbands in situations of terrorism.
Your Lordships will remember that we introduced new law which made it a
duty to inform if you are conscious of people plotting or
planning acts of terrorism. A number of wives have been
prosecuted for that. I have to say that juries do not like it. They
often realise, particularly in the circumstances of very powerful
personalities in the form of the menfolk and where women
have little power, as in some minority communities from which terrorism
has recently been emanating, that there has to be understanding of ways
in which women are prevailed on and are in terror of going to the
authorities. I hope that making this change does not in some way
militate against the raising of domestic violence as a background to an
understanding of women’s roles when it comes to allegations in

higher threshold—harassment, alarm and

appreciate that there were teething problems with ASBOs initially and
that there is always room for improvement. But after around 15 years,
the various agencies involved know and understand how to use
anti-social behaviour orders and could, I think, best advise on any
improvements to be made. Thirdly, there is the seriousness of the issue

Government have been clear that, in developing our reforms, the police,
local councils, social landlords and others must focus their response
to anti-social behaviour on the needs of victims and put them first. As
part of our consultation on the new powers, we asked victims
what they want. They told us three things: first, they want
their problem to be taken seriously; secondly, they want an efficient
service and quick response; and, thirdly, they want the problem to stop
and for it not to happen again. That is what this Government
also want. That is why we want to support agencies by giving
them effective new powers to do this. However, ensuring that the right
powers are available also means removing or reforming the existing
powers where we know that they do not work as well they should,
particularly the anti-social behaviour

professionals have recognised the ASBO’s failings, and this is
demonstrated by the most recently published statistics from the
Ministry of Justice. Since 2005 there have been year-on-year falls in
the number of ASBOs issued, with 1,329 issued in 2012, a decrease of 6%
from the 1,414 issued in 2011 and a decrease of 68% since 2005. That is

worth repeating: up to the end of 2012, 58% of ASBOs were

If an ASBO is breached, on average it is breached five times. Perhaps
even more shocking are the figures relating to young people. As I also
informed the House in Committee, the breach rate for under-18s is a
staggeringly high 69%. To put it another way, over two-thirds of ASBOs
against young people are breached. Those are the statistics. Those are
the facts. They are certainly not teething issues, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Smith, suggested; the ASBO is a fundamentally flawed

abject failure for under-18s who, for whatever reason, have taken the
wrong path in their lives. ASBOs have unduly focused on enforcement,
criminalising young people with insufficient emphasis on helping young
people subject to ASBOs to deal with the reasons for their anti-social
behaviour and turn over a new leaf. That is why this Government want to
see the back of ASBOs and give the police, local councils, social
landlords and others more effective powers to enhance their ability to
tackle anti-social behaviour and protect the

is that ASBOs are an all too visible reminder of a broken system which
the new powers are designed to fix. As I said in Committee and indeed
in our deliberations earlier on Report, the injunction under Part 1 and
the criminal behaviour order provided for in Part 2 form major planks
of our reforms to give front-line professionals the swift and more
effective powers they need to protect victims and communities. The
injunction will enable agencies to act more quickly, with its lower
civil standard of proof, and will not overly concentrate on enforcing
prohibitions or criminalise those who breach it—unlike the ASBO.
However, the criminal behaviour order will be available for more
serious cases, where there is a criminal conviction. In these cases, it
is right for tougher sanctions to be available on breach and, as with
the ASBO, breach will be a criminal offence. However, both powers can
include positive requirements to help individuals to address the root
cause of their anti-social behaviour and help them turn their lives
around<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:02:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

positive requirements will be especially important for those young
people who have been failed by ASBOs. That is why 58% of respondents to
our consultation on the new powers in the Bill welcomed positive
requirements. The noble Baroness, Lady Smith, expressed concerns about
funding positive requirements. However, the majority who responded to
the consultation agreed that this was not a reason not to have them, as
they recognised the potential benefits of reducing reoffending and the
substantially reduced downstream costs of doing so. Front-line
professionals are aware of the positive requirements and will make use
of them where there is scope to do so. As we know, local councils and 
<?notus-xml column=705?>other agencies already have a have a good track
record of providing services to individuals to turn their lives around
and we rightly expect that support and services will be continued under
our reforms.</hs_para>

Ford (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to have secured
this debate this evening. I should immediately remind the House of the
housing interests that I have declared on the register. I am a director
of Taylor Wimpey plc, the housebuilder, and Grainger, the residential
landlord, and, as the House probably knows, I have previous form as
chairman of English Partnerships, the predecessor agency to the HCA,
and most recently of the Olympic Park Legacy Company.</hs_para>

fundamentally important to us as individuals and as a society, and once
again the issues of the supply and, critically, affordability of
housing have found their way to the top of the political agenda. We
hear frequently that we live on a crowded island, and standing on the
District line today, I could certainly relate to that, but I also use
domestic flights frequently and as I look out occasionally, I am struck
by how little of our country is developed. In fact, only 12% of the UK
is developed but, as we all know, this 12% is very highly concentrated
around our great cities and suburban areas, and it continues to be
where demand lies for more housing, creating more and more pressure on
land, transport and public services.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012297000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#14012297000222">The fact is that we
cannot separate successful economic areas from demand for housing and
vice versa, which is why the intervention from Sir David Higgins,
chairman of HS2, last week was particularly interesting. His hypothesis
is that HS2 would start to move the economic centre of gravity away
from London and attract high-value businesses out of the capital. He
suggests that, among other things, this would begin to stabilise house
prices in London. That remains to be seen but it starts a debate that
is well worth having and intelligently makes the important link between
housing and transport infrastructure. He is attempting to think
long-term, which is how we must think if we are to make the
breakthrough we need to increase the supply of affordable
homes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#14012297000223">Housebuilding
is highly cyclical in nature and very sensitive to changes in the
banking environment and the mortgage market, so we have fallen into
developing housing policy that mirrors that cycle and is often reactive
and short-term. We react to today’s problem. Many very worthy
policy initiatives have been undertaken over the past 20 years but, of
themselves, have not led to the breakthrough in affordability and
overall supply that I think we all recognise is
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000224" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#14012297000224">We
do not need to look any further than Kate Barker’s excellent
2004 analysis to understand the scale of the problem. All of the issues
that Kate set out still remain. The link between house prices and
earnings has deteriorated still further in the past 10 years, and not
enough affordable homes are being completed. Yet we know how to solve
this because we have done it 
<?notus-xml column=708?>before. Housing completions in 2012 totalled 143,500. In 1968,
completions totalled almost 430,000. In the peak year in the previous
century for housebuilding, 1968, we delivered three times as many
houses as we did in
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#14012297000225">More
than half of those completions were from the private sector. The
remainder came from councils and development corporations as well as an
increasing contribution from housing associations, but this was not an
accident. The consistently large supply of homes post-war and until
1968 was a direct result of the largest and most systematic ever
release of development land that our country has ever seen. That land
release continued to supply up to 200,000 homes a year until as
recently as 1990. I am talking about the new towns programme that began
with the designation of Stevenage in 1946. The housing statistics over
that period show the affordable homes that were built by the new town
development corporations but, critically, many of the private
completions were also built on new town land due to deliberate policy
rightly to create mixed and sustainable communities, so we accomplished
scale across all
tenures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012297000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#14012297000226">It is
self-evident to me that the key to increasing supply is systematic,
planned release of land. If we are serious about tackling supply,
variety of tenure and affordability, we need to revisit the approach
that served us so well from the immediate post-war period right up
until 1990, when the programme begun in 1946 naturally
started to come to an end. If you strip out the new town programme,
private completions have always, and steadily, delivered about 130,000
houses a year if you smooth it over the cycle. It is therefore clear
from the experience of the past 30 years that the
incremental amount of homes that we can add to current stock through
what I would call the normal planning regime is around 160,000 a year;
this is taking private housebuilders and housings associations
together. That adds less than 1% to the existing stock each year, which
is plainly not dealing with the issue of supply and affordability, as
Kate Barker pointed out a decade ago and we all see, day in, day
out<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:10:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

proposed that we needed to build 250,000 homes a year, there was
immediate opposition to this figure, notwithstanding that we had easily
accomplished this almost every year—in fact, for 27 out of the
30 years between 1950 and 1980. However, 10 years after her seminal
review, no political consensus has emerged on the way forward, which is
a pity as it seems to me that the only way to deal thoroughly with this
issue is through long-term planning and a cross-party
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

seems to be recognition of that in recent months. Whether it is the
Government’s suggestion of garden cities or the Labour
Party’s announcement of a new generation of new towns, it feels
as though there is a clearer understanding that if we are to do more
than add incrementally to our housing stock and really tackle the
issues of price and variety of tenure, we need to significantly release
land for planned, thoughtful
development<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:11:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to do that. The development of the English new towns was not always
perfect—we know that—but we learnt as we went along and
the 
<?notus-xml column=709?>template has subsequently been copied in many other
countries. They were also phenomenally successful in terms of public
finance. I would point anyone who says that government cannot afford to
make the direct investment in high-quality new communities to the
return that the Treasury has enjoyed over decades from continual land
sales in the new towns; as the last ever chairman of the Commission for
the New Towns, I have direct experience of this.</hs_para>

few development corporations in the past 20 years, and I had the
pleasure of chairing one of them. The Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park is
being developed by a mayoral development corporation, but one that
recognises that there are existing communities around it and embraces
those communities through its planning system and membership of its
governing body. It is a modern corporation that accepts the
challenges and opportunities that development in an established
community naturally brings. We are all realists. We understand that
there will be challenges in building new communities, but
the Queen Elizabeth Park is a great exemplar and is being
immensely successful. Planning consent is in place for almost 10,000
new homes around the park. By the end of this year, only two years
after the Games, nearly 3,000 new homes will be occupied—not
just starting to be built, but occupied—in the park. The next
phase of building, of more than 800 homes, begins in June, and the next
two phases are already out to the market, adding a further 1,500 homes.
This demonstrates what you can do when you have a planned,
thoughtful, systematic release and, critically, you have the community
with you.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012297000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#14012297000231">I
have become increasingly convinced that this is how we do it. Whether
it is on brownfield land, surplus public land or on
greenfield sites, the principles are the same. If we want to convince
communities to embrace development, it needs to be of the very highest
quality. It needs to be sustainable and affordable. It needs to offer
real community benefits and not burden already creaking infrastructure
or public services. Experience has shown us that the very best way to
do that is through larger-scale, long-term, thoughtful development,

tonight whether the Government have any intention of adopting this
approach, taking a long-term view and committing the finance to

Horam (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, we are all very grateful to the
noble Baroness, Lady Ford, for introducing this debate on what is
clearly a very important public subject. I am by no means an expert on
housing, but I have a long-standing interest to the extent that, in the
1970s, I was the first chairman of the Circle 33 housing association,
which is now part of Circle Anglia. I remember the noble Lord, Lord
Best, from those
days<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:14:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000002">I
strongly support what the Minister and her colleagues are doing in
government, first in her own department, the Department for Communities
and Local Government, where Nick Boles, for example, is doing a great
deal to remove some of the distressingly difficult obstacles in
the planning area and where my right honourable 
<?notus-xml column=710?>friend Eric Pickles has been talking about new
towns, which I think are part of the solution. The Chancellor, in his
help to buy measures, has got building going again. There is no doubt
that it is on the up, from all that I hear from around the country,
both in London and in the regions. All that is very good and I
congratulate my noble friend on what the Government are
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:15:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000003">I
said that I had a long-standing interest in housing. It goes back a
very long way. Some people my age and perhaps younger will remember
when Harold Macmillan was Minister for Housing. The noble Baroness,
Lady Ford, quoted some statistics from before then. The House will
recall that Winston Churchill set Harold Macmillan the task of building
300,000 houses a year to cope with the housing crisis in the 1950s, and
he achieved that target within three years. Even Emanuel Shinwell, one
of the original red Clydesiders, who was then sitting for
Easington, had to admit, “This Government does get things
done”. In the following election, the Conservatives won 50% of
the vote—I do not think that they have achieved that since
then—and Harold Macmillan went on to become Prime Minister. I am
not suggesting that that exact approach could be replicated today.
Things have clearly altered a great deal. Council housing is
a fraction of what it was then and housing associations did not exist
in the 1970s in the way they do now. It is all very
different<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:16:41"></hs_TimeCode>.
But the sort of priority that that Government had
in the 1950s, when there were similar sort of crisis, though
different in prices and so forth, should be given to
housing today. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Ford,
that if we get that sort of priority and the long-term
thinking implied in that —and, if possible, with
cross-party support, so that whatever Government are in power, that
level of building is carried on—we have the makings of
a solution. Unless you have something like that,
we will just patch and mend as best we can from Government
to Government and we will have the situation that we have
today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:17:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000004">Finally,
at local level there is a wonderful opportunity to build more flats and
houses in our high streets, many of which are run down as a result of
the increase in online shopping. In Orpington, which I represented for
many years in the other place, Tesco built a new store in the high
street, with many flats above. Where I live now in Fulham, Sainsbury is
doing the same thing, both above a superstore and a local store. All
that will contribute to the revitalisation of our high streets, as well
as providing good, cheap social housing. That is one way forward, along
with the long-term measures that the noble Baroness
suggested<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:17:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140122112000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000146">6.17

Andrews (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful for the

it in a more authoritative or measured way than my noble friend, who
has been so instrumental in showing us the way forward. As she spoke,
the facts of the present Government’s housing policy appear only
starker in my eyes. Consensus is that they are facing the wrong
direction. I am sure that the Minister will tell us of the raft of
initiatives on the demand side that the Government are putting in
place, but she is sensible enough to know that that will not do
anything to address affordability, accessibility or housing market
failure.</hs_para>

compound all that, there is evidence that the local planning system is
being increasingly driven not by local plans but by the high emotions
of national policy and the appeals system. The Government complain that
the planning system is not delivering when, in fact, 400,000 planning
permissions have been granted for houses which are waiting to be built
out. However, more insidious at the moment is how the local planning
system is being undermined in two directions. A quarter of local
authorities cannot show a five-year supply of land and, therefore,
their local plans are out of date and they are in thrall to the
development priorities of the National Planning Policy
Framework. At the same time, even where there is a local plan in place,
there is increasing evidence that the Planning Inspectorate is
overturning local decisions because they are not delivering enough
development. Endless appeals, constant uncertainty and longer delays
mean fewer houses which are agreed by the local community. I should be
very grateful to the noble Baroness if she could tell me how many local
decisions have been overturned by PINS in the past five years, so that
we can get some notion of trend

tragedy is that the local authorities are the answer, but in order to
become the answer the Government have to respond to some common-sense
appeals—from the housebuilders as well as everybody
else—not to limit but to remove the housing borrowing cap. Local
authorities can then build 60,000 houses a year. We should get rid of

we know, affordable housing is the sum of affordable rent, social rent,
intermediate rent and affordable home ownership. It is provided to
eligible households whose needs are not met by the market, and that
eligibility may reflect local authority allocation policies, local

the question is a different one. It is: can I afford what is said to be

have debated social housing on several occasions. We know that we have
a waiting list of 1.8 million families. We know that house prices are
rising, particularly in London, with a consequential rise in rents. We
know that we need to build more and we know that large numbers of
people can never aspire to home ownership and need to rent. This
problem is compounded by reduced council tax support and the
underoccupancy charge, together with the benefit cap, particularly in
London, all of which are causing serious strain in the finances of many
households. For them, their rents can become unaffordable when they
used to be
affordable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000014">What
should be done? Many good ideas have been put forward—and we

to suggest a number of possible actions the Government could take quite
quickly. First<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:23:20"></hs_TimeCode>,
it should be an absolute requirement that when one council home is sold
it is replaced by another. This “one for one” is
government policy but councils, unsurprisingly, can have great
difficulty delivering it since they may not get enough money to meet
the cost of the replacement home. They need help in that
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:23:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000015">Secondly,
will the Minister examine the realities of the underoccupancy tax?
There are tenants who want to move to something smaller, and therefore
something that is more affordable, but who cannot move because there is
nowhere suitable to move to. Will the Government increase support to
encourage more providers to modify more properties to create more units
quickly to which people can
downsize?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000016">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:24:02"></hs_TimeCode>,
as regards the housing borrowing cap, in the autumn Statement the
Government announced that borrowing limits for housing revenue accounts
would be raised by £150 million a year in 2015-16 and 2016-17.
This was very good news and something that many in this House have been
urging the Government to do. If the cap did not exist, up to 60,000 new
homes could be built over the next five years. The risk is minimal
because the markets would set the cap, as the prudential borrowing
required would be secured by the rental income. Removing the cap would
of course bring local authorities into line with housing associations. 
<?notus-xml column=713?>So I hope that the recent announcement, which is welcome, could be
followed by a further rise in the borrowing
cap.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000017">I
recognise the measures the Government have taken since 2010 to try to
drive up housing starts and affordable homes. The trouble is that the
impact has been limited and further intervention is clearly needed if
the supply is to be increased and the cost to individual households is
to be made reasonably affordable.</hs_para>

housing and care for older people. In summarising these contributions
to the debate that Hanover organised to mark its 50th
anniversary, I contributed a 10th chapter, called,
“Accommodating our extended middle age”. This addresses
two of the most significant problems facing the UK: first, the
escalating health and social care requirements for those in later life
and, secondly, the acute shortages of homes for younger households. The
proposed solution to both problems is to build attractive, well
designed homes for those in their extended middle age—55 to 75
years-old—and create a sea change in attitudes in the UK to
downsizing or “right
sizing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:26:51"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

proportion of the rapidly growing number of older, single people and
couples living in family homes could be enticed—by spacious,
light, energy-efficient new homes—to downsize, there would be
huge gains for them and for the nation: improved health and well-being
for movers; liberation from looking after bigger homes and gardens;
reduced accidents in the home or illnesses linked to cold or damp; and
pre-empting, postponing and preventing loss of independence and
enforced moves into expensive residential care in later
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000022">Downsizing
retirees can access wealth by releasing equity, and this can pay for
care, assist the next generation or simply fund happier retirement.
Standards of living can be dramatically improved, and the setting of
“sociable housing” for those in extended middle age can
reduce the likelihood of loneliness and isolation, which are the chief
causes of misery and mental health problems for older people.</hs_para>

are equally for younger households. A shift in culture, whereby we
downsize at a younger age, instead of waiting for a crisis when we hit
our 80s, brings much-needed family housing, often with gardens, on to
the market—usually for relatively 
<?notus-xml column=714?>low-cost sale. It frees up existing social housing for families at
social rents, which means lower housing benefit costs that are hard to
achieve when building new affordable housing. It even provides for
those aged between 55 and 62 who need to move to avoid the dreaded

guarantee, Right to Buy and so forth. There have been a whole lot of
schemes but they have been piecemeal, inadequate and, in many respects,
misdirected by emphasising demand, not supply. In terms of geographical

am not here to proclaim that the Labour Government did it any better.
Frankly, we have all failed so let us have a political consensus that
that failure should be driving us to seek a new approach and a new
strategy. We also need to recognise the sheer size of the problem. I
was looking at some of the statistics on household growth. The growth
of households has slowed down a bit. Compared to the reference by the
noble Lord, Lord Borwick, to divorce and split families, kids staying
at home because of the economic recession has increased the size of
families, so that it has slowed down a bit. Even on those figures, it
is clear from the Cambridge study that we need 240,000 new homes to
meet the new households being created—almost twice what we are
building. We need to create a million new homes in the next five years,
and that process needs to go on until 2031—a 20-year programme.
That is a major strategic commitment and we do not have the mechanism
to deliver it. We do not have the vehicles for delivering it and need
to reinvent those
vehicles<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000040">One
of those is the role of local authorities. I am simply repeating what
the noble Lords, Lord Shipley and Lord Best, said. The most immediate
role is for local authorities to be able to borrow and engage in
developments on their own, with housing associations and the private
sector, in different ranges of housing. Unless the cap is
raised—we welcome £150 million, but it does not go very
far—local authorities which are the most obvious ones to deliver
at least part of this massive total will not be able to do so. Almost
everybody in the housing world agrees with that except Her
Majesty’s Treasury. Unless we raise that figure, we will not be
able to deliver the beginning. We may need to do a lot of other things
as well, but at least let us start with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:38:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140122112000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000152">6.39

very much welcome what the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, said.
There was nothing with which I disagreed. In fact, there were things
that I strongly champion. 
<?notus-xml column=717?>I just want to highlight three points in
very little time. First, there is a myth among some that the
demographic data showing the need for housing are somehow a finger in
the wind. A local authority planning officer once said that to

plans, we are not talking about housing for people who are not yet born
but for the people who are born—not only the people of the baby
boom of the 1990s and beyond who will be coming through soon, but the
3.3 million adults between 20 and 34 who, as the <I>Financial Times</I>
highlighted today, are living with their parents. That is an increase
of 669,000 since 1996 without any increase in that population age
group. These people are living at home because they cannot afford to
move out—even their own parents say that, when asked—and,
as a father of three young children, it worries the heck out of
me<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:40:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000044">Secondly,
there is a capacity issue in delivering the numbers we need. The large
housebuilders have a grip on developable land through land options but,
on their business model, they do not have the capacity to increase
delivery, however much they and we might want it, because their
business model will not allow such a growth in numbers. We have seen
that historically. It is simply a
fact<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:40:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000045">I
passionately believe that our country’s most successful social
enterprise sector—the housing associations—has that
capacity. It has it through the housing it already has and through its
experience of delivering a not-for-profit, social purpose model. The
housing association sector believes that some 2 million more homes will
be needed between now and the early 2030s. This includes a mix of
affordable homes to rent and homes for sale. That capacity can be
unlocked by liberating the sector and giving it greater
flexibility<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:41:28"></hs_TimeCode>. We
must allow that to happen, otherwise we will be unable to deliver the

of all, we will be unable to deliver the homes without the land being
made available. As long as we try to push denser and denser, smaller

dogs and to look at out of their window, the more and more unpopular it

certain sections of the Conservative Party—I do not know;
perhaps we will hear more about that today—but, more recently,
the Deputy Prime Minister has signalled his support, although using
different language and with the emphasis on alternative locations. The
Mayor of London, in admitting the failure of housing policy over the
years, has called for a kind of new town, or new towns, contribution
around the perimeter of London which might house some 80,000 to 100,000

view, housebuilding, and affordable homes can be achieved only by
looking seriously at the new town and garden city approach, with
populations of about 100,000 people. There is no other way possible to
meet the needs of the future. In broad terms, we should look at the
post-war model of development corporations, with the compulsory
purchase of land at agricultural prices and with the planning uplift
being passed on to the people. That was a fantastic model which worked
really well after the war. Thirty-two new towns were created in this
period. Imagine what Britain would be like today without those new
towns if that generation had not made the right decision

period ahead in the 21st century, we can adapt the principles that were
taken forward at that time, taking advantage of the large number of new
possibilities in terms of design, materials, transport, communities and
democratic involvement that people at the end of the war did not have
the opportunity to benefit from. There is a great opportunity for us to
bring this idea forward. We can bring an end to the current piecemeal
approach of a developers’ free-for-all, planning as an
afterthought or a great difficulty, and identical houses plonked miles
from amenities of public transport—all the kind of things that

progress. Just 42,380 affordable homes were provided in
2012-13—a decrease of 26% on the previous year. In the social
rented sector, just 24,550 were provided—a decrease of 36%.
Overall, there were only 135,000 total completions, in comparison to
the 219,000 delivered in 2006-07. Even that, of course, was

be in the social sector, with a concentration in London, the south-east

bringing forward of £10 billion of infrastructure spending this
year and next. A housing commission chaired by Sir Michael
Lyons is drawing up a road map to help delivery of our ambition by
looking to: reform the housing revenue account to produce a more
flexible system that enables councils to build; give local authorities
that want to expand a right to grow, with access to a fast-track
process to resolve disputes with neighbours, something which is
frustrating housing development; give councils proper compulsory
purchase powers to tackle land hoarding; and ensure that when public
land is given over to housebuilding, a proportion goes to smaller firms
and custom builders. We also plan to offer a package of incentives to
support a new generation of new towns and garden cities. That is

but it was made worse by the financial crisis of 2008, with
housebuilding collapsing to the lowest peacetime levels since the 1920s

stress that the collapse in building led to the construction industry
suffering greatly in the aftermath of the crash. It is not surprising
that it has taken time for the smaller construction companies in
particular to respond to the return to growth and for us to get back a
position where the industry has both the capacity and the confidence to
respond. Housebuilding is now back to 2007 levels but that has not

reformed the planning system: we have simplified it and handed
responsibility to local authorities to set their own housing
requirements. The framework is clear that local authorities should plan
to meet their full housing needs for both market and affordable

greater flexibility; he was kind enough to give me advance notice of

but of course none of those was built. This Government are clear about
our approach, which is to support locally led development through the
large sites programme, which aims to unblock barriers to delivery of
such sites through partnership working, provision of capacity funding
to local authorities and access to capital funding through the
£474 million local infrastructure fund. Under this programme,
some success to date has led to 69,000 new homes already being
“unlocked” in places such as Cranbrook, Sherford and
Wokingham. In the Autumn Statement we committed a further £1
billion to the local infrastructure fund to support communities in
delivering their housing aspirations over the next six years, and we

we have no plans to impose new developments on communities

on secret plans to build new towns in Yalding, Gerrards Cross or any
other areas. I noted what the noble Baroness, Lady Ford, said about the
Olympic Park. That has clearly been a great success 
<?notus-xml column=721?>but it is very different in its concept because it was built to serve
the Olympics and its national importance justifies the greater

turn specifically to affordable housing. We need more affordable
housing. It is worth pointing out, particularly in response to the
points made by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, that more council housing
has been built in the first three years of this Government than in the
13 years of the previous Labour Government. But council housing is only
a small part of the overall picture. Almost £20 billion of
public and private funding is being invested in the Affordable Homes
Programme over the four years to 2015. This will deliver
170,000 homes, nearly 100,000 of which have already been
completed. These homes are being provided where they are most needed
and in a range of areas. I say in response to the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds that around half the affordable
homes provided in 2011-12 were in rural communities. He is right to
identify that need and we are responding to
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000064">From
2015, another £23 billion will be invested to deliver 165,000
more affordable homes by 2018. The Homes &amp; Communities Agency will
publish the prospectus for this latest programme shortly, inviting bids
for funding to deliver that affordable housing outside London. As a
result of all this work, we will achieve the fastest rate of affordable
housebuilding for at least 20 years. Not only did the previous
Government build very little but they oversaw the shrinking of the
stock of social housing by 420,000 homes. My noble friend Lord Shipley
mentioned Right to Buy and the one for one programme. I understand the
point that he makes, but it is worth emphasising that that policy of
replacing homes sold under Right to Buy is something that no other

supply in time of difficult economic conditions means that we have to
look at different ways to attract investment. Our affordable housing
guarantees programme lets housing associations use a government
guarantee to secure private investment at more competitive rates. As
part of this, we recently agreed a new deal with the European
Investment Bank which will release £500 million to deliver up to
4,300 homes. We also announced the first eight housing associations to
receive funding through the guarantee programme.</hs_para>

councils also have a role to play in building homes and have announced
an independent review of councils’ role in housing supply. As
has been acknowledged by noble Lords today, we have already increased

points on this were raised by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, both today
and in a debate that we had last week on the local government finance
settlement, and by my noble friend Lord Shipley. The noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, spoke last week about ensuring that councils are able to take
advantage of some of those housing guarantees so that they are part of
the route to increasing supply—the right reverend Prelate also
referred to this today. The noble Lord felt that local 
<?notus-xml column=722?>authorities were barred from being able to take
advantage of some of these joint ventures and the source of funding.
That is not true. Some councils are already doing just that, and are
working with partners, housing associations and developers in joint
ventures on housing for sale, private rentals and sub-market rentals.
In the new scheme announced at the Autumn Statement to which I have
just referred, we expect to see partnership working with housing
associations through those joint
ventures<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T18:59:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000068">On
the increase in the borrowing level, it is important that we do not
underestimate the dramatic effect of the Government’s
self-financing reforms. The point is not just this recent increase in
the amount of borrowing but the way we have now made it possible for
165 council landlords to do this, with new freedom to plan
their housing businesses for the benefit of their tenants and local
communities. They now have that £2.8 billion borrowing headroom
and the possibility of planning longer term than they were ever able to
in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000069">Clearly,
this is about not just supply but also making best use of existing
stock. Social housing is one of our most precious resources. That is
why we have introduced much greater flexibility into the system so that
social landlords can make the best use of their holdings. Councils now
offer shorter fixed-term tenancies as well as the traditional lifetime
offer, meaning that they can better respond to families’
changing circumstances. Councils also now have much greater freedom to
decide who qualifies for social
housing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000070">The

situation around but our plan is working. Working together with housing
associations, councils and housebuilders, we are overcoming the

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, dementia is such an
important issue that I am pleased to have the opportunity to focus
attention on it tonight, at a time when it has been very much in the
news. My belief is that people need to be informed. Without doubt, a
degree of stigma attaches to the diagnosis of dementia. For this
reason, many people prefer to use the word
“Alzheimer’s” rather than the wider term
“dementia”. 
<?notus-xml column=723?>I have found this to be the case for years and we need to ensure that
that attitude changes. No stigma should attach to any medical diagnosis
of a condition that the person did not bring upon themselves, be it
dementia, epilepsy or
cancer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000073">I am
old enough to remember clearly when, in the 1950s and earlier, people
would say when they heard of someone they knew being diagnosed with
cancer, “I wonder what they did to get that”. The
attitude was that cancer was a punishment for the wicked only. Over the
years, people have had a much greater understanding of diseases and the
internet has made it easy for them to learn about cancer and its
causes. Because cancer is so widespread there has been marvellous
research in the subject. Information has created an awareness of the
great importance of early diagnosis as the best hope of a cure. Now
people know that hereditary genes may cause additional vulnerability in
some
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000074">Just
last week, I read an interesting article on a change of diet being the
way to avoid dementia. It recommended a high-fat diet, which has always
been deplored in the past. It stated that all white bread, pasta and
sugar—in fact almost all carbohydrates—should be
eliminated from one’s diet, that gluten-free products should be
used and that, in following the “five a day” health
advice about fruit and vegetables, only certain fruits of the low-sugar
type should be consumed. This new diet seems as extreme as the low-fat
diet was, but in reverse. At present, these are the views of Dr David
Perlmutter, a neurologist. The article in the <I>Times</I> on 18
January sets out much more detail about them.</hs_para>

conflicting dietary reports is not good for anyone; what we need is
solid evidence-based research. At present, it is not possible to know
who will develop dementia. It is no respecter of persons and can strike
the most brilliant people. Research is essential to determine what
measures can be taken to prevent dementia from developing and to
control the progress of the
condition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000076">In
the early stages of dementia, often a person is aware of their mental
deterioration but, as the condition progresses, they can lose all
awareness. Usually, short-term memory goes first. There are therapies
that can be applied to bring back happy memories from long ago that

patients.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000077">In
the <I>Daily</I> <I>Telegraph</I> of 28 December last, there was a
report to the effect that dementia patients were bedblocking to the
extent that urgent cases could not be admitted to major hospitals.
There were other very distressing press reports, for those who have
relatives or loved ones needing special care, of horrible and degrading
attacks on such patients, who could not defend
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:04:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000078">Solutions
are needed. I think that it is time for us to rethink some of the
treatments and facilities that we have thrown out of the NHS. More
daycare provision would allow patients to enjoy those hours in a safe
and caring environment while providing necessary relief for carers.
Respite, on a daily or longer-term break basis, is essential for
relatives and carers to enable them to fulfil that very important
role<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:05:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ideal for dementia patients needing in-hospital care but who did not
have urgent or immediate need for acute services. Both day centres and
cottage hospitals require full-time nursing and genuinely caring staff.
Those staff filled a need and were a valuable part of the NHS. Dementia
cases need genuinely caring support.</hs_para>

support the view—and the changed stroke care in London has
proven this—that we need highly specialised centres where
essential, urgent care can be provided for some life-threatening
conditions. Such centres, which are being developed, should be used for
cases in need of immediate and urgent high-intensity care, and the
patient should remain in until ready to return home or to go to an

is an essential part of any patient’s treatment at all levels. I
think it is splendid that nurses now can obtain the highest
qualifications, and I am a strong supporter of nurse practitioners.
Specialist nurses in whatever field are invaluable to patients,
consultants and the NHS. However,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:06:40"></hs_TimeCode> remain
convinced that it was a mistake to insist that all nurses must have
A-levels and obtain full academic qualifications. The loss
of the SEN qualification has done great damage. Some of the
best nurses I have known—and I have been involved in most levels
of the National Health Service—could never have
gained sufficient A-levels for university
entrance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:06:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000082">When
I have taken part in health discussions at the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association international conferences, I have asked what
other countries have done in nurse training. There is fairly wide
agreement that nurses should be able to train at various levels to meet
patients’ needs. Nurses with high clinical skills and
qualifications are needed, but so, too, are less qualified but capable,
compassionate, caring nurses who are willing to carry out the most
mundane tasks where there is a need and to treat people as valuable
human beings, not just
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:07:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000083">In
most Commonwealth countries, they have nurses train to the top level,
but when they brought in academic degrees for nurses, they retained
that intermediate level of nursing which we call the state enrolled
nurse. I am convinced that the Government should be liaising with the
nursing profession to look into the issue of our need at that
intermediate level. It is no good saying that people can become
“care assistants”. Even the talk of registering care
assistants has not moved people in a way that would make them proud to
bear that title. People consider it an honour to be called
“nurse”, and so it is, but there can be nurses and
nurses, and titles could be appropriately chosen to make clear those
who had a degree and
others<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:08:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000084">Dementia
can cause isolation as the patient becomes cut off from reality. It is
only at the early stages of the condition that the patient is able to
realise that they are losing contact with reality. Some treatments can
delay progress, but, at present, nothing can turn back the clock. It is
very hard for loved ones to see progressive dementia in a friend or
relative, and it can be a great test of their patience, as often the
sufferer becomes increasingly repetitious or even
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:08:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000085">The
number of people likely to suffer from dementia is projected to double
over the next 30 years, so there will be further pressure on services.
The Local Government 
<?notus-xml column=725?>Association states that there will be a funding gap by 2020. It cites
the Greenwich advanced dementia service as a new model of care for
people with advanced dementia which, to date, has supported more than
100 people to stay in their own homes and is saving up to
£265,000 a year on reduced care home costs and hospital
admissions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000086">Dementia
patients are more likely to die or suffer an injury than other
patients. A study of more than 17 million hospital visits
found that patients with the condition had far higher mortality rates,
longer lengths of hospital stay and a higher likelihood of readmission
than other patients. They are also three times more likely to suffer a
fall while on a ward than other patients. There were 380,000 such
incidents in a year.</hs_para>

conditions, accurate, up-to-date and well presented information for
patients, their families and friends is vital. Specialist charities can
help with providing just such information and reassurance to support
the information received from the health professionals. Today in my
GP’s waiting room, I checked the large number of information
leaflets for patients. These covered almost everything but there was
nothing on
dementia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000088">However,
my doctor told me that the practice has put people in touch with the
Contented Dementia Trust, which has proven to be of great help to
carers. Often, dementia can be associated with changes in temperament,
with some sufferers having spells of violence and others lengthy times
of apathy. Carers find it valuable to know that these situations can
arise and how to deal with or prevent them. It is an important point
that these specialist charities, of which the Contented Dementia Trust
is one and the Alzheimer’s Society is another, can help with
providing such information and reassurance.</hs_para>

has been made in healthcare and people are living so much longer that
dementia, usually associated with ageing, is becoming a major issue.
Florence Nightingale stressed the importance of the need for a
patient’s cleanliness and comfort; to those, I would add caring.
These essentials remain the same today. We must do more to see that
genuinely caring help is provided while working towards having greater
understanding, better information on the condition and a promising
future due to continuing and developing
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000090">I
thank all the speakers tonight, who can make a real contribution to the
debate on this important issue. Research is the only real answer. Until
we can fully establish the cause of dementia, we cannot develop methods
of prevention or means of curing the condition. The Government can
encourage research and increase awareness and understanding of the
crucial need for genuine caring for dementia cases, and they should
do
so.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:12:37"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_22_PT_1/9BB2B85F8611C7FFE33B62600AD6F0E33FDD6E7C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 January 2014">Wednesday,

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the
noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, for introducing this timely
debate. I have a personal interest in participating. My sister has
recently been diagnosed with suffering from Alzheimer’s disease
and has dementia. I spent the summer holiday and the recent Christmas 
<?notus-xml column=726?>break with her, trying to assist. My sister is a retired teacher and a
widow, living alone in Wiltshire. Her late husband had also been a
teacher. He was a former county councillor and had been chairman of the
local parish council. My sister had also been active locally. The
result is that she has had a great deal of local support, which has
been very valuable in her current circumstances. The local
Alzheimer’s Society has been very helpful and the county council
has a mental health committee, which has been of assistance. An
organisation called Carewatch has also
helped.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000092">While
I was there in the summer, I arranged for people from those
organisations to call and see her regularly. I also organised for a
lifeline to be installed: an alarm system with a wrist-held alarm,
which was to be rung if she needed to do so. The very nice people who
call to see her regularly make sure that she takes the medicines
prescribed for her and that she has the food she needs. She has very
good neighbours to help, who arrange to drive her if she needs to go
out. A neighbour also deals with the garden for her. I saw local
solicitors and, through them, arranged for a relative to take on the
responsibility of power of attorney so that she does not have to bother
about her financial affairs, which are in good order. She has a
pension, a widow’s pension and an attendance allowance. It is
therefore possible for her to pay for the services that she needs. That
is important, for any disability is expensive, and this is no
exception. It is also expensive if you need to pay for assistance. The
procedures in relation to power of attorney are of course extremely
complicated, as well as expensive, and there is no reason why the
Government should not intervene to make the arrangements less
so.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140122112000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000093">I
realise, of course, that not everyone is fortunate enough to have this
kind of support. It is difficult, I am sure, to come to terms with what
happens to people who have this disease. It was hard for me. My sister
had had a successful career. When I saw her after she had become ill,
it was difficult to cope with what had happened. She would sit in her
well equipped kitchen and not know what to do. We saw representatives
of the Alzheimer’s Society; she told them that she was
frightened of the microwave, and they told me that I should not try to
train her to use it again. She could not write. I wrote for her if she
needed to do any writing, and got her to sign. She did not use her
computer, of course, and had not done so for a very long time. Many
people that she knew she no longer recognised. Gradually one worked out
how best to arrange and organise living for her. The support of local
people is invaluable.</hs_para>

campaign by the Alzheimer’s Society is so important. It
understands that people with this illness are best looked after at home
in familiar surroundings. That is what we have tried to arrange for my
sister. She is able to lead a fairly normal life because of the support
of friends, family and local organisations. Through the campaign that
the Alzheimer’s Society has now embarked upon, I hope that we
shall be able to do this for other sufferers. Many people who are alone
and do not have this local support are, in my view, badly in need of
assistance of the kind that the noble Baroness made very clear in
introducing this debate.</hs_para>

I have rarely been as proud of being British as I was recently when
this country—or, rather, the Prime Minister, because of his
personal commitment—secured here in London the G8 summit on
dementia. That was an enormously important achievement. I say that with
real pride because I chair the All-Party Group on Dementia. We are an
extremely active all-party group that has produced a lot of reports on
many areas of interest. We have looked at the fact that dementia
patients stay longer in hospital when they go in for a fractured femur
and we were part of the campaign to reduce the use of anti-psychotics.
We have had many quite successful inquiries and policies have radically
changed because of the work of colleagues on the all-party group.
However, there is still a huge way to go.</hs_para>

the new cancer, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, said. It is not
very long ago that you could not really talk about it. The interest in,
and commitment to, doing something about dementia now is really
important and it is excellent that we have got that far. There are
still, however, many problems.
Dementia<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:19:35"></hs_TimeCode> is a
disaster if you are suddenly diagnosed. You have no idea how to cope
with the diagnosis or where to go for help. You are absolutely struck
by your inability to move forward. However, it should not be seen in
that way because a lot can be done. Of course we do not have all the
research that needs to be done—the G8 made that clear. As a
result, however, some very hopeful research work is being undertaken in
the United States and the money is beginning to flow in as well. But
there is still a long way to go on
research<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:20:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

looking at what has to be done now to alleviate the situation of people
when they receive a diagnosis or even before, when they suspect,
because of memory loss, that something is going wrong. It is a
progressive and a terminal disease which, at least at the beginning,
attracts social care funding and not health service funding. Over much
of their life course many of those who have the disease will experience
problems in getting financial help so that they can live adequately. It
can be a disaster and we need to do something now. The noble Earl is
doing a great deal to ensure that the Care Bill, which has now gone to
the Commons, will help many people with dementia. However, a huge
amount needs to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:21:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000100">We
have to see dementia as one element of the comorbidities that many
older people face—and it is usually older people, as the noble
Baroness said, who get a form of dementia. We have to concentrate on
the fact that if people have dementia, the other conditions 
<?notus-xml column=728?>from which they suffer are sometimes ignored, or
vice-versa. Dementia also has to be seen in the light of the huge
stigma that still surrounds its diagnosis. For many people, even GPs,
it is better to ignore it than to diagnose somebody when they do not
feel that there is a great deal they can do to help. Many people try
very hard to forget that it is happening, and if they forget it is
happening, their quality of life will be reduced
enormously<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000101">Much
can be done. We have to take into account that local commissioning is
an excellent way of improving the situation as long as it works
properly. I chaired a meeting this morning with commissioners to look
at what can be done to improve the lives of people right at the
beginning when they know that something is wrong, before they are
diagnosed and immediately afterwards. As soon as they feel that there
is some memory loss or they begin to worry they need to get
help and not wait for a diagnosis. They need to get help and
start the process of making a plan of action and support for that
person, the family and the wider community where possible. Things can
be done to improve the quality of
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:23:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

be done in preventive care, particularly with vascular dementia. A
change in lifestyle can help a great deal to delay the worst aspects of
that dementia and, indeed, some of the others. However, not all can be
helped in that way. What is necessary then is the coming together of
support mechanisms—that is, people—who can really
help.</hs_para>

have to be certain that the good measures in the Care Bill are
introduced so that we have a co-ordinated plan of action for anybody
who is diagnosed eventually with some form of dementia. The right now
of carers as well as of patients to a proper assessment leads to
action, and this is not easy. It is not easy for local authorities and
not easy for commissioners in healthcare, because there is a shortage
of funds. However, we have to find the funds because dementia is a
priority. It is a terminal disease, so it is extraordinary that it gets
primarily social funding from local authorities rather than health
funding. We have to integrate. That is what the Care Bill is aiming to
do, so we have to give it our total
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000104">Memory
clinics need to be the first place that people go to when they feel
there is something wrong. That is when the support services need to be
brought together to help somebody to find their way through the maze of
services. They need to inform themselves about them and make sure they
are available to them. That is where other people in the local
community can do so much, as the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, said.
When there are good services around that can be brought in early, we
can get this as right as possible. Even before the memory clinic people
have to start recognising that something is wrong, and then you need to
have a co-ordinated approach to care. That is essential. We need to
have a navigator/co-ordinator who can go in and advise that person and
that person’s family how to get the best care that is available
locally so that their quality of life does not deteriorate. When they
are diagnosed, this is even more important, so we need a
navigator/co-ordinator of all the services. The services need to be
brought together so that they are not difficult to find.</hs_para>

need people to understand that post-diagnosis, life can be very good.
One of the participants at the meeting with about 30 commissioners this
morning was an early-onset dementia patient. He was diagnosed at the
age of 49—10 years ago, I think. He was still perfectly capable
of taking a very active role in the debate we were having because he
had the right support around him all the time. That is essential. You
need one place where all the services are available, you need one
navigator/co-ordinator to provide those services for somebody and you
need to convince that person and the carers that life can be good for a
very long time. We need to have contact with all the advisers
straightaway, one service co-ordinator and a strategic service
integration scheme. That is key. We need one location, one centre where
all the services are brought together and, rather like when you have a
baby, you need to have a list of the services given to you so that you
know who to ask about everything. We can do that.</hs_para>

personalisation in what we do. We can look to the groups that really
cannot cope, and which have no idea of local services, and to our
minority groups, some of which do not even have a name for
Alzheimer’s or dementia. There are huge problems there. We need
to focus on those people. We really need above all to listen to,
communicate with and involve people with dementia every step of the way
because they have not lost their humanity and their ability to be part
of society. We have to trust them to know what they need and want and
bring the services close to them so that they can benefit from the many
important new ways of delivering services which will be enhanced, I
hope, by the Care Bill when it becomes part of our
legislation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_22_PT_1/25BDBA3E6680C6BEDBAC1AA3C828546462BB11CE" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 January 2014">Wednesday,

the Government are determined to address the issues of dementia. When I
was a Health Minister in the 1970s, serving Prime Ministers Wilson and
Callaghan, one scarcely heard the word
“dementia”. The NHS then was a battleground between
administrators, unions and consultants. A royal commission was
hopefully deployed; the International Monetary Fund moved in, and there
was competitive recruitment between unions. Ministers were moved out or
sacked, and there were endless resource-allocation working parties.
London was accused of gaining too much of the available
moneys.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140122112000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000109">The
question of the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, is as strategic as any
that faces administrators and politicians who now give leadership to
the nation. The scale of the challenge of dementia socially and
financially in the future is truly massive. The amount of money
available is inevitably insufficient. The amount of research needs to
be expanded, if not the quality. Already, our social services and NHS
are stretched almost to breaking point. We have on our hands, in
effect, an emergency. Longevity guarantees that this massive national
challenge will not go
away<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:30:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is a shining light: the Alzheimer’s Society, one of
Britain’s greatest and most relevant charities. It stands ready
to assist and advise countless families whose happiness is blighted by
the emergence of dementia in a loved family member. I have the
privilege of being a dementia champion in Wales and, at the grass roots
of community, I have seen the good done by ordinary people for those
who are their wits’ end struggling to cope with the challenges
of domestic change. As president of the society in north Wales for some
20 years, I have seen the enthusiasm of volunteers and their
assistance, encouragement, organisation and fund-raising—all of
these positives are constant and most effective. These activities
generate friendship, teamwork, humour and even expertise though
training as a friend. I am sure that the Alzheimer’s Society and
its headquarters will continue to harness this great reservoir of
energy and goodwill at the grass
roots<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:32:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

deeply committed communicator as chief executive, and a wise,
experienced chair in Dame Jill Morgan. My hope is that the Minister
will listen carefully to the demands and advice of the
Alzheimer’s Society’s leadership. The Minister is, after
all, accessible and open-minded in his dedication to the health
service. However, the national response to the dementia
emergency will be at its most positive at the grass roots, by
mobilising the volunteer and by appealing to the generosity,
practicality and familial loyalty at local level. Facing up to the
national challenge of dementia will require more than the findings and
promulgations of the Westminster and Whitehall village.</hs_para>

are exemplary approaches being made in my own country of Wales. The
director for Wales, Mrs Sue Phelps, called a conference in
Wrexham, north Wales, recently. It was packed out by an army of
youthful volunteers, family members, and dementia sufferers. The
society’s Flintshire office, led by Mrs Baldini,
organised this hearteningly successful gathering in the principal town
of north Wales. We heard of best practice. We had professorial insights
and examples of families coping. It was an inspirational gathering, and
pointed to—as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, seeks—the
support

of those receiving formal diagnosis? I hope there may be a reply from
the Front Bench<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>
tonight.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:34:29"></hs_TimeCode>, what
support is on offer for people following a diagnosis? If the
Alzheimer’s
Society<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:34:30"></hs_TimeCode> is a
shining light, the great European aerospace company, Airbus, is a white
knight extraordinaire. It has made the Alzheimer’s Society its
preferred national charity and it is on course to raise, in this
calendar year, £220,000 or more for responses to dementia. The
able charity organiser is Mr Phil McGraa, based in north-east Wales at
the giant, world-class aerospace factory at Broughton, which is where I
live<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:35:08"></hs_TimeCode>. More than
6,000 women and men work at that plant; they are big-hearted,
supportive and imaginative in their financial and organisational
support. They are great people; they are skilled and caring
citizens<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:35:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000114">Airbus
and the north-east Wales office of the Alzheimer’s Society
joined forces to organise a giant memory walk for the purpose of
fundraising for dementia sufferers. The walk took place in perfect,
warm, sunny 
<?notus-xml column=731?>weather on an immaculately curated racecourse, Bangor-on-Dee, with
superb views of our Welsh
mountains<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:35:55"></hs_TimeCode>. There
were no horses, but many hundreds of Airbus workers, volunteers and
families in the walk. This mass memory walk was a thundering success,
with the Airbus sponsor, the Alzheimer’s Society, volunteers and
countless families all co-operating at the grassroots. I should say
that this racecourse does not have an all-weather
surface<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:36:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000115">Quite
simply, Airbus is magnificent. It exports billions of pounds of
product, outperforms its great competitor, Boeing, and raises tens of
thousands of pounds for dementia suffers. It has encouraged families
with dementia sufferers in their midst in the most practical way, by
being alongside them. I was fortunate to be on the memory walk, and it
was heartening to meet a family of 17, and all of them were working for
who they knew as their granddad. The support services on the walk were
partly provided by high school pupils from Castell Alun High School,
who showed great promise on that
day<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000116">My
message to the Minister and to the Alzheimer’s Society is to
invest in the localities and to use the great reservoir of experience,
good will and practicality of all the volunteers. After all,
they—the ordinary families—experience the distress and
bewilderment when this dreadful condition enters the family. Every high
school with involvement in that community could begin what might become
a lifelong commitment to helping dementia sufferers. After all, the
future years will see much more domiciliary care for dementia
sufferers, and perhaps our youth will be able to tackle this
emergency.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_22_PT_1/42160DE32E9B03BF12491927026E95CE4F8AB5AD" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 January 2014">Wednesday,

my health interests as chair of a foundation trust, president of GSI
and consultant and trainer with Cumberlege Connections. I, too, would
like very much to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, for
allowing us to debate this important issue tonight. I also echo the
tribute paid by my noble friend Lord Jones to the Alzheimer’s
Society, both for the work that it does and for the very helpful
briefing that I have received
tonight<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:38:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000118">If
we come back to the question put by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner,
she is surely right about the important focus on improving information
to the public, and trying to get over some of the stigma problems to
which she referred. She referred to cancer—and I remember when,
in the 1950s, people would not actually use the word
“cancer”. It was almost hidden away. Clearly, there are
issues with dementia, which we must tackle with
enthusiasm<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:39:20"></hs_TimeCode>. My
noble friend Lady Turner spoke eloquently of the terrible impact that
dementia can have on loved
ones<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:39:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000119">On<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:44:22"></hs_TimeCode>
a more optimistic note, both the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and
the noble Lord, Lord Jones, said that much can be done.
However, the problem is that often people do not know that that is the
case. A major problem is the lack of information in many
cases when a diagnosis is made. That, of course, assumes that a
diagnosis is made. My understanding is that diagnosis rates are
currently only 48% in the UK, and vary 
<?notus-xml column=732?>widely across the country. This suggests that more than half
of people with dementia do not receive a formal diagnosis and therefore
do not get access to vital treatment and support. How does the noble
Earl think that we might improve diagnosis
rates<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:40:34"></hs_TimeCode>? Will he
also consider the Alzheimer’s Society’s priorities for
improving post-diagnostic support, to which my noble friend Lord Jones
referred? That society’s priorities are that health and care
professionals should provide post-diagnosis information packs, that
information must be accessible and useful to people with dementia and
not just available digitally—a very important point—and
that commissioners must also consider the needs of carers of people
with dementia in their local
plans<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000120">When
a diagnosis is made of any condition, not just dementia, why is the
information provided by societies such as the Alzheimer’s
Society not automatically given to patients? It has long been a puzzle
to me why the health service in particular finds it so difficult to
give out this information. Any help the noble Earl can give in that
regard would be
appreciated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000121">Will
the noble Earl say a little more about research? A number of noble
Lords have referred to this. Research into dementia has improved but
there is a long way to go compared with research into other diseases. I
hope that the noble Earl will be prepared to comment on his own
department’s policies on this issue and on the influence of the
Medical Research Council in this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:42:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000122">My
noble friend Lady Turner said that people with dementia are best looked
after at home. That must surely be right. However, the noble Earl will
know that at the moment many patients with dementia are in National
Health Service acute hospitals. Some people use the wretched term
“bed blocking”, which I think is very unfortunate.
However, there is no doubt that one of the problems for accident and
emergency departments is the difficulty of discharging patients with
dementia once they get to hospital, and, of course, those patients
often suffer from co-morbidities. Has the noble Earl looked at the
report of the Royal College of Physicians which suggests that, rather
than having specialised hospital consultants, we need general
physicians who can treat patients with co-morbidities? This is very
relevant to people with dementia. Will he write to me on that issue if
he cannot comment on it
today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-22T19:43:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000123">The
noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, referred to nursing. I very
much agree with her that in retrospect the phasing out of state
enrolled nurses was an absolute disaster. I am afraid that it was done
at the behest of the nursing profession. It is not satisfactory that we
now have only one tier of registered nurse. I will not go back to the
issue of healthcare assistant regulation, although rumours reach one of
a Bill that will allow us to debate that again at some point in the
near future. However, the substantive point the noble Baroness made was

can tackle this issue only in a wider context. My noble friend Lord
Jones said that the Question posed by the noble Baroness is a strategic
one. I very much agree with that. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross,
talked of the need, in the case of an individual with dementia, for a
navigator and co-ordinator. My argument would be that we need the
equivalent at the national 
<?notus-xml column=733?>level also. We have the national dementia strategy for England but my
understanding is that it is due to end in April 2014. I ask the noble
Earl whether he thinks that the Government would be prepared to run

illness. It impacts on 850,000 people at the moment; I believe that
that figure is estimated to increase to 1 million or so by 2021. The
need for national leadership and a national strategy is overwhelming.
The noble Earl might not be able to commit to that tonight but I hope
that he will take the message from noble Lords here, which is that this
is a terrible illness, much can be done to help people with dementia if
we have co-ordinated action, much more research ought to be done, and
we need greater co-ordination at local level.</hs_para>

dementia is one of the biggest challenges society is facing, but it is
a challenge that we are determined to get to grips with. That is why
dementia is a major priority for the UK Government, and my right
honourable friend the Prime Minister launched the dementia challenge
last year. We must fight back on an international scale, which is why
we hosted the first G8 summit on dementia in December, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross, kindly mentioned, and we will continue to

national dementia strategy was developed. It has achieved a lot and
laid the foundations for real change in how people with dementia and
their carers are helped to live well with the condition. However, we
recognised the need to build on the strategy and that is why the Prime
Minister’s challenge on dementia is the main vehicle driving
change and improvement across health and care in the community and for
research. The Prime Minister’s challenge runs to 2015, not just
outliving the dementia strategy but broadening its vision and providing
better accountability. The challenge sets out the Government’s
commitment to increase diagnosis rates, raise awareness and
understanding, and double funding for research into dementia by
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122112000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122-0002.htm#140122112000130">There
are 670,000 people in England with dementia, a number expected to
double in the next 30 years. Dementia costs society an estimated
£19 billion a year, and currently less than half of all people
with dementia have a formal diagnosis. One of the main aims of the
Prime Minister’s challenge is to improve awareness of 
<?notus-xml column=734?>the condition by creating dementia-friendly communities. If we are to
help people to live well with dementia, we need all areas of society to
become dementia-friendly—not just health and social care but
banks, supermarkets, bus stations, post offices and all the different
forms of local public services. All those places can become more
dementia-aware and supportive of people with dementia and, if they do,
people with dementia will benefit enormously, continuing to connect
with society in ways we all take for granted.</hs_para>

scheme, which aims to make 1 million people more aware and
understanding of dementia, is helping to break down the barriers
between people with the condition and their local communities, with
funding from the Department of Health and the Cabinet Office. The noble
Lord, Lord Jones, was absolutely right in all that he said on this
subject. My right honourable friends the Prime Minister and Deputy
Prime Minister and Ministers at the Department of Health are all
Dementia Friends, as are more than 500 Department of Health
staff. I myself am a Dementia Friend. It has helped me to understand
the impact that this condition has not just on the individual but on
their families who care for them. Dementia Friends is one of several
components in creating dementia-friendly communities.
Alzheimer’s Society guidance sets out the criteria for becoming
a dementia-friendly community, and already 34 communities, from York to
Plymouth, have signed up to the scheme, with others having expressed an
interest in doing so.</hs_para>

Health England, working with the Alzheimer’s Society, will
launch a three-year £12 million social movement to
make the nation more aware of dementia and enable people to understand
how they can help those with the condition. The “Dementia
Movement” will aim to do three main things. The first will be to
reduce fear and stigma through activity that improves public attitudes
towards dementia and gives more people the confidence to engage with
those with dementia. It will also aim to increase social
connectedness—for example, by prompting and supporting
conversations between people in the early stages of dementia and their
families, friends and neighbours. It will aim, too, to improve skills
by recruiting people into the Dementia Friends programme so that more
people know how to help those with dementia. The movement will target
business partners in the private, public and voluntary sectors, and
urge them to continue to implement the Dementia Friends programme
within their organisations, giving their employees an understanding of
the supportive action that they can take to help people with
dementia.</hs_para>

Lady Greengross, spoke with great authority about the importance of
diagnosis, co-ordinated care and support, and I very much agreed 
<?notus-xml column=735?>with what she said. The noble Lord, Lord Jones, also laid emphasis on
timely diagnosis. Raising awareness of the signs and symptoms of
dementia is the first step towards getting a formal
diagnosis—one that will lead to people being able to access
advice, information, care and support. The number of people with a
diagnosis is increasing year on year, but the noble Lord, Lord Hunt,
was right: still only just under half of all people with dementia have
a diagnosis. That is simply not good enough and it is why NHS England
has committed to raising the diagnosis rate to two-thirds by
2015.</hs_para>

groups are working with their local councils and other partners to
better understand how widespread dementia is in their communities,
including among people living in local care homes. This will mean that
they can identify and support people with dementia in a timely way. GPs
are now able to use the new directed enhanced service to improve the
diagnosis of dementia by asking people in certain at-risk groups about
their memory. This proactive approach should help to identify patients

Lady Greengross, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked about steps being
taken to ensure the identification and treatment of comorbidities in
people with dementia. If I may say so, that question is extremely
pertinent. NHS England has committed to increasing the dementia
diagnosis rate, as I mentioned. A diagnosis of dementia is vital in
accessing support and treatment across the board, not just for dementia

diagnosis. they need to understand the implications of the condition
and how they can access advice, information and support to help them
and their carers to live as well as they can with the condition. If the
condition is advanced, some people will need care and support
immediately, but those diagnosed at an earlier stage may need only
advice and information. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, rightly stressed the
need to provide information post-diagnosis.</hs_para>

Gardner mentioned the important role of charities, as did the noble
Lord, Lord Jones, who rightly praised the work of
the Alzheimer’s Society. The dementia guide is given
to a person with dementia when they receive a diagnosis, and almost
100,000 copies have been distributed since last July. The NHS Choices
website has dedicated pages for dementia, highlighting the range of
services and support available to people with dementia and their
carers. Regional NHS websites, such as myhealthlondon.nhs.uk provide
details of healthcare and voluntary services available locally. A free

and it will continue to roll out 
<?notus-xml column=736?>training to improve the skills of the workforce. We want people with
dementia to receive a better quality of care from informed and trained

person joining the social care workforce will undertake common

noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and my noble friend Lady Gardner asked about
research. Doubling funding for research, as I mentioned, is part of the
Prime Minister’s challenge, and the quality and quantity of
research proposals for dementia are improving. Last year £20
million was awarded to six proposals which will look at areas such as
Living Well with Dementia and dementia-associated visual impairment.

I have outlined, there are a range of services and information sources
available to support people with dementia and their carers, but this is
only the beginning and we have a long way to go until everyone with
dementia is able to live as well as they can with the condition. We are
not resting on our laurels. The Government are committed to doing more.
We are currently working with our partners in the NHS,
social care, local government, public health and the Alzheimer’s
Society on a call to action to improve post-diagnosis support for
people with dementia and their carers—support on which the noble
Lord, Lord Jones, rightly laid emphasis. The work is at an early stage
but, over the next couple of months, we will be developing an offer of
what should be available to everyone to ensure that we have achieved

The Water Framework Directive establishes an approach
for the management, protection and improvement of water resources
across the EU at a River Basin District level. It requires surface
water bodies to be classified into one of five ecological classes, and
one of two chemical classes. Groundwater classification reflects water
quantity and chemical status. One key aim is to achieve good ecological
and chemical classification status by 2015 unless there are grounds for
exemption or alternative objectives. Achieving 'good' status involves
meeting certain standards for the ecology, chemistry, morphology and
quantity of waters. In general terms, 'good' status means that water
shows only a slight change from what would normally be expected under
undisturbed
conditions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140122100000429" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140122w0001.htm#140122100000429">Classifications
