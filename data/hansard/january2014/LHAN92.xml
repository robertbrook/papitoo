My Lords, we are undertaking a number of actions supporting the
restoration of peatlands, including working with the International
Union for Conservation of Nature on the pilot peatland code, research
to determine best practice in peatland restoration, and establishing
three government-funded nature improvement areas. We are also investing
more than £3 billion in a more targeted successor scheme to
environmental stewardship, with the potential to include peatland
restoration, and we are funding research on greenhouse gas emissions

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:10:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, that
was quite a positive response. Is the Minister aware of the recent
report by the Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences at
Aberdeen University, which found that building wind farms on undegraded
peatland will not reduce net carbon emissions, and that they should not
be built there? Many peatlands are in wild, remote, often upland areas,
with large stocks of soil carbon. Developing them usually involves
substantial excavation and draining of peat, which offsets the gains
from wind power. Will the Government take these matters into account
when considering their future energy strategy for the UK in conjunction
with the devolved
Administrations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="14010845000262" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000262">Lord
De Mauley:</Member></B> Yes, my Lords. Applicants for consent for major
energy infrastructure projects must provide assessments of potential
biodiversity and geological impacts, including the effects of locating
infrastructure on peatland. The decision-making authority must take
such impacts into account before making its decision. Much can be done,
through project design, to minimise and mitigate impacts. However, if
there is damage that cannot be avoided, it is for the planning
authorities to judge whether the benefits of the wind farm development
outweigh those
impacts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:08:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Krebs (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to
ask the Minister about the impacts of climate change on
upland peat. As he will know, the report of the Adaptation
Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, which I happen to
chair, reported this year that only 4% of upland deep peat in England
is in active, peat-forming good condition. Furthermore, only one-third
of upland deep peat has a management plan in place. Will he inform the
House what he intends to do about the other two-thirds of upland peat
that has no management plan in place to improve its
quality<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:09:16"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="14010845000264" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000264">Lord
De Mauley:</Member></B> Yes, my Lords—and I
should take this opportunity to thank the noble Lord for the
work he does with the Adaptation Sub-Committee; it
is extremely important to us. The peatland code, which was
launched in September, provides a basis for business sponsorship of
peatland restoration; that is a key plank in what we are doing. We are
also undertaking a considerable amount of important and
relevant research. Environmental stewardship, which I referred to in my
initial Answer, has for many years benefited peatlands, but
the new ELMS will be more focused on environmental outcomes and
therefore will be more directly beneficial to peatland restoration. The
three nature improvement areas that have peatlands are
working hard on improving their
habitats.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:10:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Cormack" PimsId="5885" UID="14010845000265" xid="2099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000265">Lord

that Birmingham, Exeter, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester and Sheffield, as

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord

inspector has focused attention on “lucky children”.
Although 78% of schools are now good or outstanding—compared to
68% when we came into office—there are still too many unlucky
children. Many of them attend schools up and down the country that have
been failing for years and which we are now turning into sponsored
academies. The performance of sponsored academies far outstrips that of
other state schools. For instance, sponsored academies open for three
years improved their GCSE results by 12% versus 5% for local authority
schools. The Government’s extensive programme of reform is aimed
at ensuring that all children are lucky enough to go to a good
school<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:15:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the chief inspector’s finding that children’s success in
education is determined not by their background but by the quality of
the school they attend and that lucky children are simply those who
attend good schools? Does this not offer an end to the climate of low
expectations for children from disadvantaged backgrounds, which for too

other schools that setting higher expectations for our children does
work.</hs_para>

on governance. I put that right at the top of my agenda when I came
into office because it seems to me that, whether a school is maintained
by a local authority or is an academy, the key decisions are often made
by the governing body, so we need to raise the quality of governance.
Last year, we focused governors’ responsibility on three key
functions: on setting the school’s strategy and vision; on
holding the head teacher to account for pupils’ progression and
for the performance management of the staff; and on money. It is
important to focus governors on a limited number of tasks, but we are
also dramatically beefing up recruitment, including by working with
business to recruit more business

important. It is essential that schools work closely and engage with
their local businesses. Many excellent models are emerging up and down
the country—I am continually coming across new
ones—including: the Business in the Community business class,
which aims to work with 500 schools; the Ahead Partnership in Leeds,
which runs a very good organisation called “Make the
Grade” that builds partnerships between businesses and schools;
and Inspiring the Future as well as a number of other models that are

basis—whether that involves national chains operating regionally
or local schools supporting

assist us in providing support for particularly our smaller exporters,

we have engaged constructively with lawyers over a period of
many months and we continue to do so. However, the fact remains that we
have one of the most expensive 
<?notus-xml column=1507?>legal aid systems in the world and in the current

uninformative Answer. Does he recognise that the Justice Alliance,
representing a large number of people and organisations and many senior

case that these cuts will lead to more, not less, expenditure, that
cases will be bound to last much longer when people are unrepresented,
that there will be a reduction in standards and that there will be more
miscarriages of justice and an inevitable increase in guilty pleas? Is

undertaken to listen, consult and work with the profession, and we

with the crisis that we inherited, we needed to look across the board

that we will be making from this series of cuts, £1.5 billion

accepted

otherwise might seem to be an attractive saving? Can the Minister tell

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am afraid that I do not
agree with the noble Lord. This is not a jump into the dark; it is a
recognition of the current situation that the Government face across
the board and across every department. We are seeking to focus legal
aid spending on those who most need it. Spending on legal aid in the UK
amounts to about £39 per head. I reiterate that one should look
at some of the figures, even making international comparisons. Compared
with like-for-like systems—for example, New Zealand at
£18, Canada at £10 and Ireland, next door to us, at
£20 per head—our legal system will, after the
efficiencies are made, still remain one of the best in the
world.</hs_para>

point. On our investment in flood defences, it is important to make the
point that this Government’s overall investment is higher than
ever before. We announced in the Autumn Statement before
Christmas—this has not happened before—a commitment to a
protected, long-term, six-year capital settlement for flood defences.
This will lead to £400 million a year by 2021 and will mean that
a further 300,000 other properties are protected beyond those that

tribute to all of those who are working in difficult circumstances to
tackle these dreadful adverse consequences of our weather conditions
and welcome the Bellwin scheme announcements. However, we have obtained
figures in a Parliamentary Answer which make it clear that
the Government have reduced investment in flood defences by as much as
£100 million in real terms, lower than the level they inherited,
from £646 million in 2010 to £527 million this
year and £546 million in 2015. How does the Minister
justify the claim that has just been made? How does she justify the
proposed one-third cut in the budget of local flood authorities for
2015-16 that has just been announced in the local government finance
settlement?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000088"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="14010845000342" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000342">Baroness
Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> On the noble Lord’s first
point, as I have said, this Government are investing more than
£2.3 billion on flood defences in this spending review period
and the overall investment, when that is combined with local authority
and private sector expenditure, is higher than in the previous four
years. As for any reductions in budgets, as the noble Lord will know,
because he will have heard my honourable friends make the same point,
in any reductions to budgets, necessary budget cuts that we have had to
make because of economic situations, front-line flooding services are
not
affected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000089"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Elystan-Morgan" PimsId="3108" UID="14010845000343" xid="1811" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000343">Lord

Aberystwyth and is proud, indeed, to have been born in that town, I
suggest to the Minister that the situation not just in
Aberystwyth but in many other places on the Welsh coast that have been
so badly hit is far more desperate than the Government seem to
appreciate. The scale of storm destruction is such that it is
impossible for local authorities or, indeed, the Welsh Assembly to
render proper remedy. Although Westminster exercises sovereignty over
the land and nation of Wales, with that sovereignty there is also a
high and heavy moral responsibility to assist in situations of crisis
such as
these.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="14010845000344" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000344">Baroness

not to merge the Environment Agency and Natural England. That would
have resulted in a critical loss of focus by the Environment Agency
from its core function of responding to flood defences. That was a wise
move. However, bearing in mind the need to ensure that we

Dear (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 1, I
want to be absolutely clear on one thing: anti-social behaviour can be,
and often is, a blight on society and on those who suffer as victims of
individuals who care only for themselves—people who are
thoughtless, selfish or deliberately provocative. I believe, as many in
your Lordships’ House will, too, that the law should continue to
try to prevent that happening and to offer relief to those who suffer
from that sort of behaviour. Their well-being is precious. On the other
hand, civil liberty is precious, too, and a balance has to be struck
between those two
requirements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000095">My
amendment is largely concerned with that balance and with a search for
certainty, precision and clarity. It is concerned with the legal
requirement that the law should be precise and not undermine
fundamental human freedoms. The amendment is of course also about
anti-social behaviour but the primary issue is an important and very
long-established jurisprudential principle. From at least the days of
<I>Halsbury</I>, it has been recognised that the law should be clear,
reasonable, precise and unambiguous. People must know what the law
demands of and grants to them. That principle is followed in all
developed democracies. For example, in the USA the void for vagueness
doctrine allows a statute to be struck down if it lacks sufficient
definiteness or specificity so

ASBO and public order legislation addresses anti-social behaviour by
defining it in those circumstances as conduct that causes harassment,
alarm or distress—a threshold test accepted by lawyers and lay
people alike that has been well understood after years of judicial
interpretation and never seriously challenged or openly criticised as
too restrictive in scope. The Bill before us seeks to replace that
three-word threshold test of harassment, alarm or distress with two new
words: “nuisance or annoyance”. In so doing, it will open
the door to uncertainty, confusion and legal injustice. Most of Clause
1 is concerned with the mechanics of the new injunctive procedure but
the threshold test is the pivotal point around which everything else
revolves. To put it another way, it is the foundation upon which all
that is new will be based. The present threshold test of harassment,
alarm or distress is about to be replaced with the altogether more
imprecise words “nuisance or annoyance”. In other words,
the net is being cast much wider—far too wide, in my
opinion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000097">I am

“insulting” from Section 5 of the Public Order Act 1986.
The ingredients of that debate were strikingly similar to the issues
today. Again, an important legal freedom was then at stake. The word
“insulting” had been employed more and more to curb the
exercise of free speech in public. That fundamental right was being
abused. More and more, police and prosecutors were unwilling to
exercise discretion—some might say that they were unwilling to
exercise common sense—and they increasingly deferred to the
courts for a decision. That increased the growth of the

that it was no longer precise enough. The only real difference in that

signed it and I believe that it is amply justified. As the noble
Baroness has just said, one of our fundamental freedoms is
the freedom of speech. Surely it is clear that in exercising
that freedom, one may annoy one or more other people. From
time to time in this House I have witnessed a Minister explaining his
present difficulty by reference to the behaviour of the previous
Government, and one immediately senses annoyance on the opposite
Benches. If I have an opinion which I know some or many people will
disagree with, surely I am entitled to come out with it. Do I have to
reasonably consider whether it will cause annoyance to somebody else,
and if it would, what should be the consequence? Am I to muzzle my
point of view to placate people who might be annoyed? It is absolutely
plain that “annoyance” in this context, with a wide
application, is inappropriate for this purpose.</hs_para>

by the Government hitherto, so far as I understand it, is that this
definition has been tried and tested in the courts for some 15 years.
But definitions in their application are subject to the context in
which they are used, and this use has been in the context of social
housing and its enforcement has been in the hands of the responsible
authorities for social housing. You cannot imagine an authority in that
field trying to stop a street preacher, for example, on the basis that
he was annoying the passers-by by the denunciations that he was
pronouncing against their acknowledged conduct. It is not the same
context at all, and the context influences the proper
interpretation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:14:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is certainly possible to consider amendments. The Government have come
out with one in which they replace the clause which was in the Bill
originally by “reasonably be expected to occasion
annoyance”. I do not see that that helps in the slightest
because the real difficulty is the definition of what is reasonably
caused, not whether it is reasonably caused. Indeed, in some aspects
this could be regarded as slightly widening the context of what was in
the Bill before in the sense that it does not actually need to cause so
long as it is reasonably expected to cause. That is a very small point
that occurred to me just looking through
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000123">“Just
and convenient” is used as a condition of the granting of this
injunction. I find that hard to apply in the circumstances of this
case. If something is just, does it not go forward because it is
inconvenient to the respondent? That does not seem very sensible. I do
not think the condition that it should be just and convenient adds
anything to provide against the effect of the basic
definition.</hs_para>

use of the word “reasonably” has been suggested in
relation to later amendments as a defence in this situation. But is it
not reasonable for me to express my opinion even if I know that
somebody will disagree with it? Earlier I gave an illustration from
this House of a Minister on this side blaming the previous Government
for whatever is the cause of the difficulty. Certainly such a view
could be reasonably anticipated to cause annoyance on the other
Benches—one has seen it often enough. The difficulty is in
relation to the definition and to the absence of any safeguards which
would prevent the application of that definition to inappropriate
circumstances. There are various ways in which this might be approached
and I strongly urge your Lordships to support this amendment unless my
noble friend is able to indicate that these matters will be considered
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000125">I
understand that the Government do not intend this to apply, for
example, to street preachers, but the problem is that the definition as
stated would, for the reasons which we have heard, quite clearly
encompass that kind of conduct. The idea that guidance can deal with
this seems to be quite aside from the real difficulty, because I do not
believe that guidance can alter the substantial issue raised by the
statute. The idea of the Home Office giving guidance to the courts
strikes me as a slightly difficult concept for the courts to accept.
Apart from the kind of interpretation which is given as a result of
statements made in this House when an amendment is put forward,
guidance to the courts by the Executive would be regarded as being of a
rather doubtful constitutional propriety. Unless something can be done
to alter this definition or the circumstances of its application, I
urge your Lordships to support this amendment if, in due course, the
noble Lord, Lord Dear, decides to test the opinion of the

I can remember the Home Office has been bringing forward ill
thought-out proposals with little regard for the consequences.
Parliament scrutinises them, and they are from time to time defeated.
I, like the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=1520?>thought that some lessons would have been learnt from our
debate on “insulting”. I fear that from time
to time the Home Office does not fulfil its purpose as the
guardian of our liberties and a watchtower against the infringement of
those liberties. I can go back a long time. Over the decades,
Parliament has been concerned with loads of proposals of this kind
which have not been thought out because they emerge from the fortress
mentality of the Home Office, which imprisons so many Home Secretaries
of all parties.</hs_para>

wholeheartedly with the need for a careful balance. This proposal,
including the Government’s amendment, is the wrong side of that

by the courts and in its application. “Nuisance or
annoyance” is such an elastic term that it could, if it were
applied widely, be used as open-ended machinery to catch all sorts of
people who really should not be before the courts. Somebody with a
placard saying that the end of the world is nigh, a preacher or maybe a
politician on the street during an election may well be caught because
they will certainly cause annoyance to someone. Are those the kinds of
people that we want to haul before the
courts?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000129">The
Government say that their formula is hallowed and supported by 15 years

tested only within the narrow confines of housing-related cases, and
there are limitations on who can bring such actions. Like all former
constituency Members, I have experience of dealing with housing
problems. I can affirm that there is sometimes a need for strong action
to be taken in cases where people are stable and cannot move. You have
to do something to try to remedy that situation. There may be strong
arguments for a lower threshold there, but to extend that lower
threshold in a situation which has been tested only in the housing
section is a bridge too far.</hs_para>

include a requirement that anti-social behaviour had to be established

this a realistic fear? First, it must be remembered that under Clause 4
the applications can be made only by an agency—for example a
local authority, a housing provider or some other such body. That is a
defence against inappropriate use. It means that a victim of
anti-social behaviour has to go through the filter of a hard-working
agency in order to establish the fact that there is sufficient basis to
seek an anti-social behaviour order—or, in this case, an IPNA.
If it were to be done on the say-so of one individual deciding, perhaps
unreasonably or capriciously, that someone else had been guilty of
anti-social behaviour, that indeed might be objectionable. But the use

Of course, judges are used to weighing up hearsay

rather than the much more drastic step of eviction. Although an IPNA
can be obtained on the balance of probabilities, with or without the

to be surmounted appears to be lower, so there is a two-tier test for
anti-social behaviour, depending on whether you are a private tenant or
are in social housing, where an injunction is much more easily
obtained. That is hardly a satisfactory distinction, and I wonder how

about to move out of No. 11 with his red briefcase to announce a Budget
to a particularly unstartled world when we discovered that a man was
standing amid the cameras dressed in a full union jack outfit with a
notice saying “John Reid for Prime Minister”. It was
reported to me, as commissioner, that the Chancellor was likely to be
annoyed; it was pointed out to me in very firm terms that the putative
Lord Reid was going to be extremely annoyed; and, as the commissioner,
I was annoyed because the Home Secretary was annoyed, but nobody used
the terms “harassment”, “distress” or
“alarm”.</hs_para>

Phillips of Sudbury (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, a point that has not
been made sufficiently—I think that the noble Lord, Lord Dear,
referred to it in his very admirable opening speech—is the extra
burden that passing Clause 1 unamended would impose on the police and
local authorities. No one should underestimate that. If the only
gateway for getting redress for annoying conduct, which I think we all
agree is so low a test as 
<?notus-xml column=1528?>to be almost meaningless, is via a local authority or the police, does
anyone really believe that they will not be subject to a mass of
citizen inquiries and applications? Of course they will. Indeed, many
people who might be thought a little obsessive will no doubt badger the
poor local police endlessly until they get what they call
redress—that is, an application by the police for an injunction
under Clause 4. Apart from all the more important civil libertarian
aspects of this issue, we should not forget the potential extra
burden—and, I suggest, vexatious burden a lot of the
time—that will inevitably result from Clause 1 going through

Howarth of Newport (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Faulks, was right in this, at least in drawing attention to the scourge
of anti-social behaviour. When I represented the constituency of
Newport East I was all the time aware that there were households and,
indeed, communities whose lives were very seriously blighted by
anti-social behaviour. There is enormous political pressure on MPs

course, amplified by the

unthinkable that we should risk introducing legislation that could
impair the rights of people to go on demonstrations, as my noble friend
Lady Mallalieu offered as an instance, or of kids playing football in

asked: is it a realistic fear that people would be subject to IPNAs for
trivial and inadequate reasons? He offered the thought that the
requirement that applications would have to be made through an official
public agency should be seen as a filter and a safeguard.
The vast majority of public officials handle their responsibilities
fairly, properly, scrupulously and reasonably. I hate to say
this, but it is also, surely, an observation that all of us have made
that if you put a man in uniform, or if you vest a person in official
authority, some will find themselves tempted, and succumb to the
temptation, to use power overweeningly. We have to be very careful

noble Lord says, further, that guidance will be offered to these
agencies so, again, we do not really have cause to worry. I am sure
that the guidance will be a force in the right direction, but guidance
is only guidance; it is flimsy and an insufficient protection. The much
better protection would be not to write this risk into law. He offers a
much more reassuring protection—that such injunctions could be
made only at the discretion of a judge and that we can rely upon the
judges to exercise common sense, decency and appropriate restraint and
to be animated by a mature and wise sense of justice. In that case, why
legislate? We do not need to do this. We can rely on the judges not to
order injunctions against people who are merely guilty of causing
trivial annoyance. It does not seem sensible, in the present
circumstances in which the resources of the courts have been very
attenuated, to add this burden to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000197">I agree

particular to the point made by my noble friend Lord Faulks about MPs
on all sides of the House complaining about and explaining the
anti-social behaviour that some of their constituents face. As an MP of
some 26 years’ standing, I can tell him that that is absolutely
right: any MP worth his or her salt could give him numerous examples of
anti-social behaviour and of the sense of inadequacy and frustration
over the law seeming not to apply in those circumstances. However, one
of the strengths of our bicameral arrangement is that this, your
Lordships’ House, can consider such matters in a slightly
different frame from the pressured one of representing constituents,
some of whom are hard done by because of the law of the land. This
House has the opportunity to reflect on the broader principles and
bigger issues. This House sets the framework that, just occasionally,
the House of Commons has not managed to get around to addressing
because of the other pressures that Members of Parliament legitimately
face. This is an opportunity for us to behave in a way that is in the

my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay illustrated the ability to

Carswell (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, noble Lords who have spoken in
favour of this amendment have produced a gamut of compelling reasons
why your Lordships should support it. I will briefly focus on one
aspect of the amendment and the original draft as produced to your
Lordships, that of the court that has to interpret and apply the
provisions, a function of which I have had fairly long experience in my
time. The words “nuisance” and “annoyance”
are what a distinguished jurisprudent called “weasel
words”. They are highly subjective and are liable to be
interpreted by different people in different ways, which is a recipe
for judicial inconsistency and an invitation to those who wish to
oppose people expressing opinions that they dislike. In my experience,
that would be certain to lead to litigation and to further harassment
through the
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:18:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010845000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010845000206">I

are the courts to carry out their function of interpreting and applying

shoes of a judge, it is worth remembering that a lot of these cases,
perhaps a large majority, will come before junior courts, which have
neither the time nor the resources to enter into long jurisprudential
arguments. I have long maintained that judges should be given
discretion and that, whatever the legislation is, it should not
circumscribe the discretion of a judge too closely but should leave a
modicum of room for the judge to come to a proper conclusion on the
facts of the instant case. However, this should operate within the
parameters of reasonable certainty of the law. The principles that a

the outset that I think everybody who has spoken wants to see effective

cope. It creates total misery.</hs_para>

anti-social behaviour orders were brought in they created a significant
change in the way such cases were dealt with. There were teething
problems but experience has shown that they are an important tool in
tackling such serious problems. That is why I just do not understand
why the Government are embarking on such a dramatic change in this
legislation. Obviously, improvements can always be made to any system

experience and knowledge than I who have spoken have come to the same
conclusion. As we have heard, the concern is that the
Government’s new proposed threshold for granting an injunction
for engaging or threatening to engage in causing nuisance or annoyance
to any person on the balance of probabilities if the court considers it
to be just and convenient is too vague and too broad. The noble and
learned Lord, Lord Morris, described it as open-ended machinery that
would catch people who should not be before the courts. The danger is
that in the rush of those being brought before the courts for nuisance

distress and alarm.</hs_para>

about how this power could be used and abused were raised at Second
Reading and in Committee. In preparing for this debate, I started to

Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, described it as an extraordinary power, and
indeed it is. I appreciate and welcome the experienced and
knowledgeable legal views but this is not just a legal issue. It is a
moral issue of dealing with those people who are suffering the most.
The Government are not targeting the behaviour causing the most serious
problems but creating a catch-all clause that could affect almost
everybody at some point. There is no doubt that some people and some
activities inevitably cause some degree of nuisance and annoyance.
However, is an injunction, which in most cases will be pretty weak and
ineffective—although at the extreme end it 
<?notus-xml column=1537?>could involve custody—the most appropriate way of dealing with
these cases, or should we accept that in our everyday lives some level
of nuisance or annoyance is a consequence of ensuring the liberty and
freedom of the individual? Liberty and freedom are not open ended.
There have to be constraints and the test of harassment, alarm and
distress spoken about today is the appropriate point to place those
constraints.</hs_para>

“just and convenient”. I accept his assessment of the
value and usefulness of that. If the boisterous behaviour to which I
referred is ongoing and causes harassment, alarm or distress, then
action obviously has to be taken. But as it stands, even with the
government amendment, a one-off event that causes nuisance or annoyance
to any person on the balance of probabilities would still lead to
injunction.</hs_para>

in the Bill is harm referred to? Guidance is not legislation. The

the Bill. Noble Lords who were defending the
Government’s position, when asked whether they could give
examples of activities that would come under the Bill’s
definition of nuisance and annoyance but not cause alarm, harassment
and distress, were unable to do so. Every example they gave of where
action should be taken caused harassment, alarm and distress. It is
quite clear that the existing legislation is the best way to define the
kind of behaviour that is disrupting

Reading and in Committee of the great concern in your Lordships’
House, the Government did not come back today with something a bit
better than the amendment being put forward. There are serious concerns
about this, not just because it would catch too many people but because
those who are really causing distress in our communities will not be
the focus in tackling problems. I urge the Minister to accept the
amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dear. The only compromise that
would be acceptable today would be if the Minister were to say that he
accepts that there has to be a change of definition and that he can
assure us that that would be “harassment, alarm and

important part of the Government’s reforms, and I begin by
acknowledging that there has been some common ground on the need to

the elements that we need to include in Clause 1 to make it effective.
First, I am glad that the civil standard of proof for the
new injunction has been accepted by so many noble Lords. Secondly, I
welcome the tacit acceptance of the “just and convenient”
limb of the test for an injunction. The noble and learned Lord, Lord
Carswell, said that this is a proper consideration for courts in any
case, but it is right that we should make it explicit as one of the
limbs of the test.</hs_para>

1, as compared with the amendments put forward in Committee, are a

listened to the concerns expressed by noble Lords in Committee and by
the Constitution Committee and the Joint Committee on Human Rights, and
that is why I have tabled Amendment 2, which we believe addresses the
concerns about the breadth of the “nuisance or annoyance”
test. Although Amendment 2 is not part of this group, it addresses
exactly the same issue—the appropriate form of the test for the
grant of an injunction—and, accordingly, it is important that
your Lordships consider Amendments 1 and 2 together.</hs_para>

Dear:</Member></B> My Lords, we have been detained for something over
two hours and I shall take no more than a couple of minutes of your
Lordships’ time to say what I have to say. First, I sincerely
thank all those who have spoken in this debate, particularly the
three signatories to my amendment and the Minister, who has
had to sit through a varied and interesting
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010852000040">Secondly,
I want to pick up on the chilling effect. The experience with the word
“insulting” in the Public Order Act is sufficient in
itself to indicate what front-line practitioners will do. Governed as
they are by very
well-oiled<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>
complaints machinery, they will undoubtedly be faced with many examples
when a set of circumstances are produced for them, and they will be
virtually pressurised into taking some sort of action, to pursue the
case and push it through to the courts to decide. That is the easy
option, and it is what happened all too often with
“insulting”. To take an exercise in discretion and turn
around to the complainant and say, “Frankly, I think we should
let this one go by”, is not an option that they will take
willingly. That is undoubtedly why the Association of Chief Police
Officers as one group has said that it thinks that “nuisance and
annoyance” is wrong and that we should stay with the well tried
formula of “harassment, alarm or
distress”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010852000041">The
choice between those two wordings is the pivotal point of the
legislation—the absolute foundation on which everything else
hangs. We can talk for as long as we like about reasonable, just,
convenient, necessary and all those adjectives, and try to make it work
but, if the pivot does not work, all the rest falls away. The pivot
suggested by the Government is “nuisance and annoyance”.
We have no knowledge of what will happen if that comes into play, but
we know what will happen with “harassment, alarm or
distress”; it is well proven, well tried and respected, and has
never been faulted. To move way from that is a step into the
dark.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0001.htm#14010852000042">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:57:29"></hs_TimeCode>
have had no examples whatever of the sort of conduct that
“nuisance and annoyance” seeks, rightly, to address. I
pay great tribute to the Minister, for whom I have a huge liking and
respect, but unless he can satisfy me—and I suspect that this is
the case with others in the Chamber, from what I pick up from the
atmosphere—that he is willing to move immediately to
“harassment, alarm or distress”, I must seek to divide
the House. I invite him to respond to
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:57:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

concerned, if I go into discussions between now and Third Reading, all
the aspects that the noble Lord has related in his speech, and those
expressed by other noble Lords around the House, will be on the table.
I do not want to prejudge the outcome of those discussions. All that I
can say is that I wish to make sure that when we come back to Third
Reading we have a House that can unite behind legislation on this
issue. I do not think that that is an unreasonable expectation, and I

Committee, Clause 1(5)(a) was the subject of some debate. It and the
related provision in Clause 21 have also been a subject between the
Home Office and the Joint Committee on Human Rights. Essentially, this
provision places a duty on the court to avoid, as far as practicable,
imposing prohibitions or requirements in an injunction or a criminal
behaviour order which would conflict with the respondent’s
religious
beliefs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000050">The
Government have consistently maintained that this provision related to
the manifestation of the respondent’s religious beliefs, rather
than to the religious belief per se. However, for the avoidance of
doubt, we have decided not to remove the provision from the Bill, on
the basis that the courts would in any event, by virtue of the
operation of the Human Rights Act, be bound to consider whether the
proposed prohibitions or requirements were compatible with the
respondent’s convention rights, including but not limited to the
right to the freedom of religion. I beg to

Earl of Lytton (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I can
quite understand the reason why this particular safeguard or defence in
injunctive procedures is to be removed. The noble Lord may rest assured
that I am with him as far as the argument goes. I have written to his
noble friend and had an answer this morning pointing out
that, in normal civil injunctive proceedings, there
are a significant number of available
defences—depending on how one counts them, 15 or 20 or more. The
Bill as it stands would have allowed for three; this will reduce it to
two.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000052">I still
do not understand, because in his letter to me—which I thank him
very much for, and for keeping me in the loop on correspondence
generally to do with this Bill—the noble Lord, Lord Taylor,
merely said that he did not agree with me. He did not explain why in
one set of civil injunctive proceedings under this Bill there will
remain two defences, but in any other injunctive proceedings there will
be 15 or more. That seems a two-tier approach, so what is the direction

friend is seeking to argue that it is not enough to be able to
establish, in the case of the injunction, that the conduct in question
could reasonably be expected to cause nuisance or annoyance but that it
should also be necessary to show that the conduct was unreasonable in
the circumstances. My noble friend has pointed to the reasonableness
defence in Section 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which applies
to the ASBO on application, although it is worth noting that no such
defence is contained in Section 1C of that Act, which relates to the
ASBO on conviction. I am sympathetic to the point that she raised and I

the injunction. As my noble friend will be aware, the second condition
that must be satisfied is that the court considers that it is
“just and convenient” to grant an injunction for the
purpose of preventing the respondent from engaging in anti-social
behaviour. As I have already indicated, in applying this limb of the
test, the court will look at whether it is reasonable and proportionate
in the circumstances of the case to grant an injunction. It will be
open to the respondent to argue that he or she had a good reason for
his or her conduct. The court will weigh that up against the evidence
submitted by the applicant and come to a view. If the court is
satisfied that the reason put forward by the respondent is a sound one,
I fully expect it to conclude that it will not be just and convenient
to grant an injunction. Therefore, the defence is, in practice,
inherent in the drafting of Clause 1 as it
stands.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000065">In the
case of the criminal behaviour order, it is again important to look at
the wider context in which the court will apply the test in Clause 21.
The same public law principles of reasonableness and proportionality
will apply. It would therefore be open to the offender to argue that
there were reasonable grounds for the conduct in question, which the
court would then consider alongside the evidence presented by the Crown
Prosecution Service.</hs_para>

is no reasonableness defence in Section 1C of the Crime and Disorder
Act 1998, which provides for ASBOs on conviction—the forerunner
to the criminal behaviour order. That section does, however, stipulate
that the court may consider evidence 
<?notus-xml column=1550?>presented by the prosecution or the defence, which

addition, it is worth pointing out that, in deciding whether to apply
for a criminal behaviour order, the Crown Prosecution Service would
need to be satisfied that there was sufficient evidence to provide a
realistic prospect of obtaining an order and that it was in the public
interest to apply for an order. The prosecution would therefore
consider any evidence which showed that the conduct of the respondent
was reasonable in the
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000068">In
short, the point made by my noble friend is well made. I assure her

this reassurance, I do not believe that these amendments are necessary

Earl of Listowel (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I will
speak also to the other amendments in my name in this group. Amendments
12 and 13 to Schedule 2, and Amendments 34 and 35 to Clause 37, seek to
remove imprisonment as a sanction for children breaching their IPNAs or
failing to comply with police dispersal orders respectively. Schedule 2
provides for supervision orders to be made against children breaching
their IPNAs. This is adequate for dealing with children of all ages.
There is no need to introduce detention as an additional sanction for
over-14s. The case for why this is necessary has not been made. Will
the Minister explain why this is seen by the Government as
necessary?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000080">Amendment
34 removes imprisonment as a sanction for children failing to comply
with a police dispersal order. Amendment 35 sets out a range of
alternative sanctions for such children. These measures aim to ensure
that the discretion of the court is not fettered. I am grateful to the
Minister for allowing us an opportunity to meet yesterday to discuss my
concerns in this area. I will come to my final Amendment 86 in this
group, which is on youth services, when I have discussed the other
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000081">There
are two key reasons why imprisonment should not be available for
children breaching their IPNA or failing to comply with a police
dispersal order or power. First, imprisonment is expensive,
ineffective and counterproductive. In 2010-11 the reoffending rate for
children leaving custody was 72.6%. Youth custody is expensive. The
average cost of a place at a secure training centre is £178,000
per annum. There is clear evidence to suggest that for many children,
incarceration increases the risk of recidivism. Imprisoning children,
even for a short period, can introduce them to criminal networks that
become impossible to escape
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000082">I fear
that we may be introducing more children to schools of crime and
preparing them for later universities of crime. I have visited many
young offender institutions and secure training centres. I visited
Feltham young offender institution 13 or 15 years ago, and
then visited 
<?notus-xml column=1554?>it recently with a number of chief executives from London local
authorities and the chair of the Youth Justice Board, Frances Done. It
was striking how much things had changed in that time. Thanks to this
Government, there are far fewer young people in custody, which is very
much to be welcomed. Those young people who are left are very
challenging, tough and difficult to work with. In the Bill, we are
considering bringing in some young people—children—who
have not even committed a crime to spend three months or so in
detention with these very hard nuts. Do we really want to mix such
children with such
children?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000083">From
that visit to Feltham young offender institution, the concern of the
chief executives of the local authorities in London about gang violence
also became clear. We heard a transformation from my first visit to
Feltham. No longer were two young people getting into a fight with one
young person, but 13, 14 or 15 young men would be attacking one or two
boys because they were not in the right gang. It was important for the
secure estate to know from the local authorities which gangs their
particular boys came from, so that they could manage the risks around
that.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14010852000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000168">6.45

also a concern that we are bringing into these conditions young people
who may not be a member of the right gang and may be victimised because
of that. If they are not a member of a gang, one can speculate that
they will be by the end of their time in the secure estate, because
they will need to be to survive. I am very concerned about introducing
more young people into the secure estate, given how much risk for them
is involved and how detrimental for us it might be for them to have
that
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000085">The
second main reason for opposing imprisonment is that it is a severe and
anomalous punishment that may be incompatible with the UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child. Allowing children to be imprisoned for IPNA
breach or non-compliance with a police dispersal power is inconsistent
with how prison is used in the wider youth justice system. In the
criminal justice system, children are imprisoned only for the most
serious offences or for persistent offending. Failure to comply with a
police dispersal order is only a minor offence. IPNA breach is a civil
offence—a contempt of court. This Bill introduces for the first
time detention for children who are in contempt of court for minor
civil wrongs. Currently the law does not allow this to happen, except
in very limited circumstances.</hs_para>

children for IPNA breach or failure to comply with a police dispersal
order is not consistent with the UK’s obligations as a signatory
of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. Article 37
of UNCRC states that children should be imprisoned only as a
“measure of last resort”. The United Nations standard
minimum rules for the administration of juvenile justice—the
Beijing Rules—state
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14010852000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000153">“Deprivation

the Minister that Amendment 86, on youth services and the
duty on local authorities to secure appropriate services to prevent
young people from being involved in anti-social behaviour, is merely a
probing amendment. I would like to see the Minister attending to and
looking at the statutory guidance for local authorities on services and
activities to improve young people’s well-being. I support the
broad principle set out in the guidance and acknowledge the reference
there to youth work, and to young people’s personal and social
development. However, the guidance is so broad in its interpretation
that all local authorities are able to say that they are meeting some
of these requirements so far as is reasonably practicable. Because the
guidance says specifically that government will not prescribe which
services and activities for young people local authorities should fund
or deliver, or to what level, I am sure that more than ever the level
of support that young people get access to is determined by where they
live.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000089">Last
year, spending on youth services declined by 10% overall. Spending on
getting young people off drugs and alcohol declined by 18%. If we are
to be serious about preventing anti-social behaviour—and
especially if we are talking about putting young people in custody
because of their anti-social behaviour—it is important that we
ensure that we have the vital youth services that will prevent this
behaviour. This is a healthier and more civilised way of intervening
with these young people, and it is well evidenced in preventing such
behaviour. I would appreciate the Minister’s assurance that he
will look at the guidance and consider whether it might be tightened to
some degree to ensure that adequate youth services are

vice-chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children and Young
People in Care. He began life as a social worker and managed a
children’s home. He tabled in the other place an amendment to
the Children and Families Bill that is currently proceeding through
this House, which the Government eventually accepted. It is described
as one of the most important changes for looked after children in a
generation and allows young people to remain in foster care with their
foster carers until the age of 21, where they choose to do so. The
Government are supporting that with £40 million for
its implementation. He also worked very hard to introduce special
financial provision for looked after young people and did much other

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the
noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for his generous and kind comments, which we
appreciate, for our former colleague Paul Goggins. He was an
exceptional MP and, for those who knew him and were very
fond him, he was an exceptional person as well. We are very sad to lose

the amendments, rather along the lines of the issues raised by my noble
friend Lord Harris of Haringey, perhaps I may ask some questions about
dispersal orders. The extension of dispersal orders that the Government
are proposing seems quite strange. Previously, dispersal orders were
for 24 hours, with democratic oversight in consultation with the local
authority, and covered a restrained geographical area. That has changed
because under the Government’s proposals they are for 48 hours
with a much wider geographical area. There is no involvement of the
local authority but there is the involvement of a member of the police
force of the rank of inspector or
above<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T18:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recall that we discussed in Committee the lack of clarity around the
operation of dispersal orders. A number of questions were put to the
Minister but we did not get answers then. Given this extension and the
change in how the Government want dispersal orders to operate, it is a
concern that the detention, particularly for young children, would
remain for a much broader and wider offence about which we have had
very little information, and I read the debate again today. It raises
some questions for the Minister to answer. Why does he think that these
dispersal orders are appropriate? Does he think it likely that, because
of the wider area, the increased length of time and the fact that there
is no democratic oversight, we shall see more dispersal orders? Is it
appropriate in those cases that we may see more breaches of
them?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000105">It
raises a concern that something as minor as a dispersal order, which
can be issued by a police offer on the spur of the moment, when there
is not really a process in the way we would expect, could lead to
detention. The extension of how the Government are planning to use
dispersal orders in the future, retaining detention for young people if
there is a breach, gives rise to concern. Will the Minister explain why
he thinks it appropriate, how he thinks it will be used and on how many
occasions? I am concerned that we may see an increase in dispersal
orders. I am very unhappy about the Government’s proposals in
any case, but if we see an increase there could be an increased number 
<?notus-xml column=1558?>of breaches and we could then see detention of young
people. Will the Minister explain how this will operate and why he
thinks it is
appropriate?</hs_para><hs_time UID="14010852000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000169">7

very grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, for tabling these
amendments. It is right and proper that we consider these matters. His
amendments raise important issues about whether detention is
appropriate for someone aged under 18, and we debated this at some

productive meeting yesterday and I hope that I will be able to answer
some of the points made by the noble Earl and other noble
Lords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000108">The
Government strongly support the use of informal interventions and
rehabilitative approaches, particularly when dealing with young people.
That is at the heart of our overall approach to anti-social behaviour.
However, detention must be available to the court if the new injunction
is to act as an effective deterrent and to protect victims and
communities in the most serious cases. When we consulted on the new
anti-social behaviour powers, 57% of those who responded were in favour
of the breach sanctions for the injunction for under-18s. Only 22%
disagreed, with only a further 4% against any custody for
under-18s.</hs_para>

court order and must be supported by tough sanctions to ensure
compliance. However, in contrast to anti-social behaviour orders,
under-18s will not be unnecessarily criminalised and saddled with a
criminal record for breach. However, it is only in the most serious or
persistent cases of breach that a court may detain someone aged under
18. Schedule 2 to the Bill makes clear that a court may not detain a
young person for breach of an
IPNA,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14010852000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000162">“unless

case, the court may impose a supervision order on a young person and
Part 2 of Schedule 2 to the Bill sets out a number of non-custodial
requirements that can be attached to such an order. The relevant
requirements are a supervision requirement, an activity requirement or
a curfew requirement. These are three of the requirements which may be
attached to a youth rehabilitation order, the youth equivalent of a

would expect the youth courts to do all they can to ensure that a young
person’s rehabilitation is effective. In making any decision to
make a detention order, the court must consult with the youth offending
team and inform any other body or individual the applicant thinks

must give its reasons in open court. The availability of custody as a
sanction in exceptional cases reflects the current position as regards
the anti-social behaviour order on application. Indeed, breach of an
ASBO on application attracts a maximum penalty of five years’
imprisonment as well as a criminal record.</hs_para>

Administration took the view that there needed to be effective
sanctions for breach up to and including imprisonment, including in
cases involving young people. While it was generous of the noble Earl
to congratulate the previous Government on this aspect of their policy,
we do not believe that they got the balance quite right between
punishment and rehabilitation. That is why we are treating breach of
the IPNA as a contempt of court rather than as a criminal offence: we
believe that they were right to include the option of custody for both
adults and juveniles. To remove that option for juveniles would
significantly weaken the effectiveness of the injunction and thereby
weaken the protection we are seeking to afford to the victims of
anti-social behaviour.</hs_para>

their expertise and will be informed by the relevant youth offending

months. That means that where the maximum term of imprisonment that
could be imposed is less than four months, as is the case here, a
detention and training order is not an option in relation to a juvenile
offender. The court will be left with the options of a youth

86, the final amendment in this group, seeks to place a new
responsibility on local authorities to provide youth services to
prevent young people becoming involved in anti-social behaviour. This
obligation is already effectively provided for by the Crime and
Disorder Act 1998, which places a responsibility on local authorities
to formulate and implement a strategy for the reduction of crime and
disorder in their area, where crime and disorder includes anti-social
behaviour and youth anti-social behaviour. That Act includes a
responsibility for local authorities to keep the strategy under review,
monitor its effectiveness and alter it accordingly. Local authorities
must ensure that their strategy focuses on the types of problem in
their area, based on an analysis of local levels and patterns of crime
and disorder, and the misuse of drugs and alcohol. Therefore, if an
area has a particular problem with youth anti-social behaviour, the
local authority has a responsibility to put measures in place to reduce
the problem. I would expect this to include preventive measures. In
addition, the Children Act 1989 places an obligation on local
authorities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their
area who are in need and to promote the upbringing of such children by
their families by providing a range and level of services appropriate
to those children’s needs. This includes services to prevent
young people becoming involved in anti-social behaviour, crime and
disorder, as well as services to support those young people and their
families who become involved in anti-social behaviour or
crime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010852000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010852000122">I

Haringey. I am grateful to the Minister for his careful reply,
particularly for giving some detail about the training of the judiciary
and other people in contact with young people in this
regard. That is terribly important and a place where we fall down to
some extent. Again, I encourage the Government to think
about the use of mentors in this kind of training of professionals
working around young people. It is so important to develop
an understanding of young people in front-line police officers who work
on a beat and regularly come into contact with such young people, and
other workers. Allowing and supporting them to become mentors to a
young person for a period of three to six months, and helping them to
reflect on that and how it works, benefits them but also benefits the
young person who often needs that kind of

Minister made a number of other interesting and helpful points. I
express some concern about the placements—the disposals, if you
like—within the secure estate. Because of the
Government’s success in reducing the number of young people in
custody, a number of secure children’s homes have been shut
down. I am not sure if the secure training centres have also
shut—I think places in them have been reduced. The courts have
less range and freedom in choosing disposals. Sometimes, they will
simply be driven to choose what is available, even for a fairly
vulnerable young person. One recalls the suicide of a young person who
was recognised as being vulnerable but was sent to a secure training
centre because there was no space available in a children’s
home. Shortly after that, he hanged himself. That was about five years
ago. There are difficult decisions to be made. This is an area we will

safeguarding duties and other legislation that allows for a child to be

local councils already have duties under the Children Act 1989 to

committing serious anti-social behaviour to the extent that agencies
are considering applying for an injunction with the power to exclude
that young person from their home, the local council should first
consider whether the child is “in need” under the
Children Act and if so provide appropriate support as an alternative to
simply excluding a young person from their home. A Part 1 injunction
could still play a role in transforming the young person’s life
as well as protecting victims from further anti-social behaviour.
However, if removing them from the family home is considered necessary,
this should be done under existing legislation and not just be seen as
a chance to disperse the problem to another
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000003">I do not
believe that this change will weaken agencies’ ability to deal
with anti-social behaviour caused by minors. Agencies can still apply
for an injunction to stop the young person’s behaviour and the
court can attach a power of arrest to the order in cases where an
individual has either been violent or threatened violence when
committing or threatening anti-social behaviour, or where there is a
risk of significant harm to another person by that individual. The
power of arrest will act as a deterrent and allow the police to take
swift action to protect the victim or communities if the injunction is
breached. Of course, youth offending teams will play an important role
in identifying the problems that drive the young person’s
behaviour and measuring the risk they pose to others to ensure that the
right action is taken. However, we accept that excluding a young person
from their home using an injunction will not be the right action and I
therefore commend the amendment to the House. I beg to

Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, sought to challenge Clause 13
on the grounds that its provisions were not tenure-neutral. As I have
indicated, Clause 13 simply preserves an existing power
available to social landlords under Section 153D of the Housing
Act 1996. That section, which, I might add, was inserted
into the Housing Act by the previous Administration in 2003, responded
to calls from social landlords that they needed to be able
to hold their tenant responsible for the behaviour of visitors.
However, strictly speaking, Clause 13 is not necessary, as
an injunction under Clause 1 can be used to achieve the same end of
holding the respondent responsible for the anti-social behaviour of the
visitors to their property, regardless of
tenure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000007">We

Children should not have this stamp on them from such a young age

edge of care. The familial experience—the father often absent
from the home, often violence in the home, often alcohol or other
substance misuse in the home—has left many of them feeling
deeply worthless and very guilty about themselves. We all know, I
think, that when a young person sees a parent desert them, they do not
think, “This is a very irresponsible adult”; they think,
“What have I done to drive this person away from me?”.
The risk is that, by the state coming along and publicising their name
in the newspaper as a bad boy, they will think, “Yes, look, even
the local newspaper thinks that I am useless, worthless, a bad boy and
there is no good in me”. That is one area of concern for
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010860000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010860000021">The other
is that when these young people grow up in a family where there is
little love or attention and they are not listened to, sometimes, if
they cannot get any fame, at least notoriety—their ability to be
notorious—is something that they can chase after. If they will
not be listened to in their home or anywhere else or given attention in
school, at least if they cause a lot of aggravation they can see their
photograph in the local newspaper. There are real reasons to be
concerned about this. I am very grateful to the right reverend Prelate

the right reverend Prelate said, the existing provisions are not
absolute. I have some questions for the Minister arising from them.
Given that there is currently discretion to allow reporting that is in
the public interest, and given the public policy underlying the Bill,
would that not be a strong indicator to the court on how to view the
public interest test? Would not reversing it, so that the individual is
named unless the court decides otherwise—apart from the
consequences for the individual; I entirely take the points that have
been made—mean additional process for the courts?</hs_para>

Hope of Craighead (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I add
just a word based on my experience of how these things are
dealt with in the courts. The advantage of the present rule is that a
uniform rule applies throughout the country and avoids the
problem, which is commonplace in the courts, of different practices in
different areas and different judges taking different views. The
uniformity of the rule is one
advantage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010860000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010860000028">The
second point, which the noble Baroness just mentioned, is that it is
essential, if a reporting restriction is to be effective, that it be
asked for at the beginning. There is always a risk that somebody nips
out of the court before the order is made and the damage is then done
but the individual can say, “I wasn’t there when the
order was made”. To be effective, it has to be made at the
start<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:38:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

representation. I do not want to go into the issues about
legal aid, which are not a matter for this debate, but there would be
concern that people who are not very experienced and not attuned to all
the matters raised by the right reverend Prelate fail to take the
point. My impression is that if the point is taken as eloquently as the
right reverend Prelate made it, the court would be very slow not to
make an order unless there were compelling reasons for refusing the
application, but it requires an application to be made, because I
suspect that a court will not take the initiative without
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010860000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010860000030">Those

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be brief. The Minister has been
asked a number of relevant questions and I am sure that noble Lords
will be waiting to hear the responses. In particular, do the Government
anticipate that their proposal, with provision for suspending Section
49 of the 1933 Act, is likely to lead to a 
<?notus-xml column=1568?>significant increase in the number of children being
named as a result of that suspension of Section 49? Or do they take the
view that it will lead to very little increase at all because they
think that courts will regularly make decisions—an active
choice—not to name the child in question? The question has
already been asked about the Government’s intentions, not in
respect of numbers or an exact figure, but whether they are looking for
a significant increase in the number of children named. Is that the
purpose of this? Or is their view that even though they are making the
change, it may not make a great deal of difference because the courts
are more likely to look at this matter and make the active choice not
to name the child in question?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010860000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010860000032">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:49:54"></hs_TimeCode>
answer may be that it is already covered in the draft guidance. I have
not looked at the guidance to see if it is. However, if it is not
already in the guidance, is it the intention that the guidance which
will be issued to professionals will say anything about making
applications to courts for children not to be named where professionals
are directly involved? If it is not in the guidance is it the intention
that it should be put in that guidance, and what in fact would it
say?</hs_para>

will leave it at that; the concerns have been expressed about this.
Obviously<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:49:54"></hs_TimeCode> there
are already circumstances where children can be named as far as
legislation is concerned, and I do not want to pretend that that is not
the case. Clearly the Government were expecting that numbers of IPNAs
would be issued and, therefore, that that might have an effect on the
numbers of children being named. Whether that would still be the case
in light of the amendment that has now been carried will remain to be
seen. Nevertheless IPNAs will still be around, and that may lead to an
increase in the numbers of children being named. It would be helpful to
know the Government’s stance. Is that what they are looking
for—or do they not see it making a great deal of difference?
Will they be giving advice to anybody? I know that they cannot give
advice to the courts, but will they give advice to professionals who
might be appearing in court in order to make sure that courts are
reminded at the very least that they do have this power to make the
decision that children should not be
named<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010860000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010860000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="14010860000089" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010860000089">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, this again has been a good

important part of these provisions. I thank the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds for presenting these amendments for our
discussion.</hs_para>

the House will know, the Government do indeed believe that there is a
need for reporting restrictions in respect of under-18s in certain
cases, where it is both necessary and proportionate to allow for
effective enforcement of an injunction or criminal behaviour order.
This will enable communities to play their part in ensuring that the
injunction and criminal behaviour order are effective in tackling
anti-social behaviour by alerting the police if the respondent or
offender breaches their conditions. Publicising the injunction and the
order in certain cases will provide reassurance and increase public
confidence in agencies’ willingness and in their ability to take
action against perpetrators of anti-social behaviour. Potential
perpetrators will be 
<?notus-xml column=1569?>deterred from committing anti-social behaviour due to reporting. So
while I understand the sentiment behind these amendments, I believe
that there is a strong case for maintaining the default position under
Clauses 17, 22 and 29. This mirrors the current position for
anti-social behaviour orders.</hs_para>

all these legitimate aims must be weighed against the effect on the
young person of making it known to their community that they have been
subject to a formal court order, albeit a civil one. That is why, as we
clarified in Committee, Section 39 of the Children and Young Persons
Act 1933 gives the court the discretion to prohibit publication of the
injunction or order. The courts are very well used to making such
sensitive decisions, having been dealing with such cases since the
reporting arrangements for ASBOs were changed by the Serious Organised
Crime and Police Act 2005. The consultation with the local youth
offending team will play an important role here. In this and other
respects, the Bill has made changes that enhance safeguards in respect
of the rights of young people, ensuring that they are always properly
considered. The Bill provides that the youth offending team must be
consulted before an application may be made for an injunction or a
criminal behaviour order. The team will give valuable insight into the
effect reporting would have on a young person, and allow more carefully
informed decision-making by the applicants and courts on this

learned Lord, Lord Hope of Craighead, for his contribution to this
debate. We are retaining the position as it applies to ASBOs as
introduced by the previous Government. We would not expect any change
of practice or frequency, as the relevant legislation was passed in
2005. We are not looking for any increase or decrease in the incidence
of reporting. This is a matter for practitioners on the one hand and
for the courts on the other. Perhaps I can reinforce the role of the
youth courts. It is worth pointing out that once these powers are in
place all applications for injunctions will be heard in the youth
courts, which is not currently the situation for ASBOs. The youth
courts are best placed for making such decisions and so this will
ensure that the right outcomes on reporting, for the offender and the
community, are achieved.</hs_para>

appropriately a matter of judicial discretion. I hope my noble friend
Lady Hamwee also accepts that point. There is a wealth of case law on
this issue which has upheld the legislation that allows for the
publicising of ASBOs made against under-18s. The case law makes it
clear that the reporting is sometimes necessary and gives guidance on
the factors that should be considered. It demonstrates that the
discretion given to courts can be exercised reasonably, proportionately
and in a way which respects a young person’s human rights. I can
help the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, on this. Our draft guidance makes
clear that local agencies must consider that it is necessary 
<?notus-xml column=1570?>and proportionate to interfere with the young
person’s right to privacy, and take account of whether it is
likely to affect a young person’s behaviour, with each case
decided carefully on its own facts. There is a paragraph in the draft
guidance on page 26. I do not propose to read it out but I hope that

victims and the communities in which they live. For this reason, I am

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:53:30"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords, I thank the House for this opportunity to raise the important
events which will take place in Glasgow this year on the occasion of
the 20th Commonwealth Games. I look forward to hearing the response
from the Government by the Minister after our short debate this
evening. I welcome those who have chosen to speak here tonight, and in
particular I welcome the maiden speech from my noble friend Lord
Haughey, who I am sure will be a welcome addition not only to this
debate tonight, as a Glasgow boy, but in the debates that we will have
in this House for many years to come.</hs_para>

breakfast meeting on 29 July 2002, after a few glorious days in
Manchester supporting Team Scotland at the Commonwealth Games. It was
in the immediate aftermath of Sir Chris Hoy’s first gold medal
the night before at the velodrome, when Louise Martin from Commonwealth
Games Scotland and I shook hands, having looked each other in the eye
and felt, “Yes, we could do this too”. We felt that not
just Manchester but Glasgow was capable of hosting the Commonwealth
Games and, 12 years on, it will be an immense pleasure to see the Games
come to
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:55:01"></hs_TimeCode>. In
those 12 years there have been many moments, both when in office and
after leaving it. I recall the bid presentations in Melbourne during
the Games there in March 2006, when the Nigerian bid for Abuja claimed
that it was a little bit of Scotland in Africa and therefore we should
stand aside for them. There was also the elation when, from Sri Lanka
in late 2007, it was announced that Scotland and Glasgow had achieved
this
success.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000023">In
July this year we will see 70 teams with 4,500 sports men and women
coming to Glasgow for 12 days of high-level sporting
activity and competition across 13 venues and 17 sports. It will
include a record five para sports where disabled competitors will take
part in the main event at a higher level than ever before. That has
been recognised as potentially the best ever representation in
Commonwealth Games history for that important aspect of these
multisport games.</hs_para>

well under way. Today the Queen’s baton relay is in Cameroon.
Ninety-two per cent of the tickets have been sold. The venues are not
only all ready but are all in use by the public, which is perhaps
unique for a multisport Games of this sort internationally. The venues
are already being used in a way that will ensure the legacy for the
future. The Clyde-siders, who are the Games volunteers, had 50,000
applications resulting in 15,000 successful volunteers being chosen.
They are currently being notified and are to welcome the thousands and
thousands of visitors to Glasgow and look after the competitors during
these 12 days in July and August. There is a cultural programme which
will include the first ever music biennial, with newly commissioned
works that will ensure that the city is promoted not only across
Scotland and the UK but worldwide as a centre for cultural excellence,
in addition to sporting excellence.</hs_para>

tremendous all-party effort, supported initially when my Sports
Minister, Patricia Ferguson MSP, was leading the bid in the early days
through to the now Scottish Government’s Sports Minister, Shona
Robison, who has seen through the implementation of the preparations.
This is at all levels of Scottish government—the city council,
which is clearly in the lead in all this, has played a key
role—and in successive Administrations. Of course, there has
been advice, assistance and support all along from London

the engagement of the UK Government, I hope that the Minister will
specifically address in his summing-up a few important issues where the
co-operation of the UK Government is important for the efficiency and
success of the Games. For example, on visas for athletes and their team
supporters, is the Home Office ready to ensure that that demand can be
met? In relation to security and protocol, will the appropriate
co-operation be in place to ensure that the Games run smoothly? Will
UKTI and other UK bodies support investment conferences in attempts to
ensure that the Games can maximise business interest in Scotland?
Crucially perhaps, after the last few weeks, will the UK weather
forecasting authorities keep everybody very well
informed?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000027">We
had three key objectives when we launched the bid a decade ago. One was
to showcase Glasgow and Scotland to the world as a venue for
international sporting events. The second was to ensure that there was
a lasting legacy in the city and beyond, both economically and
socially—and, crucially for Scotland’s and
Glasgow’s health, on a sporting basis. The third was to provide
a platform on which Scottish and other athletes could perform to the
highest level. As I have said, the venues are all in place. They
include some outstanding new venues that have already been used for
international competitive events. Those venues and the events
themselves have been recognised, with Glasgow’s ranking in
recent weeks as the ninth best venue in the world for international
sporting events. We can safely say that the Commonwealth Games this
year will not be the last international sporting event to be held in
Glasgow. The city has done a tremendous job, efficiently making sure
these venues are ready and that they are of the highest possible
international standard.</hs_para>

economic legacy for the east end of Glasgow and the regeneration of
that part of the city. There is an economic legacy in terms
of apprenticeships and a graduate training programme as well. There
will be an economic legacy in the promotion of Scotland as a
destination for tourists and for business. There is also a
crucial sporting legacy. Since the bid was secured, sporting
participation in the city has risen by 40%, using these new venues and
the fresh interest there has been. The potential for a sporting and
health-related legacy is clearly there and I am sure the city and the
Scottish Government will be focused on that in the months and years
following the Games. There is an important role for UNICEF, which has
been chosen as the major charity partner of the Games. It will be
raising funds before and during the Games to spend on sport and
realising the potential of young people, not just in Scotland but
critically across every country of the Commonwealth, supporting
projects that ensure that sport changes lives in the way that we know
it can.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000029">In
relation to performance, these stadia are going to be fantastic venues
to see some incredible performances. The new Emirates stadium includes
not just a marvellous velodrome named after Sir Chris Hoy but a
fantastic arena which will be used for other indoor sports as well. The
aquatic centre at Tollcross is world-class and recently hosted a
contest between the USA and Europe in swimming that was so competitive
it went to a swim-off. That is the first time I have ever heard of a
swim-off at an international swimming competition. It was so
competitive and energetic that it resulted in such an exciting
conclusion. The most recent venue to open is a new hockey centre, which
I hope will generate an interest in hockey among another generation of
young Scots, not just for the Games but far
beyond.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000030">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:36:29"></hs_TimeCode>
final point is that sport has the almost unique potential to unite
people in all kinds of different circumstances and to give people the
ambition and inspiration to realise their potential. It is really
important that in Scotland and Glasgow in July and August we use these
Games to their fullest potential to unite not just people there on the
spot but a generation in having ambitions for a better future. From the
very beginning these Games—the bid, the operation, the
organisation, the preparation and now their actual
execution—have been conducted on an all-party basis in Scotland
at all levels of government. Therefore, it is critical at a time when
Scotland faces a huge choice in September about its future that, for
that two-week period in July and August, the two contesting points of
view in Scotland for a yes or no vote in a referendum due to take place
seven weeks later set aside their differences, call a truce, put an end
to public campaigning and do not exploit the Games but instead put
Glasgow and Scotland first, join together and make sure that these are
the best Commonwealth Games

Moynihan (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord McConnell, on securing this appropriately popular debate and on
giving an insightful assessment of the preparation for the Games and
the important role Government can play in ensuring the success of the
Games. He is right; the 20th Commonwealth 
<?notus-xml column=1574?>Games in Glasgow will be a powerful and genuine celebration of
world-class sport and culture. Their success will be in no small part
the result of the work of three people who deserve recognition and
praise for their dedication, professionalism and all-party approach, as
he mentioned, to the preparation of the Games. Shona Robison has been a
superb champion for the Games and for sport in Scotland. The
indefatigable Louise Martin has brought a lifetime of experience and
expertise to play in preparing for the Games, and Gordon Matheson,
leader of Glasgow City Council, deserves full recognition for
understanding how the Games can boost the interests of the city of
Glasgow and how sport can be a catalyst for regeneration, enhanced
reputation and
enthusiasm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000032">My
appeal to the Government in their support for the Games is threefold.
First, please will the Government reflect the will of the athletes in
the political fora surrounding the Commonwealth Games? Politics and
sport are increasingly interdependent. The athletes want visas swiftly
and a safe, secure and successful Games. They also look to Government
to urge all members of the Commonwealth to meet and practise the
aspiration set out in Commonwealth Games Federation Article 7, which
reads:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14010863000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000137">“There

whatsoever, including race, colour, gender, religion or
politics”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14010863000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000123">We
are a member of the Commonwealth, where 40 of the 53 member
nations—over 70%—have some laws or regulations on their
statute books persecuting same-sex relationships. That is
unacceptable.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14010863000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000033">Secondly,
I hope the Government can confirm that they have by now learnt one of
the more painful lessons from the post-London 2012
experience—namely, the need to invest far more than before into
ensuring that we translate the inspiration of the Games into
opportunities for participation and that we raise the bar to
unprecedented new heights for the young people of tomorrow,
particularly in all our schools. That means that work needs to be done
now to ensure that local authorities are ready to do more in the
provision of access to sports facilities, and that governing bodies are
assisted by Government to work through their clubs not just to welcome
new members but to have in place the trained coaches, volunteers and
equipment necessary to capture the interest of every single individual
who will be inspired to take up sport and physical recreation. The
capacity and capability to respond with a sports and health legacy for
all concerned should be audited now.</hs_para>

success of this decade of international sporting events is the work of
the volunteers. Volunteer Development Scotland and Volunteering in
Sport 2011-2015 are excellent initiatives. I hope the Government will
work to put in place additional policies to ensure that the 15,000
volunteers—the Clyde-siders—are only the tip of the
iceberg when it comes to capturing the enthusiasm of all volunteers to
work in community sport after the Games are over. We need a raft of new
policies backed by investment to increase participation at all levels,
both in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom. The Commonwealth
Games gives us a chance to deliver on that

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
McConnell, for bringing forward this debate. It is fitting that the
Commonwealth Games are in this great cycle of sporting events that we
have had. The run of events that we have experienced over the past few
years, and are going to experience, started with the Manchester
Commonwealth Games where we British proved to ourselves, much to our
surprise, that we could do it. My mother’s home town is a very
fitting place to make sure there is investment in the people and the
structure behind a successful festival of sport, which is what the
Games are, unlike a championship, no matter how glorious. Games are
where you bring everything together. The most wonderful thing about
sport is the fact that it brings people together on common ground where
they have common interests and communication. No other subject can do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010864000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010864000002">Games
present a greater opportunity than even bigger sporting championships.
Thus we must cash in on this to invest in our future. I agree with my
noble friend Lord Moynihan about the fact that we have to invest in
people at grassroots level. We are on depressingly familiar territory
here because we usually agree on this. London 2012’s great
legacy is the idea. We were never going to get it right first time.
Glasgow gives us the opportunity to build on that—not just for
Britain but internationally since the Olympics and the Commonwealth
Games are the two great international movements—to learn about
how to create enthusiasm and to take it into other sports. The Rugby
League World Cup has worked on this and the Rugby Union World Cup will,
I hope, go on and do more with it. But this is the great legacy that
will come from the Games. I am glad that emphasis has been put on
participation and involvement. I hope that we will build successfully
on the information and practice that have gone before. That is the true
legacy of this. Buildings are great but ideas can last for

Commonwealth Games are diffident. There is a reason why they are called
the friendly Games. I competed for Wales at three of them and have many
happy memories. I am delighted that the Commonwealth Games have led the
way in terms of the inclusion of disabled athletes in such a positive
way. While in the past there were wheelchair racing demonstration
events 
<?notus-xml column=1576?>at Olympics and major athletics events, such as world and European
championships, the Commonwealth Games have embraced disability sport
with full medal status events.</hs_para>

that it has not always been that way. In the Commonwealth Games in
Auckland in 1990, 1500 metres and 800 metres wheelchair races were
included in the programme, but the teams were not allowed to stay with
the mainstream teams or to have any kit. I remember that my fellow
Welsh athlete Chris Hallam, who sadly passed away last year, and I had
to share a single vest. Luckily, my event was first. In 1994, in
Victoria, Canada, we were very nearly part of the team. There was a
little bit more inclusion, and thanks to the largely negative comments
of the Australian chef de mission, who suggested that disabled athletes
should not be there, there was suddenly a turnaround in people’s
opinions. That set the path forward for Manchester, which, as the noble
Lord, Lord Addington, said, also had a massive effect on the London
Games.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010864000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010864000007">While I
do not wish to see an integrated Olympics and Paralympics, I think
there is much greater possibility within individual sports at
international level for the integration of disabled people. The
Commonwealth Games prove very clearly that it can be done. In future, I
would love to see integrated world championships and European
championships. People go to watch the sport, not necessarily to watch
disabled or non-disabled people.</hs_para>

of 2012 is behind us and Glasgow is very nearly upon us, I urge the
Government not to forget the importance of elite sport. We clearly see
the decline of Australians in Olympic sport—but sadly not in
cricket—since they thought that with the major games out of the
way they no longer needed to support sport at this level. Nobody wants
that to happen in the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010864000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010864000009">The legacy
of these Games is not just about participation or stadia, although they
are important. It is a massive opportunity for young athletes. For me,
it bookended my career. It gave me a step up, and it gave me the way
out at the end. We have a huge opportunity to look at how we use those
athletes at a local level. With the size and scale of the home country
teams, I am really looking forward to seeing what plans they have to
keep the momentum of participation going as well as giving the
governing bodies another chance to see what they can do for coaching
and volunteering. Some really embraced 2012, and some sadly missed the
boat completely. They have a second chance to do better. I am also
looking forward to what can be done to improve accessible tourism and
transport and it gives us anther chance to look at PE in schools, which
I do not believe we have quite right at the

part, I would like to talk about the legacy of the Commonwealth Games.
As I drive through Glasgow, I see many infrastructure projects that are
in full flow on both the stadia and the housing requirements, and I am
heartened by the amount of construction jobs that have already been
created and, more importantly, the ones that will be sustained going
forward. When all the medals have been distributed and the Games have
come to a conclusion, Glasgow will be left with world-class sporting
infrastructure that I hope will help young budding athletes to achieve
their dreams and goals. It is vitally important that we utilise these
facilities to the maximum for many years to come. The way the
athletes’ village, consisting of 700 houses, will be converted
to affordable housing is a master stroke by Glasgow City Council. It is

the Games for Glasgow gave us a great opportunity to tackle youth
unemployment . Two of the legacy initiatives that went a long way to
achieving this are the Commonwealth graduate fund and the Commonwealth
apprenticeship initiative. The graduate fund is designed to encourage
employers to create new graduate-level jobs in and around Glasgow. It
targets the recruitment of unemployed graduates by offering financial
incentives to employers to take on a new employee. The fund is worth
£l0 million and is providing funding opportunities for 1,000
graduate jobs in the city. The apprenticeship initiative was created by
Glasgow City Council as a way to assist suitably qualified Glasgow
school leavers into apprenticeships by offering financial incentives to
businesses in return for new vacancies. The success of this initiative
will not only benefit Glasgow school leavers but will help business
growth in the city as well. Over 2,500 apprenticeships have already
been created, which is remarkable. As a result of the success of this
initiative, the leader of Glasgow City Council, Gordon Matheson, has
committed to the continuation of this initiative to the end of the
current administration in 2017, which is a great boost for some of
Glasgow’s young people at a time when it is most
needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010864000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010864000014">As

very thoughtful maiden speech of the noble Lord, Lord Haughey. He is a
fine example of what apprenticeships can do. We can see that not only
has he benefited from an apprenticeship, but he is benefitting others.
I share his affection and passion for Scotland because I was a
post-graduate student in Glasgow and did my placement in Gorbals. My
experience of Gorbals reinforces for me how awe-inspiring the noble
Lord’s achievements are. From very humble beginnings as a
Gorbals boy, through an apprenticeship he has set up a global business
that is now the largest employer in Scotland. He is truly a Gorbals boy
made good, not just a Glasgow boy made good. His commitment to giving
back to society is equally impressive. Through his City Charitable
Trust he supports local and global initiatives, sports, particularly
football, and entrepreneurs and he acts as a role model by visiting
schools. The commitment of the noble Lord, Lord Haughey, to social
justice and zero youth unemployment and his real-life experience and
commitment to giving will be a great inspiration to this House and we
all look forward to his further thoughtful contributions. I thank him
for a wonderful maiden

intercultural relations, global citizenship and the values of the

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lord McConnell for securing this debate and, in particular, for
not being in any sense modest about the way in which the Games came
about, and the distinguished role that he played in that. It would not
have happened without his foresight and his thinking about it, and that
it has happened has been because, as with our experience of the Olympic
and Paralympic Games, these things work only if they are done on an
all-party basis. My noble friend exemplifies how that can
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:34:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000055">I
played a very minor part in the Paralympic Games, as I was involved in
distributing the flowers as part of the medal ceremonies. A flower girl
I was, and I enjoyed it very much; it was one of the
highlights of my summer in 2012. Through that, I met Shona Robison, and
was impressed, as has been said already in this debate, by the care and
concern expressed and her acknowledgement of the need to work together
across parties towards this event. I am sure that it will be
successful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:35:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000056">I
thank all speakers for the wide-ranging contributions, which will help
us to focus on some of the important issues. In particular, my noble
friend Lord Haughey made a very good point in his snappy maiden speech
that a lot of these things are very
local<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:35:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:35:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
The great value that comes from these huge projects is that they can
and do invigorate across all sectors of the host city and 
<?notus-xml column=1583?>town, with the apprenticeships and the work involved on graduate
schemes, and will have a lasting legacy around
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:35:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000057">The
Question asked the Minister to respond as to what steps Her Majesty's
Government were taking to ensure the success of the Games. However, as
has been pointed out, there are very limited direct steps that the
Government can take, since this is not a reserved issue. Indeed, if
noble Lords read the reports from the organising committee, the Games
preparations are going extremely well, so I do not think that there
will be much to say on that. But the wider context that has been raised
in this debate by many speakers is that we need to think again about
how we do big projects in the UK and the values that come from that.
The investment is not just in the Games itself but in the enthusiasm
that it generates, and the focus on the sport —and
how good it is that my sport, squash, is being played in Glasgow,
although it does not yet appear in the Olympic Games. All that makes
for a much better country, with a much better engagement of people in
the activities that make us the nation that we
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000058">When<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>
he comes to respond, I hope that the Minister might pick up on some of
the legacy issues that have been touched
on<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:36:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:31:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
I was very struck by what the organising committee said about this when
they did a survey which asked people what they wanted the legacy to be.
They found that in Scotland—and I would not think it would be
different in the UK as a whole—people wanted a successful Games,
of course, but they also wanted their children to be more
sporty, which is shorthand for them doing more exercise and being
involved in sport. They also wanted to ensure that funding for sport in
primary schools was continued and that more girls could be enthused to
enjoy sport. As we have heard today, that might also be applied to
those with
disabilities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:37:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
Although one could expect the Government to say that this is not their
responsibility, a lesson which was picked up in the excellent report
from one of our own committees, <I>Keeping the Flame Alive:
</I><I>T</I><I>he Olympic and Paralympic Legacy, </I>is that we need to
invest more in these activities. I hope the Government will pick this
point up and respond to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:37:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_08_PT_1/F2CCC77A8C8A32C6EAD690BF2724223E65F44361" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 January 2014">Wednesday,

noble Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>, Lord
McConnell, on securing this debate. I believe that he can take great
pride in what he and others embarked upon and are now seeing fulfilled.
It has been an excellent debate, and the maiden speech from the noble
Lord, Lord Haughey, was, rightly, warmly welcomed across the House.
With all his roots in Glasgow, the noble Lord could not have a more
appropriate debate to launch what I am sure will be a long and
fulfilling career in your Lordships’ House. We all very much
welcome the many contributions he is going to
make<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:38:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

opportunity that the 2014 Commonwealth Games are taking place in
Glasgow, in Scotland, in the United Kingdom. The Games are expected to
draw around 6,500 athletes and officials, competing in 17 sports in 40
venues—I have increased the number from the one suggested by the
noble Lord, Lord McConnell—with a global audience of around 
<?notus-xml column=1584?>1.5 billion people. We have the prospect of watching countless great
athletes—the likes of Usain Bolt, Laura Trott, David Weir and
Jessica Ennis-Hill. My noble friend Lord Purvis of Tweed highlighted
the rugby sevens, and I do not think that a sport could not have a more
robust champion. The Commonwealth Games are the only major games where
the sports programme for elite athletes with a disability is fully
integrated with that for non-disabled athletes. As the noble Lord, Lord
McConnell, said, this is something that we want to build on in the
legacy of Glasgow. I also agree with the points made by my noble friend
Lord Holmes of Richmond on this
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000062">As
has been said, preparations for the Games, led by the organising
committee, are proceeding extremely well, with venues such as the Sir
Chris Hoy Velodrome already open and hosting major events. The
Government are committed to strengthening our engagement
with, and role within, the Commonwealth. A strong
Commonwealth is important to the national interests of all its members
and can help promote UK objectives of democratic values,
good governance and prosperity. The noble Baroness, Lady
Prashar, spoke powerfully about the importance of the Commonwealth for
cultural engagement, international relations and the effect on its
people. My noble friend Lord Moynihan also mentioned the equally
important values of democracy and
non-discrimination.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000063">With
over 2 billion people, the Commonwealth makes up nearly a
third of the world’s population, including some of the
world’s fastest growing economies. It provides a platform for
trade, investment, development and prosperity. Glasgow 2014 provides an
exceptional opportunity to build on the experience and legacy of the
2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games and to promote Glasgow and Scotland
worldwide. The Prime Minister has made it clear that the UK Government
will do everything they can to ensure the 2014 Commonwealth Games are a
success. I know of his visit to the arena, for instance, and his
personal
commitment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:41:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000064">Working
closely with the Scottish Government, Glasgow City Council and the

including managing the border and national security, facilitating entry
to the UK of athletes, coaches and support staff from the Commonwealth
nations and accrediting them to use the Games venues and managing the
more formal international relations with visiting Heads of State and
Heads of Government. The contribution of the UK Government is managed
through the Cabinet committee system in the normal manner with regular
meetings of officials and Ministers. There have been meetings in the
past two days while I have been hearing more about these matters. There
is no doubt at all that Ministers are fully seized of the importance of
their responsibilities to fulfil the reserved matters and to co-operate

places tonight have played a crucial part in the delivery of the 2012

Holmes of Richmond, a distinguished multi-gold medal-winning
Paralympian who played such a part in delivering the 2012 Games. The
noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, an exalted Paralympian,
is now a trustee of the Spirit of 2012 Trust—an independent
trust established to keep the 2012 Games’ legacy flame alive.
Indeed, my noble friend Lord Moynihan, an Olympic medallist, chaired
the British Olympic Association with such distinction. I mention this
because we wish that all the experiences and knowledge from those Games
are shared with all those concerned in organising such an important
Games later this

Stevenson and Lord Haughey, mentioned regeneration, apprenticeships,
infrastructure and employment. All these matters will make a huge
difference to east Glasgow and well beyond. They are part of this
economic legacy. UK Trade and Investment has announced that more than
£11 billion in trade and investment has been generated from the
2012 Games. The Glasgow Commonwealth Games offer another platform to
promote the UK as a partner for business and an investment destination.
Her Majesty’s Government, in conjunction with the Scottish
Government, will host an inward investment and business conference
during the Commonwealth Games. I express particular gratitude to
Glasgow City Council for making the city chambers available during the
Games.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010863000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0002.htm#14010863000068">The
economic benefits from the London Olympics and Paralympics have been
extremely well spread. In fact, it is estimated that those Games will
have created the equivalent of between 51,000 and 62,000 jobs each year
between 2004 and 2020. These figures are hugely important, and I am
sure that they will be reflected in Glasgow. As regards tourism,
VisitBritain is now actively engaged in using the 2014 Games to promote
Scotland across the world. The GREAT campaign is also seeking to
promote the Commonwealth Games.</hs_para>

other Games-related volunteers were one of the extraordinary aspects of
the 2012 Games. My noble friend Lady Seccombe highlighted this. The
organisers of the Glasgow Games have been recruiting 15,000 volunteers,
known as Clyde-siders. These opportunities were heavily oversubscribed,
a testament to the esteem in which the Games makers are, and I am sure
the Clyde-siders will be, held. I agree with my noble friend Lord

fostering the volunteering spirit are enshrined in policy and the way

the cultural aspect of the Commonwealth Games. The two strands are a
Scotland-wide programme called Culture 2014, and a Games-time

indeed.</hs_para>

“coming together”. It will be a positive celebration of
peace and unity. This precedes the first official event to
mark this year’s centenary of the start of the First World War,

I believe that the new powers have sufficient safeguards to ensure

is not to be prescriptive; it is essential that professionals and the

choose the most appropriate course of action. However, statutory

Their readiness to look at a lot of the questions raised at Second

at the moment are government amendments—shows that they have
been willing to listen. I have absolutely no doubt that the parts of

caveat to that is that I would much have preferred the guidance to be
statutory instruments and regulations, as those would have had the
benefit of having to come before the House of Commons and your
Lordships’ House. Nevertheless, it is better that the guidance
should be statutory rather than it being left open as to whether or not
people will bother to produce guidance. The fact that it is statutory
guidance means that there will have to be proper consultation on it,
that it will have to be published and everybody will know that, and
that the Ministers issuing the guidance will have some accountability
to the Houses of Parliament if we want to raise questions as a result
of what is in it. That is welcome and it is being welcomed by a number

of the debate was about free speech, freedom of assembly and the right

it that refers to anti-social behaviour is—and about whether it
is successful in tackling anti-social behaviour more effectively than
the existing regime based on ASBOs. I am optimistic that it will be
more successful, but the guidance that we are discussing is going to be
crucial to how it works on the ground. At the moment if you have to
make an ASBO, you have failed.</hs_para>

to make an IPNA, or criminal behaviour or public spaces protection

everything else that ought to be happening in the mean time.
If the system is to work properly, the problems should be picked up
early. A lot of work should go into what my noble friend
Lady Hamwee this afternoon referred to as preventing escalation. That
requires a lot of work and effort on the ground,
and teams of people: perhaps the neighbourhood policing team, or the
local council anti-social behaviour team, or people from
schools and from the truancy, probation and environmental
health services. These people need to work together as teams rather
than individually. That is what tackling anti-social behaviour really
means if it is to be successful on the

action as early as possible and to take preventive action to work with

using them as last resorts but nevertheless as backstops if necessary.
However, resources are a huge problem. Before Second Reading, I had a
meeting with two people from the local anti-social behaviour
team—a team of three altogether—from my council of Pendle
to talk about this Bill and get their views on it. They were optimistic
that it would help them.</hs_para>

spending cuts on the local authorities and the fact that my own
authority is having to lose about half its staff over six or seven

statutory but voluntary as far as the council is concerned, is crucial
if the statutory provisions in this Bill are to work. I think they
would want me to make that point. Having said that, I support the

Hamwee and proposed by the Joint Committee on Human Rights in its
report on the Bill. The amendment will specify in the Bill that when
considering whether to make a criminal behaviour order, the court must
be satisfied to the criminal standard of proof that the offender has

alarm or distress to any

government position was that, as the case law is clear on this point,
there was no need to provide for the criminal standard in the
legislation. This approach is in line with that taken in other
legislation providing for other types of civil preventive orders.
However, on reflection, we are satisfied that there are sufficient
grounds here for taking a different approach. Part 1 expressly provided
that an IPNA was subject to the civil standard of proof so, unless
express provision was made in Part 2, we accept that there could be
some doubt that the criminal standard would apply in proceedings in
respect of the criminal behaviour order. This amendment therefore

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am for ever grateful to my
noble friend Lord Greaves for continuing to keep us on our toes with
his scrutiny of the various definitions of local government area as
used in the Bill. This amendment relates to Clause 28 which, as my
noble friend said, requires a chief officer, in carrying out a review
of a criminal behaviour order made against a person under 18, to act in
co-operation with the council for the local government area where the
offender lives.</hs_para>

statute law where there is more than one way of defining a local
government area. I have to advise noble Lords that the definition in
Clause 28 is correct, but I accept that the drafting could always adopt
a different approach. In order to preserve the overall structure laid
down by the Local Government Act 1972, the area of a unitary council is
usually designated both a county area and a district area, even though
it has only a district or a county council. Therefore, in an area where
there is a unitary county council, that council will be the council for
the district in which the offender resides. In short, the provision
works as drafted.</hs_para>

may be that, as the Minister said, Northumberland, Durham and Cornwall

that, in common parlance, they are unitary counties. In normal lists of
local authorities in England, you refer either to unitary authorities
if that is what you mean—you could do that—or to unitary
districts and unitary councils. Clearly, unitary districts such as
those in Berkshire are districts and so come under the general thing of
districts.</hs_para>

Reading if I do not get satisfaction. If it is true that the Isle of
Wight is a case on its own and has to be mentioned separately, why is
it not mentioned separately in all the other cases of IPNAs, PSPOs,
community protection notices and so on? The Minister seems to have it
both ways. Again, he has not answered my basic question as to
why—so that people can understand it—the same terminology
is not used in different parts of the same Bill. The answer will be
that different officials wrote different parts of the Bill but that is
no reason for not standardising it when you have the opportunity.

amendments in this group. It may assist the House if I set out the case
for the reform of the existing powers available to the police and, in
doing so, also address Amendment 32, which has been tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady

Committee, the Opposition questioned whether the new dispersal power is
needed—indeed, the noble Baroness mentioned that earlier in the
debate—and whether there is any problem with the existing
powers. It is true that both of the existing dispersal powers have been
used successfully to deal with anti-social behaviour and
alcohol-related disorder. However, they also have limitations. Section
30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 is used to deal with
persistent anti-social behaviour in an area and requires the agreement
of the local authority in designating a dispersal zone. That approach
is not as swift and responsive as it could be. This Bill takes a
different approach. Where there is persistent anti-social behaviour in
an area, it is the council that is able to put in place the measures to
promote long-term, sustainable change in an area. It uses not a
dispersal power but the new public spaces protection

27 of the Violent Crime Reduction Act 2006 is a police-only
power, so can be used more quickly; but it can be used only in relation
to alcohol-related disorder, and that is too limited. In reforming the
anti-social behaviour legislation, we have sought to streamline the
powers and make them more flexible. That is the philosophy behind all
the anti-social behaviour powers in this Bill. The new dispersal power
will allow police to respond quickly so that victims do not have to
suffer the anti-social behaviour while a dispersal zone is put in
place. I believe that agencies should not have to label an area an ASB
hotspot before the police are able to act. These labels are a stigma on
communities and can hinder the hard work of local agencies to improve
the quality of life in those areas. I agree that the existing dispersal
powers are not “broke”—to use a well known
expression—but that does not mean that we should not take this
opportunity to improve them. Combining the best elements of the
existing powers makes the new power a more effective tool to protect

expect the police to act in isolation from other agencies; indeed, we
acknowledge that there will be many situations where it is appropriate
to involve the local authority in the response to anti-social
behaviour.</hs_parafo>

believe that it is right to reform the dispersal powers.
That said, we have listened to the concerns expressed in Committee that
the new dispersal powers could be used to restrict peaceful protests
and freedom of assembly. That brings me to government
Amendments 31 and 33, which I hope will be agreed
by the House. I remain satisfied that the test for the exercise of
those powers precludes them from being used in such a way. However,
given the strength of feeling on the matter, we have tabled the
amendments. Amendment 31 makes it clear that, before authorising the
use of the dispersal powers, the authorising officer must have due
regard to the rights to freedom of assembly and expression as enshrined
in the European Convention on Human Rights. Similarly, Amendment 33
makes clear an officer’s duty to consider those rights before

concerns were raised in the context of public spaces and protection

that is a rather blunderbuss approach to a matter on which we have been
trying throughout the passage of the Bill through your
Lordships’ House to get clarity on: in what circumstances the
power might be used and how that might happen. We asked many questions
in Committee about how this might happen, to which we have had very
little in terms of answers. I certainly recall raising the issue of the
rank of the police officer who would authorise the use of the power in
a specified locality. I accept that the Minister described inspectors
as comparatively senior police officers—and indeed they are
comparatively senior police officers compared with a constable or a
police sergeant—but they are not comparatively senior compared
with an assistant chief constable or a superintendent. These are
relative terms.</hs_para>

these officers have sufficient sensitivity to the local environment,
local circumstances and local community issues that might be raised by
the use of dispersal powers? The reason why this is so sensitive is
that it is a very broad power. I am sure that many of your Lordships
remember the debates that took place in the 1970s about the use of the
sus power. That was a power to stop, really, on the basis of a police
officer deciding they did not like the look of somebody. What we now
have with this power is a facility for the police to say, “In
this area, we are deciding that this group of people will not be
here”. If those people are removed and they refuse to go, this
has created a power where they could ultimately be going to jail. There
are community implications of doing that. As an example of where these
powers might be used, I cited a group of boisterous youths in a
fairground site or in an area where other activities are taking place,
who are or might be regarded as alarming or distressing members of the
public in the locality, or likely to alarm or distress members of the
public in the locality. Those are exactly the sort of circumstances
which could provoke major disturbances, certainly in some of our inner
cities and, I suspect, in many other areas, if the powers were used
insensitively, inappropriately or in a disproportionate fashion. How
will these authorisations be given? Will there be a proper account of
the likely local community consequences?</hs_para>

of any reference to consulting the local authority is so silly. This is
not about a democratic deficit. The Minister is quite right to say that
under current legislation the police service is held to account by the
police and crime commissioner. This is not about holding to account.
This is about involving 
<?notus-xml column=1597?>democratic representatives prior to a decision being taken. This is not
about ceding direction and control. It is about listening to the voice
of the people who know the area best, usually the locally elected
representatives, on the likely consequence of saying, “In this
particular area, we are excluding these particular people because it is
alleged that they may be liable to cause a particular problem even if
they have not done so already”. That is why it matters. The
danger is that the inappropriate use of this power creates
circumstances where there are going to be all sorts of problems and
disturbances in the future. I would personally have confidence in the
sensitivity of inspectors in making such decisions, but there may well
be circumstances in which that would not be the case and a more senior
officer would be appropriate.</hs_para>

this complicated new legislation—the annual Home Office piece of
legislation. We need to make sure we get it right. We will designate an
inspector for the whole force area who will be in charge of
authorisations to use powers under Section 33 of this new Act”.
That would be a sensible decision for a police force to make—it
might even be one that the police and crime commissioner would
endorse—but it would mean that the inspector making that
decision would not necessarily have any knowledge of the locality
concerned. If it was the community inspector for that area, if you
could define one and such a thing existed, or if it was the local
commander or an officer of sufficient seniority that they would have
thought through all the community implications, that would make sense.

imply that it is making it more difficult for the police to act if
there is a requirement to consult. However, there are various forms of
consultation. I do not think that any of us talking about this are
envisaging a circumstance—at least I am not—in which
there would be a three-week consultation with a formal exchange and so
on. We are simply talking about the courtesy call. What is the likely
community impact in this area of doing that? That could be a simple
phone call; it could even be a text message or by word of mouth. It
could be done in a variety of ways. However, surely the least that
should be expected is that there will be communication with the local
authority with which the police are supposed to be in partnership as
part of their crime and disorder reduction arrangements. Yet that is
omitted. Indeed, the Minister said that it would be far too cumbersome
to allow that to happen. Well, there might be a small degree of
inconvenience and slowing down of the speed of action but that
opportunity to take advice might be what averts a major disturbance or
even a riot. That is why these issues are important and why we need

Minister. Or if we have had it I have lost it in the piles of letters
that he has had to send out following Committee because of the
difficulties with the drafting of some parts of the Bill. We have not
had clarity about how this power is to operate, the circumstances in

timescale and the lack of involvement from the local authority. The
noble Lord, Lord Harris, made the point that our issue is not with any
demographic oversight the PCC can provide after the event. It is with
ensuring that, where there is to be a dispersal order, democratically
elected community representatives ensure that the power is used to the
best effect and that they do not cause any further problems and
misunderstandings by not using it appropriately. That consultation and
involvement with local authorities is very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401093000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000024">When

significant changes forward? Did the police come along and say to the
Government, “There is a lack of flexibility in the current
orders. There are delays in implementing them. We do not want to have
to liaise with local authorities. We want to go it alone. We need them
to be longer. We need a wider area.”? Did they raise those
concerns prior to the Government bringing this forward? I am not aware
that they did or that there were any such concerns raised by the
existing orders, but if there were, can the Minister let us know that?
In his comments in Committee regarding the involvement of local
authorities he used phrases such as “it is likely” the
police will work with the local authority and he referred to draft
guidance, which states that the authorising officer “may wish

setting this process up, I thought my speaking notes made it clear that
information that we provided in the consultation we had on this was
about making efficient dispersal arrangements and providing them in
connection with the public space protection order. One of those things
deals with territory and one deals with situations. I think we all
agree that when we are dealing with territory, there is often quite a
bit of history—there is certainly a lot of experience—and
local government and the police can work very happily in hand together
to deal with it. When we are dealing with situations and people, it is
very important that we have a clear order of command. In areas which
may well have provided trouble in the past or, indeed, in situations
which are known to the police and local authorities to be likely to be
troublesome, there may well be some prior discussions.</hs_para>

advantages of using inspector grades to take these decisions is that
most inspectors have territorial responsibilities and local knowledge

operational matter involving the police, not local authority employees,

have access to that local knowledge and an inspector would have access
to it by consultation with sergeants and constables. Indeed, it need
not be at inspector level that the decision is ultimately made. If it
is a complex issue that requires great sensitivity, the inspector is
perfectly entitled to go up to superintendent or even chief constable
level before determining that the dispersal order is made. However,
this legislation provides the facility for it to occur.</hs_para>

“a police officer of at least the rank of inspector who has, for
example, an intimate knowledge of the communities concerned and the
likely impact of this action”. If it said something like that,
and I appreciate that that is not legislative drafting, that would
reassure on that particular point, but it does not. It could simply be
an inspector. I think it quite likely that some police forces, given
that they are about to receive a large new volume of technical
legislation, will decide to have an inspector somewhere—or maybe
even a superintendent; it does not really matter which—whose
sole purpose will be to ensure that all the boxes have been ticked in
terms of following the legislation. That is not the same as someone

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> Although the noble Lord is not being
mischievous, he is being extraordinarily cynical. Effective operation
of a police force is that police force’s job; it is not our job
here in Parliament, as we construct the law, to tell the police how
they should effect the law. The law requires us to ensure that
dispersal orders are operated properly and that full consideration is
given to the rights of peaceful protest and political expression. We
have made it clear what the law is, and it is up to the police to
decide what they should do. The view that I have expressed—it
is, of course, just an opinion—is that it is right to involve
inspectors in this sort of decision-making, because, as I think the
noble Lord would agree, when it comes to local knowledge of policing
situations, it is frequently the inspector who is in the best position.
If he does not know, he can ask a superior officer, and also consult
the officers involved in policing that particular

am sorry, but I feel that the noble Lord is making heavy weather of
what I considered to be a fairly straightforward matter. He asked what
sort of protest would not be approved of. I have already said that if
people were carrying hate messages on placards they might well be
considered to be out of order, and a dispersal order could be the most
effective way of handling that situation. I gave that simply as an

I explained in Committee, the dispersal will be authorised by an

would accept the committee’s argument

to ensure that its use was proportional and appropriate, and that we
would change the legislation to state that the use of the dispersal

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, under Clause 45 it is
an offence to fail to comply with the terms of a community protection
notice. The defences provided for in Clause 45 in respect of this
offence in part repeat the grounds on which the making of a notice can
be appealed. However, criminal proceedings on breach of a notice should
not be the forum to repeat earlier proceedings on an appeal against a
notice. Amendments 37, 38 and 39 therefore remove this particular
defence contained in subsections (3) and (4) of Clause 45. It will
continue to be open to a person charged with the offence of failing to
comply with a notice to argue that they took all reasonable steps to
comply with the notice or that they had some other reasonable excuse
for the failure to comply. This will bring this aspect of the Bill into
line with the approach taken with the public spaces protection order
and the closure powers where a reasonable excuse defence also applies.

items used in the commission of the offence of breaching a notice to be
forfeited or seized on the order of a court. As my noble friend Lady
Hamwee pointed out in Committee, forfeited items must be handed over to
a constable and disposed of by the relevant police

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I return again to the relationship
between public spaces protection orders and what I call special
categories of land. This in an important issue, so I will dwell on it
for a few minutes. I raised this at Second Reading and in Committee I
suggested that these special types of land, where public access is
specified and guaranteed by other legislation, should be excluded from
public spaces protection orders. The categories of land are: access
land under the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, which is mountain,
moor, heath, down and commons and now includes the coastal footpath and
coastal access land where that has so far been designated in England;
village greens and town greens; and rights of way—mainly
footpaths and bridleways—which appear on a definitive map and
the statement of rights of way which nowadays comes under the Wildlife
and Countryside Act and is held by top-tier local
authorities.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1401093000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000043">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T22:01:56"></hs_TimeCode>
purpose of the designation of these kinds of land is to allow public
access. To have public spaces protection orders put on them which deny
that access looks like an easy and quick way for local authorities to
prevent access, which is otherwise a fairly difficult and convoluted
process. Public footpaths can be closed or diverted. There is a process
by which, over time, access land can have its designation removed.
There is also a process by which exceptions and exclusions can be made
to access land, under the CROW Act. However, these take time and are
difficult, for very good reasons.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1606?><hs_para UID="1401093000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000044">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T22:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>
Committee, the Minister said this was okay but that rights of access
were for specific purposes. For village greens it is informal
recreation. For footpaths it is, obviously, walking along them. For
access land it is for accessing that land on foot, together with a
restricted number of ancillary activities, such as stopping and having
a picnic or taking photographs, but there are a lot of activities which
are not allowed. Anti-social behaviour may well be taking place on some
of that land which is affecting the enjoyment of it by the people for
whom the designation has been made, such as the people walking on it.
That is a fair point, so Amendment 47 does not say that public spaces
protection orders should not be made on this land. It says that, if
they are made, they cannot remove the right of access which is the
whole purpose of the
land<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T22:03:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401093000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000045">I
know the Government do not want to do this. I do not know why, because
it is very sensible. Nevertheless, I am pressing the case to give the
Minister the opportunity of saying exactly how these access rights will
be protected. I have had a letter about this from Norman Baker, who was
in charge of the Bill within the department. I will read some of it
out, because it has not been widely circulated and it is worth putting
on

note your concerns that the new public spaces protection order is a

terms of restricting access on certain categories of land, I do not
believe that this would pass the test, in part because of the final
limb, which states that the anti-social behaviour, ‘justifies
the restrictions imposed by the notice’. Given the importance of
these areas, whether coastal access land or registered common, I cannot
envisage a level of behaviour that would constitute such a draconian
response. Where a problem behaviour does exist, the flexibility within
the PSPO means that the behaviour itself can be targeted rather than
access in its totality. This is a major failing in the current system
where unless the anti-social behaviour is related to dogs or alcohol,
the local authority is left with limited options, too quickly resorted
to ‘gating’ in some situations.</hs_quote>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Greaves

he mentioned in his amendment are important and worthy of the
additional discussion. Common land, village greens, rights of way and
open access land all play an important part both in local communities
and in our nation’s heritage. This is exactly why they should be
protected from the minority of anti-social individuals who ruin this
enjoyment by acting in a way that is unreasonable. I am glad that my
noble friend has accepted that the new public spaces protection order
could be used positively to protect the categories of land he
identifies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401093000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000049">The
amendment itself, though, seeks to protect any rights conferred on
individuals or groups as a result of other legislation. As I have said
before, this amendment is unnecessary. For a new order to be made, the
activities have to be “unreasonable”. I do not believe
that someone exercising their rights to, for example, collect firewood
in a particular woodland could be considered to be acting unreasonably.
In addition, while in theory the council could seek to restrict access
to that land altogether, I do not believe that that would meet the
final limb of the test—namely, that the activities justified the
restrictions. Such an absolute ban would likely be disproportionate in
legal terms. Indeed, it is the flexibility that we have built into the
new power that makes sure that the nuclear option, to use that phrase,
is truly a last resort. Where problem behaviour does exist, this
flexibility means that the behaviour itself can be targeted rather than
access in its totality. This is a major failing in the current system
where unless the anti-social behaviour is related to dogs or alcohol,
the council is left with limited options, and too quickly resorts to

I do believe that where the anti-social behaviour is unreasonable and
so bad as to justify restrictions, the council, in consultation with
the police and others, should have the ability to act, and act fast.
That said, given the continuing concerns which my noble friend has
expressed, I assure him that Home Office officials will continue to
work with interested bodies to see how the statutory guidance can
address 
<?notus-xml column=1608?>these issues more effectively. We have already
emphasised in the draft guidance the importance of these categories of
land, but the draft guidance is exactly that—a draft.

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, the government amendments in
this group flow from the debates we have had in Committee about the
consultation requirements attached to the making of a public spaces
protection order and the preparation of the community remedy document.
In responding to the points raised in Committee, particularly by my
noble friend Lord Greaves, we have sought to strike a balance between
the need to ensure that appropriate consultation takes place, while
avoiding the imposition of unnecessary bureaucratic burdens on local
authorities, the police or police and crime commissioners.</hs_para>

spaces protection orders, the key amendment is Amendment 54, which
brings together and augments the consultation and notification
requirements already provided for in Chapter 2 of Part 4 of the Bill.
The key additions are the requirement to consult with the owner or
occupier of the relevant land, so far as it is reasonably practical to
do so, and to notify any county council, parish council or community
council. These requirements are in addition to the existing duties to
publish the proposed text of an order before it is made or varied, and
to consult the chief officer of police, the local policing body and any
community representatives whom the local authority thinks it
appropriate to
consult<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T22:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1401093000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000196">10.15

similarly augment the consultation requirements in relation to the
community remedy document. In Committee, I undertook to consider an
amendment tabled by my noble friend Lord Greaves which sought to
provide that local authorities should be consulted in the drawing up of
the community remedy document. While we would have expected local
authorities to be consulted by the police and crime commissioner as
part of their public consultation, we see merit in making this explicit
in the Bill. As my noble friend pointed out, local authorities will
often be directly involved in supervising the actions included as
community remedies, so it is right for them to be consulted as a matter
of course. These amendments accordingly place a statutory duty on the
police and crime commissioner to consult the local authorities in the
police force area on the actions that it would be suitable to include
in the community remedy document.</hs_para>

Greaves:</Member></B> My Lords, I suppose that I ought to say thank
you. As my noble friend Lady Hamwee said, when amendments come back
like this from the Government, you sometimes think that all the time
and effort spent in Committee has produced something worth while.
Therefore, I am very grateful to the Government: when I saw this
particular amendment, I thought that it was a late Christmas

because it is an odd new clause, including two completely different
things. However, both are very welcome. The reference to the rights of
freedom of expression and freedom of assembly are extremely useful.
With this Bill—and all the fuss this afternoon bemused me a
little—I have always been of the view that the public spaces
protection order provisions 
<?notus-xml column=1610?>had the potential to be a greater danger to freedom of speech and
assembly and to the civil right to protest and so on than the
injunctions for the prevention of nuisance and annoyance. The reason,
as the Minister said when he introduced an earlier amendment, is that
PSPOs are about territory and areas, and therefore, unless very
specific provisions are made, they apply to everybody. Unlike IPNAs,
which are injunctions against individual people or groups of people, as
I understand it public spaces protection orders, which can last for up
to five years and are renewable, would apply to everybody and stop
normal activities such as handing out leaflets, parading with banners,
making speeches and holding
meetings<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T22:19:24"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, this part of this new clause is extremely useful
and valuable and the Government are to be congratulated. I am a
little bemused as to why on earth they did not just produce
a clause such as this and attach it to IPNAs, as that might have
defused a great deal of the fuss earlier today. However, that is for
the Government to think about, not me.</hs_para>

final point is that one of the things that my friend Norman Baker sent

2014 (Publication of Public Spaces Protection Orders) Regulations. This
point is not exactly in this amendment but perhaps noble Lords will
bear with me for two sentences. The regulations set out the

this is very welcome. The fact that it will be in regulations is
welcome, because councils will not be able to get out of it. If the

noble friend Lord Clement-Jones and those with whom he worked on what
is now the Live Music Act 2012 remain concerned about the possibility
of local authorities using public space protection order powers when
there is existing nuisance legislation that could be used against a
particular nuisance—though I think that they do not regard much
music as “nuisance”. There have been some awkward
examples of some local authorities banning busking and other live
music-making during “reasonable hours”; and when I say
that, I would probably agree that they are reasonable, but I do not
particularly want to bring that into the equation here. During hours
when there have been a small number of complaints, the local
authorities would argue that such action is reasonable and there is a
concern that the powers might be used far more extensively than the
Government would have in mind. They have spoken to me about balancing
competing rights between freedom of expression and the right to
peaceful enjoyment of one’s possessions—in this case the
items that are being used for busking.</hs_para>

the guidance but I also know that those who have been in touch with me

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee my noble friend
Lord Faulks and other noble Lords questioned the effect of Clause
62(7). He asked whether this had the effect of stopping an application
for judicial review against a council that makes a public spaces
protection order. I agreed to go back and consider the matter further.
On reflection, it is true that, as originally worded, the clause meant
that judicial review was not available. This was because an interested
person can challenge an order in a broader way than is open under a
judicial review and, as such, the requirement for that process did not
seem necessary. I believe that this is right: it ought not to be
possible for the same person to challenge a public spaces protection
order on effectively the same grounds through two different legal
procedures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401093000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000082">However,
as my noble friend pointed out, because only “interested
persons” as defined in the Bill may challenge a decision to make
an order, this has inadvertently left national bodies and others who do
not fall into the category of an “interested person”
without any means to challenge a decision. Amendment 51
rectifies this and ensures that the option of judicial review is
available to those who do not qualify as “interested
persons”. I hope the House will agree that this is a fair way of
ensuring that all parties with an interest in a public spaces
protection order can challenge the terms of the order should they
consider there to be a case for doing so. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401093000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Greaves" PimsId="3545" UID="1401093000237" xid="1111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000237">Lord

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> My Lords, in
Committee I undertook to consider an amendment tabled by my noble
friend Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville that sought to acknowledge the
excellent work of the City of London Corporation in managing some of
the important public spaces in and around the capital. We agree that my
noble friend’s proposal has significant merit. Amendment 53
therefore provides for statutory custodians, such as the City of London
Corporation, to be designated by order of the Secretary of
State. The effect of such an order will be to enable the
designated body to make public spaces protection orders in respect of
the land they are also responsible for managing. The amendment also
includes the safeguards proposed by my noble friend ensuring that the
local authority will continue to have precedence in the decision-making
process. Therefore, a designated body will be able to make a public
spaces protection order only where the local authority does not wish to
act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401093000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000085">In
addition, any designated body will be able to make an order only in
respect of those matters it already has the power to regulate through
by-laws, so there will be no extension of scope. For the time being,
the City of London Corporation is the only body that we have in mind to
designate under this order-making power. This is in line with a similar
provision that currently exists under the terms of the Clean
Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005 in respect of dog control
orders which will be replaced by the provisions in the Bill.</hs_para>

Brooke of Sutton Mandeville (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak
to government Amendment 53, to which my noble friend has just spoken.
In responding to my amendment in Committee, my noble friend Lord Ahmad
was kind enough to acknowledge that there appeared to be a strong case
for extending the availability of public spaces protection orders to
bodies other than local authorities. I am most grateful that further
consideration has confirmed that view. I know also that the City of
London Corporation, whose position prompted my earlier intervention, is
grateful for the constructive and open-minded approach taken by
officials during discussions on this point. No doubt, other bodies that
manage public spaces under statute but are not local authorities will
also find the change
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401093000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000088">My
noble friend will recall that in my amendment in Committee, to which
Her Majesty’s Government have now helpfully responded, I alluded
to Epping Forest. In this appreciation of the Government response, I
quote a testimonial about the Corporation of London from 1979—35
years ago—when I moved in the Commons the Second Reading of a
private City of London (Various Powers) Bill on behalf of the City
which primarily related to Epping Forest. Two of my noble friends who
are now in your Lordships’ House spoke in that Second Reading
debate: my noble friend Lord Tebbit, then MP for Chingford, and my
noble 
<?notus-xml column=1615?>friend Lord Horam, then replying to the Bill as Under-Secretary for
Transport. They were thus witnesses to the quotation uttered by the
late Arthur Lewis—then and for the previous 34 years Labour MP
for West Ham, where he was Tony Banks’ predecessor—when
he spoke in that debate. I quote the conclusive passage in his
speech:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1401093000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-0003.htm#1401093000151">“I

it has not proved that it has the best interests of the people at

knowledge for the past 34 years … I have gone along to many
Ministers, ministerial advisers and local government officers. I have
never found any of them so accommodating or helpful as the City of
London authority and its officers. They have not put themselves out in
the way that the City of London’s officials have. When I have
problems or difficulties over Wanstead Flats, West Ham park or Epping

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a rather
complicated matter. We are on to the area of people who are contracted
in and those who are contracted out. Under the Government’s
proposal, an employee who by April 2016 has already built up a state
pension entitlement equal to or in excess of the single state pension
cannot add further to it. This means that a large number of long-term
contracted-in employees will face the prospect of a reduced state
pension. These employees, by definition, have not had access to quality
company DB pensions during their career, and SERPS and the second-tier
pension were originally designed to assist them. By contrast, an
employee who has been long-term contracted-out will have an established
right to the basic state pension only. Under the transitional terms,
they would have the ability to add to their single pension benefit and
could increase it from the prospective £107 of the basic state
pension level to £144 in approximately nine years.</hs_para>

amendment is designed to be helpful. We realise, of course, that the
transition may be difficult. Some people may feel that they are losing
out as a result, and we want to ensure that as few as possible feel
that way. The idea of the amendment is to limit the loss of future
rights to accrue for the contracted-in employees and to put them on an
equal footing with contracted-out employees. Under the new scheme, both
groups will in future be paying the same amount of national insurance
contribution. The idea of the amendment was therefore to ensure that
the transition that is taking place will be as smooth as possible, and
that people who think that they have been left out or that their
conditions are undermined will feel that every effort is being made by
the Government—if they accept our amendment or something rather
similar—to make the transition as painless as possible. I beg to

are now on Clause 5, which, as my noble friend Lady Turner of Camden,
explained, deals with the transitional rate of state pension. Once
again, my noble friend has allowed the Committee an opportunity for
some further clarification and explanation from the Minister. In the
House of Commons, the Minister for Pensions, Steve Webb, dealt with
this clause in two paragraphs. To be fair to him, it took slightly
longer to explain Schedule 1 but most of that legislation was probably,
rightly, a paean of praise for the drafting and for parliamentary
counsel. It appears that Schedule 1 is a unique piece of drafting and
reads logically, simply and straightforwardly. If all legislation were
as clear, it would be very helpful.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010843000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010843000008">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>
hope the Minister will forgive us if we tarry a little in this
important provision, given that we do not have a lot to go on from the
debate this Bill has been subject to thus far. Clause 5 and Schedule 1
explain how the transitional rate is calculated. My
understanding—and if it is not right I am sure the Minister will
correct me—is that this rate applies to everyone who, under
Clause 4(1)(c), has at least one pre-commencement qualifying year. A
pre-commencement qualifying year is one year of national insurance
contributions before 6 April 2016 and, for completeness, after 6 April
1978—although I suspect that is not of great relevance. Everyone
who has such a pre-commencement qualifying year and who meets the
minimum qualifying period will have the foundation amount, which is the
higher of either the pre-commencement and post-commencement years added
together or the amount already accrued under the old system, whichever
is the larger. In short, such a person will get what they would get
under the old rules or what they would get under the new rules,
whichever is the greater. Thereafter we are working on a maximum of
£144 and one thirty-fifth of £144 for each year until
they reach the maximum. Over and above that, as my noble friend has
pointed out, there comes a point, no matter what age you are, when you
cannot accrue any more pension entitlement. It is capped. Indeed, there
was some debate in the House of Commons as to whether the pursuit of
the word “cap” was appropriate. Interestingly,
“cap” is in the schedule itself. You cannot accrue any
further pension 
<?notus-xml column=373?>under the current system. As with the present system, after 30 years you
still have an obligation to pay national insurance but you will be
contributing not to your pension but to the whole
pot<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:52:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

knew—I think until the Prime Minister’s recent
announcement on “The Andrew Marr Show” on 6
January—that none of this was guaranteed to be triple locked. I
digress a little because I am not entirely sure exactly where we stand
with the fact that the Prime Minister took the opportunity to make an
announcement on “The Andrew Marr Show” on retaining the
triple lock for the duration of the next Parliament. This will provide
existing pensioners, I think, and those retiring soon after the
implementation of this Bill, with some degree of comfort in the rather
unstable financial world we are now living in and I venture to suggest
that it was calculated to do so. It was calculated by the Prime
Minister to generate that degree of relationship between him and those

supported the triple lock since it was proposed by the Government.
Maybe the Minister can take this opportunity to tell us if this
announcement constitutes a Conservative Party manifesto policy pledge
or is it—as I think we could probably, in an inspired fashion,
guess that the junior partner in this coalition is unlikely to take a
different view—now government policy, issued on behalf of both
coalition partners? I apologise if I have offended any noble Lords by
my reference to “junior”. Perhaps I will just refer to

pensions? Will it apply to pension savings credit? Is this within the
welfare cap itself? Will the triple lock apply to S2P or are we
retaining the uplift? There are lots of questions. I suspect the

people entitled to a protected payment—so, in other words, those
with foundation amounts higher than the full single-tier pension.
People in this position are likely to have built substantial additional
state pension entitlement in the existing system and would typically
have been contracted into the additional state pension for most of
their working life.</hs_para>

me first say that the decision to close the additional state pension in
2016 was by design, rather than by accident, as it allows us to provide
a simpler, fairer state pension. Most of the complexity inherent in the
current system is associated with the additional state pension and
contracting out. This in turn makes it more difficult for a person to
know how much pension they are likely to get from the state and how
much more they would need to save to realise their desired income in
retirement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:58:07"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, we are recognising pre-commencement qualifying years in the
transition design and will allow people to gain amounts above the full
single-tier pension. We also uprate the whole single-tier amount by
earnings, as opposed to just the basic state pension in the current
system, and any excess is price-protected. I think we have had
sufficient reference to the triple lock around

in single-tier pension—or, in other words, nine times the
£4.11 a week illustrative figure. If we were to do this, we
simply would not have a single-tier system. We would, in fact, enhance
disparities in state pension outcomes counter to the aims of the reform
which seeks to provide a flat-rate amount on which people can save. For
example, a person whose pre-commencement qualifying years result in a
pension that is £1 above the illustrative amount of £144
a week could add up to nine more qualifying years. However, this
generosity would not be extended to a person whose pre-commencement
qualifying years resulted in a pension just below, or at, the full
single-tier amount: this person’s pension would be capped at
£144 of the illustrative amount. This seems arbitrary and
unfair.</hs_para>

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> This, again, concerns a somewhat
difficult point. Currently, paragraph 6(2) of Schedule 1 provides that
amounts of pre-commencement pension up to the level of the full single
pension will increase in line with “the full rate” of the
single state pension, while any amount in excess of that will rise only
in line with CPI inflation. In other words, the rate of revaluation is
on the basis of prices rather than, as in the past, in relation to
earnings. This takes into the 
<?notus-xml column=376?>whole area of revaluation. We have already heard that, apparently,
government policy is in future going to support the triple lock, which
I personally have always supported. If the triple lock were accepted,
and if our amendment were accepted, that would certainly bring the
whole thing into line with the triple lock, because it would increase
this section of the pension in line with
earnings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010843000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010843000024">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:04:32"></hs_TimeCode>
am rather surprised that the Government continue to imagine that it is
possible, in this particular section of the Bill, to have revaluation
in line not with earnings, or indeed with the triple lock at all, but
in line with prices. That is completely out of kilter with what will,
hopefully, be in the rest of the Bill and with support for the triple
lock. I therefore suggest that the Minister look again at the amendment
and perhaps agree with what we are suggesting: that the amount to be
revalued should be in accordance with the full rate of the state
pension, which would of course bring you directly into the earnings
section rather than looking at prices again. I do not think that we
want to look at prices again in relation to any section of the Bill. If
we are going to have the triple lock, which I hope we shall, that would
of course not arise because the best of three would be payable in
respect of all the pension payments referred to in the Bill. I beg to

in the same direction. The issue is fairness in relation to

that as part of the overall approach, but in terms of the expectations
of the people concerned there is in essence the same point as was in my
noble friend’s previous amendment: somebody who is retiring in
15 years’ time may be able to provide other means of savings to
make up for the loss of expectation. However, if they are retiring
fairly close to the due date of the single tier, then their
expectations cannot be made up in that time. A significant degree of
unfairness applies there. The same applies in relation to the subject
matter of these amendments if you happen to be one side or another,
under the old system, of the proposed reference figure of £144
or whatever it turns out to be. There is no particular reason why one
group of workers—who have, by and large, not had the most
favourable pension schemes but have saved into the state second

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, it might be helpful if I explain the
principle behind having protected payments. We recognise that some
people who will reach pensionable age under the single tier will
already have amounts of additional pension which take them over the
full single-tier rate. A key consideration in the design of the
transition was that this extra would not be taken away. Revaluing the
protected payment, at least by increases in prices, will maintain its
purchasing power over time.</hs_para>

with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, about fairness in
relation to expectations. Under the current system, the additional
state pension is revalued up to state pension age in line with average
earnings, but is then indexed only by prices once in payment. A man
retiring in the first 10 years of single tier could expect
to spend, on average, 20 years in retirement. In single tier, we have
shifted this balance between adjustments before and 
<?notus-xml column=378?>after pensionable age, and the majority of people receiving protected
payments will be better off overall as a result of this
shift.</hs_para>

the current system, only basic state pension is uprated by a minimum of
earnings. In the future, the full amount of the single-tier pension
would be uprated in this way. So using the 2012-13 White Paper figures,
this means that people will see the illustrative £144 of their
state pension being uprated each year by earnings, or
more—potentially the triple lock—not just £107.
People with a protected payment will be relatively close to pension
age, so the revaluation will typically be applied only for a few years.
So, for example, even someone with an above average protected payment
of £20 with 10 years left until they reach retirement would find
that revaluation leaves them £4 per week worse off upon reaching
pensionable age, but £4 better off 10 years later.</hs_para>

by the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
would effectively incorporate earnings revaluation of the protected
payment into single tier. As this is a cost-neutral package of reforms,
we would need to make offsetting changes elsewhere. Given that we
expect most people to be better off from the combined revaluation and
uprating changes, this would be difficult to justify. To give noble
Lords a response to their question about the costs we are talking
about, I can tell them that using earnings to revalue the protected

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we move on to a
different subject, which is pension sharing on divorce. This is a very
simple, short amendment that raises the issues of divorce that were
touched on in previous amendments. When we delivered pension sharing on
divorce—many of my noble friends were absolutely vital in that
activity in the 1990s—it primarily affected private pensions. We
thought that the portion that could be set aside as part of the divorce
settlement would be the basis of a useful pension for the divorced
spouse—usually the woman. We were also anxious 
<?notus-xml column=380?>that he and she would build on—or, in his case, perhaps
rebuild—their pension shares back up again so that both would
face retirement with an adequate pension. However, most divorcing
spouses do not seek pension sharing. In some cases, obviously, there
may not be much pension to share, particularly if the divorce takes
place at a relatively young age—often, sadly, younger women do
not always properly value their husbands’ pension, and
solicitors, I am afraid, are still pretty sleepy about what is quite a
technical issue. Many of those who share pensions do not realise the
need for or the possibility of rebuilding their separate
pensions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:19:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, out of 120,000 or 125,000 divorces a year, an average of
10,000 divorces involve pension sharing, which means that 8% or 9% of
total divorces involve pension sharing of private occupational
pensions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:19:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

what the implications are for the new state pension. Currently, under
existing laws—we clarified this again in a previous discussion
on divorcees—upon divorce the woman can substitute the
man’s NI record for BSP in lieu of her own at the point of
divorce, if his is the higher, and she may also be entitled to half of
his additional pension—SERPS or S2P—if the court so
decrees as part of the sharing of matrimonial
assets<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:20:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010843000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010843000043">Under
the new regime, she will not be able to substitute his NI contributions
for her own, a point that we argued a few amendments back. The only
element that can be split or shared, if the court decrees it, is the
protected pension; for example, the frozen, additional amount from
SERPS and S2P, to which my noble friend referred on a previous
amendment. What is more, if he has a shortfall in his NI contributions
towards the new state pension—possibly because he has a track
record in the public sector, I imagine, with contracting
out—some of his additional pension will be brought over to make
good his NI record and that transferred slice of protected pension will
not then be available for sharing. I am assuming a genderised position
here, I am afraid. So she takes the double whammy: not only does she
not get an ability to substitute his NI contributions for her own for
the basic state pension element, but, equally, if he has an inadequate
NI contribution—that may well be the case if he has had a
lifetime of contracting out, has never had head space and wishes to
make good his shortfall in the new state pension—as I understand
it, she will then not be able to access that chunk of his protected and
S2P or SERPS pension, which will go across to make good the
shortfall<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:21:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010843000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010843000044">I
would be grateful if the Minister would confirm that I have understood
this correctly. If so, the woman has a pretty nasty deal and I think
some explanation of the implications is required, particularly for
women who have childcare responsibilities and so on and who may not be
able to rebuild the additional income, particularly once their youngest
child hits

is usually, but not invariably the man, by how much the pension has

pension, if the court has so decreed—would allow 
<?notus-xml column=381?>each of them to know where they stand to make better decisions about

this amendment, I am seeking to ask the Minister to ensure that women
who may not be aware of, but who could well take advantage of, a share
of the additional protected pension have the knowledge that they can do
so. They may wish to set that against other matrimonial assets that may
otherwise go their way on divorce. I hope, therefore, that the Minister
will agree with me that as this is techie and this has now been changed
substantively in the Pensions Bill, those women who have been married
to someone in the public sector—the reverse could equally well
be true in terms of gender—will be a loser a second time because
he may well dip into this to make good his NI shortfall. I hope that
the Minister will agree with me that we need to encourage people to be
aware of the situation and I think that the department needs to take
some responsibility for ensuring annual information. I beg to

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:23:43"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I put
my name to this amendment because I spent a happy half hour with my
noble friend trying to fathom out what the legislation was about, on
this occasion, without a bottle of gin. The conclusion that my noble
friend has just outlined, which I believe to be correct, is that any
protected payment could be shared—I think that was confirmed at
one of our briefing meetings and indeed in some of the documentation
that we have and this parallels the current situation with the
additional state pension—but the protected payment cannot, I
think, for some of the reasons outlined by my noble friend, be greater
than the second state pension accrued at 6 April 2016; it
can, however, be smaller.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T15:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>For individuals
who grow up entirely within the single-tier system, with just S2P, as
we understand it, there would be no basis for sharing the state
pension. The noble Lord’s confirmation would be helpful. The

routinely informed—seems entirely

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, I intend to make a very short
contribution to this debate. As my noble friend Lady Hollis made clear
in her introductory remarks, this is a simple amendment. If it can be
simple and complex in its implications at the same time, then that is
what it is. I have no intention of trying to replicate or supplement my
noble friend’s understanding of the complexity of this issue,
and the implications of the decisions that face people in these very
difficult circumstances. My understanding of the element of the pension
that can be split by the courts on divorce is as my noble friend Lord
McKenzie explained it. We benefited from a briefing from the
Minister’s supporting civil servants which, as always, we were
grateful to receive; it was very clear and helpful.</hs_para>

pension payments, not knowing or losing track of the details of their

asked by my noble friend, and because I do not know the answer, can the
Minister tell the Committee if there are arrangements in place by which
the courts or the legal profession—the justice system—in
some fashion notify the DWP of such arrangements? If they do, what are
they? If people are not to be sent regular statements of pension
credits or debits, how else would the Minister suggest that this

I sit down, I want to take the opportunity to provide the Minister with
the chance to put on the official record information about a very
discrete point relating to the devolution settlement, and the
implications of these provisions about pension sharing on an area of
devolved responsibility. In this Bill, necessarily, there are
consequential amendments to the Family Law (Scotland) Act 1985. As most
of us have come to know, the devolution settlement requires certain
rules to be applied to circumstances where we in this Parliament
legislate in areas which are otherwise devolved—and family law
is devolved to the Scottish Parliament. I am satisfied—because I
raised this matter with the Minister’s civil servants and
received an e-mail explanation on 13 December—that
this issue has been discussed with both the Scottish Parliament and the
Scottish Government. I was told that the Scottish Government were
content, within the scope of the devolution settlement; that the
provisions in the Pensions Bill fall under a particular category in the
devolved guidance that allows legislative provisions to be enacted here
without the necessity for the normal processes. I think this is called
a Sewel Motion in the Scottish Parliament. I am speaking long enough
for the Minister to find some words that he can put into the official
record. I am sure he will understand why it would help if there was
some recognition of these discussions and the agreement of the Scottish
Government to this Parliament legislating in these potentially
contentious areas which would otherwise be devolved. I hope I have made
myself clear that it would be helpful if that could be addressed in the
response to this amendment.</hs_para>

the challenge put by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on the
combination effect, the substitution arrangements are, as we all know,
extremely complex. There is no substantial need for them any more
because  
<?notus-xml column=383?>the vast majority of women will receive a pension in their own right.
Pension sharing is a completely separate issue to substitution, and is
to do with sharing the assets at the end of a
marriage rather than lifting women out of poverty. Last year, the
department was asked to undertake 10,000 pension valuations in respect
of pension sharing, but actually received only 150 orders
from the courts to share additional pension. Under single tier, pension
sharing will be gradually withdrawn but the numbers that I have
supplied indicate that this will not play much of a factor in
protecting the pension position of
divorcees<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:31:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

figures last time, when we debated the amendment on divorcees and the
substitution issue. The 100,000 requests and the 150 orders
are happening in terms of the protected or state second pension, or
SERPS, now. Of course, it is only a tiny fraction of the occupational
pensions which are usually the more valuable asset and make up the

disappears, most men and women will be able to build up entitlement to
a simple contributory pension above the basic level of means-tested
support. This is the most effective way of ensuring that savers have a
decent underpin which stays with them however their family
circumstances change. More than 80% of those reaching state pension age
by the mid-2030s will get the full single tier, a figure with which I
know the Committee is familiar. The courts will still be able to take
account of private pension provision in the divorce settlement. The
expectation is that the vast majority of people will be able to build a
single-tier pension in their own right.</hs_para>

someone is the beneficiary of a pension share order they receive a
pension credit. The person the order is made against is subject to a
corresponding debit. State pension credits are normally awarded and
debits applied from state pension age. If the order is made after state
pension age, the payment is increased or decreased at that point. As
under the current system, single-tier pensioners who have a state
pension debit or credit will be informed of the weekly addition or
deduction when the court order is implemented. Individuals will be able
to ask for statements of their state pension, but the pension credits
or debits would be consolidated within the individual’s
single-tier payment or protected payment and so not identified as
credits or debits. As now, these elements could be identified on
request but I am informed by the department’s pension sharing
administrators that no one can recall ever receiving such a

me on this so I assume that it  is correct—get

16, 17 and 18 allow people to defer their single-tier pension at state

provisions broadly mirror the deferral arrangements in the current

16 specifically provides for the individual to suspend their
single-tier pension only once after they have started to receive it, as
is the case in the current state pension scheme. This will be
particularly important for those who are not certain of their likely
retirement income until they have reached state pension age but who
could benefit from the ability to suspend their pension and build up
weekly increments. At the moment, pensioners can only do this once
under the current scheme. This enables people who want to return to 
<?notus-xml column=386?>work or increase their hours to manage their tax position more
effectively. For example if they have the opportunity to work and no
longer require their state pension to support themselves, they will be
able to suspend their pension and therefore lower their taxable income
for that period. They will then build up an increase to their
single-tier pension which will be payable when they reclaim
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010848000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010848000023">The
amendments would remove any restriction on the number of times a person
may opt to give up their entitlement to a single-tier pension. It
introduces new complexity for individuals planning for their retirement

de-retire later in life increases the risk that they will not live long
enough to break even. It would only really make sense for people who
would see a significant tax benefit from not claiming their state
pension for certain periods of time. Having the option to suspend their
state pension once strikes a balance between giving people the
flexibility to return to work and manage their tax position after
claiming their state pension and ensuring the system remains as simple
as possible. I ask the noble Lord to withdraw the

respond quickly should the need arise to amend the scheme—for
example, if there is a group of people to whom it would be
inappropriate to offer the opportunity to improve their pension once it
was been claimed. Under the current scheme, if the individual is not
ordinarily resident in Great Britain or another EEA member state and
has claimed their pension, they will not normally be able to suspend it
in order to build up an increase. The inclusion of this power means
that we can use secondary legislation to mirror the current position
for the suspension of a single-tier pension. The amendment would mean
that any modification of the option to elect to suspend a single-tier
pension would require a degree of parliamentary scrutiny via the
primary procedure that would be disproportionate to that

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> It does not matter. I am grateful for
the additional statistics on this issue provided by the Bill team. That
has been very helpful. In 2004, the previous Administration sought to
encourage people to stay in work longer by offering attractive
arrangements if they deferred taking the state pension for several
years, or at least for more than one year. About 9% of pensioners did
so—1.2 million people—three-quarters of them women,
usually because they were younger than their husbands and worked longer
hours, particularly given that their retirement age was earlier than
the husbands’ and this way they could retire together. These
arrangements had several advantages: they kept people in work for
longer; they allowed husband and wife to synchronise their retirement
if they wished; and they offered them a higher pension income once
retired, with interest rates—until this Bill 
<?notus-xml column=388?>comes into effect—of 10.4% per annum, or to roll it up into a
lump sum, where instead they received the basic rate plus 2%.</hs_para>

the 1.2 million pensioners who deferred their state pension for more
than a year chose income. Some 60,000 preferred to take a lump sum. I
do not know how many of those are women, but my hunch would be, again,
a very high proportion. If by any chance the Minister had that figure,
that would be helpful. Some 60,000 preferred to take the lump sum,
which on average was £13,700 for GB residents—a
considerable sum.</hs_para>

remove the option of a lump sum so that in future, if you defer taking
your state pension, all that you can do is add to your income. Why? I
have to say that the arguments offered by the Minister in the other
place did not persuade me. He said that, first, it was a less
financially attractive proposition to take the lump sum than to take
the money as increased pension, even at the proposed new rate for
income deferral of 5.2%. Secondly, drawing their pension rather than
deferring it and then putting it into a building society account would
give much the same return. And, thirdly, by removing choice, you are
giving people something more valuable—that magic word
“simplicity”, as though a lump sum payment is really hard
to
understand<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:49:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010849000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010849000009">I
think this approach is incomplete at best and, in policy terms, wrong
in terms of what we know about pensions income and capital. Why would
one want a lump sum when the alternative of income is, in terms of
return, more financially attractive, which I accept that it is? The
answer, it seems to me, is simple. It may be the only opportunity a
couple or an individual—but more likely a couple—get of
acquiring any capital before they go into full-time retirement. If they
have an occupational pension, they are likely to get perhaps the
capital of a 25% tax free lump sum. If they are reliant only on the
state pension, they have no such access to capital at all. The problem
for pensioners now, and future pensioners, as they face their
retirement, is not so much lack of income, thanks not only to what the
previous Administration did but what the current Administration are
doing, on which I congratulate them—it is above all lack of
capital. I do not think that the Government or the Minister in the
other place gave the impression of understanding that that is the
problem coming up in the
lift<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:51:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010849000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010849000010">Let
us remind ourselves that in 1997 the percentage of pensioners below 60%
of median income was 41%. As of now, it is about 14%. Pensioners, as we
know, have rightly done relatively well in terms of income. As my noble
friend teased earlier on, we now know that the current Administration
propose to continue this until 2020, should they return to office. As a
result, pensions have already risen three times faster than wages and
pensioners will continue to do well. The big problem for pensioners is
not income but the lack of savings or capital. That has, if anything,
worsened over the past decade: 21% of all pensioners have no savings at
all; 37% have less than £3,000—not enough to pay for one
funeral, let alone two—and 50% of all pensioners have less than
£8,000, which would just about cover two funerals with a bit
left over for the 
<?notus-xml column=389?>high tea. For those able to defer, bringing in an extra £13,000
to £14,000 of capital is magic. It transforms their situation. I
repeat that the struggle for pensioners is not so much lack of income,
which was how it was treated down the other end, as lack of capital,
and the Government are going to close down one of the easiest and
simplest routes to acquiring
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:52:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010849000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010849000011">A
couple, for example, could make the entirely sensible judgment that one
of them—possibly him—adds their deferred pension to their
pension income and, as a result, his state pension increases. The
other—it may well be her—brings in the lump sum to build
some savings for a rainy day or replace the car, build the
conservatory, help their grandson with tuition fees at university, and,
above all, in time, to help pay for social care and eventually,
perhaps, to fund funerals. Yes, they could save that sum out of income
instead, as Steve Webb suggested. However, as with auto-enrolment,
where we are structuring choice, ring-fencing it into a deferred lump
sum may be the most helpful way to build those savings. To assume that
people will voluntarily put their income aside into a building society
is the exact opposite of what we are doing with auto-enrolment, where
we know that we need the nudge theory of inertia to get people to save,
not to leave it to a voluntary choice. They can, of course, do as the
Minister suggests, but if that is the case, and if we can rely on them
to do that, frankly, we do not need auto-enrolment at all because
people will look after themselves with private occupational provision.
But, of course, we know that they do not and that is why we are
introducing auto-enrolment. The same cast of mind applies to deferred
state pensions, I
suggest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010849000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010849000012">In my
experience, pensioners seldom spend their full income. They cope.
Whatever the level of pension—whether it is £60,
£80 or £100—pensioners spend £1 or so
underneath their ceiling. Indeed, as a result of past and current
government policies, including the triple lock, the income from the new
state pension for future pensioners will be increasingly adequate.
However, what pensioners are badly short of is capital, and that
capital, as a proportion of their future, is<I> </I>reducing. They have
little or no reserve cushion and the Government are taking away the
easiest way in which pensioners can choose to build that
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010849000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010849000013">Why<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:55:52"></hs_TimeCode>
are we taking this choice away? No one has to opt for a lump sum but,
as long as it is an informed choice, it may be absolutely the right
choice for them. Government should not second-guess them and deny them
a choice. It is very silly. Contrary to what the Government believe, we
do not know what is best for all pensioners in all situations and we
should allow them to make the decisions they want and which work best
for them. In moving this amendment, I hope very much that the
Government reconsider their position on this as they are failing to see
the issues that are going to affect pensioners in the future,
particularly as we move into the field of social care and the need for
individual pensioners to pay for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:55:38"></hs_TimeCode>. I beg to

Lord Bishop of Chester:</Member></B> My Lords, I support this
amendment. The background seems to be one of a general lack of
provision for pensions for older people in the future. There is a major
shortage of 
<?notus-xml column=390?>pension savings, and my impression is that that is getting worse rather
than better, for all sorts of reasons. My experience of young
people—I use the word “young” to include people in
their 30s—is that they do not think about pensions as much as
they should. Anything we can do to encourage people to take a long-term
view and think for the future must be a good thing. The principle,
therefore, of deferring taking the state pension until you really need
it seems a healthy principle to encourage in our circumstances. My
anxiety is that, in the future, a lot of people are going to be very
short of money when they are older. It seems fundamentally right to do
anything we can to encourage that culture of not taking the pension
until you need
to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010849000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010849000015">If
you are going to encourage people to do that, maintaining the
flexibility so that they can either take additional income when they do
take their pension, or a lump sum in lieu of the money they save, seems
to be a sensible inducement. If you just look on it as an issue of
encouraging savings, one of the lessons of the last decade or so is
that we need to encourage the thought of saving in our culture. It may
be just as easy to take the pension and put it into a building society
account or whatever but why not offer the option of the Government
allowing the lump sum to be taken? Another reason for supporting the
amendment is the principle that if it ain’t broke, why do you
need to change it? What is wrong with the current arrangements that
means that we want to change
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T16:57:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

third reason for supporting this is that, in principle, I think there
should be parity with how we relate the state provision of pensions to
private provision, which normally allows the option of taking part of
the pension as a lump sum. That is an important principle of
flexibility and, indeed, defined benefit schemes now typically make
that option more available than they used to. There seems to be a
simplicity—to use the Minister’s point—in treating
state pension and private pension arrangements in broadly
similar

relation to the Amendment 31A moved by my noble friend Lord Browne, the
Minister, quite sensibly, prayed in aid the existing rules and said
that the provisions simply reflected that. In essence, that was his
argument for continuity. Here, he is proposing something quite
different—he is proposing to take away a freedom and a choice
that have existed for some considerable time from people who want to
defer claiming their state pension. We should not do that unless there
is a compelling reason for so doing. The principle of choice for people
retiring should be preserved. They might want to, for whatever
reason—and maybe the Minister would not agree with the
reason—take their deferred pension as a lump sum. I cannot think
of any good reason why we should not allow them to continue to do that.

agree with the right reverend Prelate. We should be doing all we can,
given the scale of the demographic changes that have taken place in our
society, to encourage people to consider deferring taking their state
pension. It could well be that one of the arguments that some people
would find attractive is that they would be entitled to a lump sum if
they were to exercise that choice. Sadly, in this country we do not
have a savings culture. It is a great shame, but we do not and we
should not pretend that we do. I accept that for many noble Lords the
sums we are talking about here as a lump sum would be very small but
for many pensioners they could be very significant. Why are we taking
away from pensioners the opportunity, at this point in their lives, of
having something that looks like a capital sum, which they can choose
to spend in whatever way they like? Why on earth would we consider that
to be a rational thing for Parliament to do at this

exercise the choice to defer their state pension claim a lump sum? That

an issue of principle and I do not think this House, or Parliament,

state pension as a lump sum if they choose to do so. That should be

amendment and I wholeheartedly support the points my noble friends Lady
Hollis and Lord Hutton and the right reverend Prelate have raised. The
Government are reserving the right to defer but, of course, making it
more expensive. I think the savings the Government ultimately get from
this are in the order of £300 million, because it is going to be
dealt with on an actuarial basis rather than the current way. I do not
know if it is possible to split the saving between that resulting from
the denial of the lump sum and that which is otherwise simply a result
of the different actuarial calculation. It would be helpful to have
that split, if it could be done. We await the final rates, which are
going to be dealt with in regulations.</hs_para>

sums is very important. We need to think about people who might have a
health impairment. There is no impaired annuity equivalent under state

increments arising from deferral, as I understand it, but they can, of
course, inherit a cash sum that has been
saved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010856000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010856000005">The
point has been made about the equivalence between the private sector
and the state sector. Many people to date have not accessed private
savings. Thank goodness auto-enrolment is in place now, courtesy of my

provision and that will provide them with an opportunity many of them

what this all means for the public finances? I presume a lump sum paid
on day one in a sense scores against public finances in that

then received at a higher rate going forward. I do not know whether
this is part of the Government’s considerations, but I hope not

differences in relation to pension credit. A modest capital sum is
ignored for pension credit but, of course, a supplement and income

support the point that no great rationale has been advanced why the
lump sum and other deferments should be denied and I hope we can agree
across the Room that it should be reinstated in the

Government have the mandate for this, but it is there now. They are
understandably trying to look at pensions as a whole, and saving for
retirement, hopefully through a personal pension scheme and through the
state scheme. We would support that. However, it is taking a very
different principle to the one that applies in private schemes. It will
only apply, of course, where the individual says, “I am going to
defer my pension”. It is not a case of saying, “I want to
take some of my pension in a lump sum”. It is also taking choice
away from people. You cannot say, on the one hand, that we want people
to have choice, to save and to be in charge of their own income when
they retire, and do everything you can to encourage them, but then, in
this particular aspect, say, “No, we the state know better than
you do”. Even if the Minister cannot do so today, I hope he will

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, in speaking to these

of the nature of the Government’s objections to the taking of
lump sums. My noble friend Lady Hollis has done your Lordships’
Committee two favours. One is in raising this issue, which has captured
the mood of the Committee quite clearly. The second is in rehearsing
accurately the explanation by Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, in the
House of Commons, as to why there is opposition to the taking of lump
sums. In my recollection, the arguments were as thin as my noble friend
made clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010856000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010856000011">My
noble friends, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Chester,
have explained very clearly the case for allowing lump sums.
Undoubtedly there is a savings crisis. Too many people do not have the
safety net of a rainy day fund or, in some cases, of any fund at all.
British households do not have enough money in savings, and the amount
they do have has been falling in recent years. This is, perhaps,
unsurprising given the 
<?notus-xml column=393?>cost of living crisis that we have been experiencing. The data on this
are very persuasive. ONS data show that 6% of pensioners—over
half a million people—live in households where the total
financial wealth is less than £10,000. Half—more than 4.8
million—live in a household where it is less than
£20,000. However, that is not the whole story. Given the
distribution within those bands, there must be a significant number of
retirees with little or no cash available in savings. Interestingly,
the ninth annual Scottish Widows pensions report stated that, of those
already retired, one-third are still paying off debts, including
mortgages. The average amount owed is in excess of
£5,500—£5,682 to be precise. It is not
as if those people are in a position to add to their savings in
retirement. In a survey in June 2013, the insurance giants LV reported
that nearly 2 million pensioners have an average £8 per week of
disposable income. By way of comparison, that is less than the average
eight year-old has as pocket money, according to another
survey.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010856000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010856000012">The
case made by my noble friends and the right reverend Prelate about why
people might need access to a lump sum deserves an answer. The lump-sum
payment option was introduced in April 2005. I think my noble friend
Lady Hollis was the Minister who oversaw its introduction. The
reasoning then was the same as the case she has made today. Even if
pensioners go into retirement with a just adequate income, they may
well not have enough savings to deal with the rainy day problems we all
face. Never mind the challenge of the eventual cost of their own
burial, what happens if the boiler fails in a bitterly cold winter? Or
the car that they require in a rural environment breaks down and they
are otherwise trapped in their home? We can all think of circumstances
in which a bit of capital would be of help.</hs_para>

defer their pensions. Drawing on the DWP’s own statistics, in
March 2013, 1.2 million pensioners, or 9%, were receiving an income
arising from a deferred pension, of whom 75% were women and 77% were
living in the UK. We know that few of those who choose to defer take
the lump-sum option; 63,000 payments were made in 2011-12, and the DWP
forecasts that that will fall to 35,000 by 2017-18. In 2011-12, the
average lump sum was £11,500, with the UK average being
£13,700 and the overseas average £4,100. These are not
significant sums, and the calculation could be done as to what this is
likely to cost based on these statistics.</hs_para>

things that we do not know. First, we do not know why people choose to
defer. Of those deferring, 75% are women, but the question is whether
they are waiting until their partner retires to draw their pensions or
there is some other motivation we do not know about. Are those who
defer still working, deferring their retirement perhaps because they
have saved too little and it is too early for them to retire? What do
we know about the wealth of those who defer? Very little. The
statistics already deployed show that 25% are overseas residents. Do we
know why they make the choices that they do? We do not.</hs_para>

like to understand the costs better. The DWP tells us that spending on
lump sums currently costs about £800 million per annum and is 
<?notus-xml column=394?>due to fall to £700 million in real terms, although I am not sure
by when. Obviously, these people have not been drawing their pensions
for the period during which they deferred, so I presume that that is
not a net cost—but maybe my presumption is wrong and it is. If
it is not, what is the cost of the lump sum minus the pension forgone?
What is the net cost of these deferrals in real terms? If there is a
net cost, what rate would have to be offered to make the lump sum a
cost-neutral
choice?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010856000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010856000016">Finally,
I would like to understand why the Government want to end this. Is it
the cost? Is it the administration? Is it the desire for simplicity?
Are the Government sure that they know enough about the impact of this
policy and the relatively small numbers who choose to defer? If not,
has the Minister or his department considered further research on who
is deferring? If it turns out primarily to be people with no or too
little savings, what other option would he suggest for those who are
retired and have no nest egg now, on what are likely to be low incomes
with no means or opportunity to build up such a nest egg or
capital?</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, as several noble Lords have said, the
Bill does not provide an option for those deferring a single-tier
pension to receive a lump-sum payment. Instead, the deferral
arrangements will be simplified. Those who defer will receive a weekly
increase in their state pension, enabling them to improve their pension
income for retirement. Looking at some of the relevant figures, I can
confirm the figure given by the noble Lord, Lord Browne, of 1.2 million
people receiving an increment in March 2013, which was around 9% of the
state pension case load. We had 63,000 lump sums taken in the latest
year for which we have figures, 2011-12. In response to the query of
the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, two-thirds of those are women and
one-third are men. However, under the new system, we expect that that
is likely to change, and I will go into that in a little while. A
primary objective for the reforms is to simplify the state pension and
to provide a simpler foundation for private saving.</hs_para>

going to give the cost figures, which the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie,
asked about. The savings from removing the lump sum in isolation from
the change in the increment rate are around 85% of the overall deferral
savings for 2030, which are outlined in the impact assessment. That
figure will be between £250 million and £300 million in
2030.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_08_PT_1/41443310D6735C69A7A9E2B0F584EF5DBA79584B" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 8 January 2014">Wednesday,

it is a better buy for the individuals receiving it, why does it

things may be possible. First, I tempt him to express a view on whether
he thinks that it would be a good thing to encourage people in their
retirement to have some capital, rather than encouraging individual
people to defer a pension or whatever. As a point of principle, would
it not be better for us if our retired population had access to some
capital that would cover these rainy-day situations?</hs_para>

to take advantage of the Bill, in the way in which the Minister has
suggested pensioners can do, by deferring taking pensions for a year
and then taking that as a lump sum or by some other simple method to
create an opportunity for people to take a deferred pension lump sum to
provide that capital? I am struck that it should not necessarily be the
case that the only way of doing this is to import a very complicated
existing procedure as a method of taking a lump sum, and then finding
that that confounded the argument for simplicity. Is it not worth
spending some time to see whether there is a simpler method of doing
this, such as perhaps an extension of what the Minister has tempted us

worrying about, then the arrears approach is not a huge distance away
from what they might find quite attractive. The best thing that I can
do is try to spell that out in a bit more detail in a rather considered
letter to Members of the Committee, to see if it addresses their
concerns. The counterpoint is that a lot of people take their nest egg
and blow it on a car. Concern about the no-savings culture is the other
side of the lump sum coin and those people will face later old age, if
they live a long time, poorer than they otherwise would have been
because it is a complicated decision. I will think a little bit harder
about the arrears issue we have discussed because it might give noble

much, but I need to spell out how that might

make one point before I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her
amendment. I know she always concentrates on the impact on women when
it comes to pensions, for very good reasons. Historically, far more
women than men deferred their state pension, but we expect the gender
ratio to equalise as the pension age for women is aligned with that for
men. Even allowing for an equal state pension age, women will typically
draw their state pension for longer than men. Therefore, for women, the
lump sum is likely to be less financially advantageous, and increments
are likely to provide a better rate of return than for men. With that
look into the future, and coming the closest I can go to giving any
advice to anyone, I ask the noble Baroness to withdraw her
amendment.</hs_para>

all Members of the Committee. I am sorry we did not hear from the Lib
Dem Benches as we would then have had a full hand. I am grateful
particularly to my noble friend Lady Dean, to my noble friend Lord
Hutton for raising the debate in the way he did and to the right
reverend Prelate for his persistent questioning. Both my noble friends
continue to interrogate the Minister, which is really valuable. The
right reverend Prelate said, “If it is not broken, why fix
it?”. I have seen no evidence at all, apart from the Minister
saying this is not such a good buy for individuals as taking it as
income, that the system is broken. The Government 
<?notus-xml column=399?>are relying on having the upfront savings rather than the longer-term
costs. That is not, in my view, a prudent way of handling
finance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000003">My
noble friend Lord Hutton, along with the right reverend Prelate,
stressed that it is no use saying that we have to go for simplicity and
thereby remove choice, if choice would be part of the attraction for
people to save and defer taking their state pension. We do not have
hard evidence on this, but we know from everything that is coming
through from auto-enrolment and the pilots—including under my
noble friend—that the nudge theory of encouraging people to stay
opted-in and having them opt out rather than choosing to opt in was
transformative. I remember when we got the figures from the Newcastle
brewery, where something like 43% of its staff opted in to a pension.
When it went to opting out, that went up to over 90%, and the only
people opting out were students working in the summer vac. It
transformed the pension regime in that brewery. It relied on nudge and
inertia and ensuring that people could save in the way that was least
problematic for them. Unless the Minister can show noble
Lords—certainly me—that denying people the right to turn
a deferred state pension into a lump sum will not only not have a
negative effect on their savings but actually increase their savings,
he is storing up problems for himself in the future.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> To go back to the point of how people use their
lump sum, it is towards the latter end of the pension drawdown period
that you are going to need to pay for care. It is exactly at that time
that any lump sum taken earlier will have been used up on other
expenditure. That is why this is such a difficult area. A lump sum
taken at 70 is probably not going to be around when social care is
needed in the late 70s, for
instance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" PimsId="996" UID="14010867000077" xid="1545" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000077">Baroness
Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> How does the Minister know? I
represented one of the poorest wards in the city of Norwich and the
pensioners I know were desperate to have a lump sum. Very often, they
cast it in terms of paying for funerals, because that was a
working-class, respectable-culture consideration. They desperately
wanted savings and they did not have them. They managed weekly.
Sometimes their daughters might help out with the odd bit of groceries
when they did their shopping but the notion is that you can read across
from people in the private sector having a car or
holiday.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000007">The
same arguments apply to equity release. We know the research on equity
release. We know that if people take it very early they may spend it on
white-good replacement or on trying to keep up a standard of living but
we also know that, as they grow older, they tend to take it for
personal care. If, as the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=400?>suggests, he believes that it is going to be blown, why, for example,
are his Government continuing to keep a tax-free lump sum? By his own
argument, we should scrap that, on the grounds that the Government know
better than the taxpayer how to spend the taxpayer’s money. We
should instead roll it into the basic pension that people have from
their occupational fund because we know that only between 11% and 13%
of pensioners use their tax-free lump sum to increase their pension;
instead they use it to give themselves savings. We know that from the
private sector. We have no reason to think that it would not apply
here. I am amazed that the Minister seems to think that there are
different cultures between those who have private, occupational
pensions and those who do not. As a result, we are making it harder and
harder for the poorest to have what each and every one of us
wants—a modest cushion against, as my noble friend Lord Browne
said, the rainy day. The Minister, the Government or the department
seem to be pulling that possibility away from people for no good
reason.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010867000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000008">My
noble friend Lord McKenzie asked about health impairment. The Minister
did not answer that question at all. Under the new scheme, a spouse
would not be able to inherit a deferred income that was accumulated by
their deceased spouse but they could inherit the lump sum. That, too,
is unfair. The couple have made a decision together that that is what
they will do. They can take it in one form, but not in the other. Why?
That is just the point at which the spouse may wish to have the cushion
of a lump sum and is not able to inherit it. It is unfair.</hs_para>

choose to look at my other consideration, which has not been discussed
today. Perhaps I should have raised it in my opening speech. Once you
hit retirement age, if you carry on working, you are not entitled to
continue to build up national insurance contributions. I think you
should be able to do so, with employer input, although maybe that is a
debate for another
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000010">Drawing
on the report from Scottish Widows, my noble friend Lord Browne
emphasised how many people retire with debt, including mortgages. He is
absolutely right. Taking a lump sum that actually pays off that debt,
which it would take years to accumulate through a modestly increased
pension, may be the most prudent thing that those people can do,
because that debt may require a much higher rate of payments to keep it
covered than any other income that they could get. It could be through
a loan company, for example, where they were paying APRs of 300%, 500%
or 1,000%. A lump sum would pay that off and therefore increase the
robustness of the rest of their income. That is what you can do with
capital—you cannot do it with income. Again, I hope that the
Minister will reflect on this. I know that he is concerned about
people’s indebtedness as they go into retirement, and by freeing
them from a burden of debt he would actually improve their financial
ability to cope once in
retirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000011">The
Minister argued about the cost of the lump sum. He seemed to suggest
that taking away the lump sum would produce 85% of the £800
million savings. I am completely baffled by that figure. What he is
doing is removing the up-front cost of paying a lump sum 
<?notus-xml column=401?>while paying out over a period of time at a higher cost to the
Government. There is therefore a break-even point, five or maybe seven
years down the line, at which the Government incur additional
cost—not reduced cost—by getting rid of the lump sum.
Obviously it  is less financially attractive; a return of 2.5%
or 3% is less attractive than the return of 5.4% that he is proposing.
In that case, how can the Government say simultaneously that they are
going to save money by getting rid of the lump sum and that if a person
takes it as deferred income instead they will be better off? He is
going to have to do some nimble footwork—I am sure he will be
able to do so—to explain to the noble Lords how he gets to those
savings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000012">The
Minister helpfully said that people could already take a deferred
pension at the end of one year as arrears of £7,500. If he were
able to say that two years could be taken as arrears, I would be
satisfied because that would give people the cushion that they would
need, or some such flexibility. I take heart from the fact that he has
responded, as I was confident that he would, to the range of feeling
around the Room that this is simply the wrong way to go. All parties
have genuinely attended to pensioners’ incomes, and the present
Government—I include both members of the coalition—as
well as the previous one are entitled to claim high credit for that. It
is a very good achievement for us to have taken pensioners out of
income poverty. However, we are sending them into retirement with
increased capital poverty. If we wish, we have the option of allowing
them to do something about that. To say that we are removing the choice
to address capital poverty in the name of simplicity is, frankly,
Orwellian, and normally I would expect better from the Minister than
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010867000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000013">Under

German (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment is an attempt to find
an alternative approach to the solution of the anomaly of what is known
in common parlance as the frozen pensions issue. At Second Reading I
asked my noble friend if I could see the correspondence 
<?notus-xml column=402?>between other Governments where there were UK pensioners receiving only
the frozen pension, in order to try to identify whether the idea of
moving forward on the basis of reciprocal arrangements was actually
going to be productive and would produce some way forward. It is
clearly an anomaly; there are currently approximately 600,000 UK
pensioners living outside the UK who get their pensions uprated in the
same way as if they were living in the UK. At the same time, we do not
uprate the pensions of about 550,000 UK pensioners, most of whom live
in Commonwealth countries. All, of course, have made the appropriate
financial contribution for their pension and many of them have
relocated to be near family members. Many of them are former members of
the British Armed
Forces<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:48:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14010867000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000070">5.45

purpose is to try to probe and examine whether there is any benefit now
in looking at reciprocal arrangements between this country and the
countries where we do not have reciprocal arrangements, to see if there
is any mutual benefit in such an approach. There may well be a quid pro
quo for other countries to seek a way of ensuring that this is of
mutual benefit to the United Kingdom and to the country concerned. If
that were the case, we might be able to challenge the approach taken

crucial words there, of course, are “mutually

which the pension starts to be uprated and the secondary cost there
might be if 
<?notus-xml column=403?>there were challenges, perhaps through legal procedures, to previous
payments which had not been uprated. Attempts to determine what
precisely those might be have led to a large range of figures being
provided in this area. However, in the document that we have before us,
which my noble friend’s department released, the estimate of the
cost of the first of those categories is, by 2014-15, £590
million a year. That is the cost of uprating in that year if you start
the process for those people whose pensions have been frozen. That is
significantly less, by the way, than the earlier quote of around
£700 million, which we heard from the House of Commons
procedures on this

understand that there have been no reciprocal agreements between the
United Kingdom and another country covering the uprating of pensions
since 1981. My noble friend helpfully tells us that this is because of
the costs involved—I have just outlined the costs that we are
talking about—and because it would lead to calls from other
countries to negotiate similar agreements. However, if the reciprocal
arrangement is to the mutual benefit of the other country and the
United Kingdom, it is clearly in our interest to pursue and discuss
these matters. The message that that would send to the Governments of
other countries would be, “Don’t bother to negotiate with
us unless the package that you can produce is to the mutual benefit of

the UK Government do not know what they would be receiving, in a

discussions, my noble friend cannot answer the question, “What
would be mutually beneficial for the United Kingdom in the Canadian
Government’s offer?”. My plea to him is that if, as I
suspect, we do not know the sorts of offer that the Canadian Government
might provide to the United Kingdom and whether that would lead to
something of benefit to each side, perhaps we ought to have these
discussions so that we can resolve the anomaly at least for some of
these people. If there were such an agreement, that would encourage the
Governments of other countries, notably New Zealand and Australia, to
come up with a deal that  
<?notus-xml column=404?>was mutually beneficial to them and the United Kingdom. I do
not know what was in the mind of the Canadian Government, but they

conclude with a remark made by a former Canadian high commissioner to

me that an excellent bilateral relationship is one in which, when an

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I had not expected to come in
on this, but I am intrigued by the concept of mutual advantage to both
countries. I have never been in a position to support—I use
those words appropriately, I hope—the proposition that we have
reciprocal relationships. That is primarily because the main
beneficiaries are the UK citizens who have gone to the major
Anglo-Saxon countries: Canada, above all Australia, to a lesser extent
New Zealand, and South Africa. Obviously, there is free movement within
the European Union. I am sure that the Minister will correct me if my
stats are wrong, but when I last looked at this the reason why it was
so costly—the figure used to be £400 million but I
understand that it has gone up to over £600 million—was
that four times or more British citizens go to those countries than
come back to the UK. Therefore, I cannot see how it can be mutually
advantageous if the UK is committed to spending four times as much pro
rata as, say, the Australian Government—if those are the
appropriate figures—in reverse. If it is the case, as I believe
it to be, that so many more people are emigrating to those countries
than come back to the UK to retire, essentially it is a one-way bid.
That is why so many of us are concerned about this proposition. In
Australia, particularly—I have less knowledge of New
Zealand—there is income-related support which amplifies any
state pension that someone may have brought with them from the UK. It
is obviously means-tested but it ensures that those UK citizens have at
least a minimally adequate income, so we are not talking about dire
poverty, particularly as many of these people have retired and gone to
join their
families<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:55:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000023">It
is also the case—this was argued all the way up to the European
courts, which found in favour of the British Government—that
increments to the British pension in the UK were granted in the light
of wider considerations of social policy, and to deal specifically with
increased costs of living reflected in increased earnings within the
UK. If you were to track the relevant figures—for example, in
South Africa—you may well find that because of changes in
currency rates, employment rates or wages, the British pension may well
be worth more in the home country than in the country to which the
retired person has moved as it was designed to deal with the UK
situation. For many years when the state pension was first introduced
there were no automatic increases at all. They were introduced as a
regular item under the Wilson Government. Then, fairly quickly, Mrs
Thatcher,  after four years, separated the provision from
earnings and attached it to prices, but only since then have  
<?notus-xml column=405?>we assumed regular increments, which is why the problem possibly did not
arise in those early reciprocal arrangements. The pension was designed
to deal with the British cost of living and not with costs
abroad<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000024">As
long as people emigrating or retiring to those countries where there is
no reciprocal arrangement have full information about the financial
implications of their choice—that is key—then they make
that decision with their eyes open to what it means. Given that the
Government are seeking to impose cuts on British pensions here for
widows, and cuts in universal credit, income for disabled people and so
on, I could not support seeing £600 million go to people who
have made an informed decision to leave this country. If we were to
have reciprocal arrangements, it would result in cuts to other very
beleaguered
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T17:58:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Browne of Ladyton" PimsId="5822" UID="14010867000081" xid="2084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000081">Lord

explanation of the motivation behind his amendment. We had the benefit

when I looked at the mechanism he had chosen, I was slightly concerned
that he was seeking to empower the Government to act in breach of the
EU and international law in the form of bilateral treaties, and that he
felt so strongly on the issue that anything which budged the status quo
was worth arguing for. However, I understand his motivation and am
intrigued by the questions that he asked, and those which my noble
friend Lady Hollis asked, about how one can—specifically in
regard to Canada—come to some mutually beneficial agreement in
these circumstances. He is right to be intrigued by that. These are the
words of the Canadian Minister and, if that is the offer that they are
making, it would be interesting to know the extent to which the

that, as I wait in anticipation of the Minister’s response to
these interesting questions, to Amendment 33B. Before I come to the
argument for it I should say, as was explained by my honourable friend
Gregg McClymont in the debate on this issue in the Commons, that we are
not hostile to the government position of continuing not to uprate
pensions in countries where they are not currently uprated. It would be
extremely difficult to explain why we had not done this in years of
government if we were now to take this position. We have the benefit of
the Government’s estimate of the cost of doing so.</hs_para>

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, we have the benefit of the
Government’s estimate of the cost of uprating those pensions
that are not presently uprated, 
<?notus-xml column=406?>which is in the region of £700 million, plus of course the
possibility of significant backdating. Once payment began then the
arguments for backdating would subsequently follow; I do not think that
that would be unexpected. We on these Benches agree that at present
this is not a priority for our country, and that the cost is
important.</hs_para>

to the justification and the reason for Amendment 33B. We promote this
review for many of the same reasons that the noble Lord, Lord German,
promotes his questions on engagement—to help us to reach a
definitive and informed judgment on the costs and benefits of uprating.
We are not calling on the Government to uprate. If the analysis that we
call for, which we understand is capable of being done on a
cross-governmental basis, has been done in whole or in part, then we
would welcome the information that is available because it would help
our understanding of the necessary information and the calculation of
the costs and benefits. By this method we seek to inform the debate,
and that is the consistent approach of our amendments calling for a
review in different parts of the Bill.</hs_para>

this issue is not going to go away; I think that we all appreciate
that. In fact, as my honourable friend Sheila Gilmore made clear in the
House of Commons, it is impossible to be a Member of that House without
being assailed by the impressive campaign consistently being run by
those who feel aggrieved because they have not benefited from uprating
over a lengthy period. Indeed, many noble Lords have also been assailed
by these arguments in correspondence. I remember, at the time when I
was in the House of Commons, receiving correspondence regularly and
indeed, on occasions, people at my constituency advice surgeries who
were home-visiting relatives coming to argue and make the
points for uprating in a very forceful fashion.</hs_para>

campaigned for uprating for these frozen pensions have been encouraged
in that campaign at various times by senior politicians. Mischievously,
I cannot resist the temptation to remind noble Lords that in 2004, when
the Pensions Bill was passing through Parliament, the now Pensions
Minister Stephen Webb told campaigners,</hs_para>

pensioners who earned their pensions by paying national insurance
contributions have a strong case for the value of that pension being
maintained in line with inflation, and I am actively seeking such a
change. As you may be aware, there is currently a Pension Bill passing
through Parliament. I will take this opportunity to table an amendment,
seeking to uprate the ‘frozen pensions’ of
expatriates”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14010867000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000058">My
researches have not gone to the extent of trying to find out whether or
not he did in fact promote such an amendment, but he
certainly indicated his intention to do so. He has clearly changed his
mind, and I suspect that he may not be the last Back-Bencher to find
his words in the surgery haunting him once he is in ministerial office.
It was once famously said by someone that when the facts changed, he
changed his mind. Here the facts have not changed—they have been
consistently the same—but the mind has changed.</hs_parafo>

issue, as we know, is not ever present in our media, but comes up
periodically, and will continue to do so. We need to engage with it in
a constructive way. Not unreasonably, in my view, does the
International Consortium of British Pensioners seek a proper assessment
of the impact of overseas pensioners on the public finances. It asks
for consideration to be given to the benefit that the UK economy gets
from the expatriate pensioners who reside outside the EU. In moving
this amendment, we are seeking just such a review, the purpose of which
is to inform this debate and to allow a judgment to be made about the
Government’s estimate of the cost—in short, whether it is
the true
cost<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000033">In
the Commons, the Pensions Minister opposed this amendment. In doing so,
he left significant questions unanswered and I hope that the Minister
will be encouraged to engage with these. Is it the Government’s
view that an analysis of this nature would be difficult to undertake?
In particular, is it the Government’s view that a review would
unfairly raise expectations? In Committee, Steve Webb, the Pensions
Minister, told the House of Commons that only 2% of British pensioners
move overseas as pensioners. He went on to say that a significant
number move just before retiring. Do the Government have statistical
evidence to support that assertion, or is it based on other
information? Any further clarity that the Minister can give to the
principle of this matter would be very
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000034">Finally,
the Pensions Minister said that he remained sympathetic to the case. Do
the Government remain sympathetic to the case? If so, and if financial
circumstances allowed, would they be willing to uprate these pensions?
With respect, I think that is the most interesting question of the

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis,
pointed out, the policy on the uprating of state pensions for
pensioners abroad is a long-standing one. It has been regularly debated
over the years. Clause 20 provides an enabling power for regulations to
restrict the availability of annual uprates, as now, in the new state
pension where the recipient is living overseas. The Government’s
intention is that there will be no difference in treatment between the
new and old state pensions as to overseas uprating, either generally or
with regard to the UK’s various bilateral agreements. I can
reassure noble Lords that all our existing legal obligations with
regard to uprating of pensions under bilateral
agreements—along with the European co-ordination
regulations—will continue to be honoured. To treat the new
single-tier pension differently to the current pension would clearly go
against the spirit of these agreements. However, I should make it clear
that there are no current plans to enter into any new social security
bilateral
agreements<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000036">There
are a number of factors to be considered behind that decision. These
are the number of people moving between countries, the benefits
available under the other country’s scheme, the compatibility of
systems and how far and to what extent reciprocity can be achieved.
Future costs are also considered in both the implementation and future
operation of any agreement. A bilateral agreement with Australia
existed in 2001 when Australia ended it because of a dispute around 
<?notus-xml column=408?>the current UK policy on uprating UK state pensions paid overseas. There
are no plans to enter into a new bilateral agreement with Australia, as
any agreement would not achieve reciprocity between it and the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000037">I
shall pick up the Canadian point. Bilateral agreements cover social
security matters only, rather than matters beyond this scope which
might be described as mutually beneficial. DWP officials are not aware
of a discussion or correspondence on this wider scope of mutually
beneficial arrangements. I cannot confirm the figures provided by the
noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on whether four times more go to Australia
than come back, but she is normally well
informed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T18:20:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000038">I
need to make information available on the numbers. We are in the
process of updating and quality assuring our estimate of the cost of
unfreezing pensions for 2014-15. The department has moved from
modelling change to the case load at a population level to a more
complex methodology, which takes account of individual characteristics
and provides a more accurate estimate when applied to historic data. As
a consequence, we now estimate that the cost of extending the uprating
of pensions currently paid overseas is slightly reduced but it will
still represent a substantial cost to UK taxpayers of more than
£0.5 billion per annum. My noble friend is right in saying that
this is somewhat below the previous estimate, based on general
populations, of £700 million. The department has recently
released a statistical publication that clarifies this matter, to which
I can refer noble Lords if they need more
information<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T18:21:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on whether people have full information,
the department issues the following leaflets which include information
on the impact of living outside the UK and the annual uprating increase
for UK state pensions: leaflet BR 23, leaflet DWP040 and leaflet
DWP026. The 040 leaflet is sent out with the state pension statement,
for instance. Information is available on the government website and
<I>Social Security Abroad</I>, leaflet NI138, issued by HMRC, and also
includes similar

name of the noble Lord, Lord Browne, on reviewing overseas
residents’ provision assumes that we would be able to identify
and assess the behavioural link between uprating policy and migration
patterns. The question about a review is whether it would raise
expectations. The noble Lord posed the question about whether we would
uprate if we had the money. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, was spot
on when she raised the issue about making very difficult decisions on
payments. Finding £500 million is not an easy
business. Clearly, there will always be different priorities for
£500 million per annum, as indeed the previous Government
decided at a time when there appeared to be more money floating around
than there appears to be today. I will not step on anyone’s
grave in the collegiate atmosphere of this Committee.</hs_para>

raised by the noble Lord, Lord Browne, was on the numbers of
pension-age people moving abroad. That comes from the document from the
ONS called <I>Emigration from the UK, November 2012,</I> which
states:</hs_para>

cent (or 6,000) of those emigrating were over the state pension age of
60 for women and 65 years for
men”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14010867000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000059">The
report also interestingly indicates that 10% were aged between 45 and
59/64
years.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14010867000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000042">We
are aware of research that suggests that a theoretical and economic
case can be made to support the uprating of state pensions for all
recipients abroad. However, it is notable that this analysis has not
been able to provide evidence of a proven behavioural link between
uprating and pensioner migration. In fact, we think it unlikely that
any review would demonstrate that. In any case, the decision to
emigrate abroad remains a personal choice for individuals. In the
absence of that kind of evidence, we know that the cost of extending
the uprating of pensions currently paid overseas remains significant at
more than £0.5 billion per annum. The Government, like their
predecessors over the past 60 years, believe that they must
put the interests of pensioners living in the UK over the interests of
those living overseas by restricting the availability of uprates to
those living here or in a country where we have a legal or treaty
obligation to provide them. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw
his

German:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank noble Lords who have taken part
in this debate. It is an interesting one because in the words, I think,
of the noble Lord, Lord Browne, it is one that will not go away and
will continue to raise its head. I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Browne, for reminding noble Lords that at Second Reading I did preface
my remarks quite clearly by saying that I was not seeking to pay huge
amounts of money to deal with this matter in the manner that many
people have demanded or asked. It is a question of trying to find an
alternative approach, which is what I was seeking to do with this
amendment and in my earlier statements at Second Reading.</hs_para>

noble Lords have mentioned, people are putting pressure on noble Lords
and Members of the other House to come up with some solutions. The
challenge is to think of a way in which an approach might be developed,
and I put one before noble Lords in this amendment. I hope it was quite
clear that the amendment was not seeking any approach beyond a quid pro
quo with another Government so that the message would be clear to any
other Government seeking to approach the United Kingdom on this issue.
Quite a number have approached the United Kingdom over the years,
including some quite surprising places such as Mongolia. If we are
going to go down this route, we need to ensure that there is a clear
message that there will be no additional costs to United Kingdom
plc.</hs_para>

what my noble friend said about reciprocity only being looked at from a
social security angle. However, that raises another point, on which I
echo some thoughts back to the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis. If income
comes to UK plc, providing the UK Government can redistribute
accordingly, there may well be opportunities in any agreement beyond
just simple social security. I think that has been consistently looked
at as the approach for all these reciprocal arrangements, right back to
the very beginning.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I am intrigued by the notion of it
being mutually advantageous. The noble Lord raised this—rightly
and in an interesting way—at Second Reading and again today and
has been understandably careful about not seeking to load a substantial
increase on the pensions bill for people who no longer live in this
country. When he talks about mutual advantage, he must have thought
about what that might look like. What suggestions has he got? What
propositions have been made? I cannot understand why it is about
anything other than money, to the advantage of people who have left the
country. Can he give us some indication of how his thinking might go in
that way because I am sure it would be of considerable interest to the
Committee?</hs_para><hs_time UID="14010867000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000074">6.30

German:</Member></B> Perhaps I could put inverted commas around the
comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, and refer them, and the
precise nature of this debate, to the Minister in Canada. I do not know
what was in their mind. My noble friend the Minister here cannot know
either, because of course they closed the door to any discussion with
the officials from the Canadian Government. However, we need a
discussion about this issue. It may well be that it is not with DWP
Ministers; it may need to be at some other level.</hs_para>

answer to the noble Baroness’s question. All I know is that the
Canadian Government believe that they have a mutually beneficial offer
to make. That seems to me to be worthy of further discussion; no more
than that. I make it clear that I am very much in favour of managing
expectations here. The amendment does not call for expenditure at the
levels which we have seen before us, and I do not wish to see a
reduction in social security expenditure for people currently living in
this country as a result. However, when an offer of that sort is made,
it is worthy of examination. If there were to be the sorts of things
that would make it mutually beneficial, and the Canadian Government
believe it to be mutually beneficial to adopt a procedure for Canadian
UK pensioners, then it is worth at least finding out what is on the
table. If it were to be a successful offer, that of course quite
clearly sends the message to other Governments that they can come up
with a deal that actually meets the expectations of this Government and
the British people.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I am sorry to interrupt the noble Lord
again; he is being very tolerant, for which I am grateful. Again, I am
relying on my memory, which is probably faulty, but something in the
order of 85% of overseas pensioners outside the EU are in the four
major Anglo-Saxon countries. However, the countries in which most of us
would recognise that there are anomalies are not so much the big four
Anglo-Saxon countries, which have decent social security systems for
poverty relief as a safety net and so on. This is about the mixed
history of some Caribbean islands, which came in under the net, before
1979, for protection of overseas pensioners, while others did not. Once
we started inflating pensions by the cost of living—I am not
sure that this was accidental—bilateral relations disappeared at
that point because they started to reflect the British cost of living.
Those countries are so 
<?notus-xml column=411?>poor that they are looking for a form of aid in the form of pensions.
How would the noble Lord justify coming to a mutually advantageous deal
with a relatively wealthy country like Canada while, because an
appropriately mutually advantageous offer could not be made with
Caribbean islands, that opportunity would be refused to some of the
poorer
countries?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010867000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000050"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord German" PimsId="5765" UID="14010867000088" xid="2039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#14010867000088">Lord

Government’s figures are quite clear. They say that 85% of all
those with frozen pensions live in Canada, New Zealand and Australia.
Those are huge numbers. One of the interesting things when you look at
these issues, as noble Lords will know, is that other countries produce
information, which comes to you in emails. The noble Baroness, Lady
Hollis, asked earlier about Australian pensions. I understand that they
are means-tested, but only by 50% of total income over the threshold,
so if the UK pension was increased by £20 then the Australian
pension would be reduced by the equivalent of £10. As we know,
it is not always as clear as we suggest.</hs_para>

I could not expect to hear an answer from my noble friend since the
discussion with officials was not allowed to take place. However, I
encourage that discussion to take place, even if it is over a cup of
tea with another group of officials at some stage. In a spirit of hope
that this will happen, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</hs_para>

to give us a chance to have a canter round the passporting issues. The
impact assessment has a section on passported benefits. We had a brief
excursion into these matters when we last met and have since had a
helpful letter from the Minister. The impact assessment sets it out
clearly:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1401097000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#1401097000014">“If

this has a limited impact on the proportion of pensioners who are

cynic might conclude that, when dealing with passported benefits, the
Government are seeking to play down the reduction in guarantee credit
recipients but are otherwise seeking to reassure us that single tier
will reduce means-testing. I accept the figures in the
Minister’s letter that in the 2040s there will be some 50,000
fewer households on guarantee credit than would have been the case
under the existing state pension arrangements. It is further accepted
that fewer will be on guarantee credit because their income has risen.
However, the working assumption is that STP will be set just marginally
above the guarantee credit level, so for notionally swapping pension
income for guarantee credit some 50,000 are notionally missing out on
passporting. Is this correct? What are the estimated savings to
government from this? There seems clearly to be no intent to compensate
in any way. As our documentation makes clear, the main driver of
reductions in pension credit is the demise of the savings credit. Chart
4.1 of the impact assessment shows—as a percentage of the
population reaching state pension age after the introduction of single
tier—the change in the composition of those eligible for pension
credit, but I cannot readily locate the absolute numbers of households
which lose savings credits and the notional average amounts. The chart
is done in percentage terms. Can the Minister help us on

far as the passporting of benefits is concerned, under current
arrangements most depend on guarantee credit. However, receipt of the
savings credit can unlock access to such benefits as cold weather
payments, affordable warmth obligations of energy companies and, until
abolition, working tax credit and child tax credit. How many pensioners
will have no access to cold weather payments under STP who would have
under the current arrangements? How much money are the Government

detailed arrangements of passporting to other benefits for single-tier
recipients who would, under the current system, have been receiving a
basic state pension with a modest private pension income above that
level. They would also ensure that mixed-age couples, where one member
has reached state pension age before 6 April 2016 and the
other after, would retain access to 
<?notus-xml column=414?>the savings credit. As noble Lords will be aware, the savings credit,
which is currently available to those aged 65 and over, will continue
to be available to those who reach state pension age before 6 April
2016, and mixed-age couples who are already in receipt on that date
will continue to receive it.</hs_para>

guarantee credit will continue to be available for the poorest,
regardless of when they reach state pension age, and receipt of the
guarantee credit will, for example, continue to give access to the warm
home discount scheme and to cold weather payments. Moreover, poorer
pensioners, in the bottom income quintile, are among the principal
beneficiaries of these reforms: more than half will be better off in
the first 25 years, with a median gain of £8 a week in 2040 and
£5 in
2020.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401094000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#1401094000011">The full
rate of the new single-tier pension will be set above the basic means
test. Where both members of a couple receive the full single-tier
pension, they will receive nearly a third more than the couple rate of
the pension credit standard minimum guarantee, based on 2013 rates.
This means state pension income alone will raise them above the
standard income level at which pension credit runs out. Savings credit
already rewards some couples for their state pension, which muddies the
original intention. Mixed-age couples, where one is on a full basic
state pension and the other a full single-tier pension, would also have
income above the couple’s standard minimum guarantee.</hs_para>

reforms is to remove access to savings credit for single-tier
households, which includes couples where one reaches state pension age

recipients and taxpayers in dealing with the conflict between the
individual basis of the single-tier pension and the household basis of
the savings credit. However, we will allow those mixed-age couples
already in receipt of savings credit on 6 April to retain it, if they

pick up the issue of why we include the example. The power in the Bill
will allow us to specify when the restrictions should and should not
apply. The example in new Section 3ZA(2) captures one situation where
we may wish to allow existing recipients to retain the entitlement, but
we may identify more situations as we work through the detail of single
tier. The numbers affected are likely to be small, with a maximum of
20,000 couples at any one time, and a total of 40,000 couples affected
at some time over their retirement, which is only 5% of an estimated
800,000 mixed-age couples. Of those potentially affected, only around
two-thirds would have claimed, because of the low take-up issue.
Changes in circumstances during retirement mean that, on average, a
mixed-aged couple would miss out for only seven years of their
retirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401094000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#1401094000015">The

from my specific question, which was exploring legislation by example,
I should perhaps correct what I said. In explaining this, I remember
suggesting that new Section 3ZA(2) was about the circumstances in which
somebody would be “entitled” to savings credit. However,
the wording is “not entitled to”. I wish to clarify that
for the purposes of the record. I am really not clear why the
Government choose to legislate by putting into primary legislation an
example of the only set of circumstances that they have currently come
across in which, specifically, a mixed-age couple would not be entitled
to savings credit and then say they expect that there are other sets of
circumstances out there but that they have not formulated them yet. Why
put in any example at all? What is the purpose of
it?</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> The purpose is that we want to retain the ability
to avoid cash losers. That is the purpose of this particular power. In
relation to the potential impact of the removal of savings credit on
passporting, I remind noble Lords that, while pension credit acts as a
passport to a number of other benefits, most are linked to receipt of
the guarantee credit rather than the savings credit. Housing benefit
and council tax reductions are not limited to pension credit
recipients; they can already be claimed on low-income grounds
regardless of receipt of pension credit, and this will continue.
Furthermore, there is a higher applicable amount for pensioners over 65
in housing benefit, essentially to ensure that the savings credit is
not itself means-tested away for those paying rent. This higher
applicable amount applies to all pensioners over 65, not just those
receiving savings credit. This provision will continue for at least as
long as housing benefit remains. As noble Lords may be aware, we
recently announced that there are no plans to change housing benefit
for pensioners until at least
2017-18.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401094000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#1401094000018">Unlike

it is important that we get to the bottom of it. We are seeking to
understand how many individuals who would get the savings credit under
current arrangements will not do so under the new arrangements in the
future, whether they are individuals or couples; I am not dealing here
with mixed-age couples. What is the average loss of income because of
the denial of savings credit? What is the benefit to government of
having restricted passporting of these individuals to a range of
benefits, except that some of them may have other routes to those
benefits? Of course, the cold weather payments depend on where they
live; I am not asking the noble Lord to assume that they go and live in
the Antarctic, Scotland or somewhere cold. Sorry, Des; I am in

is being made as a consequence of Part 2 of Schedule 12
which, among other things, amends and consolidates the provisions
dealing with category B pensions, which will continue to be available
to people reaching state pension age before the magic date of 6 April
2016. These provisions have recently been amended by the Marriage (Same
Sex Couples) Act 2013 in order to extend category B pensions to
same-sex spouses. This Bill already takes account of these recent
amendments. They are consolidated in paragraphs 55-61 and 63 of
Schedule 12. The amendments in the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act will
therefore be redundant when Schedule 12 comes into force so this

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, Subsections (2) to
(5) of Clause 24 and Schedule 14 give employers powers to amend
employee contributions and benefits in their occupational schemes to an
extent supposed to be limited to the cost of the extra national
insurance the employer will have to pay as a result of the end of
contracting out. I am totally opposed to this clause and also to
Schedule 14. The proposal potentially impacts on 1.6 million active
members of private sector DB schemes. It would enable any existing
protection for members’ benefits in legislation or scheme rules
to be overridden. This includes specific statutory protection given to
members in former nationalised industries when they were privatised and
also measures of protection that employers in times past have agreed to
write into their
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:03:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

contracting out and the associated increase in employer national
insurance is, in principle, no different from any other risk employers
with DB schemes might face and there is no sound justification for the
Government to disturb the existing balance of power in relation to
these schemes. The extra cost on employers is no greater than as might
arise in the event of a small change in market interest rates. There
was no suggestion of intervention to protect scheme members who lost
out when the Government, not so long ago, amended the statutory basis
of the pension increase from RPI to CPI. A number of us objected at the
time. Governments should allow the problems arising for employers on
this count to be dealt with through the established process whereby
changes can be effected by negotiation and agreement. An overriding
power based on being able to recover a set amount of cost could result
in great unfairness as there may be no correspondence between the
variable amounts members may gain from a single state pension and those
they may lose if employers are allowed to determine unilaterally the
form of contribution and benefit changes in occupational
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T19:04:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401094000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0001.htm#1401094000036">I
also recall, during my career as a trade union official a number of
years ago, how keen we were to negotiate what we then called
final salary schemes—  
<?notus-xml column=419?>DB schemes. As a result of the schemes that we negotiated then, there
have been beneficial changes for many pensioners. As we know, though,
after a certain number of years there was a bit of a campaign against
DB schemes, as a result of which a number of employers decided that
they would scale down their DB schemes. I have sensed that there
remains not a hostility but a lack of concern and support on the part
of the Government for DB schemes. These schemes excellently provided

the Government will take it away and rethink it. I am not the only
person to feel this; the Minister will notice that there are a number
of other amendments in this group, including my own Amendment 40, which
are designed to protect employees who were covered by existing
protections when they belonged to former nationalised industries that
were denationalised. As a result of that, there was legislation that
provided for protection. In fact, the protected persons were first
introduced by an Act of Parliament in 1948 and reaffirmed by the
Thatcher Government on the denationalisation of the electricity supply

there are consequences of contracting out, but under this clause and

employers to change established means of paying occupational pensions

actually make that worse by making it pretty explicit that the full
cost of that will, or at least can, fall on the employees so that not
only are the employers given the right not only to avoid the
consequences of that cost and place it on to the employees, which is
likely to have the knock-on effect of people opting out of the schemes,
but they are overriding the long-established system whereby such
schemes are governed by trustees representing the employers, the
contributing members and often the pensioners in those schemes. To
override the whole system of pension trustees that we have had in place
for the past 40 or so years with regard to private occupational
pensions is a very serious step. There are particular consequences in
the area where statutory protections are built in. Past Governments
have given guarantees that can be overridden by this

clearly, abolishing contracting out means abolishing DB schemes. The
national insurance rebates to both employees and employers currently
run at 1.4% and 3.4% on a band of earnings, so they are not
insignificant amounts of money. The Bill will give this statutory
override to the employers effectively to recoup that loss of their NI
rebate by a choice of one of two options: increasing the
employees’ contributions or reducing the value of the future
benefits to be accrued. Not all employers need this statutory override
to make that adjustment. It is quite clear that the closures and
benefit changes of the past 10 years are evidence enough of that.
However, there will be some schemes where employers cannot do that
without trustee consent.

confess to articulating that view myself some years ago; it may well
have been a factor in deciding what route one takes, and at what speed,
to a flat-rate pension scheme. However, I am not persuaded by that
argument any more. The compelling arguments that employers mobilise for
closure of DB schemes are, first, that they simply do not want to bear
the risks and the costs any more and, secondly, that they simply do not
want to meet the impact of volatility and deficits in the funding of
the scheme on their company balance sheets. Even with the continuation
of the contracted-out rebate, we have seen private sector
contracted-out DB active membership declining from nearly 6 million in
1980 to an expected 950,000 by 2016. I am therefore not sure that I
accept the raison d’être. I am not going to pursue that
point but I mention it because I think it is a vain hope that this

with the trustees. I know that it is the Government’s intention
to remove any requirement for agreement with the trustees—that
is the driver of the amendment—but there is no explicit
provision in the Bill for any consultation with the trustees. In
Schedule 14 there is some limit on the employer’s power in
Clause 2—for example, the employer cannot increase the amount of
the annual employee contributions by more than the employer’s
annual increase in national insurance contributions as a result of the
abolition of contracting out. However, certain key definitions, such as
exactly what amount the employer is entitled to recoup, are to be set
out in regulations. Unless I have missed something and the Minister

be negative regulations. Even if they are positive regulations, my

the employer’s power whereby, for example, if an increase in
employee contributions would trigger an increase in the
employer’s contribution, further amendments can be made to the
scheme to prevent the employer’s contributions increasing.
Similarly, if reducing future benefits would lead to a decrease in
employees’ contributions, this power can be used to ensure that
those contributions are not decreased. This expansion of the
employer’s power introduces more complexity, particularly in a
multi-employer shared cost scheme—for example, the railways
pension scheme—which I suspect is part of the driver behind the
Government’s amendment.</hs_para>

ever-increasing complexity as employers, actuaries and pension lawyers

face of such complexity, it should be absolutely and unequivocally
clear in the Bill that trustees have the right to be consulted. Even if
the Government do not want to concede to trustees that they have to
concur with or agree to the change, it is nonsense not to make it
explicit that there is a right of consultation. If the Government are
concerned that consultation with trustees could delay the single tier
implementation timetable of April 2016, they should set consultation
time limits in regulations. That is not without precedent. Trustees can
be held to time limits on consultation. The bringing forward of the
implementation date is not of itself a reason for removing an explicit

statutory override will be very difficult to operate in multi-employer
schemes as there is more than one employer. They will have different
views on if, when and how they want to exercise the override. Depending
on how many employers and how many variations on a principle are
exercised, the trustees could potentially be faced with a bedlam of a
situation. Again, there is no explicit requirement in the Bill to
consult on these 
<?notus-xml column=423?>measures. Statutory overrides are not mechanisms to be used lightly.

the existing arrangements anyway? So, if you freeze its value in 2016

the employer reduces future benefits? How will the regulations work in

Government are going to be under considerable pressure to release
details of these regulations so that employers can start to prepare for
2016. Most of the consultation is with the employers, so it is really
important that that level of protection where both actuaries have to
concur that a change deduced under this statutory override meets the
regulations should be in the Bill. There is an even greater defence for
my argument. The majority of private sector active members contracted
out of DB schemes are concentrated into the biggest schemes. Of the 1.6
million active members in schemes, 1.2 million are in schemes with more
than 5,000 active members. This means that the total membership of the
scheme will be much bigger because there are 5,000 active members.
These regulations will be drafted under pressure from an influential
group of employers so it is important that, if the Bill is to provide a
statutory override, there should be a clear provision for consultation
with the trustees. There should also be clarity as to the value of what
it is that an employer can recoup, and for the scheme and the
employer’s actuary to agree—not the amendment itself
necessarily, but that the amendment or the proposed change meets the

a statutory override, the powers to increase employee contributions
and/or reduce accrual rates of defined benefit schemes in order to
reflect the cost of the extra national insurance that the employer will
now have to pay as a result of the end of contracting out. However,
these powers are limited by the mechanism set out in Schedule 14, which

assess whether the changes may have the consequence that my noble
friend Lord Whitty fears and lead them to close their defined benefit
schemes or move employees on to career-average schemes, which are still
good but not as good as defined benefit schemes? Should the costs of
the additional amount of national insurance fall on to employees, my
noble friends are fearful that employees will be unable to pay this
from their salary and be forced to leave their schemes. Even a 1.4%
additional contribution may be more than can be afforded by some
workers living with static salaries and the rising cost of living. This
is clearly not in their long-term 
<?notus-xml column=426?>interest, but if a large percentage of workers withdraw it will also
threaten the viability of some pension schemes. As my noble friend Lady
Drake has pointed out, 5% is a huge amount to find between employer and
employee at a time when so many small businesses are seeking to get
back on their feet. My noble friend reflects the views of trade unions,

the changes are achieved—by consultation, as we advocate, or by

main streets of Kilmarnock by pensioners who asked me why they had to
pay tax on their pension. I became quite adept at replying. I will not
bore the Committee with the explanation, which is simply that you make
up the pot from untaxed income and the deal is that you pay the tax as
you draw down. Try as I might, though, I do not think that I ever, even
with charts, persuaded one pensioner that that was the case with regard
to their pension. I spent from 1997 to 2010 as the MP for those people,

their pension scheme and the operation in this fashion and how it was

employers retain the remaining defined benefit schemes. That is a
justification for the override, as he said at col. 245 of the eighth

against the pocket. After single tier is introduced, there will not be
an additional state pension to contract out of. Employers with such
schemes will no longer receive the national insurance rebate; they will
pay the same rate as other employers and will have to continue to
provide a pension scheme that is generous but which will therefore be
more costly. To continue funding these defined benefit schemes and to
keep them open without the rebate, employers will be forced to find
other ways to reduce running costs. They may wish to reduce the future
rate of accruals, or to increase employee
contributions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401094000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0002.htm#1401094000088">Employers

Based on all the information we have at the moment we believe employers
who choose to use the override should be able to do so within this time
limit. However, contracting out is complex and there may be unforeseen
problems for some employers. An employer who is unable to use the
override within the time limit, without the possibility of an
extension, may have no option but to close their defined benefit

a prolonged period of uncertainty that the industry and employers have

employment of actuaries and other professionals to work on the scheme
changes that may be necessary, and will in turn delay any negotiation

turn to Amendments 40 and 40A. In some formerly nationalised
industries, employers and trustees are limited in their ability to
change scheme rules by legislation made at the time of privatisation.
However, Governments cannot bind their successors. The radical overhaul
of the state pension system and the abolition of contracting out in
this Pensions Bill leaves this Government with a very difficult
decision—should the statutory override apply to those covered by
protected 
<?notus-xml column=433?>persons legislation or not? Trade unions have strongly urged us to
honour the promises made at the time of privatisation. They have argued
that a change in 2016 would leave those close to scheme pension age no
time to make adjustments. It is also reasonable to ask why we would
disturb the pension provision of a relatively small group of workers.
Around 60,000 individuals are covered by protected persons legislation.
This represents a small proportion of the members in private sector
contracted out schemes. However, employers and the National Association
of Pension Funds argue just as strongly for the override to apply to
protected persons because they want all scheme members to be treated in
the same way. If protected persons are excluded from the override,
employers will look for other ways to offset the loss of the rebate for
that group. Consumer prices may rise where regulatory regimes allow.
Wages could be held down, which would also affect those outside the
protected persons group. Additionally, employers fear that any
differential treatment carries a risk of industrial
dispute<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-08T20:01:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401094000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0002.htm#1401094000103">One
could also argue that those protected under privatisation legislation
will in many cases have ended up with more generous pension terms than
their counterparts in the public sector. We also have to factor in that
the design of the single tier reforms means that those with a long
history of contracting out will in most cases build up significantly
more state pension. Around 75% of people in the private sector who pay
higher national insurance contributions and reach state pension age
during the first two decades following implementation will receive
enough extra state pension over their retirement to counterbalance the
increase in national insurance

Drake:</Member></B> I wish to clarify one or two points, if I may. The
Minister said that these changes would still be subject to consultation
with employers, by which I assume he is saying that they would be
considered as listed changes and therefore trigger the listed changes
regulations. What triggers that? Those provisions can be operated in a
way that excludes the trustees, if the employer takes a certain route.
I do not want to go into the detail; perhaps I can do so outside. I
would like to understand how consultation with employers is triggered
because I would almost certainly want to go on to say that what I think
will be triggered will not be fit for purpose in a statutory override
situation. I have a couple more

want to respond 
<?notus-xml column=434?>to the answers. There could be an element of the positive in the
second—on specifying the assumptions in the
regulations—because it starts setting out the rules more
explicitly. However, it appears that the Government are still
proceeding on the basis that these are negative regulations. The
trouble is that other interested parties cannot make an effective
contribution unless this House has the opportunity to question those
assumptions and those regulations. I have no idea what the delay
implication would be of allowing this House to consider the proposed

like an answer to what it is that can be recouped. Is it the definition

get too much into protected persons but, on the fourth point, if one
takes as an example the railway pension scheme, the Minister is
absolutely right. Lots of people in that scheme do not have protected

complexities that arise from shared costs and some other things as
well, but I feel that there is no opportunity to flesh these out. I
have spent some time looking at the railway pensions bill. Even if one
did not want to challenge the Government on the principle, there are
some complexities here. It is not easy just to adjust the contribution
rate or to adjust the benefits in a shared cost situation and where

The difference is that you get them in and, within a matter of a month,
they are effectively law and they can then be prayed against, but they
are in shape unless they are undone. Affirmative has to be approved. So

conscious of the time, but I am also conscious that we should not move
on from this particular part of the Bill with all its complexity
because we are pushed for time, due to the accident of when we held
this debate. I say this for a good reason. The Minister read a speaking
note about affirmative resolution procedure in relation to regulations
which was not written to respond to the amendment that I proposed but
was a much more general speaking note. The amendment tabled by me and
my noble friend Lady Sherlock related only to Section 24(8)—a
very specific part that would not involve the complex regulations which
the Minister narrated. The regulations in Section 24(8) will

government Amendments 48 and 49. Schedule 14 currently provides that
regulations can create exceptions to the limits set out in

unusually funded schemes, such as fixed cost-share schemes, which I
hope goes to the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Drake. The
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee raised concerns about
the power. In light of this and our ongoing discussions with the
pensions industry, we no longer believe that we need this
power—we believe that something different is required—so
Amendment 49 removes it. Amendment 48 then makes specific
provision for employers with atypical scheme-funding arrangements, such
as cost-share schemes. It allows those employers to recover their
increased costs without affecting the safeguards provided by Schedule
14.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401094000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-gc0002.htm#1401094000115">In the

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> I thank everyone who has contributed to
the debate. I agree, of course, that it is a complicated matter but, on
the other hand, the complications take place within the context of what
is in the Bill. The Bill makes it clear that in future employers will
have the right to change the provisions of pension contributions and
benefits. That is what most of us are concerned about. I do not think
that 
<?notus-xml column=436?>the Minister’s response has dealt with the fear that people have
that they are now facing a possibility that DB schemes could be under
attack. They have been under attack in the past. Although I agree with
everything that has been said about the necessity of involving
trustees—of course I believe in that—when in the past
employers have changed from a DB scheme to something less good, which
has happened, the trustees have been consulted but have made no attempt
to disrupt what the employer had intended to do. I therefore still do
not think it is sufficient to say that the trustees have to be
consulted. There has to be general consultation. The problem is, of
course, that it is in the general context of the Bill, and the general
context of this clause, which gives the employer power to change the
benefits system through the DB scheme that may exist.</hs_para>

are concerned about the continuation of their DB schemes. As I have
said in the past, DB schemes which have been negotiated in the past
have been responsible for improving benefits for a whole generation of
pensioners. They want to continue with those schemes and to ensure that
the unions to which most of them belong will have the right to ensure
that negotiation will properly take place before anything can be done

return to it on Report. Personally, I have not been satisfied with what
I have heard and am quite certain that a number of other people will
not be either. There has to be much more of a debate. Unfortunately, a

I made clear that when future countries join the EU we must look again
at the transitional arrangements for the free movement of workers, and
my preference to look at options such as much longer transitional
periods and new benchmarks that would need to be met. I also made the
case for returning the principle of free movement to a more sensible
basis and making clear that it should never be a completely unqualified
right but should be what the EU first envisaged - the free movement of
workers, not of those after the best benefit deal. This is not just the
view of the UK. At the recent meeting of interior ministers, Germany,
Austria and the Netherlands all made clear that we need to find a
better approach to tackle free movement abuse. In this spirit, we can
now look forward to continuing these discussions in the coming year and

to the consultation – carried out in summer 2013. A summary of
the responses to the consultation and the Government’s reply to
these responses is being published alongside the new
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010844000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-wms0001.htm#14010844000020">Under
the Transport Act 2000, the CAA is required to take account of
environmental guidance given to it by the Secretary of State when
exercising its air navigation functions. The new guidance has two key
objectives. The first is to provide the CAA with additional clarity on
the Government’s environmental objectives relating to air
navigation in the UK, including the need to improve the efficiency of
our UK airspace network. 
<?notus-xml column=193?>The second is a reaffirmation of the need to consult local communities
near airports when airspace changes are being considered in the
vicinity of these airports. The guidance now reflects significant
developments such as the creation of the Future Airspace Strategy and
Single European Sky, and the Aviation Policy Framework.</hs_para>

has been prepared, consulted on and revised by the Government
separately from the Airports Commission’s work, it is notable
that the clarity it brings around the introduction of performance-based
navigation routes at our major airports and the 
<?notus-xml column=194?>need for greater delegation of decision-making powers over airspace
changes to the CAA are in line with the findings of the
Commission’s recently published Interim Report. The
Government’s full response to the Report will follow in the
spring. In the meantime, this publication demonstrates the
Government’s desire to act quickly to make the best use of
existing
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010844000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140108-wms0001.htm#14010844000022">A

witness fraud through lotteries based overseas can make a crime report
