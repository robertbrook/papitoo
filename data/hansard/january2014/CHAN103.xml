Barry Sheerman</B> (Huddersfield) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> Mr
Speaker, there is a crisis here. The fact is that half of people who
suffer from AF—as a member of my family does—do not know
they are suffering from it and are not diagnosed. If they are not
diagnosed, that leads to great expense to the health service because
they are very prone to having a stroke. Even when doctors know about
AF, they say inappropriately, “Have an aspirin as part of your
medication.” Some 25% of doctors recommend aspirin, and that is
very dangerous. When will the Minister wake up? AF is a dangerous
condition and it is very expensive.</hs_Para>

5.2 million admissions to hospitals are avoidable if we have
better alternatives in the community. The Government believe that
restoring that personal link between doctors and the people on their
lists—the people in their communities—who could often be
much better looked after outside hospitals is the way to deal with
that. That is why we are making that major change to the GP
contract—it is the biggest change since named GPs were removed

reason there have been increased referrals to therapists is that this

in the improving access to psychological therapies programme so we can
get to people with mental health problems much earlier and give them
better support before they reach the point of crisis. If I may beg your
indulgence for one second, Mr Speaker, on the specific point of what
the hon. Gentleman says about gay to straight conversion therapy, I
also find that absolutely abhorrent in principle, but the issue
is—it is an important issue and he should listen to

it may have unintended consequences. That may affect counsellors and
stop counsellors from practising who are supporting people coming to

The report did not find any one individual responsible; it found
systemic failings. What really matters is what has been done to ensure
that this sort of thing does not happen again, or that the chances of
it happening again are minimised. Following the publication of the
report, NHS London wrote to all the primary care trusts outlining the
lessons to be learned, and my right hon. Friend will be relieved to
hear that all clinical commissioning groups’ chief financial

difficulties with the IT systems supporting the application and

components to that. There is the technical challenge of processing
recruits through the pipeline. I have admitted to the House on a number
of occasions that the system is very clunky, which is partly but not
exclusively because of problems with the ICT platform. There is also
the wider challenge, in the face of societal change and public
attitudes, of encouraging people to want to join the Army Reserve and
encouraging employers to want to support employees in joining the Army
Reserve. It is very early days, but the signs are encouraging. I have
no doubt that I will continue to report to the House as the evidence

Even if that is overcome, however, there will still be a time lag in
getting medical records from GPs. We are looking at whether we can use
a system similar to that used in officer cadet training units in
universities, where recruits can answer a simple medical questionnaire
to enable them to begin taking part in some carefully defined
activities. That would capture and get them engaged in that first flush
of enthusiasm, rather than leave them sitting on the bench for months,

provide IT solutions to the Government and utilise existing IT

that potential recruits seeking to access the system will notice an
improvement in the quality of the IT platform, principally
because the front end—the web-based portal through which they
will access the system—will be replaced at the end of January by
a system that is now running but still being trialled before it goes
live. The system will work, but that is by applying additional manual
resource, which, as I have already told the House, is costing us
£1 million a month. The purpose of the partnering contract is to
take about 1,000 personnel who were involved in the administration of
recruiting out of that role, and save about £300 million a year.
In the long term we still need to harvest that saving, and it will be
necessary to have a proper ICT solution to do

year, Hayley was pregnant. For nearly 20 weeks, she carried the child
of her and her partner Frazer. She felt the baby kicking. She went
through all the other ups and downs of a first-time pregnancy. Sadly,
after around 19 weeks, something went wrong, and Hayley and
Frazer’s baby died unborn. It was not a miscarriage, and the
following week Hayley had to go through the pain of giving birth to a
baby that she knew was no longer alive. She had to take powerful drugs
to induce the pregnancy. She experienced contractions. She went into
Worthing hospital and had pain relief. The following day in June, she
gave birth to her baby, Samuel. She held Samuel in her arms. She and
her partner took photographs, had his hand and footprints taken and
paid their
goodbyes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0001.htm#14011474000287">Fortunately,
Hayley was given good support by the clinical staff at Worthing
hospital and had bereavement guidance later. She has an understanding

all intents and purposes, Hayley went through all the experiences of
pregnancy and the pain of childbirth endured by any other mother, but
they were coupled in this case with the unimaginable grief of a parent
who has lost a child before they could ever get to know him. She did
not just go through a stillbirth: she had a still baby; she became a
mum. The crucial difference is that Hayley’s and Frazer’s
baby is not recognised in the eyes of the state because he was born
before 24 weeks’ gestation. If he had survived until 24 weeks
and one day, he would have been recognised and the death properly
registered in a register of stillbirths, forming part of the statistics
I referred to earlier. More than just adding to the statistics though,
that would have been the acknowledgement of an actual, individual baby.
To add further insult to injury, Hayley had to hand back her maternity
exemption certificate straight

stark difference surely cannot be right; it adds insult to the
unimaginable pain that the parents have already had to suffer. Until
the passing of the Still-Birth (Definition) Act 1992, which amended the
Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, the threshold was
28 weeks, so prior to that even more babies went
unrecognised in official records. That change followed a clear
consensus in the medical profession on the age at which a baby is
considered viable. Since then, in fact, there have been cases of babies
born before 24 weeks who have, incredibly, survived.</hs_Para>

is true that there is an informal procedure for hospitals to issue

having existed; Samuel’s death would have been registered. That
would go some way to providing some comfort to parents such as Hayley
and Frazer at an unimaginably painful time. It would provide some form
of closure and allow them to move on more easily. It would also provide

changes, rightly, to maternity allowance guidance to ensure mothers

Paul Goggins. Paul served on the Public Bill Committee for this Bill,

have to say, and I am sure others Members agree and have said it
already in this House, that he was the most thoughtful and supportive
colleague anyone could ever have hoped to have sitting behind them on a

would have been very pleased to see the Government shift their position
on the length of time that looked-after children can remain in foster
care and be supported to do so. That is something he should have taken
personal pride in. Although he was not the sort of person who would be
arrogant enough to take personal pride, I think he should get the

passage of the Bill through both Houses. For a short and welcome
period, it was included in the Bill. The Opposition, and I imagine a
number of Government Back-Bench Members, would like to see it put back.
I will point out from the start that the call for parliamentary
scrutiny did not start life as an Opposition amendment. Although the
Minister might sometimes think it, it was not cooked up on the Labour
Benches just to make his life uncomfortable. The call for parliamentary
approval before significant upheaval of the probation service was a
Cross-Bench amendment tabled by the noble Lord Ramsbotham who, as
colleagues will know, is a former chief inspector of

Ramsbotham’s amendment was supported by every Cross-Bench peer
who heard him speak to it. While the Bill focuses on one element of
change to probation, it is flanked by massive irreversible sell-off of
a public service. It appears that the Government were hoping just to
push that through under the radar and we think that that is very wrong.
The former chief inspector of prisons was concerned enough by the
proposals to try to stop that happening and enough noble Lords agreed
with him to pass the original version of the amendment. New clause 1
concerns proper parliamentary scrutiny: MPs taking responsibility for a
decision that will irreversibly alter the way in which offenders are
supervised in the community, and for which there is no evidence and
precious little support.</hs_Para>

2007 Act created probation trusts, and they have now been in existence

the Minister would concede that they are performing very
well—but they could perform an awful lot better if challenged

the proposals that has raised the most professional concern is the
issue of risk management itself. These are people who are in the risk
management business. The Government’s plans will fragment
the service and split up offenders based on their category
of risk, with low and medium-risk offenders being managed by new
providers while those deemed to be high risk stay with the public
sector. The problem with that split is that risk is not static and
regularly shifts. Around a quarter of offenders change risk category
during their order and they do not just change it once or in
incremental steps. Low risk can become high risk almost instantaneously
if an offender’s circumstances change. The Government are
institutionalising into this system a break, which we think is
dangerous, where offenders whose risk escalates will have to be handed
over to a different provider at the moment they are most volatile, with
all the risk that that brings in terms of time delays and communication
failures, which we know from other areas cause real
problems. That is an unnecessary and, worse, a

national probation service will be collocated to ease handovers but I

the same building mean that an officer of the national probation
service will have the time to monitor the entirety of a community
rehabilitation company’s cohort as well as their own case load?
It is just not realistic. Will the national probation service be
guaranteed the resources and capacity to take over quite a high

because of all these problems, Ministers have pinned all their hopes on
the payment mechanism. They assure us that success is guaranteed
because providers 
<?notus-xml column=736?>will be paid by results. But Members will recall similar claims being
made about the Work programme, in which every provider
started by failing to meet its targets. Ministers have also so far been
unable to tell Members exactly how much of a fee will be paid by
results and how much the provider will get up front, regardless of
their performance. My hon. Friend the Member for Rotherham (Sarah
Champion) made an excellent point in Committee, when she said that when
universal credit had been bailed out the original structures were still
in place to provide services that the reforms could not. There was at
least some sort of continuity. Given that the Secretary of State is
planning to abolish every probation trust in a matter of months, what
will be in place to protect the public? Should a provider fail or the
entire roll-out have to be halted because of poor performance, nothing

me to new clause 5, which deals with contract management. It is
designed to ensure better performance from providers and
much better management of contracts by the Ministry of Justice than we
have seen in recent years. I know the Minister will accept that this is
needed. Now we come to the bit about the rabbit! The MOJ paid for a
rabbit to be licensed as a court interpreter—the commissioning
car crash, as it was called, meaning the language service’s

the Ministry’s naivety at the start of the process appeared to
have been matched, once the new arrangements came into
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T13:50:58"></hs_TimeCode>, by
its indulgence towards underperformance against the

will disagree today on how well the Secretary of State and his
Department can manage this kind of process, but I am sure that the
Minister would agree with the Opposition Front-Bench team at least on
the fact that we must not tolerate underperformance if and when these
contracts come into force. We cannot allow these problems to happen
again in the future. Neither the Ministry’s nor the
Government’s records are particularly encouraging on this front.
The Justice Select Committee in its review of the budgeting structure
of the MOJ reported—astutely, I think—that the Department
has a tendency to focus on policy creation rather than
implementation. The recent independent review into MOJ contracting
reported in December that there were long-standing and significant
weaknesses in contract management at the Department. It found that the
focus on contracts lessened significantly after the initial procurement
and, in some cases, there appeared to be a lack of appetite for
continuous improvement. The review concluded that opportunities to
mitigate risks and optimise services were being missed.</hs_Para>

Contracts for two major providers and potential failures in probation

after the taxpayer was overcharged by millions for the tagging of
offenders who were dead, had been released or, in some cases, had left
the country. The prisoner escort contract with Serco has been referred
for investigation by the Metropolitan police, and the Ministry’s
own review of contracts has led to two more G4S contracts being
referred to the SFO. It should not

that not out of party political animus; I say it out of a desire to see
something done, having spent five years in opposition between 2005 and
just short of 2010 taking an intense interest in the way in which we
ran our prison system, our criminal justice system and our
rehabilitation system. I also say it as someone who has sat for 12 or
so years as a Crown court recorder and who had to deal quite regularly
with the results of failure, and I think the time has come to stop
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_14_PT_1/AA13A93C730D22C21E74A9E637F2F3AADCA6EF52" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="14 January 2014">Tuesday

assumption that is being presented to us is that probation trusts are
failing to reduce reoffending rates, yet reoffending rates are falling.
The latest statistics published by the Ministry of Justice show that
the probation service reduced reoffending by a further 5% below the
target figure. This continues the downward trend in reoffending rates
witnessed over recent years, and reoffending by all adult offenders in
the community subject to probation supervision is now at its lowest
since 2007-08. The probation service has achieved that while making the
considerable budgetary savings asked of it. In South Yorkshire, the
figures are even better, at 12.77% lower than the target
figure<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:23:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000430" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000430">Reoffending
rates are important, but they are not the only criterion for success in
this area. The probation service can also boast that victim feedback
has been positive in 98% of cases; that targets for completions on
domestic violence interventions, and for court report timeliness, have
been met and exceeded; and that completion targets were also met or
exceeded on the vast majority of probation programmes. The probation
trusts are doing a superb job, and they should be allowed to continue
to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:23:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000431" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000431">Another
assumption that keeps being mentioned in the debate is that the only
way in which supervision for people serving a sentence of under 12
months can be afforded is through privatisation. However, the proposals
will necessitate the wholesale reorganisation of the probation service
and a lengthy and complex national tendering and contracting process,
all of which will require significant investment before we even get
into the meat of doing the job. There is huge concern over the lack of
information on the cost of the proposals. We have asked for that
information, but it has not been presented. Despite the publication of
several impact assessments, the Ministry of Justice has yet to set out
the cost of the reforms and the way in which they will be
funded<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:24:38"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
a fundamental point. If we are expected to take this leap in the dark,
at least we should be chucked a lifeboat so that we can get into
it.</hs_Para>

current budget for probation is approximately £800 million a
year, suggesting a 10-year budget of £8 billion. The
House of Commons Library has broadly estimated that the 10-year value
of outsourced probation would be between £5 billion and
£20 billion. That is in addition to the budget for the remaining
public sector probation service. That suggests that a significant
increase in costs is being predicted, contrary to Ministry of Justice
claims that the reforms are a cost-saving initiative. In addition,
there would be the unknown percentage resulting from
performance-related
pay<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:25:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000433" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000433">Now
it starts to get surreal—not that it was not already. The
Government say that the probation service cannot tender because of the
performance-related pay aspect, so why do they not just drop that
element? The probation trusts have been saying all along that they
would like the opportunity to support people serving short-term
sentences. They are clearly the best trained and most skilled
specialist people to do that work, but they are not even being allowed
to tender for it. I find it incredibly challenging that the main
stumbling block to retaining the status quo in that area is that the
Government will not drop the performance-related pay element.</hs_Para>

for Rotherham (Sarah Champion) mentioned ideology. It might surprise
her to learn that I am a great fan of ideology; I think that people
should have clear political beliefs. There is at least one clear
ideology on public services, which states that government services are
best delivered not by a Government agency but by private bidders trying
to satisfy the Government. There is a general view that Government
agencies are necessarily incompetent, inflexible or naturally the
prisoner of Government employees and unions, and that outsourcing is
always the best and first option.</hs_Para>

known technique is used, as we have seen in connection with this Bill,
which is to discredit the existing service; propose restructuring and
reform; argue for appreciable haste; reduce the Government’s
role, where possible, to that of a commissioner rather than a provider;
and then, if necessary, to talk up what has been referred to as
“bid candy”. That involves talking about mutuals or
charities, rather than private providers, which will be the big players
in most scenarios. In addition, savings are promised, as are a
reduction in bureaucracy and greater efficiency through competition.
The ideology is always clear, although the political manoeuvring is
sometimes less than transparent. Critics legitimately claim, as they
have done in this debate, that a loss of institutional memory occurs
and a less integrated service results, just as the demoralisation and
de-professionalisation of existing staff results too. There are other
attended risks, such as the risk of putting profit before service or
cost before
quality.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:31:05"></hs_TimeCode> An
ideological view would, however, assure us that we can have all the
upside gains from this approach and none of the downside risks if we
are clever enough, plan right, commission wisely and so on. I am sure
that is what the Government will say.</hs_Para>

is where the debate goes, and it is where we are now, but for one
thing: ideology, or what we think should happen, is always
trumped by evidence—by what actually happens. Regardless of what
we think ought to work, we have to look at what actually does work. So
far, there is no evidence that the suggested demarcation and division
of work load projected by this legislation can work; that clients can
be permanently labelled either “high risk” or “low
risk”, or move effortlessly from one category to the other; that
the savings—this does worry me—can be guaranteed; that
there are enough good bidders in all markets to provide a good and
equitable service, which should worry the Minister; and that it is
necessarily a good thing to have mandatory 12 months’
supervision of all people in all circumstances, with that being the
most efficient and effective way of using the probation service, which
it might be, but the evidence is not there so far to support that.
There is no evidence to suggest that the current system is not working

the other hand, there is plenty of evidence that staff are demoralised

<?notus-xml column=748?>from previous restructurings in the NHS shows that wholesale
restructuring absorbs time and resources, and reduces efficiency, and
that there are still lingering communications systems issues to
address—we have mentioned the IT system, too. Enough evidence is
available to make an ideologue—though not perhaps a
Minister—think that a smart move in this case would be to have a
pilot, because we are talking about a precious asset, the probation
service of this country, and we need to handle it carefully. One way of
doing that is to pilot things first and then, when we are totally
satisfied that everything is working, to put it in place nationally, if

Elfyn Llwyd</B> (Dwyfor Meirionnydd) (PC):</Member> I wish to speak
briefly to new clauses 1 and 4, both of which I have co-signed with Her
Majesty’s official Opposition. The Government do not want new
clause 1 in the Bill because they are concerned that, in due course,
they will not win the vote in either House of Parliament because,
frankly, what they are proposing does not add up to much. At the end of
last year, the official Opposition held a debate on the
Government’s plans to restructure probation work and, until that
point, the Justice Secretary had refused to answer for his plans on the
Floor of the House. During that debate, many of us outlined why we
thought it baffling that the Government should want to target the
probation service, a service that is so high performing and where the
numbers speak for themselves.</hs_Para>

Ministry of Justice’s own figures show that none of the 35
probation trusts is currently showing cause for “serious
concern” and none “require development”; and that
31 of the trusts are “showing good performance” and four
are “performing exceptionally”. In 2011-12, victim
feedback was positive in 98% of cases; 80% of orders or licences were
completed successfully; and 49% of offenders were in employment at the
end of their orders and 89% were in accommodation. Reoffending rates
were better than predicted in both England and Wales, and the probation
service met all its targets in 2012. The service achieved a successful
completion rate of 81% for participants of sex offender treatment
programmes and exceeded its completion targets on domestic violence
interventions. In October 2011, the probation service became the only
public sector organisation to be awarded the British Quality Foundation
award. The board said that the service was</hs_Para>

reoffending rate among those sentenced to more than 12 months but less
than four years is 36.2%, while among those serving between four and 10
years it is 30.7%. As we know, the reoffending rate for individuals
sentenced to less than 12 months—the cohort that currently, by
and large, receives no supervision, despite some probation trusts
asking for the authority to take control of them—stands much
higher, at 58.5%. That takes us to the crux of the argument. Everybody
in this Chamber agrees that something has to be done, but we disagree

stopped, but let us also be honest and say that we are where we are and
we should at least see whether these plans will work. That surely is a
common-sense thing to do, but time and time again, in the Public Bill
Committee and in all the other debates, we have been unable to persuade
the Government to pause and to think carefully about why they initiated

perpetrators of such complex crimes. It is highly unlikely that the
private sector will prioritise holistic initiatives such as work with
victims of crime. I am afraid that it will be

into contact with the probation service have one or more mental health

Social Market Foundation has argued that payment by results
incentivises an increase in offending. To understand that, it is
important to note that the Government have decided that a private
company will neither be penalised nor rewarded for an increase or
decrease in offending of 3% either way. Ostensibly, that is to take
account of the fact that external factors can have an impact on
offending rates. In practice, however, it would mean that private
companies would have to achieve a 4% decrease in offending before being
rewarded. They will simply not invest that amount of money when there
is no guarantee of a return on their investment. Unfortunately, it is
far more likely that the companies will make a profit by delivering
court orders in the cheapest way possible by opening call
centres. Understandably, the National Association of Probation

let me refer to new clause 4. The impetus behind it is to ensure that
we do not rush headlong into implementing these reforms without first
having a pilot, which would be independently evaluated and reported on
to both Houses of Parliament. I notice that the esteemed Chair of the
Justice Committee,

Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith), is in his place, so I
must be careful about what I say. Over the past few weeks, we have
taken evidence from many sectors involved in probation and
rehabilitation. A considerable amount of it was from people who had
been involved in previous Government privatisations. Surprisingly, they
were saying, “Don’t do it. Don’t rush in. It is
not proven. It may not be cost-effective and it could cause
huge problems.” Such people are surely aware of the risks
involved and they came before the Committee to give their opinion. It
is not simply a matter of one political divide against the other. Some
of those people presented as being more in sympathy with the Government
than with anybody else, but they said do not do it because it is
unproven and could be dangerous.</hs_Para>

me pick up on the point made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:52:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier). We have all been
pressing for some time, under the previous Government and this
Government, for the supervision of offenders with sentences of less
than 12 months, but we all expected that to proceed
normally—that is, with a proposal being made with a budgetary
paper attached that the existing system would be challenged to
meet—so that we could plan the development of the probation
service. If there were to be additional funds, some of us would have
lobbied the Treasury while others would have argued that the service
should swallow its own smoke and keep the budget within its existing
budgets. That was what we expected.</hs_Para>

think that clause 1 was inserted into the Bill in the other place
because none of us expected the use of the previous legislation to
introduce proposals for the wholesale privatisation of the probation
service—that is what this means for 70% of the service going
forward. When that legislation was going through, I opposed it and I
warned those on my Front Bench that it could be abused in such a way. I
was assured that the legislation, which was supported on both sides of
the House if I remember rightly, would ensure that the third sector,
voluntary sector organisations and others could participate in
rehabilitation, and that it would introduce flexibility into the
system. A number of organisations lobbied for that, particularly in the
drugs rehabilitation field. That is why I think that this is an abuse
of process. It is an abuse of the previous legislation, which was never
intended to be used in this way, and I think that is why the other
place inserted the clause.</hs_Para>

have been angry and have shouted about the subject in this House, and
it is not good for my health. This is, however, a leap in the dark, and
I am fearful for my constituents. As with other privatisations, there
is a financial risk, but that is nothing in comparison with the risk to
life and limb. As a result of this leap in the dark, there could be
safety problems that will bear down on Ministers in the
future.</hs_Para>

not publish the risk register and make it completely public, and why
not publish those mechanisms you have put in place to address the

experience of privatisation in the justice service has given us
sufficient warnings that we need to tread very carefully. I do not want

somewhat bureaucratic but, I think, important: new clauses 10, 9, 11
and 13, which are all in my name. They are simple suggestions. First,
if the Government are going down this path let us have full and open
transparency. The new clauses suggest that the contracts should be
fully published. The Minister has said that the draft contracts should
be published, but I think that it is important that the full contract
should be published so that we can all see it, in particular the
elements of the contract that include the requirements and expectations
of the providers’ performance. It is important that in future
the National Audit Office can investigate and assess the effectiveness,
economy and efficiency of the implementation of the
contracts.</hs_Para>

change that I have suggested is just common sense: no company that has

consortium. They will play a key role within those consortia because of
the resources they have.</hs_Para>

clause 9 suggests that companies that are the prime contractors for the
Work programme in an area should not be able to bid, and I say that
because there is a potential conflict of interest. If one company is
implementing the Work programme at the same time as the new probation
system for those with sentences of less than 12 months and there is a
sanction, the Work programme will lose out. That introduces a conflict
of interest within the system. What worries me is that a number of
companies will bid for a range of contracts in an area, across the
piece, with the result that mini-monopolies will be built up in
particular geographical areas.</hs_Para>

the scale of this outsourcing, particularly when it is being done in
such a hurry, poses a real risk. I believe that it will reduce
standards. People will be taken on by large companies that have no
track record in probation, and will be paid at much lower levels, as
probation assistants, rather than full-blown and experienced probation
officers. I call it probation-lite. Those people will be making very
important decisions. They will decide, for instance, whether someone is

background of knowledge that enforces and informs the way in which a
probation officer acts. Someone who is deemed to be skilled might
actually be unqualified, so it is important to have the qualification

am also worried about some of the companies that might come into this.
I serve on the Public Accounts Committee, and I challenged the big
public sector providers that appeared before us recently on whether
they would bid for contracts in areas where they had no experience.
They all denied that they would, but we have seen, in the 
<?notus-xml column=756?>Public Accounts Committee, in other Committees and on the Floor of the
House, example after example of companies that bid for contracts
because they are good at bidding but that do not actually have a
background in delivering the relevant service. They then have to
backfill by recruiting people to take on those jobs. I have dealt with
the Minister on constituency matters and know him to be assiduous, and
I am sure that he will bear that point in mind, but I think that it is
worth reiterating that it is a very serious matter. Companies should
not be bidding for huge contracts in areas where they have no
experience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000499" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000499">That
also fragments the service. Fragmentation can be good where there is
specialism, where there are smaller contracts, perhaps run by
specialist voluntary sector groups, or indeed by private companies if
they have the necessary level of expertise, but they have to work
together. We are in danger of seeing another approach whereby the MOJ
and the Government put out big contracts and the smaller specialist
providers simply do not get a look in. They might get the odd crumb
from the big contractors’ table, but they will be squeezed out.
That is particularly true in mental health, one of the local concerns
in my
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000500" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000500"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:04:01"></hs_TimeCode>There
is an important concern about local accountability. I am a great
supporter of extending freedom of information in the first instance,
even with limitations, to private sector companies that deliver public
contracts paid for by the taxpayer. It should be the tax pound that
determines whether there is freedom of information, not the nature of
the delivery body. Most parties in the House support some degree of
contracting out, but we need to ensure that transparency is built in.
Companies have told the Public Accounts Committee that they are in
favour of a much greater degree of transparency, so perhaps the
Minister will take this opportunity to challenge them to stand up for
what they say and make that part of the bidding
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000501" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000501">New
clause 4 is important—I will not repeat all the arguments
Members have made—because we need proper scrutiny. If we look at
reoffending as a whole, we see that there are other ways of looking at
it, for example by looking at mental health support or the Work
programme. We know that offenders who come out of prison with a job are
less likely to reoffend, but does the Work programme, which
is provided by another Government Department, go into prisons to ensure
that offenders have jobs for when they leave? Perhaps we should be
challenging them to step up to the mark and provide job opportunities
as a major plank of what we all want to see: less reoffending,
particularly by offenders given short-term sentences.</hs_Para>

summary, the Public Accounts Committee has seen far too many poorly
managed large Government contracts. The Cabinet Office is pushing hard
to see that procurement is done in a different way that allows smaller
companies a bite of the Government contract cherry and to stop the big
companies being able to snaffle public money without being
held properly to account. This is an opportunity for the Minister to
consider, even at this late stage, allowing something in the contract
to ensure that the big companies are required to work effectively with
the small companies and not, as many of them do, to dodge their
responsibilities later by saying, “Actually, we
can’t quite deliver what we promised, so we’ll do it
differently, but we’ve taken it all on.” That is 
<?notus-xml column=757?>often how they get around that. That will need constant monitoring and
an audit of what happens with the contract. If this is to go ahead, I
urge the Minister to tell us how the Government plan to audit the
impact and the delivery of the

comments of my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Darlington (Jenny Chapman) about our late
colleague, Paul Goggins. I followed him as a Justice Minister, doing
the job he did when he was in the Home Office and had responsibility
for probation, and I know how well respected he was in the sector, by
officials and the community at large. I also had the pleasure of
sharing time with him as a Northern Ireland Minister, where he was also
well respected. This is my first opportunity to put that on the record
in the House. I will attend his funeral on Thursday, along with many
colleagues across the House, to pay my final respects to Paul for all
his work.</hs_Para>

wanted to speak in this debate for several reasons. Nobody disagrees
with the Government’s general premise for dealing with offenders
sentenced to 12 months or less in prison. They are often prolific
offenders who go on to reoffend. They are often tomorrow’s
serious offenders. It was an aspiration we had when I served in the
Ministry of Justice to try to reduce their reoffending. We need to
involve the voluntary and private sectors in supporting rehabilitation
work for individuals who go to prison and come out within 12 months.
Housing associations, voluntary providers and employers all have a role
to play. That can be done in a positive way by the voluntary and
private sectors.</hs_Para>

us therefore not have a debate today on the difference between the
Government and the Opposition on the need to involve some elements of
the voluntary and private sectors. Instead,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:08:14"></hs_TimeCode> want to raise
my concerns about the issues addressed by new clauses 1 and 4. New
clause 1 would ensure that we put a parliamentary brake on
reorganisation, pending proper parliamentary scrutiny, and new clause 4
would put in place a pilot to test some difficult and serious matters
in relation to which mistakes—they will be made, because that is
the nature of the business the Minister deals with—will have a
real impact on the community at large.</hs_Para>

clause 1, which I fully support, would prevent the Government from
selling off or restructuring the probation service unless the proposals
had first been laid before, and approved by, both Houses of Parliament.
It is no secret that if the Government did that this year, they could
put a Bill before Parliament and get it through before the general
election. They could have it scrutinised and probably, because of the
votes they have in this House, get their way.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:06:27"></hs_TimeCode> object to the
Government using the Offender Management Act 2007 to achieve that
objective. I declare an interest, because I was the Minister who took

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:09:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

discussions about the difficulties of making judgments about low-risk
people left in the private sector? He may recall that I raised in the
House the case of Jane Clough who was murdered in the Blackpool
Victoria hospital car park by her former abusive partner while he was
on bail. The Government accepted the thrust of that campaign when they
made changes in relation to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders Act 2012. Does that not show that the ability to have an

privatise great chunks of it. They believe that the proposals actually
endanger some of the important and innovative work they are doing. For
example, they recently set up a specialist team to deal with the
problem of young offenders, whereby staff time is split between the
youth offending service and the probation staff so that the two
services join up better. They told me that the proposals the Government
wish to force through in the next year will lead to huge upheaval and
massive duplication, and will make it less likely that the work that is
so important in our community for reducing reoffending is moved forward

management of the trust told me that instead of being externally
focused on reducing reoffending and protecting the public, over the
next couple of months their priority will be to support staff through
the transition and to make sure that they move cases between the split
services in a way that ensures that no cases are lost and no mistakes
are made. That does not make sense to me. The priority for the
management and those with experience should be to ask, “How do

one key to the reduction of reoffending relates is having stable

better path in life. If young people are transferred between different
organisations because their risk fluctuates, I wonder how there can be

Member for Darlington (Jenny Chapman) and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:28:12"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson) said about Paul Goggins. Paul was the
first Minister I went to see as a newly elected Back Bencher. I was
struck not only by his command of the brief, but by his inherent
kindness, his reaction to somebody who was not of his party and his
willingness to give me whatever assistance he could. That continued
throughout the time that I knew him in this House. As others have said,
he will be missed on a personal level by a great many people on both
sides of the Chamber. It is right for us to recognise today that he
will be missed in debates such as this. The lack of his warmth and
wisdom on these subjects and many others will make our debates all the
poorer. I know that we will all miss him in the Chamber more
generally<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:29:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000543">We
have had an interesting and informed debate on this group of new
clauses. There is no doubt that the substantial burden of the debate on
the Bill has been not about the contents of the Bill, which are broadly
uncontroversial, but about the wider reforms that surround the Bill. I
understand why that is. It might therefore be 
<?notus-xml column=763?>helpful if I spend a little time dealing with what is at the heart of
the Government’s reforms to probation and why we believe they
are so urgent. That will relate to the issue of piloting, which has
been raised this

reason for our belief that this is an urgent matter is that reoffending
rates have barely changed over the last decade. That is not true only
of offenders who are released from short sentences, whom we all agree
get little or no support at the moment after release, but of every
group of offenders. For adult offenders who serve community sentences,
the reoffending rate in 2011 was 34%. After falling in the early 2000s,
that trend has been broadly flat since 2005. For adult offenders who
are released from custodial sentences of less than 12 months—the
group that we are interested in—the reoffending rate in 2011 was
58%. That trend has been broadly flat since 2002. For adult offenders
who are released from custodial sentences of 12 months or more, the
reoffending rate in 2011 was 35%. That trend has been broadly flat
since
2005.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474000545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0002.htm#14011474000545">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>
recognise that those rates have barely changed despite the considerable
efforts and very good work of probation officers up and down the

justified because no good work is being done. In my view, good work is
being done. None the less, there is clear justification for a change in

close to the proposals that we are making for us to learn as much as
Opposition Members would like us to have learned from their conclusion.
That does not mean that we learned nothing from their period of
operation. The point has been made from the Opposition Benches that it
is possible to learn from pilots even if they are not allowed to run to
full term. We certainly have learned from those pilots and from other
experiences of payment by results. I will return to that point in a

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:32:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Lewisham East (Heidi Alexander) is right that reoffending rates are
too high. We could not allow that situation to continue without a
response. We could simply have imposed further significant cuts on the
35 probation trusts without targeting our efforts on those with the
highest reoffending rates, or we could have brought in new and
innovative approaches to supporting offenders that would also be more
efficient and that would allow us to reinvest some of the savings to
target support through the gate on the under 12-month group. We chose
the latter
option<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:32:51"></hs_TimeCode>. At the
heart of our proposals is the aim of opening up the supervision of low

Wright:</Member></B> Again—I made this point earlier when I
intervened on the right hon. Gentleman—I do not think that Lord
Reid could have been any clearer on Third Reading. No doubt under
considerable pressure from Back Benchers in his party, he undertook
that those core functions, including two things that we do not propose
to move from the public sector—advice to 
<?notus-xml column=765?>court and breach of proceedings—would remain in the public sector
for three years. That was not in perpetuity, not as a matter of
principle, but for three years which, conveniently enough, took him up
to the date of the general election. I think we can all take from that
a pretty clear understanding that the Labour Government were not
promising that those functions would stay in the public sector for
ever; they did it to take them up to the general
election.</hs_Para>

would count themselves as a reasonably good friend of Lord Reid, I
think there is a different interpretation and that the Minister is
taking this out of context. Lord Reid had no experience of the many
private sector providers, such as Capita and G4S, that are being sought

they have failed. With that experience, do we really want to

Wright:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making a slightly different
point. I am talking about what authority is given to this Government by
the Offender Management Act and, more broadly, what the previous
Government thought they were doing when they passed it. The case made
by Labour Members is that we have in some way taken that Act and
twisted its meaning. It has been taken wholly out of context, and we
have a travesty of a representation of what that Act says and means. I
have been saying to the right hon. Member for Delyn and his colleagues
that what the Act says is very clear, and the <I>Hansard </I>that
supports it is also clear. Not only did the previous Government
anticipate that such a thing could happen, they chose not to rule out
the possibility of its happening. They had every opportunity to do so

point and in connection with further parliamentary approval, the
Offender Management Act says nothing about requiring Parliament to
approve the exercise of that power. In contrast, section 15 of the
Offender Management Act provides that an order repealing or disapplying
the restriction of certain functions, including advice to court, to the
public sector, must be subject to parliamentary approval. If, when in
government, the Opposition had wanted to ensure that the exercise of
the power in section 3 for the Secretary of State to enter into
arrangements for probation provision was subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure, they could have done so, but they did
not.</hs_Para>

the Labour Government were prepared to guarantee that the supervision
of offenders more widely would remain in the public sector for only
three years, as I have said. Let us be clear: the Labour Government
position was that the supervision of any offender—not just
medium or low-risk offenders—could at some stage be competed for
outside the public sector. This Government are not saying that. We say
that medium and low-risk offenders should be competed for. Secondly,
the Labour Government’s position was that the only element of
parliamentary scrutiny of the Secretary of State’s powers to
organise the probation service relates to the relatively narrow concept
of advice to courts, which this Government do not intend to alter.
Thirdly, the previous Government’s position was that the public
sector monopoly on providers would be guaranteed for only three

necessarily apply to the word “reform”. Therefore, we
might end up being asked to discuss very minor changes to the probation

hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington address. Let me be clear that the
Justice Secretary and I are determined to ensure the integrity of
future contracts to deliver value for money for the taxpayer. The
Ministry of Justice is currently following a proper procurement process
and will do so in future competitions. It is that process that should
rightly be used to determine who can bid for contracts and who the
future providers of services should be. Procurement law permits
consideration of issues that affect a bidder’s eligibility, such
as fraud, only at the initial prequalification stage, and not after
that stage unless a bidder’s circumstances have
changed.</hs_Para>

that stage, we would not have been legally allowed to exclude a bidder

grounds for mandatory exclusion under procurement law are that the
bidder has, or any of its directors have, been convicted of fraud. The
ongoing investigation by the Serious Fraud Office into the conduct of
G4S and Serco—which, I remind the House, this Secretary of State
initiated—in delivering the Government’s electronic

our own investigations. I have warned the hon. Lady before that she is

feel strongly about this matter and why some of our language is strong.
The Government awarded the contract for unpaid work in Greater
London—so this affects our constituencies—to Serco. I
will briefly set out some of the problems that have occurred: works
shops have been closed, shutting down placements for women high-risk
offenders; offenders recently complained to a probation officer in
north-west London—my area—that no supervisors were
available onsite; and rival gang members have been placed on the same
scheme and transported in the same way. In addition, a known sex
offender was alleged to be on the same placement as a victim. That is

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:51:27"></hs_TimeCode>As with all

value for the taxpayer. If we are not satisfied that overall bidders

Members have raised the issue of the management of high-risk offenders,
so let me make it clear exactly what will be involved. We are creating
a new national probation service to manage directly all offenders who
pose a high risk of serious harm and any sexual or violent offenders
subject to multi-agency public protection arrangements. After an
offender has been sentenced, the NPS will make an initial assessment of
an offender’s risk of causing harm, and all offenders assessed
as posing a high risk of serious harm will be the responsibility of the
NPS. For low and medium-risk offenders, CRCs will be required to manage
any risk of serious harm that the offender might present and to have
appropriately trained staff and robust procedures in place for the
management of cases where the risk of serious harm escalates to high
during the offender’s supervision. They will also be
contractually required to refer cases back to the NPS if they consider
that the risk of serious harm might be escalating. In the end, the
decision will be taken by the NPS.</hs_Para>

committed to acting in the spirit of those amendments. We are already
considering how we can provide information about reoffending rates
broken down by CRCs and the NPS. As Members will know, the MOJ already
publishes reoffending statistics, not just annually but every three
months, broken down by probation trust, prison and upper and lower-tier
local authorities. I am happy to commit to the House that, in the
future, the reports will break down reoffending rates for the different
CRCs and the NPS. Indeed, as a first step, we have already published on
the MOJ website a set of indicative figures to show what reoffending
rates and cohort sizes in each contract package area would have looked
like had the new structure been in place for the 2005-10 period.

penalties for services not delivered to time or to quality. Contracts

I do not want to lose sight—nor should the House—of the

Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd). I want to reassure him that as part of our
reforms there will be a new resettlement service provided in custody

individual’s needs, but is likely to include support in finding
accommodation, family support, mentoring and financial advice. Services
in custody will be underpinned by the changes to the way in which the
prison estate is organised. That will mean that, in most cases, the
same professional can work with offenders in custody and continue their
rehabilitation work in the community.</hs_Para>

this is a huge leap in the dark and that no testing of what we are
doing is or will be going on. That is not the case. Let me set out to

they are working at key stages of implementation.</hs_Para>

are the reforms at the heart of the Bill; the extension of licence and
supervision to offenders released from short custodial sentences. There
are lawyers among Opposition Members, and they will know, and ought to
appreciate, that with a change to the sentencing framework of this
magnitude, it cannot be desirable to introduce it one part of the
country but not another. To do so would risk postcode justice, with
some offenders getting different sentences from others.</hs_Para>

supervision to the under-12-month group, as we all say we want to do,
we need to make the changes at a national level. That means funding
those changes at a national level. The savings to fund the
changes come from two sources; first, the efficiencies generated by
competing supervision of low and medium-risk offenders and, secondly,
the back office savings from moving to 21 from 35 CRCs, along with a
single national probation service. Competing services in only one area
of the country, if that is what is being proposed—I have heard
little detail as to what sort of piloting is being proposed
here—would extend supervision to short-sentenced offenders but,
in every other respect, we are carrying out extensive local testing of
the reforms in no fewer than 14 probation trusts. There is also the
testing we are carrying out on the new operating model for the CRCs and
the NPS. Those tests will enable us to inform how the new processes
will operate once implemented. The first round of tests has already
started and will continue over the coming months.</hs_Para>

there is the important fact that the 21 CRCs that we are
creating will remain in public sector ownership for some months after
their creation until the conclusion of the competition. This gives us
further opportunities to carry on testing and to refine the system.
Caseloads will not all necessarily transfer at the point the NPS and
CRCs come into being, and we have made it clear to trusts that where
there is a case for doing so, we will give greater latitude to allow
for caseload transfer to operate more slowly than the people transfer
process. That will avoid disruption and the type of dangers that that
might create, which Opposition members have described.</hs_Para>

there is the testing that we are carrying out of our approach to
payment by results. We have consulted extensively on this and there are
also pilots under way to test different approaches to payment by
results. Opposition members would have us believe that there has been

undertaking—HMP Peterborough and Doncaster—are providing
significant lessons for our

the reforms—the move to a through-the-gate system supporting the
transition from custody to the community. The difference between them

me deal with the Peterborough pilot and what it does. It is worth
making the point that the interim figures from the pilot—we have
been told often this afternoon that there is no evidence for the
changes we are making, so let me offer some up—show an 8% fall
in reconvictions among offenders released from Peterborough between
September 2010 and June 2012 as compared with the preceding period.
Similarly in the Doncaster pilot, the sixth-month reoffending rate fell
5.7 percentage points compared with the preceding period. That clearly
demonstrates that with targeted support and help aimed at the right
people at the right time, we can divert more offenders from a return to
crime.</hs_Para>

what about what he is arguing for. Secondly, he is absolutely right to
say that the Peterborough and Doncaster pilots were conducted on a
voluntary basis. That is because the law does not allow us to impose
them on a compulsory basis. That is the law I am inviting the right
hon. Gentleman to vote in favour of today, and I very much hope he will
do so. Unless we have that law, we will never be able to impose those

on the issue of the pace of the reforms—an issue of which others
have made much—I want to say two things. First, it is important
that those who are employed by probation
trusts—my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:03:32"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for St Albans (Mrs Main) made this
point—understand where they stand. It does not benefit them for
us to drag our feet at this point. We need to get on with it so that
those people can understand what their own futures hold. Secondly, to
reiterate a point made
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:03:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier), I make
no apologies for the urgency of these reforms: as long as we wait,
there will be further cases of reoffending and further victims created.
Some 600,000 offences are committed every year by those who are
reoffending. That is the problem that everyone here has identified
correctly and everyone says they want to do something about. The
difference between the Government and Opposition Members is that we
know how we are going to do it and they do not have the faintest idea.
They do not know how they would pay for it, either. We know that the
last Government set out to achieve this, but could not afford to do it
within existing budgets. That option is out. We know how we will pay
for this; they do not. They have not told us; they should certainly
support what we propose.</hs_Para>

amendment 5. This welcome proposal deals with the provision of
restorative justice as part of a community sentence. I observed in
Committee that it had become something of a tradition in justice Bills
for the Government to show support for restorative justice and for the
Opposition to try to push them a little further. We duly tabled an
amendment in Committee that would add restorative justice explicitly to
the Bill, with the aim of encouraging its use. The Minister was
supportive, assuring the Committee that he would go away and consider
the amendment. On this occasion, he has not disappointed us.</hs_Para>

restorative justice would be able to be used as part of a
rehabilitation activity requirement, and the Minister has now taken
care to add that explicitly to the Bill. I know that Paul Goggins, who
spoke in Committee in support of this, would have been very pleased
that the Minister has done so. We welcome the amendment and I thank the

Chapman:</Member></B> It is difficult to develop policy sensibly
without having the information to inform decisions. One thing we want
to achieve in this debate is a commitment to gather the data that we
need to make those decisions in a more structured fashion. The specific
issue of rehabilitative services for veterans was first raised in
debate on this Bill last summer by Members in another place. Noble
Lords had taken inspiration from the United States, from
which we have a lot to learn on this issue, and laid down amendments
calling on the Government to establish a pilot of a so-called veterans
court. Veterans courts are now quite well known in the United States,
but, as yet, we have not used them here.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011474001194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011474001194">A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:24:33"></hs_TimeCode>
veterans court is staffed entirely by ex-servicemen and women, and
deals with veterans charged with non-serious offences. As it was
explained in the other place, a veteran who has committed an offence
can be referred from the trial court to the veterans court. Under the
system, the court assigns a fellow veteran as a mentor and systematic
efforts are made to help the offender deal with a range of problems
with which they are struggling to cope, such as substance misuse,
mental health issues, lack of housing, anger management, skills, jobs
and family breakdown. Other problems can be addressed in that way. The
veteran is expected to attend monthly hearings so that progress can be
assessed. Failure to co-operate leads to recall by the trial court and
the possibility of a custodial sentence being imposed. The reported
results of the courts are extremely impressive. The state supreme court
in Pennsylvania reports an average reoffending rate for courts in its
counties of just 1%. In other reports, rates vary from 10% to 30%,
which is substantially lower than rates for custodial
sentences<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:27:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474001195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011474001195"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Llwyd" PimsId="1541" UID="14011474002217" xid="366" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011474002217">Mr

Chapman:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman clearly has a great deal
of experience and expertise in this area. I am heartened by what he has
said, which makes the idea of veterans courts all the more compelling.
Since the first court was opened, the programme has been replicated
across the country, and a number of states have passed legislation
providing for the state-wide establishment of such courts. One has
introduced changes to allow veterans to be diverted, where appropriate,
into treatment rather than prison. That is the mark of simple,
systematic support that can make a life-changing difference to an
individual.</hs_Para>

clauses 2 and 3 are the starting steps. They aim to start our catch-up
with the US and other nations. New clause 3 provides for a pilot of a
variation of the veterans court to be trialled in the UK. New clause 2
requires a wide-ranging consultation on the issue as a whole. Both new

clause 2 would provide that the Secretary of State must consult on

think about the best ways of screening for veteran status and to
consider the international comparisons for best practice—the
list goes on. It will also give us a platform to consider some of the
less straightforward issues. I do not deny that such issues exist, and
we will not press either new clause to a vote this afternoon as they
are complex. However, such issues include the questions of who we
consider to be a veteran and how we define a veteran. A veteran can be
anyone ranging from a 23-year-old injured in Afghanistan to a
90-year-old honoured for world war operations, and there are certainly
differences that should be considered between a recruit who dropped out
of basic training early on and a soldier who served for years. We

a veterans panel. The new clause would provide for a veteran who
received a community sentence to be immediately referred to a veterans
panel that included representatives of probation services as well as
experts on veterans’ health, resettlement and rehabilitation.
The panel would put in place a programme of rehabilitative support for
the offender and would request to see him or her at regular intervals

suggest in my new clause 12 that programmes for tackling domestic abuse

that there is consistency of approach. It would also allay several
fears. I do not want to make this a contentious point, but one of the
fears that has been excited relates to the unpaid work programme that
Serco has taken over, in that some women’s workshops have been
closed as a result of that privatisation. We do not want that to be

am not a big fan of the equality agenda. In the previous Parliament,
not only did I introduce an awful lot of amendments to the then
Equality Bill, but I voted against it. This clause is a perfect example
of why the equality agenda is such a sham. It should not really be
called the equality agenda. It should be called the
“equality but only when it suits us agenda”. All the
people who campaign so vehemently on these issues argue, quite rightly,
that men and women should be treated the same. There should be no
difference in their pay, the way they are treated in the workplace and
so on. I agree with the premise that we should be gender blind in all
matters. That, to me, is true equality. It should not matter what
somebody’s gender is. It should not matter what their colour is,
what religion they are or what their sexual orientation is. Those are

therefore seems to me that gender should also be irrelevant in how the
criminal justice system treats offenders. It should not matter whether
the offender is male or female—they should be dealt with on the
basis of the crime they committed, the seriousness of the 
<?notus-xml column=787?>crime, the persistence of their offending and their likelihood of
reoffending. I do not see what on earth their gender has to do with any
of those factors. Their treatment should be gender

would sign up to. If that is the case, perhaps the Minister and the
other Members who support clause 10 will explain—because for the

should be treated the same, apart from when it comes to sentencing and
the treatment of offenders. Perhaps when he winds up, the Minister will
explain why he thinks that women should be treated far more
preferentially in the criminal justice system than men. If anybody
doubts that, I have all the figures to hand. In the interests of time,
I will not bandy them about the Chamber, but I have them here and am

are treated more favourably than men not only when it comes to the
sentencing of people to prison, although that is particularly stark,
but in the recommendations of the probation service. In a recent
parliamentary question, I asked on how many occasions the probation
service makes a recommendation of immediate custody for sentencing in
the Crown court, which considers the most serious offences, for men and
for women. The probation service recommends immediate custody for 24%
of men who are up before the Crown court, but only 11% of
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474001238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011474001238">People<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:53:47"></hs_TimeCode>
would be forgiven for thinking, on the basis of that statistic, that
the probation service is already bending over backwards to treat women
more favourably than men in the criminal justice system. It recommends
prison twice as often for men as it does for women. And yet there is a
clause that seeks to make the probation service go even further in
giving preferential treatment to women. That seems to me to be
completely
unnecessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011474001239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011474001239">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:54:09"></hs_TimeCode>

men are treated more fairly in the criminal justice system, because
that is where the problem lies at the moment. The figures on that are
stark, and yet the Minister wants to go further in the opposite
direction. The argument I have heard is that women should be a special
case because they are often more vulnerable, but that ignores the fact
that there are plenty of men who come from vulnerable backgrounds as
well. Why are we not interested in those people? Why are we not giving
them a fair lick of the sauce bottle, as they say in Australia? Why is
it only vulnerable women offenders that we are bothered

only is what I have said about prison sentencing true, but men are more
likely than women to be given the highest level of community order.
More men than women go to prison, so we might therefore expect women to
get more higher level community sentences than men because of the
shortage of numbers going to prison. Even at that level, however, more
men are sentenced to the highest level community orders than
women—10% of women compared with 16% of men. At every possible
level in the criminal justice system, men are already treated far more

models for their children. In fact, some prisoner organisations have
made it clear that it is actually a relief when the mother is sent to
prison—in one case they described those mothers as causing

of the polite way to describe that—what the hon. Lady says is
utter garbage. It is utter rot. The idea that women are sent to prison
for short sentences and non-violent offences is a myth—it is a
big myth, but it is a myth. At any one time, there are about 3,700
women in prison. Perhaps she will tell the House which ones she
believes should not be there. Perhaps it is the 211 who are in prison
for murder; the 135 in for manslaughter or attempted homicide; the 352
in for wounding; the 142 in for serious assaults or other violence
against the person; or the 58 in for cruelty to children. Perhaps she
means the 58 who are in there for cruelty to children; or the 
<?notus-xml column=790?>83 who are in for rape, gross indecency with children or
other sexual offences. Perhaps she means the 272 women in prison for
violent robbery. Perhaps she means the 151 who are in there
for burglary. Perhaps she thinks the 398 drug dealers should
not be in prison. Perhaps she means the 91 arsonists; the 24 convicted
of violent disorder; the 45 in there for kidnapping and blackmail; or
the 192 in there for serious fraud and forgeries. Perhaps
she means the 320 in prison for importing drugs into the country, which
end up being sold on our streets. She might mean the 111 others serving
time for other serious drug offences. The hon. Lady might believe those
people should not be in prison, but they are not non-violent, minor
offences. It is a disgrace for her to suggest to the victims of those
crimes that they are the victims of minor, non-violent offences. She
should be absolutely, utterly ashamed of herself for suggesting that.

more men are in prison for those same offences. My point is that men

serious community order and a longer community order, and are more

feature was that their crimes were 
<?notus-xml column=792?>inexplicable, or at least difficult for a person who had not served in
theatre to explain. I remember one case vividly of a young man who had
come back from Iraq and was standing in a fish and chip queue when the
lad behind him who had had too much to drink bumped into him. He
knocked the hell out of the young lad in no time at all. He was trained

previously argued, I would ask: why do we have specialist drug courts

are not used to paying regular bills and so on, and sometimes they do
not balance their monthly income and outgoings, they end up in debt and
everything spirals from there. I remember speaking with SSAFA in south
Wales some time ago, and it told me that about 60% of its work was to

March 2008, I tabled a number of questions to the Minister of State at
the Ministry of Justice, asking how many inmates in UK prisons there
were from service 
<?notus-xml column=793?>backgrounds. I was told that that figure was not available. In the
summer of that year, together with NAPO and the redoubtable Harry
Fletcher—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> He must be
mentioned more often than the Queen in this place, although we are not
supposed to mention the Queen. NAPO estimated that the figure was about
9% of the prison population; at that time, that amounted to roughly
8,000 people. I know that the official figure is 3.5% but I will not
split hairs now. It is a very big problem and my view is that much of
it is avoidable if we offer treatment early enough. In other words,
everybody leaving the services should go through a period of
decompression to enable them, yes, to have medical checks, and also
assistance with things such as balancing budgets, holding down jobs and
all of the other things that other people would have if they were not
in the services. We need to assist personnel to adjust to civilian

readily accept that the majority of returnees will be perfectly fine
and happy, but a large percentage will experience acute social rupture,
become homeless, be cut off from mainstream welfare services and be
isolated, and unless something is done they will fall into a downward
spiral. It is likely that, at the end of the day, they will fall into
the criminal justice system. Abuse of alcohol and drugs and mental

think it essential that the Government invest in the rehabilitation of
veterans when they leave the criminal justice system as well as when
they leave the services, as new clause 2 calls for. The services
available to Army personnel when they leave the forces should be
improved. I have it on good authority—from when I was an adviser
to the Howard League on this subject—that how well someone is
reintegrated into society depends on the senior officer in their
regiment and whether they take an interest or not. I hate to put it in

assessments should be made mandatory for all service leavers.
Post-traumatic stress disorder will not be spotted immediately; it
could manifest itself today or 12 years from now. That is a complex
matter as well. We need to put in place strategies to ensure that the
maximum amount of help is available to all veterans and returnees. We

typical.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000038">I
am also very supportive of the aim of new clause 3, which provides for
veterans rehabilitation panels based on the courts in the United States
to be piloted. In 2010, I sat on the advisory panel to the Nutting
inquiry into veterans in prison, which was sponsored by the Howard
League for Penal Reform. As part of our research, we travelled to the
United States, where we visited the veterans court in Buffalo, New York
State and saw at first hand how it worked. It was described very ably
from the Labour Front Bench earlier, although I have one slight
correction: individuals referred to the veterans courts would normally
expect to spend between 12 and 18 months in prison.</hs_Para>

the federal courts were completely against the idea. My understanding
is that now, following the brilliant court that has been in operation
in Buffalo, there are about 47 throughout the United States, and they
are regularly receiving referrals from federal courts and even, in some
instances, from higher appellate courts 
<?notus-xml column=794?>as well. It is working, but I add a word of caution: getting good
mentors who speak the same language as the individuals and who are
trusted because typically they have been through the same thing in the
services is highly labour-intensive. A bond develops, and the
individuals do not want to let down their mentor. That is how it works,
and it has led to 0% reoffending in Buffalo—an absolutely

something as simple as not having a bank account can be crucial. If

hon. Friend the Member for Barnsley Central (Dan Jarvis). I speak with
some experience, as someone who, as a schoolgirl, grew up in Portsmouth
in the 1970s. I saw at first hand how little support was often given to
people leaving the armed forces in those days. I also saw the aftermath
of the Falklands conflict, when those returning from it were having to
readjust to
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000052">I
want to tell the House a story. In September, I had the privilege of
meeting Harold. Harold served in the Australian air force during the
second world war, and saw action in the Pacific. Harold is 90 years
old. Ten years ago, he began to receive support and counselling for the
experiences that he had had in the 1940s. One of my main reasons for
adding my name to the new clauses is that I remember speaking to Harold
and being very impressed by him, and impressed by the service that the
Australians provide their armed forces. They recognised that, even so
many years later, Harold still needed support.</hs_Para>

has no criminal record. He has been an upstanding member of his

five years ago I was approached by an ex-colleague who asked me to meet
a group he was working with. Tony Wright was that colleague and he is
an ex-Marine. He had to leave the Marines as a young man because of an
injury and he went into the social services, ending up in the probation
service. Everywhere he went he bumped into people who had gone through
similar experiences as him. They had left the forces, sometimes under a
shadow and sometimes not, and they had lost their way. He had become
increasingly concerned about their well-being and eventually decided to
do something about it, and five years ago he set up a group called
About Turn, which has now become the charity Forward Assist.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:30:31"></hs_TimeCode>Tony asked me to
become a patron of the charity. After sitting down with some of the
people he works with, I said I would be very pleased to help
them.</hs_Para>

years ago, Tony won a Winston Churchill scholarship to travel to
America. One of the first places he went to was Buffalo. He went to
some courts that had been spoken about, and he was blown
away by his experience there. The whole thing was based on comradeship.
People who had gone the wrong way in 
<?notus-xml column=797?>life were being pulled back by the people in those courts. Everybody
from the judge downwards was ex-service personnel and their
determination that nobody would fail was what made things succeed.

a result of that visit, Tony asked me if I would go with him to
Arkansas to try to develop a link between Tyneside and Arkansas. The
intention was not only to develop a civic link, but to develop a
veterans exchange project. I went with him last December. While we were
there, we were invited to go and meet Judge Mary McGowan, who runs one
of the courts in Little Rock in Arkansas. She originally ran the drugs
court, but after a discussion about drugs courts she
decided—along with a gentleman called Rob McDonald, who was a
prosecutor at the time—to set up the veterans treatment court.
We sat in and listened to the court in action and spoke to people who
were going through the system and we realised that this was something

Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd): are we saying that these
people are a special case? I think the answer to that has got to be
yes. They are a special case because of what Members in this Chamber
ask of those people. We ask them to go around the world and to be
prepared to die for us and to be prepared to kill for us, and if they
refuse to kill for us, they will do time in jail. That is the complete
opposite to the norm. We ask these people to do abnormal things. If
somebody fires a gun at us, we run away. When somebody fires a gun at
service personnel, they run towards them.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:33:07"></hs_TimeCode> these
people come out of the forces, what happens to them?</hs_Para>

will describe some experiences. A meeting was hosted by Mr Speaker in
the House of Lords last year. There were about 10 to 12 men ranging
from guys in their 20s to a gentleman who was 92 and who had been a
tail-gunner in world war two. One of these guys told a story about when
he came out of the services. He sat down with his wife and said,
“Whatever you do, don’t ever leave me alone with the
children, because I’m not sure I can cope with them.” Is
that not really, really frightening? At least the man had the nous to
accept his potential shortcomings. Another one told his story.
Everything was normal in his life except that every time he went to
bed, he got a panic attack. When he thought it through, he realised the
cause was the simple act of turning the bedroom light off, because the
switch reminded him of the time he was walking along with a friend who
was killed by a booby-trap that was triggered by an electrical switch.
That was put right by putting dimmer switches into his
home<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:34:20"></hs_TimeCode>. These are
the sorts of situations that we, as ordinary people who send those guys
out there, would never ever think about.</hs_Para>

talked with another guy who for 10 years had been given the wrong
medication because nobody had realised that he had been in the forces.
When that fact came out and people started trying to work out the
causes of his problems, it was discovered that they stemmed from the
fact that he was the only man who jumped out of a burning tank that
still had his friends inside. After that discussion had taken place,
the way in which he was looked after completely changed, and he is now
on the right track and working towards a normal life.</hs_Para>

we came back from Arkansas, I was proud to invite people from the US to
Newcastle to develop a link, and to discuss the Buffalo veterans
treatment court. We held a seminar in Newcastle in May, which was
addressed by Prosecutor Rob MacDonald who had come across from the
United States. Lord Beecham was also there. He is a former leader of
Newcastle city council, and a gentleman with whom I have had the
privilege of working for more than a quarter of a century.
He had never heard about the courts before, but he was instantly able
to see how important they were. I asked him whether they could work in
Britain and he said, “There’s no reason why they
can’t work, Dave. We have the models; we already have family
courts. We could adapt that model and we could make this work if we
really wanted to.” He came back here, and he and Lord Ramsbotham
tabled amendments in the House of Lords. Unfortunately, none has been
accepted so far, but I am glad that progress is being made.</hs_Para>

committed really serious crimes. This is about men and women who have
committed crimes almost as a cry for help because they have no money or
because they do not understand the chaotic world that we live in today.
They have had a structured life and, all of a sudden, that life has
been pulled away from them. This is about helping them to make a
difference.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:36:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport (Oliver Colvile) mentioned, we went
to Washington with the Northern Ireland Committee last year to meet
prosecutors and others involved with the veterans treatment courts.
Some members of the Committee were, to put it mildly, cynical about
them. Some, unlike myself, have a legal background. No one pretended
that the courts provided a magic wand, but when it was explained how
they worked, those Committee members agreed that this was something we
should pursue.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>The veterans
treatment court in Buffalo was the first, and more than 100 are now up
and running. I think that two have been given up on, but the rest are
reporting really positive results. They also link into the work being
done on drugs, because the link between drugs and the activities that
the veterans get involved in is hugely relevant.</hs_Para>

am often loth to push the American experience, but the way in which the
Veterans Administration was set up can teach us some lessons. For
example, it can teach us about the horrible experiences that came out
of Vietnam. Vietnam veterans were treated disgracefully in America, but
somewhere along the line, the light went on and the Americans realised
that that was wrong, and that they should not blame those men and women
for the mistakes made by the politicians. The work that has been done
since is a great example to us all. It covers a huge range of things,
and it shows us how we can learn to treat people properly.</hs_Para>

am a great advocate of the national health service. People in this
country tend to think that if someone has a problem, the NHS can put it
right. Well, it can be put right if people happen to put all the pieces
together. As I have said, one of the biggest pieces is the
ability to realise that a man is where he is
because of his experiences —not because he is inherently violent
or because he has a mental or physical problem but because of what he
has gone through, and what we have put him through.</hs_Para>

is a raft of information available from America on how big this problem
can be. A recent seminar held there under the auspices of Justice for
Vets estimated that, in 2010, about 300,000 Iraq and Afghanistan
veterans were suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, and that
almost 50% of the people who had been in those theatres of war were
seen to be suffering from traumatic brain injury. The numbers are huge
compared with those we have seen in previous wars. This is about the
changing nature of war, and about being exposed to the real world of
modern-day warfare 24 hours a day. That is very different from what
people experienced before.</hs_Para>

does not mean that veterans from earlier wars do not have the same
problems. The group I work with in Newcastle has a guy from world war
two and people who went through the situation in Aden. Those events are
still as live to them today as they were 50 years ago or more. They
lost friends there, for example. Those who served in Northern Ireland
also played their part in trying to put things right over there. There
are huge issues involved in how we deal with those people, and we need
to be aware of how we can help them.</hs_Para>

psychiatrist we met in Little Rock said, “You need to understand
that a tsunami of mental health problems is going to hit this nation in
the same way as it hit ours.” We know that the number who went
from these shores was small compared with those who left America, but
the number who are coming back with problems is big. I am not saying,
and I would not like to be portrayed as saying, that everybody who goes
to war and everybody in the services will have these problems, because
they will not, as we know. Lots of people make a good new life for
themselves and move forward, but the ones who are not able to do that
deserve special care from us in this House.</hs_Para>

of the real issues was touched on by

group in Tyneside met one of the Justice Ministers just before
Christmas, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:40:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Plymouth, Sutton and Devonport talked through this issue. What is
clear is that nobody really knows how many people from the forces are
in jail. A gentleman called Colin Back works on rehabilitating the
forces to get them back into work, and he has done work in the
south-east of England. He reckons that we could be talking about almost
12% of this population, which is hugely more than the official figures
suggest. So as part of the review and the ongoing work, we need to get
these figures to see how big the problem is. If we can get a fraction
of those people out of that situation, that would be the right thing to
do, not only for them and for us, but for the economy. If these people
are in work, if their families do not need special support and if there
is no family break-up, we will not have probation on the side and
prisons that are too full—everybody will win, and that is the
great beauty of it.</hs_Para>

can never relate to it in the way 
<?notus-xml column=800?>they can. These people have been given a lifeline and they want us to
help them, and we should do so. Part of that is about supporting these

data collected to sit alongside it? What will be important is to learn
a huge amount from this, not just about the number of people who will

question that has been raised was how we are going to define “a
veteran”. The importance of reservists has been mentioned, so I
will not go back over that in the way that I had planned. We have to
recognise that post-traumatic stress disorder and mental health
conditions relating to service do not necessarily happen on return. I
know that the hon. Member for Penrith and The
Border<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:44:35"></hs_TimeCode> is very
aware of that, but we must ensure that we clearly identify who will be
eligible for veterans courts. We must not just discount people because
their service took place years ago. It was suggested that an
18-year-old who had joined the services but not completed basic
training might not be suitable. May I ask the hon. Gentleman to look at
the research on suicide carried out by Professor Nav Kapur at
Manchester university, because it shows that the highest number of
people who have served in the armed forces and are likely to go on to
take their own life are found among exactly that group? Often that is
because they have been failed by society because they have gone through
the care system and, yet again, they feel that they have been
failed.</hs_Para>

collecting that data, can we please look at how many of those people
who go on to reoffend have gone through the care system? That is
critical information, because we know for a fact that many people who
end up in the criminal justice system have served time in our care
system and have already been failed by society. Let us use this
opportunity constructively and creatively to look at how we can tackle
reoffending and to ensure that we offer the best way forward to
reducing it. We have an opportunity to be not punitive or negative but
constructive and creative. I look forward to the work that will come
forward. If I can help in any way, I look forward to doing
so.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_14_PT_1/9AFD41BABEDAEC283DBC1856B8697520124CCE03" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="14 January 2014">Tuesday

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:46:03"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd) and many others across the

agree that our armed forces do a difficult and dangerous job. We should
also be clear—I know that no one has suggested otherwise in the
course of this debate—that service in the armed forces does not
inevitably lead to a life of crime following a return to civilian
status. Undoubtedly, however, there are those who struggle with the
transition, although, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:46:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Penrith and The Border said, it is also true that those
with a service background are less likely to commit offences than those
who do not have such a background. We should also recognise the
considerable support that the armed forces, as an employer, offer to
those who are returning to civilian
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:46:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

prison and probation services already work with ex-service personnel,
and my hon. Friend will want to look at that and perhaps suggest
further improvements. We are doing more in prisons to identify veterans
as early as possible, and all prisons should now have a
veterans-in-custody support officer to co-ordinate and assist in that
task. The proposed probation reforms offer an opportunity to do better
in that regard, and to encourage all sectors to work together to
identify service personnel and offer the assistance that we can. I
recognise entirely, as

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:47:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) have said, that a
variety of organisations already do good work with offenders, but there
is always an opportunity to do more. The review that

the Member for Penrith and The Border has been invited to lead will, I

Wright:</Member></B> I want to come to the timetable. Without wishing
to get into too much detail on these probing amendments, there are
deficiencies within them that would require further legislation in any
event. I understand the hon. Lady’s point, but I want to answer
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:48:30"></hs_TimeCode> question of
the hon. Member for Darlington about what my hon. Friend’s
review will be covering. First, we will ask him to consider the
rehabilitative needs of ex-service personnel convicted of criminal
offences and sentenced to a custodial or community sentence, and the
current rehabilitation available to them. Secondly, we want him to
consider the process whereby ex-service personnel are identified
following conviction, and that goes very much to the point that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:48:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Blaydon (Mr Anderson) was making. Thirdly, we want him to consider
best practice relating to the rehabilitation 
<?notus-xml column=802?>of ex-service personnel offenders, including evidence of effective
interventions in other countries. Fourthly, he should consult with the
cross-government military reference group, which already exists, and
report to the Secretary of State within six months. That is an
important time frame, because we want to ensure that our reforms are
informed by what my hon. Friend and those working with him can tell us.
We will publish my hon. Friend’s report and place it in the
Library of both Houses so that it is available for all to see. If we
were to wait for the conclusion of the Bill process, as the new clauses
suggest, that would delay the beginning of the review. We do not want
to do that as we want to get going as soon as possible and I hope that
that will meet with the approval of the House.</hs_Para>

view of what the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:49:52"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Darlington has helpfully said, I do not think that I
need to go through the deficiencies we believe that there are in new
clause 3. I recognise the intent behind it and we very much
support that. We want to ensure that the review produced by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:50:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Penrith and The Border can assist us in producing
solutions and suggestions that we can make use of in the course of our
broader reforms.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011496000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000083"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>Let
me say something about new clause 12, tabled by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:50:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell). He is right that it is
hugely important to ensure that domestic violence is treated seriously
and that the programmes he has described are implemented effectively.
He knows that those at highest risk of serious harm will in any event
be the responsibility of the national probation service, and the NPS
will also manage all offenders who are subject to multi-agency public
protection arrangements. That will include all offenders convicted of
sexual and violent offences attracting a sentence of more than a year
and all those whose offending leads them to become registered sex
offenders.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011496000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000084"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:50:57"></hs_TimeCode>On
the specifics of the programmes that the hon. Gentleman described, I
entirely agree with him on his enthusiasm for a consistency of
approach. I hope I can offer him some reassurance, as such programmes
would have to be accredited. Accreditation is overseen, as he will
know, by the National Offender Management Service, which ensures that
the programmes are evidence-based and have therefore demonstrated their
effectiveness in reducing reoffending. The programme requirement will
continue to be available to sentencers, and the NPS will have a key
role in assessing offenders and providing advice to courts on their
suitability for such programmes. CRCs will be mandated to deliver the
sentence imposed by the court, and that will include the provision of
accredited programmes. All offenders, whether they are managed by the
NPS or CRCs, will be able to access accredited programmes and other
interventions provided by CRCs.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011496000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000085">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:51:51"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that the hon. Gentleman is reassured by those points. I understand
that he would prefer all those programmes to be delivered by the public
sector, but I think that he and I would agree that what is crucial is
that the standards and quality of those programmes are maintained. We
will achieve that by virtue of accreditation and, of course, the
accreditation process will still take place within the public
sector.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011496000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000086"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:52:15"></hs_TimeCode>I
am grateful for what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:52:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Darlington and others have said about Government amendment 5, which
I will move at the appropriate time. I am also 
<?notus-xml column=803?>grateful to the hon. Lady for raising the issue initially in Committee.
I also want to take the opportunity to pay tribute, as she did, to Paul
Goggins and the contribution he made not only to the amendment but to
the restorative justice agenda over a considerable period of time.
There are few who can say that they have contributed more to the agenda
than he did. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:52:44"></hs_TimeCode>I
am grateful to the hon. Lady for her support, and I hope that there
will support on both sides of the House for amendment 5.</hs_Para>

final amendment in the group is amendment 7, tabled by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:52:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies). As he has outlined,
the amendment would remove clause 10, which was added in the other
place, rightly, by the Government. I am sorry to disappoint him, but it
would not be right to remove the clause at this stage. I know that he
has a healthy disrespect for consensus, but the fact that almost
everybody disagrees with him does not automatically mean that they are
all wrong. In this case, I do not think that they are. We should
recognise that this is not a sentencing question, as he says that it
is—I agree that there is no justification for treating female
offenders per se more leniently than male offenders. We are discussing
not the sentencing process but the process of rehabilitation that takes
place after sentencing. It seems to me that the evidence is clear that
how one approaches rehabilitation for female offenders must be
materially different, if one expects it to be successful, from how one
approaches it for male offenders. That is what clause 10 sets
out.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011496000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000088"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:54:05"></hs_TimeCode>The
experience of female offenders is different in a number of ways,
whether that concerns the abuse that they might have suffered before
committing offences or the rate at which anxiety and depression are
suffered. As my hon. Friend said, female offenders have different rates
of child care responsibilities from male offenders, so a
one-size-fits-all approach will not, in all likelihood, be successful.
Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:54:32"></hs_TimeCode> me be clear
again that this is not about advocating preferential treatment for
women in the criminal justice system or a different sentencing regime
for female offenders; it is about ensuring that our reforms remain
responsive to offenders’ needs in order to ensure that we turn
their lives around and end
reoffending.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496000089">On<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T17:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>

restorative justice, the Bill gives many more victims the means to

Bill provides for testing after release for a wider range of offenders

enter the justice system as juveniles but leave as adults, the Bill
gives the support they need, either from an adult probation provider or
a youth offending team, whichever is best suited to their
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496001244">I

too long, the criminal justice system’s efforts to reduce
reoffending has been hampered by a major gap in the law—the lack
of any statutory supervision for offenders released from short prison
sentences. As a result, the most prolific offenders have historically
received the least support. The Bill will change that. It will put an
end to offenders who cause havoc in our constituencies leaving prison
with only £46 in their pockets and little or no support. It is
not a surprise that about 60% of them go on to reoffend within a year.
It is often easier for them to return to a life of crime than to sort
their lives out. The Bill begins to address that huge
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496001246">The
human cost of not providing support for that group is enormously high:
85,000 crimes every year, including hundreds of serious sexual and
violent offences. The Bill will significantly reduce the terrible harm
that that group of offenders currently causes to victims and
communities. It will also help those people to turn their lives
around.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0003.htm#14011496001247">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T18:24:38"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill will give 12 months of licence and supervision after release to
every offender who is given a short sentence. That will give those
working with them the time and professional discretion to deliver the
rehabilitation necessary to provide proper mentoring support after
offenders leave prison to help them turn their lives around. It will
create a light-touch framework for dealing with breach of supervision
that allows for sanctions in the community or a warning, as well as a
return to custody. It will expand the group of offenders who can be
tested for drugs after release from prison to tackle what is a major
cause of reoffending, and it will make

Much of the public do not realise the work of the probation service,
and it is a sign of its success that the Government will leave to it
the most high-risk offenders. It is welcome that offenders released
from sentences of less than two years will be subject to at least 12
months of mandatory supervision in the community, but it is
multi-national companies with no track record in this area that will be
responsible for this, rather than the probation service, which we know

private company involvement instead. That is precisely the kind of
piloting and testing that his predecessor planned and which the Justice
Secretary cancelled in his first week in his job in a fit of pique,
when he announced that his own gut instinct trumped evidence and
statistics. Does the House really think, without any evidence whatever,
that a privatised and fragmented probation service will be able to

is simply wrong for the Justice Secretary to argue that those who are

Bill will now return to the other place. I hope colleagues there will
insist that their clause—to ensure that probation privatisation
should not happen without both Houses having the opportunity properly
to scrutinise the Government’s detailed plans to change the
structure of the probation service—is reinserted into the Bill.
I see no reason why the other place should back down. The concerns
reflected in the clause it inserted are as important now—if not
even more so—than they were last summer. Scandals involving
private companies have increased, and more evidence has come to light
about concerns from the chief inspector of probation and from the
Ministry’s own internal assessment of the risks. It is thus only
right and proper for the Government to submit their full and detailed
plans to proper parliamentary scrutiny, and not rush things through. We
cannot afford to take reckless gambles where public safety is
concerned. The Government’s plans risk doing exactly that, which
is why we cannot support

Labour made provision for a Bill but did not bring it into practice
when they had the opportunity. We have wasted too much time already.
The previous Government facilitated the legislation eight years ago,

Two sets of statistics have been published. The comparators are between
the absolutely numerical reduction at Peterborough and the reduction
among a comparable group at a prison elsewhere in the country. The 20%
figure, which is the highest, refers to the number of further crimes
committed by the cohort, while the lower figures show the overall
reduction in the absolute rate of reoffending—the binary rate. I

request that the Government take some action on this case, although I
am under no illusion that that is very difficult for the Government,
even with the best will in the world. Austria is a modern European
country with a judicial system that follows the rules of natural
justice and it is very difficult for any Minister from that country,
let alone this country, to comment on, or interfere in, the process.
However, such is the scale of the injustice that has happened to Beth
Schlesinger that I hope the Minister can in some way approach the
Austrian ambassador to the United Kingdom or the Austrian Government to
express the concerns that many of my constituents have on this matter.

to explain to the House what has happened is to go through the
chronology of the events. Beth Schlesinger—her maiden name was
Alexander—married Mr Schlesinger in October 2006. On 24 May 2009
the twins Samuel and Benjamin were born to the couple. Unfortunately
the marriage then deteriorated and Mr Schlesinger became violent and
abusive towards Beth Schlesinger and on 15 February 2010 Mr Schlesinger
tried to have Beth committed to a mental hospital in Austria. Because
there had been violence against Beth, however, the police were called
and they removed Mr Schlesinger from the family home. He was
given five minutes to pack his bags, and a restraining order was placed
on him. He was subsequently given limited access to the children. Full
custody was given to Beth Schlesinger; he was given two hours’
supervised access, three times a week.</hs_Para>

far, so understandable, unfortunately. It is not an uncommon
arrangement for married couples, in this country and elsewhere in
Europe, for the mother to end up with custody and for the father to
have supervised access because of his violent activities. Mr
Schlesinger had been violent and abusive not only towards Beth but
towards her father and her father-in-law.</hs_Para>

things took a turn for the worse. Mr Schlesinger requested a friend of
his, Konstanze Thau, a high court judge in Austria, to contact Susanne
Göttlicher, the judge in charge of the case. It is highly
irregular for a 
<?notus-xml column=824?>high court judge to intervene in another court on behalf of a father who
has shown himself to be violent. However, after that meeting,
Beth’s custody rights were reduced. The judge also ordered that
the children were not to leave Austria.</hs_Para>

January 2011, the father was given further, unsupervised, access to the
children. I am told that that happened through a legal technicality.
Let us remember that, after the violent episode, Mr Schlesinger had
tried to have Beth committed. I suppose we would call it
“sectioned” in this country. A doctor, Ulrike Willinger,
then produced a psychiatric report on Beth, in which she recommended,
without having fully examined all the people involved in the case, that
the children should be returned to Mr Schlesinger’s control.
That report was considered by the judge on 17 June 2011.</hs_Para>

further report was produced by Dr Sinko-Sanz, a qualified psychiatrist,
which informed the court that there was nothing wrong with Beth and
that the children were developing normally. Social services put in a
similar report. Unfortunately, however, Judge Susanne Göttlicher
—who had previously been visited by the friend of Mr
Schlesinger—decided to give full custody to the father. That was
an extraordinary decision, and no details were given in the order of
how the handover should happen.</hs_Para>

October 2011—this is a crucial point, because these decisions
were never carried out—Beth brought an appeal and the
father’s rights were reduced; he was granted only temporary
custody. Crucially, the higher court asked for a further investigation,
and that reports should be drawn up on the children, the father and the
mother. That instruction from the higher court was never carried out,
however, and the only reports that were ever produced for Judge
Göttlicher’s court were those relating to Beth. As well
as asking for those three reports, the father was told by the
courts—there is a specific word for this, as is often the case
with the German language—to give as much information to the
children’s mother. That was so that she could understand all the
needs—</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14011496001367" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0004.htm#14011496001367">7

Stringer:</Member></B> The father was basically asked to tell the
mother what the children’s needs were and what was happening,
but what actually happened was that he cancelled 50 of Beth’s
visits. Rather than him looking after the children, Filipino nannies
were hired to do that for 12 hours a day and at weekends, and to take
them to and from the nursery. Beth became more and more worried about
the children; Samuel had four teeth taken out without any medical
reasons given and Benjamin had two teeth removed. Beth was not only
worried about what was happening as the visits were cancelled and the
children were upset, but it became clear that in the court’s
previous decision Judge Göttlicher had suppressed a report from
the nursery which had shown, and expressed the view, that when the
children were seeing the father they had been crying and screaming, and
had been extremely distressed. Clearly, Judge Göttlicher had had
that report but it was not used. Things went from bad to worse, in
terms not only of access to the 
<?notus-xml column=825?>children, but finance. Mr Schlesinger stopped paying maintenance and,
indeed, tried to demand that Beth paid maintenance. She was now given
access only on two afternoons a week and three hours every second
Sunday, which represents an extraordinary turnaround from the original
situation.</hs_Para>

July 2013, the judge awarded full custody to the father. At
this time, crucially, no assessment of the father, or of the father
with the children, had taken place. Beth had been examined in German
for the psychiatrist’s report that had recommended against her.
She is not fluent in the language, and so her answers had been slow,
which was counted as a mark towards her being considered mentally
unstable. Some of the relationships involving Judge Konstanze Thau
became clear, and not only the one with Mr Schlesinger; her husband
worked in the same hospital as Dr Willinger. I do not usually believe
in conspiracies, but in this case the decisions that were taken were so
strange that one has to suspect that undue influence and conspiracy
were taking

has asked me to draw to the House’s attention a case of a
similar custody issue, although much more extreme in many ways, that
has been before the higher Austrian courts in the past week or so. It
involved a neglected and filthy child—not the same as in the
Schlesinger family’s case—that had been taken away from
the mother, who was seen to be inadequate. The higher courts in Austria
said in giving the child back to the mother that a loving
child’s bond is of “paramount consideration”. I
agree with that, and that Austrian court got it right in a
much more difficult case than this one. Court cases are always
difficult to compare because they involve details that one
does not know, but I think that that case highlights what has gone
wrong in Beth’s case.</hs_Para>

this case is about a violent father who has been violent towards the
mother of his children and other members of the family and who has been
given custody of two children. The children are clearly unhappy. They
do not speak very well, and they are still in nappies beyond the age of
four. He was given custody of them after exerting undue influence on
the courts over a mother who is completely blameless. As a Member of

should begin by saying that the only thing that matters is the best
interests of the children, Benji and Sammy Schlesinger. After two and a
half years in the care of their father, they are suffering from
seriously impaired development and appear traumatised. The decision to
award custody to the father, Dr Schlesinger, is one of the worst
miscarriages of justice I have ever experienced during my long period
as an elected representative. Beth Schlesinger has been falsely and
cruelly labelled mentally ill and an unfit mother, labels both
disproved by independent professionals. She is a mother, by the way,
who is still allowed unsupervised access to her children. If this woman
was an unfit mother and suffered from serious mental health problems, 
<?notus-xml column=827?>surely the norm would be supervised access at the
very least. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:11:07"></hs_TimeCode>As
my hon. Friend has said, the father’s documented history of
abusive behaviour has not even been considered by the relevant court. A
senior Austrian judge, Konstanze Thau, a friend of the father’s
family, sought to influence the judge hearing the case on behalf of the
father.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011496001324" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0004.htm#14011496001324"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>There
is an element of the case that my hon. Friend did not mention. A senior
social worker, Dr Kindlehoffer, who testified to the mother’s
positive parenting skills and expressed serious concern about the
integrity of the legal process, has been intimidated and threatened
with the loss of her job. As a consequence, she is no longer willing to
express an opinion on the case. As my hon. Friend has said, the final
decision made by the Austrian court was that the father should be
awarded custody without any independent professional assessment of the
father, the children or the interaction of the father with the
children, despite the fact—this is not generally
known—that one of the children has been referred for
professional help because they are self-harming, at such a tender age,
and despite the fact that child protection agencies have been called to
the father’s home following reports of children crying
endlessly, in an unusual way, in distress. Despite all that the
court’s final decision was one word: “refused”. It
refused the appeal.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend has said, it is ordinarily incredibly difficult for any
Government to intervene in the justice system of another country. I can
testify to that as a former Foreign Office Minister. The default
position of the civil service in the Foreign Office—I hope that
people will take this in a good natured manner—is not to get
involved in civil disputes of any nature. That is the default position
and I am almost certain that that is the advice that the Minister will
be given.</hs_Para>

Minister has been incredibly sensitive in how he has previously dealt
with the case and he has offered to provide an element of assistance on
behalf of the Foreign Office. At that time, the solicitor
for Beth Schlesinger advised that that would not necessarily be
helpful, but we are long past that point now. The family and their
current legal representative are very clear that any assistance that
the UK Government could give would be welcome and could make a
difference. We are asking the Minister to raise the case, as my hon.
Friend said, with the Austrian ambassador to the UK, to raise it,
through the relevant channels, with the Austrian Justice Ministry and
to ensure that there is a comprehensive review so that, if possible and
where appropriate, the case can be reopened. We are realistic enough to
realise that it would be entirely inappropriate for the UK Government
to instruct the Austrian Justice Ministry or the Austrian courts on the
decision they ultimately make, but there is no question but that there
are serious issues to be addressed about a flawed process
and, as my hon. Friend said—I will go even further—about
corruption. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:13:32"></hs_TimeCode>

urgency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0004.htm#14011496001327"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:15:11"></hs_TimeCode>I

is a sad fact that international custody cases are becoming more
frequent, as in today’s world more parents of different
nationalities marry and bring up children, and marriages and
relationships sadly sometimes collapse. Although in many cases
arguments about the care and custody of the children can be settled
amicably, in an increasing number of such cases we see parents going
before the courts to argue about who should have custody or in which
country the children should reside. In more extreme but increasingly
common cases, one parent absconds with the child without permission, an
action that can quickly escalate into charges of abduction, and arrest
warrants being issued.</hs_Para>

case is different from those. In cases of child abduction, it is our
standard practice in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to urge
parents to look to The Hague convention to provide them with the way
forward. The Hague convention, as the House knows, provides a mechanism
by which to determine in an international dispute over custody in which
country’s courts the children’s future should be
decided.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0004.htm#14011496001331">Let
me turn to the case we are debating this evening. Ms Schlesinger is a
British national and her husband is an Austrian national. They both
currently live in Austria. Their children were born in that country in
2009 and have lived there ever since. That is why this custody case has
been heard by the Austrian courts, rather than the United Kingdom
courts. Ms Schlesinger contacted my office only this week to outline
her concerns about the welfare of her children—concerns that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:19:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Blackley and Broughton described in some detail.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:19:30"></hs_TimeCode> was somewhat
reassured to see that she has the support of her family and friends and
specialist non-governmental organisations, such as the Twins and
Multiple Births Association, but I am the first to acknowledge that her
separation from her children and her consuming anxieties about their
welfare make this an incredibly difficult time for
her<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0004.htm#14011496001332">I
want to explain the Government’s involvement in supporting Ms
Schlesinger to date and then move on to how we see the case
today. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>In
February 2010, Ms Schlesinger’s father visited the
British embassy in Vienna to discuss his daughter’s situation.
Divorce and child custody proceedings were taking place in the Austrian
courts at the time and Ms Schlesinger was clearly concerned that her
husband might prevent her from returning permanently to the UK with the
children, following the breakdown of their
relationship<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:20:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the embassy was able to help by providing our list of English-speaking
lawyers in Austria and information on local women’s support
organisations and international organisations with relevant experience.
Our consular staff explained that, in cases where families could not
agree custody arrangements for the children on their own, it would be
for the courts to decide which parent should retain custody and where
the children should be
resident.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0004.htm#14011496001334">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:20:45"></hs_TimeCode>
staff also explained that both the UK and Austria are party to the 1980
Hague convention on international parental child abduction. That means
that both countries have agreed that, where there is an international
dimension to custody disputes, it is the court in the country where the
children usually live that is best placed to make a custody decision in
the best interests of the child. In this case, for the reasons I have
described—the children were born in Austria and have always
lived there—that is the Austrian court.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:21:12"></hs_TimeCode> July 2011, as
the hon. Gentleman has explained, the Austrian courts awarded custody
of the children to their father, Michael
Schlesinger<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:21:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011496001335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/debtext/140114-0004.htm#14011496001335">When
parental relationships break down and they cannot agree where a child
should live, the resulting custody case inevitably causes untold
distress to everybody involved—from the children themselves and
both parents to the extended family. That distress can only be
amplified when large geographical distances separate, or threaten to
separate, one parent from their
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:21:44"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, as I explained when I met the hon. Gentleman and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T19:21:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bury South last year, while there is no doubt that this is a deeply
distressing case for Ms Schlesinger and her family, there is

terms, even if they disagreed with the perspective they thought I was
going to take. I would not like to suggest that I have read every one
of the more than 400 e-mails that I have received on this subject down
to the very last detail, but I have reflected on the key points that
people raised and hope that they will appreciate that I have attempted
to do so. It is important to look at this subject as calmly and
respectfully as we can, because these sorts of plans and projects

phase 1 is complete the journey time from Scotland to London could be
cut by half an hour—that might not sound a lot, but it is an
important reduction—because trains will be travelling at a
higher speed for the first part of the journey before connecting on to
conventional lines. When phase 2 is complete, journey time could be
reduced to around three and a half hours, which would be a significant
gain. However, my support for HS2 is not simply about cutting journey
times from Scotland. I think that the project is in the national
interest. The fundamental underpinning of that view is the need to grow
our economy throughout the United Kingdom, and improved connectivity is
a crucial part of achieving that. It is particularly important for the
midlands, the north and Scotland: we need to distribute our centres of
manufacturing and service industries throughout the country, and
improved connectivity is the key to doing
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000010"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Simon Burns" PimsId="2380" UID="14011455000230" xid="82" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000230"><B>Mr

be able to distribute our investment in our economy more generally, and
connectivity is important to that. We have seen, for example, what has
happened in Salford with the development of Media City and the
BBC’s sometimes apparently painful move  
<?notus-xml column=200?>up there, which some people obviously felt meant going to the end of the

argument about why, if we want to grow regional economies, we need to
improve connectivity and why that is not possible within the existing

20 years, and there is limited spare capacity. Investment in
existing lines has been increased and, we acknowledge, that investment
is continuing under this Government, but—this is perhaps the
point that the right hon. Member for Chelmsford (Mr Burns) wished to
make—the ability to make further improvements is decreasing

number of objections are made to the arguments about capacity. Some

continue, but that is unlikely, given the patterns we have seen. The
factors that are pushing people away from their cars and on to
trains—high petrol prices and congested roads—are
unlikely to change any time soon. Any type of sustained economic
growth, which we all say we want, is likely to push demand for
long-distance travel up further, not reduce it. On top of that, there
are the predictions for growth in our population, which are now well
established.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000021"><Member ContinuationText="Andrea Leadsom" PimsId="5676" UID="14011455000240" xid="1204" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000240"><B>Andrea

other point that some people have raised about capacity is that some
inter-city trains operating at peak times—those operating in and
out of Euston, for example—are not actually full and we should
use that capacity before building a new line. However, on present
patterns, it is likely that that capacity will be used up by the time
the new line is built. London Midland trains, for example, which serve
many commuter towns on the west coast main line, are already full to
bursting and room must be created for trains to serve those
destinations. Upgrading the west coast main line would be difficult and
disruptive and would not provide the other
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000024">Some
people have argued that HS2 would not release useful capacity around
Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. Existing services will still be
needed in some places, but those trains will be able to stop at
intermediate stations. The lines will remain and the trains will be
able to stop at more intermediate stations without holding up
longer-distance travellers, giving a substantial boost to regional
connectivity. For example, stations between Coventry and Birmingham New
Street would stand to gain more
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000025">We
could tackle commuter demand at the southern end of the west coast main
line by building more cross-rails. One is being built at the moment and
another is planned. I am not saying that those schemes are not helpful,
but if such an approach continues it will exacerbate many of the
problems created by London’s dominance and would not help
economic growth in other parts of the country. People often suggest
that other schemes could achieve that, but no one has come up with firm
proposals in which we can have confidence. The main transport corridor
between Newcastle, Leeds, Manchester and Liverpool—the
trans-Pennine route—is already being electrified and will
provide that greater connectivity, which is good. This is not a matter
of either/or.</hs_Para>

argument that is often raised is that the business case is not
sufficiently strong. Perhaps one of the biggest arguments is about the
use of time and the value that is placed on that. People say that in
the modern age people can work on trains so there is not the same value
to be gained from speeding up journey times, but that does not make up
for the fact that it is even more valuable if staff can arrive at their
destination and return in a shorter time. Although the cost-benefit
ratio is low compared with smaller projects—some people have
suggested that road bypasses have a much higher cost-benefit
ratio—we cannot build a whole network with small projects. As
large projects go, HS2 is relatively good value for
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000027">There
are wider economic benefits that are not always captured in the
business case. One argument that I have already addressed but want to
talk about a bit more is that HS2 will be a disbenefit to the midlands,
the north and other parts of the UK. Examples sometimes cited from
Europe are that high-speed rail there has not benefited the places to
which it goes. What matters is whether the project connects significant

London. That is why the route must be built as suggested.

and the pull factors. Some opponents of HS2 say that it would increase
centralisation in London, but I argue the opposite. The pull factors
towards the south-east exist despite the disadvantages of
London—high property prices, lack of land for development, long
travel times to work from not far away, and so on. I am seriously
worried that we are seeing more of that than we have for some time. As
the population is pulled in that direction, it increases even more as
people who move to work in the financial services sector and other
sectors require other public and private services to support them, so
London’s population becomes more and more dense. If we genuinely
want to decentralise our economy, we must think about that
seriously.</hs_Para>

looks carefully at the plans for Euston station and where the

More alarmingly, we heard this morning that over the next six weeks,
Sir David will prove that he can produce HS2 cheaper and quicker. That

October, the Government released yet another version of it, which
confirmed the shrinking benefit. The benefit-cost ratio for phase 1 is
now estimated to be 1.4, excluding the wider economic benefits.
However, experts working on the figures—particularly those in
HS2 Action Alliance, which includes some great experts on transport and
economics—have estimated that the real figure could be under

order to deal with the bad publicity that HS2 was getting about the
benefit-cost ratio and the project’s value for money, which is a
shrinking benefit, a report from KPMG was commissioned. That was
supposed to build a positive view of the railway, as we all now know.
It claimed that the economy would be boosted by £15
billion a year. Within days of that report being published, that claim
was challenged from many angles. In September, Robert Peston, the
BBC’s business editor, 
<?notus-xml column=206?>drove a coach and horses through the report. He rightly pointed out that
many of the gains that KPMG had calculated were based on a reasonable
notion that companies would be established in places where there were
better transport links, but the report took no account of whether those
regions contain available land to site new or bigger companies, or
actually have the people with the relevant skills to employ. As those
two features are the fundamental causes of poor growth in many parts of
the UK, it is amazing to me that the report even stated:</hs_Para>

our regional economies from this potential rail link will cause real
problems. The negative impact on the north-east of Scotland, for
example, was described as “significant to say the least”
by the Aberdeen chamber of commerce. Areas from Cardiff to Kettering
have been identified as ones that will lose millions of pounds from
their annual GDP. I agree—that was missed out of the report.

this project is so good, perhaps the Minister will also, when he
replies, let us know why the Government have still not published the
Major Projects Authority reports, which highlight the risk. I believe
that they have been classified as amber and red. If the Government are
so convinced that this is such a wonderful project, it is important
that those reports are made public. After all, we came into government

an environmental statement of nearly 50,000 pages, from which, as the

to my constituents that some of their grievances are aired. The

such an extent that they will probably be put out of business. People
cannot run an equestrian business next to a major construction site;
nor can they use ground that has been submerged in 50 feet of soil.

There will be a lot of substitution in the economy. Yes, businesses

when the BBC, which

for Edinburgh East referred to, went to Salford. That move has
attracted many production companies and media companies to that area.
However, that is substitution, because the businesses have been drawn
from other parts; hence one of the very important things that was
highlighted in the KPMG report was the disinvestment and the permanent
loss to GDP of other regions as businesses are attracted falsely to the

(Mrs Gillan) that I am not speaking as part of any lobby, and I have
not been asked by anybody else to come here. I have simply come to

Scottish perspective, support for high-speed rail continues to be
almost universal. One or two people oppose it, but the vast majority of
interest groups across different sectors support it. The Scottish
Government are united with the other political parties in Scotland in
supporting HS2. The Scottish partnership group for high-speed rail has
a wide range of supporters, including the major local authorities in
Edinburgh and Glasgow, CBI Scotland, the Scottish Chambers of Commerce,
Scottish Enterprise, the Scottish TUC, Transform Scotland—an
environmentally focused transport organisation—and the local
transport networks. There is wide public support as well.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011455000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000088">Those
organisations clearly set out the case for high-speed rail in the UK
and the benefits that it will provide to Scotland. To me, those seem
self-evident, although others do not agree. There are numerous
arguments, and it is not right to single out one issue as the priority,
whether it be speed, capacity or modal shift, because they are all
important. HS2 will provide faster journey times, increase capacity and
promote modal shift from air and road to rail, and it will support and
benefit businesses not only in Scotland but in the rest of the UK. All
those factors together make a powerful case for HS2.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011455000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000089">We have heard
the argument that instead of spreading economic benefits throughout the
country, HS2 will suck economic activity into London. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds) has pointed
out, if we took that argument to its logical extreme, we would have to
tear up all the existing roads and railways. Presumably, if we were to
return to the days of toll roads with a turnpike every few miles and
highwaymen along the road to stop us getting anywhere, it would lead to
wonderful economic benefits for the rest of the country. I take that
argument to its extreme to highlight the folly of the suggestion that
HS2 will suck economic activity into London. Supporters of HS2 cannot
simply assert that, however; we must give examples of the economic
benefits that will result from the project, and recognise that some
cities and some parts of the country might lose out from HS2 if it were
not done in the right way. The answer is not to say “No
HS2”, but to address the problems of areas that might suffer
genuine negative economic consequences if high-speed rail is not
introduced in the right way.</hs_Para>

outline the powerful case for HS2 from a Scottish perspective. Scotland
has an important tourist industry, and many tourists come to Scotland
not only by rail connections, but by road and air. Anyone who travels
regularly on the routes from Scotland to the south will know that the
passenger trains are already pretty busy, so tourism might be further
enhanced by better, faster trains with improved capacity. Again, it is
a question of people’s choices. London is and always will be a
major tourist hub, and visitors to London increasingly go on to visit
other places. They have to decide whether to go on, for example, to
Edinburgh, 
<?notus-xml column=211?>Glasgow, Manchester or somewhere on the continent of Europe. If the
choice is between travelling to other destinations in the UK on
relatively slow routes, and travelling in Europe using better rail
routes or improved air connections, visitors may well choose not to
travel within the UK but to go elsewhere. The tourist industry,
therefore, strongly supports
HS2.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000091">HS2
also has business consequences. It is not simply a question of speed,
because modern technology allows people to work together without
necessarily all being in the same place at the same time. Nevertheless,
we still need to produce things that must be transported, and we still
need to have business meetings, so people make choices based on the
accessibility of locations to head offices and other sites of economic
activity. A business that is well connected to a major economic
hub—in reality, that will often be London—has a much
better chance of being successful than one that is not easily
accessible.</hs_Para>

to improving connections to London, it is important to improve
connectivity between other cities and regions in the UK. We have heard
about the benefits of faster links between cities such as Leeds,
Manchester and Birmingham, and I have another example of how regional
economies might benefit from high-speed rail. In Edinburgh and the
south-east and east of Scotland, the strong renewables sector is an
important and growing part of the economy. There is also a strong
renewables cluster around the north-east of England, but although there
are some connections between the two, I get the impression that they do
not work together as much as they could to achieve maximum benefit. Who
knows where high-speed rail might go in the future? Increased
connectivity between the east of Scotland and the north-east of England
would benefit that potential regional
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000093">Edinburgh,

depends on good air links as well as rail links. HS2 would allow
travellers the option of using airports further south by providing
direct links to Scotland.</hs_Para>

about to come to that important point, so I will not repeat what she
has said. As I suggested, high-speed rail stations can be important
hubs and promoters of economic activity, and it will be up to local
governments, communities and businesses to make the most of the
opportunities that those connections offer. They will have to choose

suck prosperity away from their economy.</hs_Para>

of the railway age, towns reacted in all sorts of ways to new railway
lines. Some towns chose deliberately to keep the railways away and
avoid building stations, but they soon started to campaign for branch
lines to reach their communities. I believe that some communities close
to the route of HS1 regret choosing 
<?notus-xml column=212?>not to have a station and reap the benefits that we now see. That
emphasises the fact that communities across the country must take the
opportunities that arise from HS2, because if they do not, they will
not get the benefits.</hs_Para>

question about whether HS2 could damage the economic position of
certain parts of the country. If HS2 does not go from London to the
midlands, the north and Scotland, those parts of the country are in
great danger of becoming worse off as a result of economic developments
elsewhere. If there are improved transport links from London to
elsewhere in Europe and the world, but no such links going further
north, those of us from communities further north will be relatively
worse off. In addition to the high-speed services from London to
Brussels and Paris, operators are planning direct high-speed services
all the way from London to Cologne and Frankfurt, for example. If
people and businesses in London have access to that high-speed link,
but we are relatively worse off further north, our economic position is
likely to be damaged. That is why I strongly support the argument for
high-speed routes reaching Scotland as early as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000098">It

reaches further north to Glasgow and the rest of Scotland. I understand
that the parameters for the study laid out by the Department for
Transport state that all options should be considered. That could
include new lines, upgrading existing lines or a combination of both. I

wrong approach. There are no economic or technical reasons why starts
on the line could not be made at more than one location. I understand
that part of the difficulty has more to do with politics. I understand
the wish of the Government not to have to deal with the difficulties of
the HS2 route from London to Birmingham

Manchester, or from Manchester to further north. It
would be great if Members on both Front Benches made it clear that time

of stopping what we are doing on the hybrid Bill on the line between
Birmingham and London, and progressing quickly with the northern
connectivity. We could, for example, bring in a Bill at the back end of
the year for the northern stages, which could go through Parliament

will make some final points as briefly as possible. First, one strong
argument for committing to high-speed routes as well as high-speed
trains going to Scotland is that the economic case for the entire line
is improved if Scotland is linked into the process at an early stage.
That point has been made by other people, and I strongly endorse
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000114">My
second point is about the economic benefits of the line, not just in
the long term, but in the construction phase, as a direct consequence
of engineering and construction. The Government must assure people like
me that they are making every effort to ensure that the benefits are
spread as far as possible throughout the country. A document on HS2 was
recently produced, I think by the Department for Transport, that
emphasised how Crossrail had brought a wide range of job benefits to
large parts of the country. If one looks at the chart in that document,
the vast majority of the benefits, perhaps unsurprisingly, were focused
around the Crossrail route and south-east England. Hardly any benefits
from construction, engineering and knock-on consequences reached
further north. The Government must ensure that a major effort is made
to make sure that the indirect benefits from the construction
phase—jobs and employment—reach the entire
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000115">Finally,
I have a question for the Minister about the further education college
that has been proposed to provide trained workers for the high-speed
line. I recognise that the college must be based somewhere, but all its
activities need not be based around one location; nor must they take
place at just one physical college. That initiative should be aimed at
ensuring that the job benefits from the construction phase of HS2 are
spread as far as possible throughout the country. I suggest to the
Minister that it would be worth while to enter into discussions with
the Scottish Government at an early stage, so that there could perhaps
be a linked initiative in Scotland to provide similar benefits to the
section of the HS2 line that I hope will be promoted by both the UK and
Scottish Governments at a relatively early stage. In that way, we too
can see the jobs benefits, as well as the longer-term economic
benefits, of HS2, for which I think the case is very
strong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000116"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Edward Leigh (in the Chair)" InTheChair="True" PimsId="1455" UID="14011455000299" xid="352" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000299">Sir

Buckinghamshire, the released capacity on the conventional west coast
line that goes through Buckinghamshire and other related conventional
lines will ensure that passengers using those lines to commute to
London will have more capacity and a better journey experience, because
others who might otherwise have been on those conventional trains
travelling to London will be using the high-speed
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000126">High

Kent has shown, it will also create jobs through the actual building of
the railways and through increased business activity, particularly
around stations, whether at Birmingham, outside Sheffield, at
Manchester, or elsewhere where there might be stations. The figures
that I have seen, which some people would say are on the conservative
side, suggest that 100,000 extra jobs will be created, although a
conglomeration of local authorities has come up with the bolder
suggestion of 400,000 jobs. Equally importantly, 70% of the economic

a more open and reasonable approach to it. According to the report,
when High Speed 2 is up and running to Leeds and Manchester, the annual
benefit to the economy is anticipated to be in the region of £15
billion a year. Of course, as was said, some businesses and jobs may
well be pulled away from other areas. That is part of economic life,
but it does not mean that we should not allow a project that will bring
a potential £15 billion a year in improvement to the economy
once it is up and running. People must be careful about rubbishing a
report that shows the potential for job creation, increased and
enhanced economic development and growth, and an improvement in the
growth abilities of our economy as a whole.</hs_Para>

think that all right hon. and hon. Members would agree that the
exponential growth in passenger demand now poses a serious challenge
for our railways. We have debated the causes of that growth at length
before and I do not propose to revisit those arguments today, but it is
a fact that passenger demand has doubled in the last 20 years and we
are now accommodating the same number of passengers as there were in
the 1920s on a network less than half the size it was then. That growth
has continued through periods of infrastructure
disruption  
<?notus-xml column=218?>and even through recession. Technology is making it easier for people to
travel and young people are now the group who are most predisposed to
travel by
rail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000139">Passenger

at<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:41:11"></hs_TimeCode> the start of
last year compared with the first quarter of 2012, and across the
network conflicts between inter-city, commuter and freight trains are
common as competing grades of traffic jostle for scarce paths. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:41:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
spelled out, some sections are already approaching the limits of their
capacity, especially on the west coast main line, where the number of
trains being run has doubled during the past 15 years, leading Network
Rail to warn that the line will effectively be full by
2024<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:41:29"></hs_TimeCode>. All this
has happened despite the west coast route modernisation project, which
cost £9 billion and caused enormous disruption over a period of
12 years without delivering the long-term capacity benefits that we as
a country
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000140">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:41:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:41:59"></hs_TimeCode>
have full sympathy with right hon. and hon. Members and local
authorities who represent communities served by the west coast main
line, and they have made it clear that they have no wish to relive the
experience. Unfortunately, the heavy demands on the line mean that
expensive periods of disruption continue. In 2014, there are three
planned closures of the line in the Watford area alone, which means
that the southern end of the line will be closed for most of August as
track and signalling is replaced. Such closures require sizeable
compensation payments to train operators—Network Rail puts the
cost for such works on the west coast main line at 18% of its overall
budget—and cause delays and inconvenience to businesses and
individual passengers, the costs of which are much more difficult to
quantify.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000141"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:42:34"></hs_TimeCode>Consequently,
before I talk about the economic case for HS2, we should consider the
economic impacts of inaction. Commuter trains could be cut as train
paths are reassigned to more profitable long-distance trains—a
process familiar to transport planners and passengers in the west
midlands. In the most extreme cases, some smaller stations in
Staffordshire were closed while the west coast main line was being
modernised, and they have not reopened. Thousands of passengers are
already being left standing on their morning commute, not only on
routes into London but on the approaches to Birmingham, Manchester,
Leeds and Sheffield. In addition, growing congestion on the lines hits
resilience and reliability, undermining rail’s traditional
advantage over other modes of
travel<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:43:34"></hs_TimeCode>. A
consequence of the growing number of services provided is that journey
times have not improved on most of the main lines, and in many cases
have got worse in the past 20 years. Even after the intercity express
programme trains are introduced on the east coast main line, a number
of important long-distance journeys will still take the same time as

believe passionately in a successful Britain and in a country that can
compete and thrive in the global economy. To achieve that, we need
infrastructure that is fit for the 21st century and beyond. Nowhere is
that truer than in the context of transport, which is a key enabler of
economic growth. Good transport equals good economic conditions. An
important way to support British business, to power up the recovery and
to put people back in work is to invest in and modernise our transport
networks. Growth and prosperity are created by businesses and people
having ideas, taking risks, innovating, working hard and creating jobs.
A balanced and successful economy requires modern and efficient
infrastructure. The Government’s role is to help create the
conditions for success by fostering the security, skills and
infrastructure that support our economy. By delivering additional
capacity and enhanced connectivity, transport infrastructure allows
businesses to grow and work together and to access a wide range of
customers, suppliers and skilled labour. Business investment is
encouraged by the quality of transport links, influencing the decisions
of international companies on where to locate and, in turn, increasing
investment in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011455000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011455000170">Transport<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T10:55:22"></hs_TimeCode>
infrastructure has particular economic significance for UK cities. In

Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham and Sheffield, together

seamlessly to the existing rail network, serving destinations not
directly on the high-speed line, releasing capacity on the existing
main north-south lines to enable additional commuter, regional or
freight services to use the line and freeing up more space on existing
trains. It will provide a step change in the capacity of the rail
network to accommodate the growing demand for long-distance travel. Our
transport system is already under strain, as we have heard today, and
will only get worse as demand continues to grow. Alongside the

taskforce, ably led by Lord Deighton, has a relentless focus on
maximising the economic growth potential of HS2. Lord Deighton was also
at Old Oak Common today to see the potential in that part of London.
HS2 will be the biggest infrastructure project in Europe and will have
a significant direct impact on local jobs, particularly in engineering
and construction. Independent research predicts that HS2 is capable of
directly generating up to 22,000 jobs in the next five years, rising to
a maximum of 50,000 jobs by the late 2020s. In addition, HS2 will
support over 100,000 jobs. Phase 1 will create 40,000 jobs in the
midlands and London and phase 2 will create at least 60,000 jobs in the
midlands and the north. We recognise that the benefits will not just
fall into our lap, and the role of the growth taskforce is to identify

conclusion, HS2, coupled with the record investments we are making in
existing transport, is the right solution to the transport challenges
that we face. It is about a step change in capacity and connectivity
for passengers. It is about unlocking the potential of our major cities

the great opportunities before the new state of South Sudan. We heard
of the problems in bringing together a cross-tribal, cross-community
Government able to function efficiently in order to alleviate hunger
and educate the country’s children. We heard of the need to
adopt a genuinely pluralist constitution that provides for the
accountability of the state to its citizens and of the Government to
Parliament. We listened to the complex issues regarding the future of
Abyei state and the need to resolve the continuing border problems with
Khartoum.</hs_Para>

of the country, strongly promotes. We experienced for ourselves the
problems of a country that has only 60 km of paved roads and, in many
respects, a very weak—in many states,
non-existent—infrastructure. We saw the intense difficulty that
that causes to farmers in getting their goods to market and in
distributing seeds and other agricultural products from the capital out

their businesses and their lives on land that had been returned to them

that she had been denied: the right to an education. It is tragic that
the avoidable humanitarian situation is putting at risk all of that

internal Sudan People’s Liberation Movement party structures in
November. That step was described by his internal critics as
unconstitutional. There was a walk-out by the opposition at the
national liberation council on 15 December, and fighting began later
that day between factions of the presidential guard in Juba, spreading
to other parts of the armed forces in the following days. That violence

it the view of the Minister and the Government that those two functions

I have said, before the current crisis, South Sudan was already one of

were below the poverty line. Alongside our emergency humanitarian

disrupted—I cannot put it any other way—because so many
of our staff have had to leave, as have our implementing partners. Our

humanitarian situation. In the UN Security Council the UK was quick to
agree to an emergency troop uplift of 5,500 to the UN mission in South

six different women, with seven more children by unnamed women, and who

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:38:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

parents are more likely to have physical and mental health problems in
childhood and to fall into crime or substance abuse in later life. The

stable relationships themselves, thereby continuing the

from about 415,000 in 1970 to about 240,000 in 2010, a near 100-year
low. The number of single-parent households has risen from 8% of the

Since<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:41:11"></hs_TimeCode> the late
1970s, there has been a steady increase in the rise of cohabitation,
with nearly half of all children today born outside marriage, but
cohabitation is a relatively unstable substitute for marriage. Figures
from the Centre for Social Justice show that fewer than one in 10
married couples separate by their child’s fifth birthday,
compared with one in three cohabiting

Children need a father and a mother to nurture them... Children need
parents who love them and love each other just as much. That love must
be a permanent and not a temporary commitment… The best
environment for raising children is marriage because the spouses have
committed themselves to each other, and thus their children, for life.
No other kind of relationship provides this environment of stability

speak from the perspective that supporting stronger relationships is a
public health issue. The importance of relationships in preventing
disease and in prolonging life, health and well-being is becoming
increasingly recognised, not only for partners in a relationship, but
for their children, their wider family and the community at
large<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011467000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0001.htm#14011467000032">The
scale of the problem of relationship breakdown is such that we cannot
put it into the “too difficult” category. Government have
to act and treat it as a public health issue. The public health
outcomes framework should make explicit mention of family and
relationship factors. In particular, we need to be concerned about 
<?notus-xml column=237?>the impact of family breakdown on those in the more deprived
households<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T14:49:00"></hs_TimeCode>.

to a recent YouGov survey for the Prince’s Trust of 2,161 young
people aged 16 to 25, 21% of the children in poor homes said that no
one had ever told them, “I love you.” Those results show
that young people from deprived homes where there are not necessarily
functioning and strong relationship standards are significantly more
likely to face symptoms of mental illness, including suicidal thoughts,
feelings of self-loathing and panic attacks. Young people who grow up
in poverty are also twice as likely to believe that no one cares about
them—22% expressed such a view compared with a figure of 10% for
the wider youth population. The tragedy is that many young people are
growing up today in households where they have no role models for
strong relationships.</hs_Para>

and extent of the problem we are up against have all the hallmarks of a
public health emergency. The Office for National Statistics recently
found that people’s personal relationships, mental health and
overall sense of well-being are all intimately bound up with each
other. But the stakes are even higher than that: in many cases it is
about life and death. A huge review of 148 studies, with almost one
third of a million participants, that looked at how social
relationships influence the risk of mortality showed that people with
stronger social relationships have an incredible 50% increased
likelihood of survival when compared with those with poor or
insufficient social relationships.</hs_Para>

credit to Dr Samantha Callan of the Centre for

inactivity.</hs_Para>

potential public health issues are isolation and loneliness. The
absence of loving relationships of any sort is bad for health and is
linked with increased risk of cardio-vascular disease, diabetes,
stroke, obesity and death. One of my constituents has written to me to

boards take into account the issue of loneliness and focus on how they
can improve relationship support, bearing in mind the impact that

the impact of relationship difficulties suggest that improving couple
relationships has the potential to reduce alcohol misuse. Recent
studies focusing on metabolic syndrome suggest that obesity, high
cholesterol, high blood pressure and poor blood sugar metabolism, all
of which increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke, are
other mechanisms by which poor marital adjustment increases poor health
outcomes for women.</hs_Para>

the issue of obesity among children. Children who are raised by parents
who have what is called an authoritative—not an
authoritarian—parenting style apparently eat more healthily, are
more physically active and have a lower body mass index than children
raised under other parenting styles, such as authoritarian, permissive,
indulgent, uninvolved or neglectful. Reports say that marital
dissatisfaction results in more authoritarian and less authoritative
parenting. In other words, there is a vicious cycle. The quality of the
parental relationship has a significant bearing on children’s
health. The sad fact is that disadvantaged children suffer the
most.</hs_Para>

relationships has the potential to deliver significant public health
gains, how do we realise those gains? Certainly, building stronger
relationships requires encouraging couples to build on good habits and
to reduce bad ones. We should encourage and support proposals within
plans such as the “Let’s Stick Together” programme
developed by Care for the Family, which talks about avoiding negative
habits. Often the issue is skills, which can be developed. Such skills
include being responsive or even enthusiastic about what a partner is
saying, expressing feelings of warmth and affection, managing conflict,
communicating well and preserving a friendship, as well as learning how
to perceive and demonstrate commitment and deal constructively with
misunderstandings. All those skills can be learnt, and learning them is
critical when people have had no role models.</hs_Para>

return to my point about the elderly, loneliness has significant links
to a range of chronic conditions, including high blood pressure and
depression, and increases the risk of developing Alzheimer’s
disease by over 60%. On average, 10% of the population aged over 65 is
chronically lonely, which means that they feel lonely all or most of
the time. It is vital that the health implications of this issue are
recognised by those making decisions about local health priorities. The
proportion of elderly people in our population is increasing. Many of
them live alone due to relationship breakdown. Helping them to sustain
partner relationships, with the mutual support that such relationships
can provide in later life, could carry major personal and public health
benefits.</hs_Para>

goes without saying that the family is the backbone of our society. As
I am sure many hon. Members have experienced, when couple relationships
are turbulent, it shows in other aspects of the couple’s lives.
Several studies show that those who are married or in stable
relationships live longer lives and require medical assistance from the
state less frequently. Couple, family and social relationships may act
as a shock absorber in supporting people through life changes, such as
becoming a parent, retirement or family bereavement, but for many the
relationship itself may need support during, after and even before such
events. That is why it is vital that when things go wrong in
relationships, there are organisations to turn to that offer affordable
support and guidance.</hs_Para>

counselling services to couples, or those in complex relationships,
which are now more common, as relationships and family structures are
evolving all the time. Without Relate, many in relationships would not

subsidise its support, making it accessible to everyone, not just the

Derbyshire contacted me to say that Derby city council had told it that
it would reduce funding further. It looks as though Derbyshire county
council will follow suit. In fact, it is expected that in 
<?notus-xml column=243?>time there will be no funding whatever from the two councils. The
squeeze on funding has resulted in a 30% reduction in Relate staff

to funding structures mean that many central initiatives could be

substantial cuts in funding that will mean a reduction in the provision

Without regular grants from Derby city council and Derbyshire county
council, funding for Relate services in the area increasingly comes
from spot purchasing, which means that the charity experiences peaks in
demand without the core funding to ensure that staffing levels are
sufficient to meet that demand. The other issue with spot funding is
that it generates an increase in administration costs for Relate. That
has already had a knock-on effect on its provision of additional
services. It is considering no longer accepting further requests.
Children and young people in other groups will be all the poorer if
they are unable to access the excellent services of our local
Relate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011472000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011472000006">Relate
Derby and Southern Derbyshire is well known for its work with people
with Asperger’s syndrome and their families. Relate offers live
chat, e-mail and webcam counselling, which can be more suitable for
different client groups, such as those with Asperger’s. That
counselling might well disappear if no money can be found, even though
the demand is even greater this year. Last year, Relate helped more
than 250 families in the area in which there were people with
Asperger’s. It is clear that the withdrawal of funding by Derby
city council and the county council, and the change to funding
structures for services, will have a profound and negative effect on
the number of referrals that Relate can deal with and the ongoing
support it can offer to
stakeholders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011472000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011472000007">Jeopardising
the provision of subsidised counselling has an impact not only on the
relationships of the couples and families who need it, but on the
police force, the health service, social services, the school system,
the courts and the economy as a whole. As has been said, a report by
the Relationships Foundation estimated that the total cost to the
economy of relationship breakdown was some £46 billion. That is
perhaps not surprising when one considers that those who have
experienced the breakdown of a relationship often have poorer
employment outcomes and poorer physical and mental health.</hs_Para>

consequences of conflict in the home are even more keenly felt by
children; those who experience such situations typically have poorer
outcomes in the classroom. Domestic violence is a substantial issue for
a number of Relate’s clients. In fact, 23% of all those referred
by the two councils are victims of domestic violence, but only 4% of
those had reported the abuse and violence to any other agency. Relate
is doing an incredibly valuable service that other agencies seem unable
to do. It goes without saying that it is in the Government’s
interest to ensure that affordable counselling is accessible.</hs_Para>

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> The Government are making one effort. They
have said that they will bring in a transferable allowance for married
couples. It is a matter of regret and has already been noted that the
Labour party spokesman is here alone. Fair enough—he will speak
in a moment; but it is a matter of regret that the Labour party has
continually laughed at the proposal from the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. The Labour viewpoint is “This is rubbish and will not
make any difference.” The fact is that if one
member—usually the mother—of a married couple who are
doing their best to bring up children decides to stay at home, they are
uniquely disadvantaged by the tax and benefits system.</hs_Para>

are six key arguments that drive a coach and horses through the
arguments against the transferable allowance. First, the UK is out of
line with international convention in not recognising marriage in its
tax system. We are virtually alone of all big countries. One-earner
married couples—those who would benefit from a transferable
allowance—are thereby at a serious disadvantage relative to
comparable families. The second is the distributional argument:
introducing a transferable allowance for married couples will
disproportionately benefit those in the lower half of the income
distribution. In that way, it is quite unlike the coalition policy of
increasing the personal income tax threshold to
£10,000.</hs_Para>

third argument is about the married couples allowance, which was
dismissed by some as something of an anomaly, but which played a key
role in sustaining one-earner families. The fourth argument is that a
transferable allowance would help to make work more rewarding for many
of the poorest in society. The fifth is that transferable allowances
should be introduced as soon as possible to compensate for the attack
on one-earner families resulting from the introduction of a
higher-income child benefit charge. The sixth and final argument is the
stay-at-home spouse argument; most one-earner families do not have the
option of becoming two-earner couple families.</hs_Para>

A child whose parents split up is twice as likely to live in poverty as
one whose parents stayed together, and has a 75% greater likelihood of
underachievement at school. The Youth Justice Board says that 70% of
children and young people in custody have an absent father. How much
more evidence do we need that the issue is important, and a legitimate
area of public policy? That is why those of us who care about it are

first programme I want to mention is called As 2 Become 3,

has been rolled out in the north-east. I think the Minister has had an
invitation from Sir Peter Vardy to go and see it, and I hope that he
may be able to take that up at some point. Parents are most likely to
split up just after a child has been born, so if parents can be given

Government seal of approval—so that public authorities such as
local authorities, hospitals and others can refer people to them with
confidence, knowing that proper provision is made and people’s
qualifications and other standards will be acceptable. That would be
hugely helpful, so that directors of public health, people running
family centres, local authorities and so on could signpost such courses
with confidence.</hs_Para>

third area I want to address, which has been mentioned by some
colleagues, is local authority and local council engagement. I believe
that if we value something, we measure it, and we also measure what we
value. It is therefore really important that local authorities know
what is going on in terms of relationship health in their areas. If
local authorities saw the extent of family breakdown in their area,
they would be more determined to do something about it. They have the
opportunity to do so through their child poverty strategies, which need
to address family breakdown. If they saw that an area was worse than
another similar area, they would ask why that was and what that other
area was doing better. They would perhaps want providers of some of the
courses that I mentioned to come in and do something about
it.</hs_Para>

my area, I set up the Bedfordshire Family Trust. We run couple
strengthening courses. We get people coming to them and know that the
courses work and that people appreciate them. That is the sort of thing
that local authorities should be able to refer people to in order to
save their budgets on housing, care placements and so on, because, as
we know, local authorities have to watch the pennies at the moment.
That is the third area where I would like to see action.</hs_Para>

not something that people would have thought was directly linked to the

quality of couple relationships also has a remarkable impact on
survival rates after bypass surgery, with married people being 2.5
times more likely to be alive 15 years after coronary artery bypass
grafting (CABG) than those who are not married, and those in
high-satisfaction marriages being 3.2 times more likely to be alive 15
years after CABG compared with those reporting low marital
satisfaction”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14011472000053" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011472000053">That

that fourth point, the cost to the health service of people with
long-term conditions is huge. When couples are together and can support
each other in older age, we save a huge amount of money for the health
service. That is another reason why we have to take public health

was particularly keen on some of the practical suggestions made by the
hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous), who is the
chair of the all-party group for strengthening couple relationships, as
he said. Looking at the group’s minutes, I was struck by some of
the issues identified, especially by Dr Lester Coleman of the
OnePlusOne charity. He emphasised that those who are more engaged at
work enjoy a better quality of relationship. That may be because they
are more personally fulfilled and more secure in their personal
identity, and therefore are better able to give and share. That would
seem to be an argument for making it easier for those who wish to work
to do so, and is perhaps also an argument for supporting child care,
which is a very important part of the Labour party’s policy,
especially at a time when the cost of child care is rising so
dramatically.</hs_Para>

parents, as opposed to non-parents, also experience better-quality
relationships, and although I would be the first to accept that many
contented couples do not have children, that finding suggests to me
that we may need to do all we can to support those who wish to be
parents. That might include measures such as those that the Government
have embarked on to improve adoption.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:47:25"></hs_TimeCode> might mean
working harder to broaden the range of people who can adopt and foster.

also understand that Dr Coleman says that where there is greater
work-family conflict, that can have quite a negative impact on the
quality of relationships. Of course, that brings to mind all the
arguments about making work flexible, so that it fits in with families,

throughout this debate, though, is that all the evidence has shown that
cohabiting couple households—I am referring to the statistics
relating to family disorder, the breakdown of family life and so
on—are much more akin to single-parent households than to
married couple households. No one is saying that people have to live
that lifestyle, but the facts suggest to us that there is one lifestyle
in this country that is likely to produce a happier outcome and is
better for children, and that is marriage.

for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh)—is available only to one
third of married couples. The proposals are really designed for the
situation in which one partner does not work outside the home or earns
very little. It is really a policy for stay-at-home mums, which is
perhaps slightly at odds with some of Dr Coleman’s
suggestions. Of course, it is available only for married mums, not for
widows, cohabiting mums or anyone like that. Perhaps most astonishingly
of all, it is available for the love rat who deserts his wife and
family and runs off with someone else’s wife. He can remarry and
claim the allowance. That strikes me as a slightly perverse way of
strengthening couple relationships.</hs_Para>

thing that is slightly strange about the policy is that it applies to
only 4 million of the 12.3 million married couples, and it
is not clear what impact it will have on children, given that pensioner
families make up more than one third of the beneficiaries. In fact,
only 35% of the 30% of families who gain from the policy have children,
and only 17% have children under the age of five. It is hardly a well

for Mid Derbyshire (Pauline Latham) about Relate. I agree: I think that
it is an excellent organisation that we should protect. The Relate
survey paints a slightly rosier picture. It found that 93% of people
said that, when times were hard, relationships within their family were
important. Although the media sometimes presents our society as one in
which family relationships have broken down, Relate could not find
evidence that that was the case overall. According to its survey,
families—albeit sometimes new families or reconstituted
families—remain the backbone of our support
systems.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14011472000107" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011472000107">3.47

all those who contributed this afternoon, I believe that strong and
stable families are the backbone of a strong and stable
society—the key to ensuring that children grow up in a loving
environment and develop into healthy and fulfilled adults. That is why
the Government have invested significantly in supporting families and
couple relationships, as well as the institution of
marriage—because we understand the crucial role that the family
plays in providing a foundation for a child’s development and
success in later life. I saw that for myself in my own personal and
professional life before coming to Parliament, so I need no persuading
of the merits of a strong, stable and loving family environment in
bringing about a better
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011472000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011472000072">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T15:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>
the view that I have set out is based partly on what we know
intrinsically works, and the values that help to improve and enhance
lives, we also know from research that happy relationships lead to
better physical and emotional well-being for all involved. The fact is
that the quality of the relationship between 
<?notus-xml column=253?>parents is strongly linked to positive parenting and better outcomes for
children. Family stability is key for children. Sustained parental
relationships are associated with a range of positive childhood,
adolescent and adult outcomes, including in respect of cognitive
development, education—my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State himself said that in his speech to the Institute for Public
Policy Research in 2008—better job prospects and less propensity
to commit crime, as well as in relation to health. My hon. Friend the
Member for Congleton (Fiona Bruce) raised important points about how
health outcomes could be improved with the right support for
relationships, and measures that we know help to achieve that. I will
take away her comments about the health outcomes framework and the role
of the health and wellbeing board, and I will discuss the matter with
Ministers in the Department of Health to ensure that it is properly
considered as those aspects of the health system develop
further.</hs_Para>

attachment, which is a vital part of understanding whether a
relationship is positive or not, the National Institute for Health and
Clinical Excellence will for the first time produce guidelines on what
constitutes a secure attachment, which will be an extremely useful
addition. Conflict between parents is detrimental to children’s
outcomes, hence the high priority we are giving to supporting all
couple relationships, particularly those of people who are married. As
my hon. Friend the Member for Aldershot told us, evidence shows us that
the children of married parents do better than those of cohabiting
parents, particularly on measures of social and emotional development
at the ages of three and five. We need to ensure that all under-fives
receive the best possible support, so such evidence is
important.</hs_Para>

Social Justice reports, which many hon. Members have brought with them,
have starkly illustrated the considerable emotional, social and
economic costs associated with the breakdown of families. As my hon.

£46 billion a year, which is not far off the total annual budget

life events, including the transition to parenthood, relocation or
changes in employment, can contribute to relationship stress. We must
do what we can to encourage couples to take up support at an earlier
stage—the early prevention that hon. Members have mentioned in
this debate—to ensure that they get through difficult events in
their lives. My time at the family Bar has shown me the devastating
consequences of not doing so, not only for adults but, perhaps even
more importantly, for any children involved. To bring that about, and
by virtue of the strong prime ministerial steer, the Government have
committed £30 million over the spending review period 2011-2015,
which puts funding for relationship support on a much more stable
long-term footing. That gives us greater encouragement that we can get
couples to use relationship support services.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=254?>particularly likely to face relationship stress or be at risk of
relationship breakdown. There is also a series of campaigns and culture
change messages aimed at employers, new parents and young people to
raise awareness and encourage them to seek help on relationships. There
is training for early years workers and managers, to help them to
encourage positive relationships between parents, and to engage better

organisations. Many hon. Members have praised the work done by such
organisations, which include Relate, Marriage Care, the Tavistock

or Departments. Forums are available to bring the topic together across

improving the information, advice and support available to separated
parents outside the court system to help them focus on their
children’s needs and to agree workable arrangements for
post-separation parenting. As my hon. Friend the Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) rightly said, the Children and
Families Bill, which is currently in the other place, includes
provision to highlight the importance of a 
<?notus-xml column=255?>child having a relationship with both parents following family
breakdown, provided that to do so is safe and in the child’s
best interests. The welfare of the individual child must be the
court’s paramount consideration, but, subject to that, the
parental involvement clause requires courts to presume that the
child’s welfare is furthered by the involvement of each parent
who can be safely involved. By making clear the basis on which the
court makes those decisions, that provision is intended to encourage
parents to reach agreement themselves about their child’s care
without recourse to the court.</hs_Para>

lower Thames area. As we all know, new Thames crossings do not come

is excessively short-termist. We need good infrastructure if we are to
make the most of economic growth opportunities. I feel that we have
insufficient crossings to the east of Tower bridge. I would like to see

in the present options before us—to be honest, they are just
lines on a map. They are sticking plaster, informed more by cost than
by what is in the best interests of developing a sustainable road
infrastructure that will actually meet the needs of our growing
economy. We all have great ambitions for the Thames Gateway as a
powerhouse of economic regeneration, but they will not be realised
unless we have adequate road infrastructure in place. That means
developing a new lower Thames crossing much further east so that we
open up the whole of south Essex and north Kent to new
opportunities.</hs_Para>

the Minister will be aware that the two options still under

objections are not based on nimbyism. My reasons for opposing them
relate entirely to the resilience of the road network, by which I mean
both the local and the strategic road network. On the local network,
Thurrock is a major logistics hub with substantial port infrastructure,
so a functioning road infrastructure is crucial to our continued
economic success. I advise the Minister that the problems caused by
traffic congestion are without doubt the biggest issue in my postbag. I
hear from not just residents, but businesses, and they tell me that it
is costing them jobs and
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011477000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011477000011">I

Doyle-Price:</Member></B> I will resume my critique of
option A. As I was saying, it is the Highways
Agency’s preferred option, due to the current challenges of
managing traffic flow into the tunnels. However, as things stand,
Thurrock routinely experiences gridlock whenever there is an incident
at the Dartford crossing, and that would only get worse if option A was
chosen. To give an example, over the Christmas period, the bridge was
closed on three occasions due to high winds. Those in my constituency
who live inside the M25, including 
<?notus-xml column=259?>myself, are totally cut off when such incidents take place. The traffic
conditions are utterly miserable. On 23 December, it took me 105
minutes to travel two miles between Lakeside shopping centre and my
house. Dartford crossing may be part of our strategic road
infrastructure, but when things go wrong, it has a great impact on the
local road network in Thurrock. To add insult to injury for the local
users who crossed via the tunnels, the tolls continued to be levied
during the disruption, after many commitments that at times of serious
congestion they would be
lifted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011477000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011477000019">The
Minister will also recall the security incident that took place last
September, when both the bridge and the tunnels at the Dartford
crossing were closed. The disruption that that caused illustrated
clearly how dependent the road network is on that one crossing, which
makes the argument strongly that any new crossing should be not at that
location but at a new one. In my view, the interests of the strategic
road network would be best served if we considered creating a new outer
ring road to complement the M25. That brings me to what is wrong with
option C, which would link up on the north side with the M25 and the
A13, which is already severely
congested.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011477000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011477000020">Another
issue with option A that the Minister should reflect on arises from
representations made to me by Vopak, which has a fuel terminal sited
just east of the Dartford crossing. Vopak has advises me that if option
A were to be built, it might require the closure of Vopak’s West
Thurrock terminal. That would have serious implications for the
resilience of the fuel supply to London and the south-east. That is the
final nail in the coffin of option A—I
hope.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011477000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011477000021"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>I
am aware that option C has generated considerable support from the
local enterprise partnership, not least because it is also supported by
Essex and Kent county councils. To be fair to Kent, it has developed
its own vision of how the road network should look on the south side,
but, unfortunately, that type of thinking has not really been done on
the north side. As I have said, the result is that there would be
greater burdens on the M25 and the Al3, so, for me option C is not the
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011477000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011477000022"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>I

our road transport infrastructure, but
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>it appears that
they have been ruled out on the basis of cost. Dare I say to the
Minister that that is a false economy? Sooner or later, we will have to
build a new outer ring road, particularly if we are to realise the
economic potential of the Thames Gateway. It is also worth bearing in
mind the additional connectivity of the eastern region that such a road
would create. It would add to the connectivity of Stansted airport,
which would help us to deal with our aviation capacity challenges. In
particular, option D—a crossing at Canvey—would allow
connectivity with the Al30, which is a very under-utilised

growth in south Essex, does she

the most of Southend airport, which is now a growing hub and making
great strides in providing additional airport capacity? Now, if someone
wants to get to Southend, they have to come all the way to the M25 and
then go out along the A13. A new outer ring road might start to address

illustrates again the importance of looking at transport issues not
just in terms of rail, or roads, or airports, but in terms of the whole
picture. Let me remind those people just down the river at city hall
who talk about a Thames estuary airport that we already have one at
Southend. It is very popular with my constituents because going there
is almost as nice an experience as going to London City

it. If you are flying short-haul, I recommend that you use Southend. My

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011477000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/halltext/140114h0002.htm#14011477000026"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:22:40"></hs_TimeCode>I
am really disappointed about this entire debate. I congratulate Kent
county council on the work that it has done. It has taken the 2009
study and used it as a prompt to develop its vision of what it needs
for its road network, so it is very disappointing that that type of
thinking has not taken place on the north side of the river. Essex
county council and Thurrock borough council should hang their heads in
shame, because we are now on the back foot as we respond to these
proposals. In 2009, the highways engineers of those two authorities
should have sat down and come up with a sensible solution. Actually,
there is evidence that Southend council is starting to do
that—as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:23:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

communities can be very badly let down by poor leadership of their
local authorities.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-14T16:22:02"></hs_TimeCode> are now

after Tilbury docks, which again shows the weakness of Essex and
Thurrock councils in responding to the road traffic infrastructure
challenges facing them, to which they should respond more strongly if
we are to maximise our economic competitiveness.

D and E involved locations further east than the other options. Quite
aside from the costs and the environmental issues associated with them,
they were found by the 2009 study to take relatively little
traffic—about 5% or less—away from the existing

course, we all know that 50 years ago a tunnel was opened between
Dartford and Grays. Today the Dartford-Thurrock crossing comprises two
tunnels and one bridge, which carry about 140,000 vehicles daily across
the Thames and provide a vital link in the M25 orbital route around
London. It is worth reminding ourselves that the Dartford-Thurrock
crossing, or the A282, is the only river crossing east of London and
the only road link between Kent and Essex. It also in the Thames
Gateway, which is the area identified for major redevelopment and
growth. Therefore, whether people are making long journeys from the
channel to the rest of the UK or travelling across the area east of
London, and whether they are travelling for business or leisure
purposes, the crossing provides a critical

course the whole point of the Government’s consultation and the
work that we are continuing to do is to ensure that we make the right
decision based on environmental, traffic, cost and of course air
quality grounds. Air quality is a major issue now, as the vehicles we
are using on our road networks are failing to deliver the clean exhaust
emissions that had been promised in earlier testing. It is
disappointing how the vehicles operate in practice compared with the

succession of Governments, both at national and local level,
commissioned studies on congestion and possible new river crossings. A
study for the Department for Transport in 2009 identified short and
medium-term measures to improve traffic flows. It concluded that a new
crossing was needed in the long term, and shortlisted a number of
potential locations: option A at the existing Dartford-Thurrock
crossing; option B connecting with the A2, which we have since
discarded; option C connecting the M2 with the A13 and the M25 between
junctions 29 and 30; and the option C variant that would additionally
widen the A229 between the M2 and the M20. The Government have been

the Dartford crossing. There was no plan to address the congestion and
pollution in the area or to do anything to help small businesses based
in Thurrock and Dartford. There is still much to be done, and the

Manufacturing accounts for more than half of all our exports, and it
provides skilled and well paid jobs and employment opportunities for
people of all educational attainment levels throughout our country, and
particularly in the less affluent regions. The recent Foresight report,
“The Future of Manufacturing”, pointed out that it is

manufacturing output rose by 0.6% in the three months to November, and
industrial production rose by 0.3%. Two weeks ago, an executive survey
by the Engineering Employers Federation and Aldermore told us that 2014
looks set to be better for the UK and for manufacturing than each of
the past two years. Projected manufacturing expansion of 2.7% will put
us top of the European Union growth league. The Deloitte chief
financial officer survey, published on 6 January, reported that
business optimism was at a three-and-a-half-year high. It is true that
macro uncertainty and capital constraints, two of the biggest blocks to

three very specific questions. The first was on supply chains. They are
absolutely essential to creating strong, sustainable and balanced
growth, but they have weakened or hollowed out in recent years. Our
broad objectives there are, first of all, to work with industry to map
current supplier capabilities and quantify the opportunity to source
more UK content. In each sector—aerospace, automotive
manufacturing, marine industry, nuclear and the like—where that
mapping finds gaps in supply chain capabilities, the sector will
encourage domestic suppliers to expand to fill them, with the support
of the manufacturing advisory service.</hs_Para>

working to strengthen existing supply chains by encouraging some of the
prime producers to adopt a more collaborative and long-term approach to
their suppliers. That is part of the answer to the point raised by the
hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman). For example, the
Rolls-Royce apprentice academy will enable the company to train
additional apprentices to work not just for Rolls-Royce, but for other
companies in the Rolls-Royce supply chain, as well as other
manufacturing firms in the east midlands. We are helping domestic
suppliers to build the strength and capabilities that they need to
access new opportunities. We underpin that through the advanced
manufacturing supply chain initiative, which helps with funding for
capital investment for skills and innovation.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Inverclyde quite rightly drew attention to the
continuing need for innovation. He was right that it was innovation
that drove the first and subsequent industrial revolutions in this
country, and when it comes to innovation, the Government have a
legitimate and necessary role in ensuring that our future is
prosperous. Despite financial pressures, my Department has sought to
protect vital investment in future innovation. We have launched seven

recovering hand over foot, and we have seen significant recovery,
particularly in sectors such as aerospace, automotives and
pharmaceuticals. The Government’s active encouragement is needed

Prosecution Service (CPS) to carry forward the underspends against its
vote reported in its annual accounts. However, under budget exchange,
the CPS may reduce its vote by taking a supplementary estimate in
advance of the financial year end. Where a Department uses budget
exchange, it receives a corresponding budgetary increase in the
following
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140114100000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/text/140114w0001.htm#140114100000147">In
2011-12, the CPS surrendered £2 million under budget exchange,
in return for an increase in budget in 2012-13 of £2 million. In
2012-13, the CPS surrendered £14 million in return for an
increase in budget of £12 million. The CPS follows
Treasury guidance in maintaining budget carry forwards within prudent
limits, and recognises that Departments are under no obligation to
surrender their entire forecast
underspend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140114100000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/text/140114w0001.htm#140114100000148">The

subject to regulatory approval at EU level. We are arguing for the
European Union authorisation regime to operate more effectively,

assessment, so that our farmers can choose whether or not to grow them.

the farm sector by ensuring that pragmatic segregation measures are in

Green:</Member></B> Police and crime commissioners have been notified
of indicative budgets for the commissioning of support services for
victims' of crime including Restorative Justice services, totalling
£30,250,000 for 2014-15 and £60,800,000 for 2015-16.
These figures represent more money than ever before being spent on
support for victims of crime in England and Wales. The allocations for
each Police and Crime Commissioner (PCC) area are shown in the
following
table.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140114105000758" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/text/140114w0002.htm#140114105000758">While
it is possible to calculate funding per police recorded crime in each
area, it is not appropriate to calculate a ‘spend/funding per
victim’ figure for each area as we do not know from these data
the true number of victims at area level or their distribution between
areas.</hs_Para>

recorded crime data can be influenced by area-level variations in both
police recording practices and in reporting behaviour of
victims.</hs_Para>

crimes and different victims will likely require varying levels of
support. It is crucial that services respond to individual need.
Additionally, crimes recorded by the police are recorded against the
location where the incident took place. This is not necessarily where
the victim lives and where they will likely seek the support of
victims’ services. One of the reasons we are moving to a local
commissioning model is to allow police and crime commissioners to
provide a service which is tailored to their local community’s
needs.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="7"><table tabstyle="headft"><tgroup cols="3"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="34*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="33*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="33*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="3" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>Total

Programme is £339 million. This includes the costs of
development of the required modifications, trials activity necessary to
certify the aircraft; the provision of initial support and conversion
training for aircrew and maintainers, as well as the cost of modifying
each aircraft. Some of the modification work is being undertaken in
Romania (Brasov) and it is estimated that this work accounts for less
than 10% of the project value.</hs_Para>

dissolved between January 2003 and December 2013. In the majority of
cases, the corporation was dissolved as part of the legal process of
merger with another further education corporation(s). The exception is
St Mary's Roman Catholic College in Middlesbrough. In this instance,
the corporation was dissolved and the provision made by the sixth form
college was taken on by a neighbouring secondary school, Trinity
College. 
<?notus-xml column=501?>The reason for dissolution is rarely a single issue but is often a
combination of factors such as: inadequate Ofsted assessment; falling
student numbers; financial viability, and strategies of the local

Maude</Member></B><I> [holding answer 13 January 2014]:</I> At
30 September 2013, the year to date cost for HR across
Government Departments was £623 per employee. The year to date
cost comprises the first two quarters of 2013-14 and the final two of
2012-13, divided by the headcount as at 30 September
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140114108000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/text/140114w0002.htm#140114108000214">The
total cost of HR was £259 million against the original 2009
baseline of £524 million, a total saving of £265 million.
The cost of HR for central Government has thus fallen by 51% since
before the last general election. The comparison is like for like and
uses Cabinet Office common areas of spend definitions to specify HR
staff and non-staff
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140114108000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140114/text/140114w0002.htm#140114108000215">To
achieve this overall cost reduction Departments were given a
‘graduated ambition’ setting different expectations based
on their size, type and complexity. These ranged from £590 per
employee for the largest Departments to £1,280 for the
smallest.</hs_Para>

The criteria applied in connection with environmental factors will
depend on the circumstances and specific procurement requirements. The

environmental laws and

The Department is making it easier for all types of organisations to
bid for work including social enterprises through early market
engagement, the use of Lean Standard Operating procedures and
increasingly the use of the Open procedure. For work with a value under

terminates because someone does not have limited capability for work
following a work capability assessment, it will be reinstated only
after there has been either (i) a successful application for mandatory

from the date of the termination decision; for the latter, once the

can be reinstated in which case it would be backdated to the date of
