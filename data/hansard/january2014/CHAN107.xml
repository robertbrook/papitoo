many reasons, but one of the reasons that have been brought to my
attention is the amount that has been spent on bringing homes up to a
decent standard. The last Government spent a lot of money on that, and
the present Government have spent £2.1 billion on it.
Paradoxically, the fact that homes are so well insulated can contribute
to a dampness problem. Obviously some households also have income
problems, but the Government are doing their best to reduce the cost of

<?notus-xml column=3?>living per household by lowering council tax and energy bills, and by

spends more than half its income on rent. The truth is that the
Government are presiding over the lowest level of house building since
the 1920s and they have cut the affordable homes budget by 60%.

who delivered the lowest number of houses built in their last term of
office. Despite presiding over a period of boom, they still never
achieved the ambitious figures that they are talking about now. At the
peak, only 176,000 houses were delivered. It is this Government who are
using both public and private money to deliver a very ambitious project
of affordable housing. Of the 170,000 houses that are planned, 99,000
have already been delivered. We are more than halfway through. With the
money that we have given to the Mayor, another 32,000 houses will be
delivered. It is this Government who are committed to building
houses.</hs_Para>

to clarify the issue. It is one of the conversations that we had on 6
January and which will be continuing, I hope, next week. I do not
entirely agree with his interpretation of Dr Williams’s report,
which makes it clear that, with proper fitness work going on—one
of the things that we expect the service to do as part of the
principles that we are consulting on—firefighters can retain
fitness until 60. That is very achievable, and we want to make sure
that the protections are in place. Beyond the Scottish agreement, we
have suggested an independent review to ensure that the service is
putting these protections in
place.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1401205000020" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0001.htm#1401205000020">Waste

So far, 37 authorities have indicated that
they plan to make a claim through the Bellwin fund. As I said earlier,
all the local authorities that have been affected are coming in to talk
to us about the recovery process. I am sure that they will want to
raise the issue of funding. The Bellwin fund is well tested, it works
and local authorities know how it works. We will obviously work with
any authority that needs specific
help.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1401205000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0001.htm#1401205000165"><Number>T6</Number>.

Government continue to believe that the best way to address the
suffering of the Syrian people should be to provide humanitarian
assistance to displaced people, in partnership with neighbouring
countries and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Before

Syrian relief effort, of which more than £480 million
had been allocated to partners in Syria and the region. That has helped
more than 1 million people. Almost 320,000 people are being provided
with food assistance each month in Syria and neighbouring countries,
and more than 244,000 people in Syria have been offered medical help.
The Government continually press for better access and protection for
humanitarian convoys inside Syria so that aid can get to the millions
in need inside the country. That represents the UK’s largest
ever response to a humanitarian

proactive programme of resettlement of refugees who are currently

options very carefully and respect the views of those countries who
favour a resettlement programme, but we think that our priority should
continue to be to provide humanitarian assistance to displaced people
in the region, in partnership with neighbouring countries, the UNHCR

displaced want to return home as soon as it is safe to do so, and

Syria’s neighbours. Britain has led the way, through Government
aid and the generosity of the British people, in providing outside
help, but we have also been asked by the UN to join its programme for
the most vulnerable refugees. I spoke to the UN this morning. The
programme is for those whom the UN believes will find it hardest to
survive in the camps in the region, such as abandoned children who have
no other protection or support; torture victims, who may be suffering
immense physical and mental distress; those who need urgent medical
help; mothers of young children who have lost their husbands and
relatives and are vulnerable; and those who have been abused in the
camps. They are not asylum seekers. They cannot travel here or
elsewhere to apply for asylum. They are already UN-certified
refugees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401205000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0001.htm#1401205000202">Other
countries—France, Spain, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Belgium,
the Netherlands, Ireland, Norway, Sweden Finland, even Luxemburg and
Moldova, and Australia, Canada and the USA—have agreed to help.
Those countries have offered places, taking the UN well on its way
towards its target. Britain is being asked to provide only limited help
as part of the wider programme, but the Government have refused. The
Minister described such help as “token”, but it is not
token for a child who is given a home. He dismissed the UN programme in
favour of regional support, but it is not an either/or question. As
every other major western country understands, some vulnerable refugees
need a different kind of help. This is not about border control or
immigration policy, but about our long tradition of sanctuary. How can
we ask Jordan, Turkey and Lebanon to keep their borders open or to keep
helping millions of people if Britain will not do its bit for a few
hundred of the most vulnerable, or if we will not even take in those
with British relatives who are desperate to help? Charities like Oxfam
and Save the Children are urging us to join this programme. It would be
shameful for Britain to refuse.</hs_Para>

State’s response, I do not think that she could have listened to
a word that I said. On the scale of help and support the United Kingdom
is giving to the region, our level of aid support dwarfs that of most
other European countries. Some countries are willing to take very small
numbers—sometimes just two figures, by which I mean 10 or
20—and they are not providing financial support. We are the
second largest donor: we are helping not hundreds but hundreds of
thousands of people in the region by providing water, food and medical
supplies. That has to be the right way. Indeed, my right hon. Friend
the Secretary of State for International Development has been one of
the leading players working with UNICEF on a programme to help about
15,000 vulnerable children in Syria and the neighbouring countries.

numbers of people compared with the millions of people in need and the
hundreds of thousands of people we are helping in the region.</hs_Para>

no reason to continue. The population of Lebanon, which I recently

the money in the camps, but could we have a differentiated response for

addition, the Bill provides protections from infringement for

such as carpentry in a school, is a sensible measure. So too is the
provision of a defence for third parties when, in good faith and
without copying, they have made preparations to use a design before a
similar design is registered. This and other measures in the first half

on IP in disputes. The existing opinions service provides a low cost
means of resolving such disputes, in many cases without a need to seek
redress in the courts. Almost 70% of respondents to an IPO review who
had used the service considered that it should be extended to
other areas of IP. Over 65% wished to see it extended to
registered designs and 40% wished to see it extended to the UK

world an image of the UK’s soft power that is envied by other
countries, and given how that can bring further investment and
prosperity to our country, I do not understand why the Government have
not got a creative industries industrial sector document. Perhaps the
Minister will respond to that point when he sums up the debate. Perhaps
it is because Whitehall is often silo-driven and IP is often in a
conflict between the Departments for Business, Innovation and Skills
and for Culture, Media and Sport. No one from the DCMS ministerial team

at last to manufacturing. High-value manufacturing is dependent on
innovative design to produce comparative advantage. Indeed, high-value
manufacturing in the 21st century requires a blend of design,

emphasise in the modern age open, innovative models and the sharing of
ideas. That makes IP more, not less, important.</hs_Para>

means that there is an ever-growing importance to securing returns from
those assets. That in turn means that companies need to pay more

property regime is needed. IP should not be seen as regulation or
bureaucracy, with all the negative connotation that that entails. IP is
not regulation but a legal right, and it would be wrong to suggest
that, in an era of globalisation and digitisation, IP is irrelevant or
an anachronism that needs somehow to be swept away. Businesses will not
invest if their innovation or creativity is not protected. If somebody
has created or invested in something, they should have the right in law
to derive benefit from that creation or investment. That right should

many respects, the Government are continuing the approach they used
last year with the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, several

consultation asked whether the Registered Designs Act 1949 should be
amended by providing greater consistency between joint ownership
provisions for both registered and unregistered designs. All or most
respondents to the consultation agreed with the move to greater clarity
and consistency in principle, but for whatever reason the Government
have decided not to change the law in that
regard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000033">Clause
13, to which I will return, has been mentioned a number of times. It
provides a significantly different approach to registered and
unregistered design rights. It is as if the Government are saying,

has been said, the most contentious part of the Bill is clause 13,
which brings into law criminal sanctions for deliberate infringement of
registered designs. I think that this will take up a significant part
of our deliberations in Committee. On the one hand, as I think I
mentioned earlier in my remarks, the Opposition strongly believe in the
principle that a person who has created, invented or designed something
should derive some protection of ownership in law, together with the
right to derive benefit from that creation, invention or design, and
that appropriate and proportionate sanctions should be put in law to
assert that legal right. If criminal sanctions exist for copyright or
trademarks, why not for design, especially when the future UK economy
will rely so heavily on innovative design? This is a strong argument,
especially when there is already similar protection in other parts of
the IP framework, such as for copyright or trademarks. However, the
introduction of criminal sanctions with the prospect of 10
years’ imprisonment is a serious matter and must be considered
closely by the House.</hs_Para>

those who accidentally or inadvertently copy a design.

I said, we will consider this matter closely in Committee, but what
causes me most concern about clause 13 is that, as several stakeholders
have stated, criminalisation, with the prospect of up to 10
years’ imprisonment, might have a “chilling
effect” on innovation. New products might not come to market or
benefit the UK economy because people are reluctant to risk a criminal
trial and 10 years’ imprisonment. I suspect that in Committee we
will deliberate at length about the nature of innovation—whether
there are great leaps forward or whether innovation is undertaken by
swinging from tree to tree in the jungle or, to switch my metaphor, by
standing on the shoulders of giants.

UK businesses clearly see merit in the UK unregistered design right,

should that right not be protected through criminal sanctions when the
Government propose that for unregistered designs? I cannot see anything
that would prevent companies from identifying unregistered designs,
registering those designs for themselves and then stating to the
original designer, “You’ve infringed our registered
design. We will bring a criminal case against you for deliberately
copying our registered design and you may go to prison for 10 years
unless you pay us a large fee or assign the rights of the design over
to us to exploit anyway.” How does that protect small and

but only 32% took a case to court. Copyright infringement costs
£775 million every year—5% of the total value of UK

£7.6 billion annually. We must not forget that intellectual 
<?notus-xml column=51?>property is not important only to the big multinationals, major record
labels or Hollywood studios; it is vital, too, for hundreds of
thousands of small, medium and even micro-businesses delivering jobs

Bill seeks to introduce some changes in the field of patents and design
law, something that we should warmly welcome. Clause 13 introduces a
new criminal offence of intentional infringement of a registered
design, bringing the law into line with copyright and trademarks.
Unfortunately, although this is a welcome move, the vast majority of
designers, many of whom are individuals or micro-businesses, rely on
unregistered rights, as several hon. Members have said. Approximately
4,000 designs are registered each year with the Intellectual Property
Office, while between 18,000 and 25,000 unregistered designs were
lodged on the ACID—anti-copying in design—data bank last
year, yet there are only 1,100 members. The vast majority of designers
rely on unregistered rights, so if we really want to make this
legislation effective, it should be amended to cover unregistered, as
well as registered, rights.</hs_Para>

packaging. Businesses and consumers need more protection against
copycat packaging of goods or services. Packaging consumer products to
mimic familiar branded products free rides off investment in brand
reputation, misleads consumers, and distorts competition. A report

on at least one
occasion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:16:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Moreover, the copy hijacks the reputation of the brand, which has often
been built up over years of consumer experience and investment in
innovation and product performance. The copy bears none of the cost of
building that reputation, while benefiting from higher sales and

That review reported in 2006, and I have to be candid and say that I
was disappointed that the then Government did not do more to implement

say the results—of the Hargreaves report, does the Minister
acknowledge that there is much more to do? Given the threadbare nature

word. I am sure that the alliance will be delighted that its researcher
has not laboured in vain to bring its concerns to public attention. The
hon. Gentleman also pointed out that the most contentious part of the
Bill was clause 13. The difficulty with it, and it will be hard to find
a way that pleases everybody, is that legitimate and genuine but
conflicting rights and interests are involved. Those depend on where
someone comes from, and people’s instinct or feelings about the
clause tend to be based on their commercial interest in the matter.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:30:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hartlepool outlined how a large organisation could
intimidate a small rights holder by saying, “Unless you pay us,
we will not allow you to use this.” Equally, a small rights
holder could be told by an organisation that it is going to use
something come what may and the only way of stopping it is by court
action, particularly if it disputes that there is a breach or
infringement in the first place. The IP Federation is the most
antagonistic to clause 13, although, as has been mentioned, others are
too. By contrast, plenty of others, including the Alliance for
Intellectual Property and the Law Society, are in favour of its
provisions. 
<?notus-xml column=56?>Clearly something will have to be put in the Bill
there. Rejecting the clause entirely is not a viable option, as it will

radical philosophical shake-up. An ever more assertive China will argue
that traditional IP structures are no more than an attempt by Europe to
impose its own form of protectionism to suit its particular

that end, the aspects of the Bill that are aimed at improving the
operation of the IP system internationally are most welcome. The
recognition of foreign copyright claims in the UK and enabling the
Intellectual Property Office to share information on unpublished
patents with other patent offices should, in principle at least, make
it easier for UK companies’ IP rights to be respected
internationally. However, clause 13 introduces a new criminal offence
of deliberate infringement of a registered design, but, as the hon.
Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright) rightly pointed out,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:42:19"></hs_TimeCode> vast
majority of the UK’s 350,000 designers rely on unregistered
design rights. There should be consideration of whether the criminal
sanctions could and should be extended to include them as
well.</hs_Para>

about 4,000 designs are registered each year with the IPO. That pales
into relative insignificance when compared with the 18,000 to 25,000
unregistered designs placed on the ACID design database last year, 
<?notus-xml column=59?>especially as the organisation has only 11,000
members. Given the vast amounts of capital invested in developing
brands and the economic benefits that creates, I agree with the hon.
Member for Hartlepool that it seems advisable to at least consider in
Committee whether criminal sanctions for the infringement of copyright
online should match the level of sanctions for the infringement of
physical goods.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:43:13"></hs_TimeCode> our lives
increasingly shift online, the discrepancy between the maximum
penalties for online copyright theft, with a maximum of two
years’ imprisonment, and physical copyright theft, with a
maximum of 10 years, seems in need of updating. The Minister made it
clear that he recognises that the situation is fast moving. The Bill
itself will no doubt be largely redundant within a few years,
so we need to be aware of those changes.</hs_Para>

my work as a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee, I am
increasingly aware that malicious cyber-activity such as the ongoing
and daily attempts to steal British-owned IP—whether that

a more parochial and local basis, in 2009, I worked with a group of
local entrepreneurs and recommended the development of a start-up
business incubator, now called the innovation warehouse, to the
economic development office of the City of London corporation. I am
pleased to say that that proposal was strongly supported financially
and generally by the corporation. It is now based on the northern edge
of the City, in Smithfield market. It opened in May 2011, and it
provides 88 desks, counts more than 50 small businesses as tenants and
provides a range of business-related mentoring and other events each

dynamic office and incubation space developed at Smithfield market not
only provides much-needed resources for small and growing businesses,
but houses a large number of high-growth potential start-ups that have
gone on to secure significant investment. I am sure that one of the
Bill’s longer-term effects is that we will see such innovation
not just in the gilded parts of the City of London, but in all the
suburbs and, indeed, in many other UK cities. The scheme has rightly
received praise from central Government and has become a destination of
choice for UK Trade &amp; Investment tours of Tech City. It is in my
view precisely the sort of initiative that needs to be encouraged if
the UK is to continue to aspire to be a world leader in IP, as

Government could do a little more to encourage the development of IP in
the UK. At a City round-table meeting on IP a year or so ago, I met a
former engineer and investment banker who now helps technology
start-ups. He had worked as a part-time chief financial officer for a
tech spin-out from one of Britain’s top research universities.
In the end, although it was backed by a quasi-governmental venture
capital fund, the technology was sold prematurely to a large French
company, as it had proved impossible to eke out the limited VC funding
to expand the fledgling enterprise. Had it not been for the complexity
of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs rules and an equity gap in
first-stage venture capital, he 
<?notus-xml column=60?>believed that the UK Treasury would by now have been
enjoying the rewards of fresh job and corporation tax

tech businesses are typically nucleated when a piece of IP is picked up
by a small team of high-calibre executives who practically apply and
market that technology. Seed funding of £50,000 to
£250,000 is typically not too difficult to come by, but
founders’ resources, or those of business angels, can be tapped
and new Government mechanisms, such as the seed enterprise investment
scheme, incentivise investment in the early stages. However, the next
part of the corporate journey—to obtain between £l
million and £5 million in more conventional first-stage venture
capital—represents the big stumbling block to
expansion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:47:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000109">The
structural shortage of such funding in the UK is exacerbated by the
fact that, before these start-ups begin generating revenue, a large
share of funds goes towards paying executives’ salaries.
Therefore, the taxman gets much of the VC money through employer and
employee national insurance and pay-as-you-earn tax. That is, of
course, particularly ironic because, in many instances, a quasi-public
source has helped to generate the VC funds in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:47:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000110">To
work through this problem, many start-ups eke out their VC money by
instead rewarding executives with sweat equity. Since many such
participants are perhaps established people in the 45-to-60 age
bracket, they tend to have an existing financial cushion that leaves
them able to work for free in the short term in return for those
shares. However, HMRC rules currently insist that such shares are
valued and treated as taxable salary. To pay the tax charge associated
with the granting of shares for which there is no liquid market and
which might turn out to be worthless in the end, executives must raid
their savings. In short, when a start-up fails, as is often the case,
executives have paid from their own resources for the privilege of
working for free. That common problem is part and parcel of the whole
intellectual property package that we are looking at

therefore taking the opportunity of this debate to say that, although
perhaps other Ministers have a part to play as well, we need to try to
find a way to ensure that such share rewards are not crystallised

generally welcome the Bill. I have managed to speak in most of the
debates on IP since becoming a Member of Parliament, and I have had the
great pleasure of introducing a couple of them, but this is the first
time in those 13 years that we have had a Bill dedicated to it. It
gives us an incredible opportunity to assess the value of IP-supported
business and industry to the economy. IP makes a fantastic
contribution—4.3% of our GDP, as the Minister

So<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:49:54"></hs_TimeCode> much more
could be done through educational initiatives. I have seen some
important work being done. I have visited schools and see
schoolchildren trade marking their work with the little copyright
symbol. They were starting to appreciate that what they produce, even
if it is just a drawing, has an intrinsic intellectual value. If we can
get across the message that intellectual property is as important as a
property right, and if we can encourage that culture, we will be making
great strides
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000120"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:53:01"></hs_TimeCode>It
has been reported in recent weeks that the creative sector has grown by
8.6% in recent years, compared with growth of only 0.7% in the general
economy. It is the UK’s fastest growing sector and is worth
around £71 billion a year. As the Culture Secretary has said, so
much of our cultural and creative endeavour rests on important
intellectual property rights, which is absolutely spot on. It is the
creative industries that are growing us out of recession. Imagine
growing our economy on the back of the creativity, talent and
imagination of the 
<?notus-xml column=62?>people of this country. What a fantastic way to grow our economy. That

every cultural discipline, whether music, film, television, publishing
or whatever. We must be doing something right. It also comes naturally
to people in these isles; we are just naturally creative. That is
reflected in the great output we have seen over hundreds of years, in
our contribution to invention, talent and creativity. We get something
right and we are able to protect it, so we have to be very careful as
we progress with intellectual property rights. We tamper with that at
our peril. We have to be careful about how we

genesis of the Bill was in November 2010, when the Prime Minister made
his great “Googlesburg” address. I remember coming home
one evening and being unable to believe what I was seeing on the
television: a UK Prime Minister talking about intellectual property. It
was the first time I had seen a UK Prime Minister take an interest in
intellectual property, which was great. I was also interested in what
he was saying, because I wondered what on earth he was going on
about. His basic premise seemed to be that we would never see a Google
emerge in the UK because of our restrictive intellectual property laws
and copyright framework. He did not say whether it would be a good
thing to have a UK Google. The clear thing he said was that we would
not be able to create a Google in the UK, and he also said something
about our IP rules being restrictive and that they needed to be
fixed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000123"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:55:53"></hs_TimeCode>I
do not know who was advising the Prime Minister at the time, but it was
certainly not
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:55:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hove (Mike Weatherley), who is now his adviser, because I know that
the hon. Gentleman would never advise him to say such nonsense about
the need for a Google to emerge in the UK—he would have advised
him to say something much more sensible and measured. Was there perhaps
somebody close to Google working at No. 10? Was somebody in a personal
relationship with somebody working at No. 10 and advising the Prime
Minister? I will leave that question hanging. Thank goodness
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:56:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hove is now advising him much more sensibly on such matters.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I see the
Whip<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:56:49"></hs_TimeCode>, the hon.
Member for Devizes (Claire Perry), nodding her head. I will return to
Google later, because there are lots of important things to be said
about that. We have to understand what that has all been underpinned by
and the impact and damage that type of process is
having.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000124">The
Prime Minister then dispatched Ian Hargreaves to solve the Google
conundrum. Ian Hargreaves rightly dumped all the Google nonsense as
soon as he could. He went to the United States to see if he could
introduce the American system of fair use into UK law. When he was
prohibited from doing so because of very sensible European legislation,
he moved on to the substance of his review by looking at IP’s
economic contribution. He came up with 10 recommendations—some
good, some bad, some indifferent and some repetitive—that the
Government were minded to
accept.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000125">Since<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:57:53"></hs_TimeCode>
then, throughout the Hargreaves process, we have been in the business
of legislating for those 10 recommendations. Some have
required primary 
<?notus-xml column=63?>legislation, such as the Enterprise and Regulatory
Reform Act 2013, and some have required secondary legislation. We are
yet to see the statutory instruments, because the Hargreaves process
has not concluded. We have this Bill and the SIs are coming forward.
One thing that I would like the Minister to tell us—he can
intervene now or answer when he responds—is what on earth is
happening with the SIs for the rest of the copyright exceptions. He
will probably say that they are still with parliamentary counsel and
that they are not yet ready to be presented. Well, he had better get a
move on, because he only has until March to do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000126">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:52:27"></hs_TimeCode>
would like to hear about the process for introducing the SIs and what
we should expect.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T17:52:27"></hs_TimeCode> strongly
suggest—several Members have said this several times to various
Ministers—that we have separate SIs for each of the copyright
exceptions. As a matter of principle, it is right and proper that we
should be able to assess each of the exceptions individually. It would
be unacceptable to bundle them together on a “take it or leave
it” basis, particularly the new exceptions, and there are some
really important ones, such as parody, copying and all the other
ones—I cannot remember what they are, but the Minister knows
what I mean. We have to ensure that we see them separately and debate
them properly when they come through.</hs_Para>

are getting close to the end of the Hargreaves process. Has it been
good? Yes, some of it has been all right. The digital copyright
exchange is fantastic—a great little innovation. That part of
the process has worked. However, there is a lot of
nonsense—stuff that we did not need. In fact, great unhappiness
has been caused among many people who represent our creative
industries, because when they came to the Government stating their
strong concerns about some aspects of Hargreaves they were arrogantly
dismissed as though they—the people who have built the success
of the industry—did not understand the environment they were
working in and the Government or Hargreaves knew it better. There was a
great deal of dissatisfaction among people who felt out of sorts with
the way the Government went about this business. I hope that if we have
a process such as this in future we will be able to look at things much
more circumspectly and take everybody with us as we go

want to make a few remarks about how the Bill has been handled. It is
an absolute disgrace that the House of Lords looked at this matter
first: it should have been elected Members in this House. Given the
value of the role that IP plays in industry and business, we should
have considered it first, and if the House of Lords then wanted to look
at it and suggest amendments and things we should reconsider, that
would have been absolutely fine. Something as important as intellectual
property and its contribution to the economy should have been handled
first by directly elected Members rather than the House of Lords,
talented and well respected as some of its Members may be. It should
have been our right and our responsibility.</hs_Para>

fact that the IPO deals with matters looked after by the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport. All the disciplines that the IPO manages and
supports are covered by the DCMS, but the IPO is covered by BIS. Is
anything as ridiculous as that? Surely we should be trying to bring
this together, as suggested by the all-party intellectual property
group. I see some of my fellow officers here;
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:02:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

all-party group also suggested that we should have an IP champion. If
this is going to work cross-departmentally, we need somebody out there
banging the drum for IP-supported business and industry. That is the
great forgotten in all this. There are people here who are passionate
about IP and recognise its value and importance, but the place should
be mobbed—full to the gunwales. This is about billions of pounds
and we have to get it right. The problem is that we have an anonymous
Minister in a Department that does not serve the industry. We must get
this fixed. We should make
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:03:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

things sorted out. He was right to mention the IP tsar in the United
States, who is doing a fantastic job. When the all-party group met her,
we were all very impressed with the power and clout she has on Capitol
Hill to get things done. That is what we need in this
country—somebody who will work cross-departmentally to get
things resolved and make sure that we are able to take this key matter

let me get this properly into context. We have heard all about the
sorts of things that the Bill does. It is great that it covers
registered design rights—the great forgotten IP right. It is
fantastic that ACID has at last got its way and that this will now be
covered by criminal infringement provisions, but it is totally wrong
that unregistered designs are not covered too. In the House of Lords
there was a big debate about this on clause 13. There has also been a
debate within the industry whereby a consensus has developed that if we
are to pursue the idea of registered design rights, unregistered design
rights must be included. The vast majority of people who work in the
design industry are in small or micro-businesses with probably fewer
than four people working for them, and they cannot spend so much time
making sure that things are

did not expect to be raising a constitutional point in relation to
these issues, but the unified European patent court could seriously
affect Scotland’s ability to judge and make rulings on patent
issues within Scotland. As the Minister knows, under the new European
regime every member state is allowed four divisional courts. We know
there is going to be one in London, because the Government have said
so, but we do not know where the other three will be—if there
are three; they have not said how many they have chosen to have. One of
them has to be in Scotland. We cannot have our economy suffering
because our inventors and creators in small businesses have to leave
their jurisdiction to secure justice and satisfaction elsewhere in the
UK or further abroad. After centuries of looking after these issues,
this ability must be available to the Scottish judiciary. The Minister
has probably seen the letters from the Law Society of Scotland and the
Faculty of Advocates in Edinburgh, who are very worried that we could
be diminishing or getting rid of not just decades but centuries of
experience in dealing with patents according to Scots law. We must make

“lobbynomics<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:10:30"></hs_TimeCode>”.
However, the Intellectual Property Office made some heroic assumptions
to support its copyright exceptions. It said that if all 10 of
Hargreaves’s recommendations were introduced it would make a
difference of between 0.6% and 0.9% of GDP. Come on! It expected us to
believe that. It therefore works both
ways.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000141">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>

totally unbelievable. We in the all-party group on intellectual

what they said totally unsatisfactory. The annual report must therefore
be credible and robust, and it must respect everybody in the sector.
The Government should not just leave it to the Intellectual Property
Office to concoct some figures and expect us to be happy and satisfied
with them. At some point, we will have to be able to challenge the

I want to return to Google. This all started with Google, did it not?
It was kicked off by the “Googlesburg” address, but let
us try to turn that on its head. The issue was all about whether a
Google could emerge in the UK because of restrictive intellectual
property practices. What about looking at Google itself? It is a
digital behemoth—there is nothing bigger in the digital
world—and the gatekeeper for all our content industries. Nothing
happens without Google, and nothing can go through its prism without
satisfying it in some way. It distorts the digital market, and it is
damn good at ensuring that it keeps its predominant position. All its
activities are about maintaining its predominant, almost monopoly
position as the gatekeeper of content. It produces no content of its
own—not a bit—but, yet again, the question all comes down

its importance to the economy. The statistics speak for themselves: the

gross value added terms, which is 5.2% of total GVA in the UK;
they generate £130,000 every minute for the

account for about £1 in every £10 of the UK’s
exports. Without a vibrant creative economy, our deficit would be
higher and our services worse. I am often told that the creative
industries are not as important as the NHS, but one thing is certain:
without them, we would have a much reduced NHS. Every person in the UK

the intellectual property adviser to the Prime Minister, I am well
aware that a strong intellectual property culture and regime is the
cornerstone of how we do business, and that protecting intellectual
property rights is essential for growth. I therefore broadly welcome
the measures in the Bill. By valuing intellectual property, we help not
only the UK businesses and investors that take the brunt of the

infringement, but the consumers by ensuring that the public are able
and willing to buy the most legitimate product available, and that

focus on the entrepreneurial aspects of intellectual property is vital

Government have started to tackle the issues that plague intellectual
property law enforcement, and the Bill addresses some of those issues
head-on. From the introduction of criminal penalties for deliberately
copying UK-registered designs to extending the expert opinion services
delivered by the Intellectual Property Office to include registered
designs, the Bill will bring to design rights the same level of
protection that is afforded through copyright and trade marks. In
addition, the implementation of the unified patent court agreement
proposed by the Bill will lead to direct benefits to UK business of up
to £40 million per year. Simple changes, such as providing the
option to mark a patented product with a web address, rather than a
patent number, and allowing the sharing of information between
international patent offices, could reduce the burdens on businesses
and individuals, as well as alleviate the backlog of more than 4
million patents

I discuss what additional measures it would be beneficial to

With industry, I have developed a three-pronged plan for how to address
intellectual property issues in my position as the Prime

has been mentioned today, education is all about winning the debate
about cheap or free goods. We must make the argument that if people get
something cheap or free, they will eventually get only cheap goods or
none at all. We must use education to get the public on side, with a
focus on young people. We must convince people that piracy and similar
illegal activities are not in their best long-term interests and are
not socially acceptable. My goal is to have young people telling their
friends that illegally downloading content or buying counterfeit goods
will harm them all in the long run and is just not right. Their friends
who might want to carve out a career as musicians will be the hardest

we will all be hit hard. I mentioned some impressive statistics at the
start of my speech. The creative industries are the third largest
employer in the UK and we are one of only three countries worldwide
that are net exporters of music, the other two being the USA
and, perhaps surprisingly, Sweden. As I have mentioned, all our public
services will be hit if we lose that enormous revenue stream for the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000161">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:22:15"></hs_TimeCode>
second part of the process—the carrot—is about providing
incentives. We must challenge the creative industries to step up and
provide appealing, consumer-focused services for their products. Some
companies, such as Spotify, Netflix and Bloom, are already doing work
in that area, but there are many more possibilities to be tapped.
Indeed, there was a Rock the House seminar on that very topic in
December last year, chaired by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:22:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

a traffic light system for search engine results that would inform

I come to the stick. To address abuses of intellectual property, there
has to be IP enforcement legislation with real teeth. There are welcome
measures in the Bill, such as increasing the protection of design
rights. There are other measures, like increasing the maximum penalty
for digital copyright theft, that are not in the Bill but perhaps
should be. Another enforcement measure would be to follow the money and
stop advertising and payment facilities on websites that host illegal
content. Internet service providers and search engines would also be
accountable if there was known to be criminality. Ultimately, we need
to consider withdrawing internet rights from lawbreakers, along with
imposing fines and, as a last resort, custodial
sentences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000164">The

other Members, I am grateful to the Alliance for Intellectual Property,
which has produced a useful list of recommendations on how the Bill

<?notus-xml column=70?>issues more effectively. It has rightly pointed to clauses 13

long-standing anomaly that a 2D drawing receives greater protection
under the law than its 3D manifestation. To provide any significant
benefit to UK designers, the provision must be extended to cover
unregistered designs.

sections of the manufacturing industry that rely on innovations to

21 introduces a requirement for the Secretary of State to report

measures that the Bill could include are an increase in the maximum
penalty for digital copyright theft from two to 10 years, which would
match the penalty for physical copyright theft. I support that
proposal. The same crime is being committed and matching the penalty

Bill deals with only a relatively small area of IP. It does not include
any of the supportive measures of the Digital Economy Act 2010 or any
of the Hargreaves exception recommendations. Indeed, this is a missed
opportunity to debate those exceptions on the Floor of the House. The
Bill shows that the Government wish to strengthen IP importance and
enforcement. However, the Hargreaves exceptions have the potential to
send out exactly the opposite message, with a plethora of IP relaxation
measures that will introduce new exceptions for parody, text and data
mining, and private
copying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000170">The
Hargreaves exceptions will affect businesses that employ significant
numbers of people in the UK, so their wording matters greatly. The
wording needs to be tight and must not go further than is necessary to
implement Government policy. For example, the statutory instrument on
private copying needs to ensure that the definition of private copying
does not mean the wider definition of “friends and
family”, as it does in Europe. Creative content providers are
very concerned that the education exception may extend beyond the
classroom. I cannot emphasise enough the importance of considered
drafting. It will define the Government’s approach to IP. We
await with bated breath the wording of the statutory instruments
relating to Hargreaves. However, I fear that it may be too late and

report to the Secretary of State on how the activities of the Patent
Office have contributed to promoting an understanding in the United
Kingdom of the importance of intellectual property and its effective
exploitation, and how the activities of the Patent Office and other UK

creative industries—whether film, television, the arts, or

medium-sized enterprises to use creativity as a way of creating those
jobs of the future. Intellectual property is a key element of that,

reports came from many areas of the country showing that things worked
well in some places, but not in others. Enforcement is a big issue, and
perhaps when we get the opportunity in Committee, we can look at the
role of the IPO, trading standards, packaging, and some of the goods
that mimic others. As a former sports Minister, I think particularly of
the football industry where counterfeit football shirts and so on are
produced. There is a tremendous cross-section of areas to consider,

British businesses are able not just to win in the global race, but to
protect the advantages that got them to the top of the podium in the

Hargreaves’s recommendations was the need for copyright laws to
recognise that IP is a tool for stimulating economic growth. I am

are many admirable clauses in the Bill, but I should like to highlight
a few in this context. First, on the creation of a criminal offence of
infringement of a registered design, our IP framework already has
criminal sanctions for breach of copyright—in the case of music,
for example—and breach of trade marks to protect brands, but
this change recognises that creativity of design is as important to the
economy as any other piece of intellectual
property.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:59:33"></hs_TimeCode> In

15 brings patent notifications into the modern world. Currently, in
order to obtain the maximum protection, patent owners must mark every

to give non-binding opinions on patent validity and the introduction of
a 
<?notus-xml column=79?>design opinion service will help resolve disputes

have the option of litigation, but it should not be the first port of

inspections of registered design files and permitting changes to
statutory forms, and even business hours to be made by directions

IPO wish to extend its opening hours, secondary legislation would have
to be passed in this House.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:01:47"></hs_TimeCode>I also welcome
clause 21, which implements Hargreaves’s recommendation that the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:03:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

mentioned how design was worth £33.5 billion to the UK economy,
as did the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:03:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Burnley (Gordon Birtwistle). He said that 4,000 designs were
registered, but that about 18,000 to 25,000 unregistered designs were
logged on the ACID register—a point also made by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:03:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field)—highlighting
the possible inconsistency between the approaches to registered and
unregistered designs in clause 13.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:04:04"></hs_TimeCode>He also said we
needed greater consistency in our approach to digital copyright theft,
along with physical copyright infringement, and called for the repeal
of section 73 of the Copyright, Design and Patents Act
1988.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham West and Penge (Jim Dowd) pointed
out that not even the Prime Minister knows who the IP Minister is. To
be fair to the Prime Minister—not a phrase I use very
often—there have been three IP Ministers in the last two years,
so it is unsurprising that he has not been able to keep track.
Importantly, he also mentioned parasitic packaging and his experiences
of Worcestershire sauce at the Hare &amp; Billet, which we will cover
later in Committee. As my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland
(Helen Goodman) said,
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:04:55"></hs_TimeCode> is a sense
of a common culture. 
<?notus-xml column=80?>For example, ready salted crisps tend to be packaged
in red—not a bad colour at all. Flavours can denote across the
board what colour can be used, but when a design—for shampoo or
Worcestershire sauce, for example—becomes misleading, we get
into the realms of parasitic packaging. We need to explore that in
Committee. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:05:32"></hs_TimeCode>He
also made a good point about fraudulent websites and, in the public
sector, mentioned Transport for London. The Alliance for Intellectual
Property has shown me websites for Ugg boots that look very credible
but are illegal, fraudulent and not providing a proper service. Again,
that should be looked at.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Cities of London and Westminster generally welcomed the
Bill, but said that more needed to be done. He said that his spiritual
home was Soho, which started to get me worried, but he soon brought it
back to animation and video games, on which he said it is important
that we stay ahead in the global race. He makes an important point.
Canada is aggressively pushing to be the leading place in the world for
video games and animation, using tax credits and other things. We have
to be mindful of that. He made another important point about tech
companies and their scale. The UK is good on start-ups, but perhaps not
so good at growing them to the scale we need. That might have something
to access to funding, as opposed to IP, but it is certainly something
to look at.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart) was great in
Runrig, but he is even better in MP4 and has consistently advocated a
strong IP framework. I think he said that we tamper with it at our
peril and made an important point questioning what was happening with
the delay to statutory instruments for copyright exceptions. He made
another important point about how these things should not be bundled
together but taken, I hope, on the Floor of the House, and certainly
individually so that we can consider things such as parody and private
copying. He made the astonishing point that 77% of singles and 64% of
album downloads had been directed via an illegal site. That is
something we need to look at.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Hove (Mike Weatherley) is the Prime Minister’s
IP adviser. He brought a lot of knowledge and experience to the debate.
He said that helping the consumer to buy legitimate products was a key
concern and mentioned the three elements he wanted to deal
with—education, carrot and stick. He also made the important
point that a 2D drawing was covered in the Bill and IP legislation, but
that a 3D physical manifestation of that design was not. Surely, that
cannot be right and needs to be dealt with.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Bradford South (Mr Sutcliffe) said
that education was at the heart of all this. His area is using
creativity in creating jobs for the future. He mentioned the importance
of tax credits and touched on film tax relief, which was introduced by
the last Labour Government, showing the importance of certainty and a
long-term policy framework. He also mentioned enforcement and the role
of trading standards.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland, who is an excellent shadow
media Minister but will be an even better actual media Minister,
pointed out that the media industry lost about £250 million a
year through illegal downloading. The music industry has been slow to
deal with illegal copying and digital technology—I think of
Napster a couple of years ago—but interestingly this
weekend’s <I>Financial Times </I>said that downloading 
<?notus-xml column=81?>was now being eclipsed by subscription services
such as Spotify. We can talk about whether artists, such as
Thom Yorke of Radiohead, get enough royalties from subscription
services, but pushing people in that direction seems to be the way the
music industry is going in order to raise
revenue.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:09:20"></hs_TimeCode> She
also said that the IPO should have an enforcement role and brought to

than anything else, this debate has shown that the House appreciates
and recognises how vital IP is to the future prosperity of the UK
economy. This is an important Bill that will be studied closely in

today, but there can be no doubt that IP matters to the UK
economy.</hs_Para>

many of the interventions went beyond what is in the Bill, I
appreciated the general welcome for the specific proposals, in
recognition of the importance of protecting intellectual property. It
is sometimes said that behind every fat person is a slim person trying
to get out; on this occasion, we have a slim Bill, but there seems to
be a fat Bill that Members are trying to impose on us. This slim Bill,
however, is intended to achieve some of the specific objectives set by
Hargreaves, and I believe we are doing that in the right
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0002.htm#14012030000238">Several
Members, including the hon. Member for Lewisham West and Penge (Jim
Dowd), mentioned the IP index. We score well internationally on the
quality of our IP protection, including being second in the world in
respect of patents. The area where we underperform—down to
fifth—is design. That is why this Bill specifically focuses on
that area where our performance is weakest, as our legal framework on
design is inadequate.</hs_Para>

Members raised the specific issue of whether the new criminal offence
we are introducing should extend beyond registered design to
unregistered design. I have said at several points in the debate that
we are absolutely up for consultation, and I intend to introduce
amendments in Committee. On this particular issue, however, we do not
take the view that unregistered designs should be subject to a criminal
sanction. Our view is that the design registration provides a clear
starting point for any prosecution and includes important information
such as the precise scope of the protection of the design and who owns
it, which would be important for any criminal prosecution. It can be
difficult, however, to track down information about unregistered
design—such as who owns it and whether it is still protected.
There can be uncertainty about whether a design is free to use. Unlike
the UK registered right, the UK unregistered right can protect
functional designs, and where these are complex and highly technical,
it could cause difficulties in criminal cases. If we think about the
risks of injustice from criminal sanctions in cases where unregistered
designs are involved—we have had a long consultation on
that—we believe that we have got the balance correct in
extending criminal protection to registered but not to unregistered
designs.</hs_Para>

several questions about the working of the Intellectual Property
Office, including from my hon. Friend the Member for Cities of London
and Westminster 
<?notus-xml column=82?>(Mark Field), who asked where the responsibility for IP lies. Let me be
clear: the IPO, which is an agency of the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, leads on IP policy across the Government. It
works closely with a whole range of Departments and organisations,
including the Treasury and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport.
It worked well with the Treasury on the patent box, for example, which
has been a real boost to our IP-generating industry, and it accessed
finance for IP intensive businesses, while it has worked with DCMS on
copyright enforcement online.</hs_Para>

Field:</Member></B> I would not want our earlier exchanges to be seen
as negative about the IPO in any way. In my small number of dealings
with it, I have been impressed by its clear focus and its international
vision. It was clear from what Members of all parties said that dealing
with the issue of intellectual property seems to be divided
into a number of different Government Departments. It is good to have a

have strayed into that confirmation, as I was about to say that we are
also fortunate in having a Minister for intellectual property. On
several occasions when Members were talking about the need for a
Minister for intellectual property, I could see that Minister up in the
Gallery. Those comments were a disservice to my colleague, Viscount
Younger of Leckie, who does an excellent job as the Minister for
intellectual property. The IPO does have an enforcement role, and it

wanted the issue to be debated today because this is a particularly
strategic time for such a debate to take place. Historically, the
regulation of payday lenders has been the responsibility of the Office
of Fair Trading, but in April that responsibility will be taken over by

on the rules that it is proposing, and we felt that it was timely for
the Select Committee’s recommendations to be given an even more

personal debt survey that was conducted in December last year found
that 5% of adults admitted to having taken out payday loans. An even
more significant finding was that 6% said they would consider taking
out such a loan in the next six months. The turnover of the market
increased from £900 million in 2008-09 to £2.26 billion
in 2011-12, and all the indications are that the more recent figures
will show an even greater increase. According to StepChange, an
organisation that provides advice on debt, 36,000 people approached it
for advice in 2012, and 30,000 people did so during the first six
months of 2013. That means that what was a very large number of people

Bailey:</Member></B> I broadly support that course of action. I
think that there is a sector of the market to which payday lenders can
be relevant, but that sector must be closely regulated and transparent,
and there must be a process that prevents lenders from adding to the
problems of those who apply to them for loans. I shall say more about
that, and about the important issue of
competition<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:28:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012030000271">I
intend to talk about just one significant part of the industry, but let
me first point out that much of the publicity about the industry has
focused on the interest rate charged by payday lenders and the
associated costs. That is obviously crucial in terms of the impact that
it has on the people who take out the loans, but I think that we should
view the issue much more broadly. We should think about the way in
which payday lenders promote themselves, and the way in which they lure
people into taking out loans. We should think about the processes in
which they engage, which do not ensure that the loans given to people
are appropriate to their personal needs, as well as how much they
charge and how much they make from those charges. The Select
Committee’s
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:29:18"></hs_TimeCode>recommendations

issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012030000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012030000272">I
think that the main problem—which was reflected in the 2013 OFT
review of payday websites—is that payday lenders who are in
competition with each other do not operate on a competitive
price-offering basis; they operate on the basis of speed of access to
such loans and lack of accountability. Anybody who goes on a payday
loan site will see that the key aspects of every company advert are
speed of access and lack of accountability. The OFT review made a
substantial impact. As a result of the investigation, 19 of
the 50 operators left the market, three had their licences revoked and
three surrendered them. That alone shows the appalling
misrepresentation that was going on at that point, but should anybody
believe that that problem is over as a result of that action, even a
cursory glance at their advertising will show that it is not. There are
still many areas of enormous concern, and I know other Members will

children seeing these adverts and the impact they are having on them is
such that we cannot stand aside and disregard that. I understand the
broader issues about regulating advertisements, but I feel there is now
a huge body of evidence to demonstrate that the Advertising Standards
Authority should be working with the financial services industry and
others to ensure that there is a code of practice so that children are
not subjected to such a level of

cannot believe all this is coincidental. Parents respond to
pester-power from their children, and if those children believe it is
so easy to obtain money, the pressures that adults may feel are

general philosophical approach is very much that we want to build a
land of opportunity and aspiration where anyone can do well and where
they have the tools to succeed and achieve and even reach for the moon.
There is a flipside to that form of opportunity politics—that
Conservatism—and that is that we also need to protect people
from being taken advantage of. In too many cases, there is a history in
this country of lax regulation, which has enabled people to be taken
advantage of: water and power companies not properly regulated with
rising bills; the banking system was not properly regulated and spawned
payday lending; a tax system that was lax and weak and allowed
industrial-scale tax avoidance, which was unacceptable; and employment
law that is not properly regulated, even though it was previously
reviewed and zero-hours contracts were allowed to carry on. In too many
cases, this Government need to protect people and make sure they are
not taken advantage of. In many instances action has been taken,
however, and I welcome the action on payday lending announced
by the
Chancellor<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000003">The
problem is not a new one; it has been around for a while. I remember a

thinking of buying a payday lender.” I said, “What is
that? I haven’t heard of it.” He explained what it was
and I said, “This is a car crash in the making.” He said,
“It’s great: it’s a rising a market and I can make
lots of money out of it.” I said, “Don’t do it.
People will not understand. It will not be acceptable, and sooner or
later it will cause a massive scandal in this country and an enormous
row,” and that has turned out to be the case. I am glad to say
he did not take on that business, but many others did: they saw an

say we should not take any action on payday lending because that will
drive people into the hands of loan sharks, but the evidence from the
Bristol university department for business was that when customers
could not access short-term loans, most would either go without or
approach a friend or relative for help.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>It showed that a
small number would try to borrow from other short-term lenders, but
that the use of an illegal lender was not an option that the vast
majority would consider. It does not seem right, therefore, to say that
most people would end up going to loan sharks.</hs_Para>

USA has introduced caps, and the overall result has been substantially
to restrict the market. Payday lending has been dramatically reduced as
a result. Other countries have gone down different routes. Canada, for
example, has introduced substantial regulation for short-term loans and
established a payday lending education fund. It has also introduced a
two-day cooling-off period during which customers can cancel their
payday loan, and banned the inclusion of fees in the value of the
loaned amount. The payday loan industry has set up its own industry
body. There are also rules banning the rolling over of payday loans;
the issuing of multiple payday loans to the same customer; the taking
of collateral as security; and the charging of an interest rate greater
than 90 cents a week for the first 13 weeks. Canada has thus produced a
system of regulation that involves capping amounts of money, rather
than capping interest rates.</hs_Para>

considering. Those international comparators suggest that we should
consider not only an interest rate cap but perhaps a cap involving a

Elphicke:</Member></B> I am in complete agreement with the hon. Lady.
Credit unions are a good idea, and mutual finance is a good thing. I am
a fan of mutuals, having made the case for my own port of Dover to
become a people’s port—a community mutual. We have
mutuals in the financial sector in this country, but they are rarely
mentioned. What happened to the building society movement? Why is no
one fighting for that these days? Building societies are mutual
organisations. We should look again at what we can do with them and at
the kind of organisations they could become. They are substantial
organisations, and this is something we should look at. In Australia,
the credit unions have been more successful than they are here. Here,
we have a building society movement, and we should look at developing
it.</hs_Para>

want to touch on a further concern. Why is the payday lending industry
there at all? Why has it arisen? I believe that bank overdrafts have a
lot to do with it. Anyone who has an unauthorised overdraft will be
charged 20 quid for a letter and 50 quid for the unauthorised overdraft
fee, plus an extra amount per cheque or payment. That is wrong; it is
egregious. When people have run out of money and cannot get an
authorised overdraft, it is the behaviour of the banks that can help to
drive them to the alternative credit providers. A practical step would
be to look into the banks’ behaviour. We need to strike a
balance between protecting customers from being stung by the banks when
they have short-term cash-flow problems and making access to
irresponsible credit too easy for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:44:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the banks should operate a grace period, so that people who ended up
with an unauthorised overdraft would not get hit with fees immediately.
They should be able to overdraw for a short time without being charged.
That would reduce the numbers being forced to seek alternative forms of
credit. There should also be a wide-ranging review of the way in which
the banks handle overdrafts, and of their ability to help people who
find themselves short of funds in the short
term<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:45:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
Most<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:45:58"></hs_TimeCode> of us in
the House want to defeat the payday lending industry, and the best way
to do that is to provide an alternative for people who do not have much
money and who are in real need of assistance.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:45:32"></hs_TimeCode> am also
concerned about the EU consumer credit directive. The ability of
lenders to operate across EU borders makes it possible for payday
lenders to bypass anything that we decide here. That needs to be
carefully considered and addressed.</hs_Para>

what more can we do, above and beyond what the Financial Conduct
Authority is proposing to look at when it takes over in a few
months’ time? We could consider the following measures: setting
a ceiling on the total cost of borrowing, rather than setting an
interest rate cap; seeking reform of the European consumer credit
directive; introducing tougher sentences for illegal lending, including
mandatory prison sentences; enabling victims of illegal lending to
recover all payments made to the lender, plus extra, rather like what
the Labour Government did with tenant deposit schemes; requiring payday
lenders to form an accredited industrial body; and requiring banks to
give a grace period of three working days before customers are charged
for unauthorised

McKechin</B> (Glasgow North) (Lab):</Member> The fact that this is the

Committee has reported on this issue reflects the enormous public
interest in the matter and the concern about the impact of the sector
on our communities as well as on individual borrowers. To date, the
regulatory authorities have being running behind the curve, and it is
important that the Financial Conduct Authority should start ahead of
the game. The regulators initially gave little priority to protecting
the poorest borrowers on the basis that the total lending represented
just a small percentage of the total in the financial services sector.
They failed to take proper account of the problems that had already
beset other international jurisdictions, to which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:47:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Dover (Charlie Elphicke) has referred. The Government’s
response to our first report was simply to try to shift the problem
further down the time line, with an instruction for further reviews and
reports. The transition to regulation by the FCA was used as the main
reason for not taking immediate
action<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T19:47:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000014">In
my own city of Glasgow, the council reported last year that its
citizens borrowed £57 million annually through high-cost credit,

council estimates that a staggering 100,000 residents are using
non-standard credit and that a high percentage of that number are

framework and priorities that it needs to address; nor should it be a

deal now with the real-time recording of credit information. If credit
information is to work, it needs to be both accurate and comprehensive;
otherwise, there is little point to it. Unsurprisingly, the industry
was quick to downplay the significance of this potential regulatory
step, and again it is regrettable that the authorities have not been
faster to respond, preferring instead an approach of wait and see. I
commend the sustained pressure from agencies like as Citizens Advice
and StepChange, but the cloud lifted when BBC’s
“Newsnight” programme and others reported at the end of
last year on the potential impact on mortgage lending. If there is no
real-time recording in the payday lending sector, the existing credit
recording systems become increasingly unreliable and inaccurate,
particularly in respect of younger borrowers, who form the bulk of this
sector’s customers. Lenders in the mainstream sector
have now decided, in their world of lower risk, to dismiss payday
borrowers entirely from their eligibility test—and hey presto,
this month we have the announcement from Wonga and some others that a
real-time recording system is going to be put in place later this year.
Call me a cynic, but I suspect that the potential hit
on their client base, who were increasingly worried
about future access to mainstream lending and to
mortgages, acted as a greater incentive than the dialogue with

my speech, because that is what the FCA absolutely needs to do and it
is what we have recommended. Unless we have a recording system that is
properly comprehensive, we will not have a solution and we will not
stop lenders making non-compliant loans. The current proposal contains
no requirement to report to the FCA; it still relies on voluntary
reporting, and we know that many of the same lenders were found wanting
in last year’s OFT investigation. As colleagues have done, I
urge the FCA not to rely on the industry to provide the solutions, but
to ensure that the public’s protection is paramount. Given that
no one trade organisation represents the sector and that new entrants
are likely, albeit in smaller numbers than before, we need a regulated
and transparent system of recording which will have the trust of
borrowers and lenders alike, and which will do the work it needs to do
to allow our constituents to obtain legitimate credit. The FCA should
quickly impose such a system, rather than allowing a not very
satisfactory alternative to emerge in fits and starts.</hs_Para>

Committee has further requested that in the light of the disturbing
evidence we received of continued abuses of the present regulatory
system, all companies should resubmit their affordability tests to the
FCA for approval. Like some other hon. Members here today, I received
whistleblowing evidence this weekend from a former senior employee of a
major payday lender. It portrays an endemic culture of avoidance, from
the senior managers down to shop-floor staff, and I trust it will
receive the urgent and serious attention it deserves from the
regulators. This is not just about a company bending the rules to suit
its own profit line; it is about full-scale lending to people the
company knows will be unable to repay in full or part, with the misery
that goes along with it. I do not believe this is an isolated example,
and as the Chair of our Committee has stated, the evidence before us
challenges regulators to make sure that their enforcement systems are
going to work. As this evidence suggests, there may be a move by some
lenders to have long-term lending simply to bypass regulatory attempts.
To be fair to the FCA, I know it appreciates that the challenge on
effectiveness will be in trying to cope with changes in the market and
how it shifts over months and years. I believe it is important for the
Government to have a strong response to our Committee’s report,
to accept our recommendations and to make sure that public protection
is always paramount in our
considerations.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_20_PT_1/4963CC7BF0CDC3A191E880F6C921523562C11F20" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="20 January 2014">Monday

I want to see the FCA introduce a roll-over limit of one. Failure to
meet a loan repayment should be a clear signal that the borrower is in
financial trouble. The answer is not then for the lender to refinance
the debt. The purpose of payday loans is to tide the borrower over
until payday; they should not be allowed to become long-term financing
instruments. Two roll-overs equate to three months, which is far too
long. Getting the regulation right is important, but if we do more to
support the incomes of the lowest paid, this market will lose much of

more money in the pockets of millions of hard-working people, reducing
reliance on high cost credit. Of course, the most direct impact
Government can have on our income is to take less of it in tax. That is
why the increase in the personal allowance, which has a
disproportionate impact on the low paid, is so important. Someone

payday lending, but there are other practices that we need to look at.
The logbook loans, the rent-to-own model of BrightHouse and brokers
such as Cash Lady all bear closer inspection, but at the moment we are
looking at the payday loan industry. The industry has said that it
recognises the need to clean up its business, and it introduced the
good practice customer charter a year ago. However, were those just
fine words, or has it cleaned up its business? Over the past year,
Citizens Advice surveyed more than 4,000 people who had
taken out a loan with payday lenders, and I am afraid that the results
do not make encouraging reading. Like my hon. Friends, I do not trust
the payday industry when it says that it is going for the

real-time database must be mandatory to have any effect. If it is not,
lenders can pop up all over the place without putting in the data. It
is no good for lenders to say that they will give the FCA information
on their products and services on a six-monthly basis, as has been said
by the lenders who have promised to join the real-time database. That
promise is simply not worth having. This is a fast-moving

the tools to work with the companies, examine their products and see
how they are lending to people in as quick a time as they are changing

Loans are capped at $500. The regulator thought that a company had
given two loans that breached the cap. It went in and the manager of
the shop said, “Hands up, yes. It was a rogue employee. I am
terribly sorry.” The regulator had the real-time data in enough
detail to be able to say, “Actually, it was you, the manager of
the shop, who approved this loan on two occasions.” That is the
sort of data we
need<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:06:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000041">I
am still uncomfortable with the idea of two roll-overs. The survey says
that for 18% of such borrowers, the risks were never explained at all.
In only 18% of cases were the risks of extending the loan explained to
people. In 37% of cases were the costs clearly explained. Only 17% of
people were treated sympathetically when they got into difficulties. In
only 16% of cases were the charges and interest frozen. I have even
more concerns now after receiving the same e-mail as

the Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey) in which the company
talked about repaying the loan in full, and then making another loan,
which means they would get out of any cap. They would not be capped
because it would be a new loan. The market is extremely fast-moving and
slippery, and we must ensure that the regulations are worded in such a

fees are a major problem for many people. Someone who borrowed
£200 was charged £50 for a letter telling them that they
had not paid. That is  
<?notus-xml column=97?>a completely ridiculous amount to charge for a letter. I have always
said that payday loans are a perfectly sensible way to borrow in
certain situations, but if someone cannot pay the loan, they can expect
to be treated with some sympathy. I am more concerned that the cap on
the total cost of credit will not include default fees. I have heard
some companies say that it is the cost not of credit but of not paying,
and that is how they will get around the cap, which is why there should
be a cap on the default fee, and it should be an amount that the
regulator says is reasonable. I am sure that a company can justify
£50 for a letter, with time, office costs and so on, but it is
not justifiable on a £200 loan. It means that vulnerable people
who take out a loan, like 48% of the population, and are slightly
over-optimistic about whether they can pay it back will continue to be
exploited.</hs_Para>

side, we are also in a period of regulatory change and an evolving FCA

Hinds:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is right. Of course, many local
councils do that, providing premises and soft support in all sorts of
ways. What the Government are doing, which is key, is trying to help
the sector get a point where it stands on its own two feet. Although
subsidy and direct support have a role, we eventually want the sector
to thrive, to be self-sustaining and to be able to take on the other
lenders. That will include brand awareness and a product range that is
right and that attracts people, but essentially we want the sector to
be a bigger, professional operation that provides a real alternative. I
think that we are moving in that direction, both through the
Government’s support and through the liberalisation of the
sector, with the legislative reform order and the move from a 2% cap to
a 3% cap on interest a month. That puts credit unions a little closer
to being able to compete with payday
lenders<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:14:45"></hs_TimeCode>,

biggest change by far that the Government are putting in place is the
duty to have a cap on the cost of credit. That is an enormous

either. Of course we want clarity about what a product offers,
disclosure, health warnings and so on, but there is a limit to their
effectiveness. Warnings quickly become part of the wallpaper of life,
just like that thing that goes, “Your home is at risk if you do
not…blah, blah, blah.” People stop paying attention and,

for sound financial education, of course we want educated, empowered

before they are in a position to need to use that education—and
I can guarantee that by the time they do need it, everything will have
changed. If we had had financial education when we are at school, we
would have learned about clearing houses and endowment mortgages. They
would have said, “Don’t worry—at least a final
salary pension will see you safe,” and we probably would have
been told that payment protection insurance was a damn good idea and we

are another suggested solution. We think that if we find an abuse in a
market we should stamp it out, but there are limitations in that
regard. If we restrict roll-overs, I can guarantee that the industry
will find a different way to make money. That even applies to the
real-time database that people are setting such store by—we
should always beware when people think that one solution will solve a
lot of problems. Quite apart from the other problems caused by the
creation of mega-databases, there is also the issue of scope. In
Florida, for example, there is no home credit market on the same scale
as ours. If a real-time database is to be really effective, it must

that the current levels of payday lending are a social ill, that it

that we must make the market less attractive. We must reduce its
ubiquity so that we reduce both supply and demand. Not only do we want
to make the market work better, we want less of a market. A cap on the
cost of credit is a fundamental part of that, not only in ensuring that
consumers are not ripped off but in making it less attractive to
players coming into the market. We do not want to make it unattractive,
because, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>

cap is, of course, not a panacea either. First, stimulation, whether
big or small, at the margin of the illegal market will definitely be a
problem. Of course, firms will find other ways to make money. When
people hear that, they say, “Oh, but I’m not talking just
about a cap on interest. I mean a cap on the total cost of
credit,” but what do they mean by that? I suggest that people
mean different things and think that everyone else is using the same
definition. Sometimes, people mean restricting behavioural charges or
penalties. That is a perfectly legitimate goal, but it is not the same
as reducing the overall cost of credit. Such a cap would have to be
really rather high to tackle the real abuses.</hs_Para>

people say, “Ah, but we’re talking not about penalties,

annual percentage rates cover. If a fee is paid by everyone, it is
already included in the APR. Because people do not understand
percentages very well, they could be presented with a cash number for
the total cost of credit, but I suggest that there is a big difference
between using a cash number for disclosure where it makes perfect
sense—“You will pay x per £100”—and
using it for a limit where it can be generalised. That probably
explains why most usury caps use APRs, and I suggest that the twin caps
approach now used in Australia is probably the most
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:21:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_20_PT_1/53F91929993017C49CFB130611BD41C1D150977D" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="20 January 2014">Monday

the Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin) noted the extraordinary
growth in short-term loans being taken out. Members on both sides of
the House have suggested that that is something to do with either bank
overdraft charges or, perhaps more fundamentally, the growth of a
low-wage economy. The latter is absolutely true. We cannot understand
this problem without reference to the growth of low-wage employment.
However, it is important to refer not only to low wages but to
irregular and insecure
employment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:24:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000066">What
we see in the 21st century phenomenon of payday loans is
something that we commonly found 100 years ago in the form of the
pawnbroker: the debt-credit cycle, which appears in economies and
contexts where low pay and insecure and irregular employment are a
reality. One hundred years ago, the pawnbroker was ubiquitous for a
simple and straightforward reason: weekly wages did not cover
outgoings. Therefore, in a world where weekly wages could not meet the
cost of living, what was the rational response of people in that
position, of whom there were many millions? The rational response was
to pawn their good claithes at the point in the week when their wages
were exhausted and then to redeem their good claithes—that is,
clothes, for non-Scottish Members of Parliament—when their wages
were paid. That continued week after week. They pawned when their
weekly wages were exhausted but their outgoings had not been met, and
they redeemed when they were paid—over and again, week after
week<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:25:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000067">Of

observations that might seem obvious. The most obvious is that one must
be absolutely clear about what one is encompassing in the cap—a
point that he made very well—while being clear about when the
cap will be introduced. As things stand, we have an undertaking from
the Government to move towards a cap on the total cost of credit, but

to be taking place—Members on both sides of the House feel that,
and the public certainly do—but at the same time to ensure that
legitimate access can be maintained to short-term loans that are not

to pick up on a point made by more than one Government Member today,
when all that is done and exploitation through payday loans has been

wage. My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T20:29:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Glasgow North is absolutely right that that form
of lending can be much more exploitative than pawnbroking has been over
the past 150 years, but the lesson from the era when pawnbroking was

I would like to see. The first one, and it is often the simplest, but
the one on which I am not sure we are there yet, is that the total cost
of a loan should always be displayed in cash terms. I suspect that not
even Treasury Ministers can calculate an APR rate, which involves a
hugely complex formula. Therefore, a customer should be able to say,
“I want to borrow £100, and it will cost me
£20.” Even those without a particularly good grasp of
mathematics would then be able to make a reasonably informed decision
on whether that represents good value for money.</hs_Para>

second thing I would like to see is real-time credit checking. The
industry wants that because, despite a lot of the rumours, it relies on
people being able to pay back the money they have borrowed. It would
help to avoid somebody going into one shop and 15 minutes later going
into another one. The credit checking agencies follow the traditional
monthly banking system, so in theory somebody can wreak damage on
themselves in the course of a month before the banks catch up. The
industry says that it wants real-time credit checking; the credit
agencies say they would like to offer it but that it is very
complicated. One of the smaller operators, Call Credit, has got 10
operators signed up, but it will not be 100% participation. The
Government will therefore have to empower the FCA to demand this. We
are getting close to it, and it exists in some forms in America. It
will make a huge difference because it will protect people from taking
out multi-loans and allow the FCA to enforce affordability checks so
that lenders who are lending to people who cannot afford it can be
dealt

would like to go one step further in ensuring that people can rebuild
their credit rating. When someone has been turned down for a loan by
one of the mainstream banks, the payday lending industry is often the
only one that is prepared to take the risk with them. If they pay back
the loan properly and on time, they should then have their credit
rating repaired, allowing them to re-enter mainstream traditional

is a perception that the products, prices and requirements placed on

FCA needs to be extremely proactive in terms of mystery shoppers. Often
the consumers who get themselves into the most difficulty are
vulnerable people who are least equipped to raise it with us so that we
can chase things up. This particularly applies to doorstep lending, as
I have said in previous debates. With that lending model, the lender
befriends someone, gains their trust, goes into their house every
month, and could encourage them to borrow more. They might say over a
cup of tea, “Have you sorted out your Christmas presents? If
not, don’t worry, because we could provide the money for that,
and why don’t you get your carpet sorted out if you’ve
got your family coming round—that’s only another

things that can be done to tackle the problem have been mentioned by
right hon. and hon. Members, and I want to touch on a few of them.
First, we need to acknowledge and address the growing poverty in our
country. It affects not only those who rely entirely on benefits,
but—and, in some cases, more so—the working poor who
struggle to make ends meet on low and irregular pay. The rise in the
uptake of payday loans has been accompanied by a growth in the number
of food banks, which is evidence of the financial stress with which
many families have to contend in trying to afford the
basics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000101">Raising
the level of the minimum wage and lifting the poorest out of taxation
are two very positive measures that the Government are considering and
have committed themselves to doing. However, the impact of welfare
reform is likely to hit hard precisely those same families who are
struggling now, which will increase the risk of their getting into
unmanageable debt. One alternative source of help that has been
available for those in difficult financial circumstances is the social
fund. Although it has certain eligibility limitations, I am concerned

year a number of steps have been taken, which will be welcomed across
the House, to tighten and improve the regulatory regime for high-cost

and to protect consumers. The FCA provided a helpful briefing for
today’s debate that enumerates many of the improvements it
intends to introduce, and given the rapid growth of the industry since
2008, such action is not only welcome but necessary. Nevertheless,
there remains a high degree of concern about the prevalence and ease of
access to very high-cost loans, and a good deal of evidence that they
are causing real problems to many of our constituents.</hs_Para>

Select Committee took evidence from payday lenders, they were at pains
to point out that the number of people driven to default was only a
small proportion of the total number who use such loans. That may be
the case, but given the enormous scale of the industry, that small
proportion represents a significant number of people whose lives have
been profoundly affected for the worse, whose credit ratings may have
been destroyed, and who will have been left permanently worse off
and—as the hon. Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin) pointed
out—sometimes unable to get a mortgage as a result of short-term

report sets out some important points, and I wanted to focus on two:
real-time data sharing and the importance of the FCA levy to fund free
debt advice. For real-time data sharing, and taking on board the point
made by my hon. Friend the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)
that it is not a total solution, affordability is key, and it can play
an important role in ensuring that payday lenders better assess
affordability in the future. Representatives of the industry who gave
evidence to the Committee went to great lengths to argue that they
apply strenuous and rigorous affordability tests, but we also heard a
great deal of evidence to the contrary. Perhaps one of the most
illustrative points was the example cited by my hon. Friend the Member
for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart) about Bo Peep applying for a payday
loan—an extraordinary story.</hs_Para>

such as Citizens Advice and StepChange were able to demonstrate too
many cases where the same person was able to take out irrational
numbers of loans from different providers, and the evidence both on
defaults and roll-overs suggests that affordability is still not
properly assessed. Although the spokesman for 
<?notus-xml column=110?>Wonga argued that the proportion of its debts written off had been
overstated in some media coverage, he admitted that there was
£77 million of bad loans, which represented almost 10% of
lending by that company, or 300,000 customers. In another answer he
suggested that only 3% of customers got into financial difficulties and
could not afford to repay, but even if we take that 3% as a fair
assessment, we would be talking about tens of thousands of
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000124">I
think that real-time data sharing—unglamorous and perhaps
wonkish as it is—is one of the keys to making the short-term
credit industry work better and more fairly. Not only would it mean
that existing lenders could avoid giving loans to those who might
already be overcommitted elsewhere, but it would allow new entrants to
the market to lend at a better rate, increasing competition and
providing a real alternative to some of the sky-high costs out there in
the market. That is because they would be able to avoid lending to
people with large numbers of outstanding short-term loans, and thereby
reduce their default rates. I have met potential market entrants who
believe that if a proper system of real-time data sharing were
available they could offer short-term loans at not much more than the
roughly 39% APR allowed to credit
unions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000125">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T18:10:18"></hs_TimeCode>
industry has suggested that it is in favour of such a system.
Callcredit, one of the main players in the credit reference agency
sector, has recently announced that it is piloting a data sharing
scheme. That is to be welcomed, but there are a number of concerns with
that voluntary approach. One credit reference working on its own with
its clients will be unable to provide an accurate picture of the whole
market. Its suggestion is an improvement, in that it reduces the
interval between filings on lending, but it is not a real-time system.
There is still a chance that customers could apply for one loan after
another in a short time interval, and that lenders will be unaware of
the loans outstanding at the time of their lending
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000126">More
seriously, as long as credit reference agencies continue to provide
lending data to their paying customers only, and as long as they
compete on which agency has the best client list, there will be gaps in
the picture of the market they can present. There is no guarantee that
that voluntary approach will make lenders or the FCA aware of all the
loans an individual has outstanding at any moment in time. Unless there
is a firm agreement for all the credit reference agencies to work
together and share their data, which is inimical to their reason for
being and their way of doing business, some form of Government or
regulatory intervention will be
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000127">I
was pleased that both the regulator and the Minister, in their evidence
to the Committee’s inquiry, expressed a willingness to intervene
should it become necessary to do so, and I welcome the recognition they
gave to the importance of real-time data sharing, but I reiterate the
question I asked then: what time line will they set before taking
action to mandate real-time data sharing? The Committee’s report
suggests a deadline of July 2014 for the FCA to step in if the industry
has not delivered. Notwithstanding the decision of Callcredit, I
believe that that is likely to be
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000128">I

to run through my four main concerns, the first of which is the
exorbitant interest rates charged by those companies, which should not
be tolerated in our society. Pay-back rates of 5,800% are not unheard
of, and APRs of 2,600% are not at all unusual. That creates huge
problems for people paying back the loans. Despite this, more and more
people have to turn to payday loan companies just to make ends meet.
That indicates that there is a huge cost of living problem in our
society, and that many jobs simply do not pay people enough money to
live on.</hs_Para>

1% of people getting advice from citizens advice bureaux had debt from
at least one payday loan. That rose to 4% in 2012 and 10% this year.
Evidence from Citizens Advice also reveals irresponsible lending, and
says that it is intrinsic to the industry. New 12-month figures from
the national charity’s payday loan tracker reveal that 61% of
loans still come without proper checks to assess whether borrowers can
afford to repay. It also found not only that three out of four
borrowers found it difficult to repay their loan, but that in 84% of
cases lenders were breaking their promises to freeze interest and
charges for those who were struggling.</hs_Para>

Debtline says that calls for help with payday loan issues
soared from 776 in 2008 to more than 20,000 in 2012. A ComRes survey
found that 98% of MPs and 93% of the public believe there is a
problem with payday lending, and that 66% of MPs and 65% of the
public support a cap on the total cost of credit. It is hardly
surprising, therefore, that the Government were forced to take action
earlier this year, but I am not sure that requiring the FCA regulator
to clamp down on excessive interest rates is really good enough,
especially when it will be some months before any such scheme can be
implemented. Labour put forward an amendment to the Financial Services
Bill, which would have given the new FCA clear powers to tackle the
overall cost and duration of high-cost loans, especially where it could
demonstrate consumer detriment. It is a real pity that the Government
did not accept the amendment.</hs_Para>

second concern is the methods used to trap people in cycles of debt. I
have a constituent who, when desperate and applying for a loan, was
told that she had to give her mobile phone number. Thereafter, she was
sent texts that offered her more loans and offered to give her more
money to pay outstanding loans. She was contacted at the end of the
month, when she was particularly short of money, and urged to take out
more loans. When she came to my surgery she was literally at her
wits’ end and did not know what to do. That case is not unique
and we really should not continue to allow companies to behave in this
way. If this sort of bullying was taking place anywhere else, it would
be
tackled. My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:02:13"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich West mentioned how advertising
is increasingly being targeted at children. Again, that is a disgrace
and something that should be brought to an end immediately. Research
shows that of those sampled who had taken out a payday loan, 60% regret
the decision and 48% believe that their loan has made their financial
situation worse. Only a tiny number think it has had a positive impact
on their finances.</hs_Para>

third concern relates to the proliferation of these companies on our
high streets. Action the Government have taken to deregulate use
classes and permitted development rights means that it is much easier
for payday loan companies to set up on our high streets without having
to gain planning permission. This is a step in completely the wrong
direction. We are urging the Government to take action on this
immediately by returning powers to local councils and local
communities, so that they are able to reduce the numbers of payday loan
companies on their high streets. We know, from a number of different
surveys undertaken with communities, that local people want those
powers and they want their councils to be able to reduce the number of
payday loan companies in their area.</hs_Para>

fourth point concerns the way in which payday loan companies target
disadvantaged areas and prey on poor people. Research recently
carried out by Professor Sarah Banks at Durham university
described payday loan companies as preying on the poor. She said that
many people have multiple loans with payday and doorstep
lenders at annual interest rates of up to 4,000% even though their
incomes are very small, and that the companies did not even look at the
other debts people had or whether they could afford to repay them. They
lent to people, even though some of them had only very small amount
savings or no savings at all. She 
<?notus-xml column=113?>gave lots of examples of the unscrupulous way in
which loans were being targeted, particularly at those with very low
incomes.</hs_Para>

hon. Members have said, we need to find ways out of this situation, and
one of them is to support and promote credit unions better. I am
pleased that our new Bishop of Durham has signed up to the Durham
County credit union. It is important we see this as a way of fighting
poverty, particularly in areas like the north-east that still have very
high rates of unemployment and where people are losing lots of money
through welfare reforms and increasingly being driven to loan sharks
just to make ends meet. We must ensure that people see credit unions as
a viable way forward and give them the support they need to join
them.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14012038000227" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000227">9.5

key—and not just in schools. I was happy and proud to chair the

taken that report on board—it is a good start—but much

bristle when I am told on Twitter, “You’re a millionaire
Tory MP who doesn’t understand real life.” That happens
too often, but it was not the case with me; I struggled with high
levels of debt that I am still dealing with. I am lucky: I am a Member
of Parliament with a reasonable salary, and I can get to grips with it.

that, we will not get anywhere, whatever caps on lending, roll-over

their debt for very many years. This is largely because of the failure
to understand that while some debt is good—the Select Committee
talks about mortgages, home ownership and so forth, perhaps as
necessary evils—much debt is truly evil and life changing for so
many people. Until we crack that problem through education, I do not
think that any of the other solutions will do a great deal, welcome
though they are. Financial education in schools is a good start, but we
need to address the adult population if we want to make a real change.

phoning to be the most fruitful way of dealing with Wonga in the past.

different ways. In the food retail sector, for example, competition
drives down prices. Generally, people in areas of larger population
concentrations have access to other companies offering the same

the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) for promoting the

advertising and marketing as well as on access to real-time data on a
person’s suitability to a specific
loan<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:20:02"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Committee has also called upon the Financial Conduct Authority to
extend this practice of access to real-time data, concluding that if it
is not properly established by this July, the FCA should make it
obligatory for all regulated lenders seeking to provide payday loans or
similar financial services products. I hope that the Minister in
replying to this debate will say that is precisely what the
Government’s approach will
be<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:20:35"></hs_TimeCode>. On roll-over
loans, which can see an individual’s effective interest rate on
debt escalate rapidly, a limit of one roll-over for each payday loan
would prevent much unnecessary hardship for our constituents across the
country.</hs_Para>

this debate we have heard a great deal from Members, representing the
views of their constituents, on the purpose of markets. The views of my
constituents are that where markets do not serve the public interest
and serve only the purpose of maximising profits for a very few, we in
this House are right to call for them to be reset and rebalanced in
order to provide greater fairness for consumers, and in this case
greater justice for those on the lowest incomes. Sadly, however, the
Government’s recent proposals may be too late for many people in
Scotland who are facing escalating charges from using payday lenders.
It is clear that the cost of living crisis is biting hard in areas like
mine, where 16.5% of all people in work earn less than the living wage,
including nearly 3 in 10 of all part-time workers. The mean wage, at
just £342 a week, fell in cash terms by nearly 2% in the year to
last April, while at the same time prices were rising at a rate of
2.7%, meaning ordinary workers in my constituency were nearly 5% worse
off in the year to last April.</hs_Para>

have outpaced wages for such an extended period it is no wonder that
people have had no choice but to run down their savings or seek
recourse to credit to try to maintain what they can of their previous
living standards. This means that they are increasingly likely 
<?notus-xml column=118?>to seek payday lending from a proliferating range of
shop-front lenders in Springburn, Dennistoun and
other areas in my constituency, but they also seek lending online or
increasingly by following up adverts that they have watched on
television. My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:24:46"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East
(Gregg McClymont) was on to the very important point that the
under-employment in our economy, with nearly 1.5 million
people trapped in part-time work but seeking further hours, is driving
the sense of weak productivity, and the response to the growing crisis
people are facing with rising personal
debt<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:23:20"></hs_TimeCode> is a very
poor
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000162">Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>
has the highest volume of payday lending in the UK according to
research published by StepChange last November. Last June, some 10.3%
of total client debt in Scotland was the result of payday lending,
compared with 9.4% in England, 8.4% in Wales and 7% in Northern
Ireland. The research also shows huge increases in arrears in priority
debt areas such as rent, mortgage, gas and electricity, particularly in
the preceding six months. Moreover, payday borrowers in Scotland had
the highest value of council tax arrears in 2012—nearly double
the UK average at £1,312.</hs_Para>

presented its data in terms of the Scottish Parliament constituency
boundaries rather than UK Parliament boundaries, but the picture it
painted of the payday lending problem in the two constituencies which
make up Glasgow North East is equally depressing. In areas with some of
the highest material deprivation in Scotland, we see people falling
into severe payday debt interest rate problems, with 37% of people in
Maryhill and Springburn having council tax arrears averaging
£1,504, and half—50%—of all StepChange clients in
Maryhill and Springburn with rent arrears averaging £620. That
is the scale of the crisis that is being faced in some of the poorest
parts of this land.</hs_Para>

deal with the crisis, the Government should be encouraging the FCA to
use the powers it has at its disposal now to implement a total cap on
the costs of lending, to ensure that the consumer credit market serves
the consumer, rather than the other way round. We also know that our
credit unions are experiencing the sharp end of this cost of living
crisis. People are using them to save for the things they
need—such as a washing machine, when theirs breaks
down—when their pay and savings can no longer stretch to
them.</hs_Para>

credit union sector could be provided. I urge the Government to do all
they can to implement the Select Committee’s findings, but that

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:26:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

I endorse the Committee report’s recommendation for limits on
payday loan companies’ advertising. That should apply
particularly to advertising on children’s television channels.
There should also be health warnings in relation to advertising, as the
report suggests. Secondly, I endorse the report’s recommendation
about ring-fencing the levy that is to be placed on payday lenders, in
order to fund debt charities. Those charities do excellent work, and I
welcome any measure that would ensure that the payday lenders funded
them.</hs_Para>

third point relates to payday lenders on the high street. There is no
doubt in my mind that there are far too many of them, and better
regulation will be critical in that regard. There are 10 payday lenders
on Rochdale’s main shopping street alone. Their presence creates
difficulties for the regeneration of our high streets, and I endorse
Labour’s proposals to change the use classes available to local
authorities in order to limit the number of payday lenders on high
streets. It has already been mentioned that local authorities could do
more to help credit unions to gain a greater presence on the high
street. I supported the Manchester credit union in setting up a pop-up
shop in Rochdale for three months, which was extremely popular. Local
authorities could do more, not least by implementing a 100% business
rate waiver for credit unions to enable them to have a
greater presence.</hs_Para>

I am on that point, various alternatives to payday lenders have been
discussed today. The directly elected mayor of Salford is proposing to
establish the bank of Salford, which would see the local authority
getting directly involved in providing an alternative to payday
lenders. I thoroughly endorse that proposal, and I will be interested
to see how it develops.</hs_Para>

conscious that there has been a lot of cross-party consensus in this
debate, and I do not want to make anybody’s chips soggy by
moving on to something more contentious, but I want to make an
important point about the Government’s effect on the
discretionary social fund. It used to be administered by the Department
for Work and Pensions, but from last April the Government passed it
down to local authorities to manage. There has been variable
performance by local authorities in how effective they have been in
getting that money to people in desperate straits. So the Government,
first, reduced the social fund budget and then passed the
responsibility to local authorities, and we heard just before Christmas
that they intend to scrap it completely from 2015. It appears that they
would rather the private sector, through payday loan companies, met
this need. We should remember that this crisis fund has been a safety
net for people at a critical time, and the Government are now
proposing, in effect, to privatise it, because they want payday lenders
to step into the breach to meet that need. That is wholly unacceptable,
and people will reach their own conclusion as to why the Government are
so enthusiastic about payday loan companies providing this safety net
instead of the Government. The Government should remain the lender of
last resort and provide a safety net when people are really in crisis.
At that point, I will leave the Floor open to

Blomfield</B> (Sheffield Central) (Lab):</Member> On this occasion, it
is a pleasure to be called at the end of the debate, Mr Speaker,
because it provides me with an opportunity to reflect on the
contributions, where two things have stood out. The first is the deep
concern on the issue and the positive points that have been made about
the Financial Conduct Authority and its proposals. The second is the
unanimity across the House that the FCA is moving in the right
direction, but not going far enough. After it launched its proposals in
October, Members from every party represented in this House came
together to launch the “Charter to Stop the Payday Loan
Rip-off”, not only outlining a holistic intervention on how we
could regulate the sector, but critiquing the FCA proposals. That has
subsequently been backed by civil organisations ranging from Unite to
the Women’s Institute, and by councils of all political
persuasions, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:32:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) pointed out. It is also supported
by every major debt advice and consumer organisation.</hs_Para>

have cited shocking statistics and research to back the case for
further action, but I thought I would share the case of one Sheffield
woman and ask how she would be helped by the FCA proposals? She has
asked to be kept anonymous so let us call her Susan, and her case is
all too typical. She was struggling to keep up with bills and to make
ends meet, she took out a payday loan to help tide her over but still
found that she was short at the end of the month. By rolling over the
initial loan and taking out new ones to pay off that debt, she found
herself in a spiral of increasing debt, with three payday loans, costly
default fees and mounting interest.</hs_Para>

first question is: would the FCA proposals on advertising have
protected Susan? She took out that payday loan because of the
advertising she had seen. Too often, such advertising makes borrowing
look easy and stress free.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:33:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage) made the point that the FCA is focusing
on tackling misleading advertising, but we should be focusing on
tackling irresponsible advertising. We have all seen “Wonga: the
movie”, which illustrates the problem of advertising that makes
loans seem aspirational and life-improving, whereas payday loans are in
fact the worst form of credit anybody could take out. So Susan would
have been failed by the proposals on advertising.</hs_Para>

second question is: what about roll-overs? Once Susan had taken out her
first payday loan, why was she encouraged to keep rolling it over? How
could she have taken out two further payday loans when she was clearly
having difficulty repaying the first one? The FCA’s proposal to
limit the number of roll-overs to two is a step in the right direction,
but the Select Committee is right to say that there should be a limit
of one. Is the need to roll over more than once not a sign that the
borrower is in
trouble<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:34:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000175">Similarly,
we must look at repackaging loans and the problem of multiple loans. On
the issue of multiple loans that pushed Susan into the spiral of debt,
I recall that in a debate on 11 December on the Financial Services
(Banking Reform) Act 2013, there was great agreement across the House
on the need for real-time data to prevent irresponsible lending. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:35:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue) pointed out, Callcredit,
with great support from Wonga and  
<?notus-xml column=121?>the Consumer Finance Association, announced the establishment of some
data sharing. However, that scheme will not stop irresponsible multiple
lending.</hs_Para>

us consider these questions. Are all lenders signed up to this data
sharing? If not, and Susan went to one that was not, they would not
know that she was struggling to pay back her initial loan. Will the
scheme identify lenders who are breaching FCA rules by, for example,
rolling over loans too many times, and report them to the FCA? If not,
Susan’s loans could be rolled over, just as now, with the FCA
left to play catch-up once it has received its six-monthly data report
from lenders<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:36:17"></hs_TimeCode>.
Will it establish a benchmark of affordability and assess whether that
is being met by lenders? If it is not, will it report those lenders to
the FCA? If it does not do that, Susan will still be trapped by
unaffordable loans. The answer to each of those questions is no, so we
still need the FCA to establish a database, require all lenders to use
it, and use the data to enforce its rules. The case for that database
is as strong now as it ever was, and I hope that the Minister and the
FCA will pay heed to it.</hs_Para>

is also the issue of the continuous payment authorities. I welcome the
fact that the FCA is suggesting that CPA administration be limited to
two unsuccessful attempts, but it does not go far enough. It still
provides lenders with the opportunity for a strategic intervention into
somebody’s account to drain them of all their resources at a
critical point in the month when they need that money for rent and

provide three days’ notice of using a CPA, and yet, assessment
of the sector by Citizens Advice suggested that 60% were not complying

a very thoughtful and interesting debate this evening, with 17 speakers

a consensus on a way forward, although, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:39:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for East Lothian (Fiona O'Donnell) pointed out, the slight
exception might be
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:40:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:40:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Bromwich West (Mr Bailey), the Chair of the Select
Committee on Business, Innovation and Skills. I know that we have had a
number of debates on the issue and I wondered whether we would be able
to reach consensus on the report this afternoon. That has happened and,
as a number of hon. Members have said, this is an important time for
such a debate, not least because the FCA is considering the responses
to the consultation and will be publishing the rules shortly. It is
also debt awareness week. I always feel that we should be concerned by
debt awareness week—it is good for us and for the organisations
that support people as it focuses our attention, but for many people
the harsh reality of debt is something of which they are aware not just
for one week of the year but every single day.</hs_Para>

have heard once again this evening examples of the cases with which we
are all only too familiar that involve people in our constituencies.
The Chair of the Select Committee highlighted a number of issues with
advertising. He put it very powerfully when he talked about the
suggestion that there could be a one-minute verification to decide
whether someone could access such a loan. That highlighted why we need
action on advertising.</hs_Para>

West<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:42:37"></hs_TimeCode> also
highlighted the impact of television advertising on children and young
people aged 12 to 15. I have raised concerns about the issue in a
previous debate, and about how advertising normalises payday loans and
such borrowing. Someone might not normally consider such an option, but
it can be instant and they can do it without thinking.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:42:20"></hs_TimeCode>I was also
concerned to hear the story from a teacher about children’s
awareness of the payday loan sector as one way of getting the things

the need for the Advertising Standards Authority to work with the

work on the matter and agree on how to take things forward, that would

and<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:43:16"></hs_TimeCode> for Glasgow
North East (Mr Bain) raised some of the particular concerns
of the city of Glasgow. Let me take this opportunity to pay tribute to
the new scheme introduced by Glasgow city council whereby pupils going
to secondary school for the first 
<?notus-xml column=123?>time will be given the opportunity to have a credit union account, with
£10 put into each account. That is one way of providing
financial education while working creatively with the credit union

various evidence was given from the CAB and StepChange about the level
of debt. My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:44:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue) raised concerns that
she has pursued for a long time now about the database and access to
real-time information. A number of hon. Members talked about the
Callcredit announcement and questioned whether it went far enough, as
it does not necessarily provide real-time information on how decisions
are made. That must be considered in more detail because, essentially,
it is no good having information if it is not up to date.</hs_Para>

we have heard, indebtedness is not a new issue. As a former social
worker, I well remember spending a lot of time trying to work with
families who had to borrow money to pay for the basic necessities of
life, without understanding the ongoing costs and how they would pay
the money back. Of course, access to online systems and the
“press the button, do it now” approach of the payday loan
companies make it even easier to borrow now than in the days when the
payday lenders of the time went around the doors and persuaded people
to take out
loans<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:45:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000190">We
heard some interesting comparisons with work that has been done in the
US, Canada and Australia, particularly on roll-overs, and some good
questions have been asked. For example, if someone cannot deal with one
roll-over debt, why on earth would we want to let them have a second
roll-over debt without that being challenged? We have heard concerns
about the fact that payday originally meant payday. Of course, now it
does not always relate only to people who are in work; many people on
benefits and very low fixed incomes are also encouraged to take out
these loans.</hs_Para>

many hon. Members will be aware, thanks to the changes made by the
Government, the Financial Conduct Authority will take on new consumer
credit responsibilities from the Office of Fair Trading in April. The
OFT has done a good job with its powers and resources. However, the FCA
will have far stronger powers than the OFT. It will be a regulator with
teeth. It will have the power to set its own rules, rather than
having to wait for the Government to pass legislation each time a new
problem arises. That will put it in a stronger position to keep pace
with a fast-moving
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000200">Furthermore,
for the first time those rules will be binding on lenders. The FCA will
have far stronger powers to enforce breaches of its rules and
standards. For example, currently the OFT can fine up to a maximum of
only £50,000, whereas there is no ceiling on FCA fines. For the
first time the regulator will have powers to award redress to wronged
borrowers. The FCA will thoroughly assess every single lender over the
next two years. Those that are not fit to trade will be ejected from
the market. It will approve key executives to ensure that they are
personally accountable for the way their firms operate. In short, we
are moving from PC Plod to Sherlock

is encouraging to see that the FCA is already flexing its regulatory
muscle. It set out proposed new rules in October, as we have heard
today, including: a cap on roll-overs; curbs on the use of continuous

absolute priority in this area is to ensure that the FCA can clamp down
quickly on the causes of harm in the payday lending market,
particularly the unfair and extortionate cost of borrowing from certain
payday lenders and the spiralling costs faced by those struggling to
repay. We took the opportunity in the Financial Services (Banking
Reform) Act 2013 to give the FCA a clear mandate, and indeed a duty, to
put a cap on the cost of payday loans by the beginning of next year,
which means that it will not have to spend precious time making the
case for a cap and can instead focus on the best way of implementing a
cap and protecting consumers from those unfair and damaging
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000203">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>
FCA is already on the case on that front, and we should see rules to
implement a cap in place this year. It will be not just an interest
rate cap, but a cap on all fees and charges associated with a payday
loan, including default charges and roll-overs, which many hon. Members
made the case for today. The total cost cap will work alongside the
regulatory interventions already proposed by the FCA to tackle
decisively the causes of consumer harm in the payday lending
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000204">I
will endeavour now to cover some of the important points raised in the

Government believe that lenders must make proper assessments of an
individual’s<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>
ability to repay before they lend and that that should be based on
accurate, timely and comprehensive information. The FCA is looking at
real-time data sharing as an absolute priority and has committed to
bringing about a real improvement in the way data are shared, including
looking at the role of credit reference agencies and at international
examples of data-sharing systems.</hs_Para>

FCA has warned the industry that it must improve the way data sharing
works, including how quickly lending data are made available. A number
of Members referred to last week’s announcement by Callcredit
that it will introduce real-time data sharing from this April, which I
think is a welcome step. However, if the industry fails to improve
properly, the FCA has been absolutely clear that it will not hesitate
to act. The Government wholeheartedly endorse both that message to the
industry and the regulator’s commitment to
action<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:53:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012038000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0003.htm#14012038000206">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:53:56"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for West Bromwich West and several others rightly mentioned
advertising, particularly advertising aimed at children. The idea that
children might see payday loan adverts and then put pressure on parents
to take out loans is very concerning. The Broadcast Committee of
Advertising Practice, the body that writes the broadcast advertising
code, is considering the extent to which payday loan advertising
features on children’s TV and whether there are any implications
for the regulation of the sector. However, it is important to note that
recent Ofcom research found that payday loan adverts make up just over
0.5% of TV ads seen by children aged between 4 and
15.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T21:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> Many payday
loan firms, including Wonga and those that are members of the Consumer
Finance Association, have stated that they do not advertise on
children’s TV. It is essential that all payday loan advertising
is responsible and is not designed to target children. That is why
payday loan adverts are subject to the Advertising Standards
Authority’s strict content rules. I hope that I will reassure
hon. Members when I say that the ASA will not hesitate to ban
irresponsible adverts. In fact, it has a strong track 
<?notus-xml column=126?>record of doing so, including, recently, Wonga and Cash On Go adverts. I
hope that I will provide further reassurance by saying that the FCA is

it will transpose much of the OFT’s affordability guidance

increasing the interest rate that credit unions can charge, as we found
that many—indeed, almost all—were making losses, and this
was clearly not sustainable. The interest rate was therefore increased
from 2% to 3% per month. We also have the credit union expansion

modernise the sector. I want to do more for it, and the Government are

connections between changes to welfare, food insecurity, fuel poverty
and prepayment meters. It is not an uncommon experience for food banks
to find that people with prepayment meters who use the services of food
banks have no energy to heat the food they receive. Households across
the UK have seen energy bills soar. Last year, the big six announced
increases of from 8% to 10%, with the average dual fuel bill now
costing households £1,385. Many in my constituency without
access to gas miss out on that dual fuel
discount.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000009">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>

is difficult for someone who inherits a prepayment meter to return to
the credit method of securing an energy supply. Will the Minister tell
the House whether he has any plans to act on that? During the last
debate, I had a text from my son Michael to tell me that when he
inherited a prepayment meter in the last property he rented in
Newcastle, the supplier refused to remove it and to put him on the
credit method, because of the postcode where he lived. I would hate to

who are moved on to PPMs are usually put on their supplier’s
standard prepayment variable tariff and are therefore unable to protect

Stratford-upon-Avon’s citizens advice bureau, “Left out

said that the standard tariff is not always the cheapest and so
customers who are already struggling to keep up with payments on their
supplier’s cheapest tariff—perhaps an online tariff paid
by direct debit—are moved to a more expensive one. Those
customers are unable to access the best deals and discounts on the
market or to
lock<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:09:53"></hs_TimeCode> into

should have the same opportunities as other consumers to switch
suppliers, and to have access to fixed tariffs, better and accurate
information about the way their tariff works, and fair arrangements for
repaying debt. The energy market as it stands does not serve the needs
of consumers, and that is particularly true of vulnerable consumers and
PPM users. The Government can and should do more. I hope that in the
time available, the Minister will answer the questions I have raised,
and I look forward to his
response.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_20_PT_1/84C7A178AD8781EDA97741703FB7339474902850" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="20 January 2014">Monday

Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change
(Gregory Barker):</Member></B> I congratulate the hon. Member for East
Lothian (Fiona O’Donnell) on an excellent maiden Adjournment
debate—I believe she said it is the first time she has secured
one—and may I say upfront that she raised some sensible and
pertinent points that I take very seriously? I doubt that I will be
able to answer all the points she has
raised—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> The hon. Lady asks
whether I will write to her. She has made a serious and sensible speech
tonight, and I would be happy to go further than simply writing to her.
If she would like to take up my invitation to come and meet me and my
officials, I will happily consider in more detail, face to face, the
questions that she has raised. Not all her questions have convenient,
pat answers. They bear further analysis, and she would be right to
scrutinise further the answers she gets. There is undoubtedly a lot
more to do on the problem—I am not complacent for a
moment—but the fact is that we have finite resource to address
it. We have made progress in recent years, but not nearly enough to be
in any way confident that the problem is being
defeated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000028">We
are heading in the right direction and determined to do more, but, as
the hon. Lady says, unacceptably high numbers of people are living in
cold, damp and unhealthy conditions. That is why, for starters, the
Government have introduced a new and more accurate measure of fuel
poverty, and why, for the first time in many years, we will publish a
fuel poverty strategy. That will happen later in the year. The strategy
will be deliverable but, in addition, the public, the Opposition and
parliamentarians from both sides of the House can hold the Government
to account on
delivery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000029">We
continue to deliver the policies that we believe will make a difference
in tackling fuel poverty this winter. The energy company obligation,
which runs alongside the green deal, ensures that help goes to
low-income and vulnerable households to help them to heat their homes
and stay warm and healthy. New statistics will, I believe, be published
tomorrow, but up to the end of October 2013 more than a quarter of a
million measures were installed for people on low incomes, equating to
around 220,000
households.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000030">Colleagues
will be aware of the proposed changes announced last year to the energy
company obligation. They will result in savings of £30 to
£35 in household 
<?notus-xml column=132?>bills on average in 2014. Those savings are part of a wider package of
changes to green levies that is designed to reduce the cost of
household bills by, on average, £50 a year. That will be
welcomed by everyone, but particularly by the fuel poor, who must still
pay those
charges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000031">In
respect of low-income and vulnerable households, I can assure the hon.
Lady that the changes will not lead to any reduction in the intended
level of support. Indeed, we want to provide longer-term certainty, so
our consultation on the ECO changes will propose setting new targets
for 2017, ensuring that the current annual scale of activity and
ambition continues. In addition, the Government will use the
consultation to come forward with further improvements to our fuel
poverty schemes, with the aim of ensuring that greater help is made
available to those fuel-poor households who are off the gas grid and
living in rural

Barker:</Member></B> No Government to date have come up with a totally
satisfactory answer to the self-disconnection question, and it is a
problem. However, it is a relatively small part of the overall fuel
poverty
picture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000035">Let
me clarify a point on fuel poverty and pre-payment meters. The hon.
Lady quoted me accurately, but my point was that the percentage of
pre-payment customers in fuel poverty—the latest year for which
we have audited figures is, I am afraid, 2011—has continued to
come down. In fact, fewer than one in five customers with a prepayment
meter are defined as fuel poor. Not all those who have prepayment
meters are fuel poor, and it is by no means true that the fuel poor all
have prepayment meters—as I say, only about one in five do. It
is not that I was trying to deny a link between the
two—absolutely not. Of course there is a link. What I was
pointing to is a larger problem. Quite often in this House, Members
have assumed that by attacking the prepayment issue, we were really
putting one’s hands around the fuel poverty issue.
Unfortunately, it is only one of several concentric circles as far as
fuel poverty is concerned. The hon. Lady is absolutely right to focus
on prepayment customers as being vulnerable and worthy of further
attention and support, but it is not correct to say that in so doing
she is tackling the majority of fuel poor customers. I am glad to have
cleared that up.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1401214000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000036"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:21:15"></hs_TimeCode>In
addition to the energy company obligation, the warm home discount
scheme requires more than 250,000 domestic customers to receive a
discount on electricity bills. Typically, that is aimed at low-income
and vulnerable customers. Some 2 million households this year will
receive help under the warm home discount, including well over 1
million of the poorest pensioners who, in addition to the winter fuel
allowance, will receive £135 off their electricity
bills. The Government have also committed to extending the warm home
discount in 2015-16, with an increased spend of £320 million. 
<?notus-xml column=133?>More than 1.16 million low-income households will receive that payment,
and will do so, I am glad to say, without having to take any action.
This is the result of data-matching undertaken by the Government and
the seven largest energy suppliers. I am sure that the hon. Lady knows
that accurately pinpointing who the fuel poor are and where they are
has been a great stumbling block for this Government and previous
Governments. We are making progress. Furthermore, the Department for
Work and Pensions provides winter fuel payments and cold weather
payments to help vulnerable
households<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:22:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000037">Finally,
in 2013 the Government announced the creation of the Big Energy Saving
Network. The network was established alongside existing advice to
deliver a comprehensive package of advice and support, particularly to
vulnerable customers, and has focused on helping them to reduce their
energy costs through assisted action on tariffs, switching and take-up
of energy efficiency offers. With total funding of £900,000, the
network is supporting activity for more than 150 organisations. Some
500 volunteers from third sector organisations and community groups
have been trained to provide advice and help consumers to take
action<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:23:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000038">I
understand fully the point the hon. Lady made regarding manuals for
prepayment meters, but for many customers a manual can often be
daunting. I think the most effective thing is for one of the many
volunteers, or people from the excellent organisations that are part of
the Big Energy Saving Network, to be on hand to give helpful and
supportive in-person advice on prepayment
meters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:24:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401214000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/debtext/140120-0004.htm#1401214000039">Of
households that were fuel poor in England in 2011, approximately 25%
paid for their electricity and 20% paid for their gas through
prepayment meters. That compares to 13% and 10% among non-fuel poor
households. Clearly, prepayment is more common among poorer households,
but the relationship is far from absolute. They can also be a valuable
alternative to disconnection for non-payment of bills. In 2010,
Consumer Futures found that more than one third of consumers expressed
a preference for prepayment meters, citing the security and peace of
mind that comes from knowing they will not receive an unexpectedly
large bill. Often, many of the poorest customers worry not just about
the bill but about unexpected changes in it, and many value the
certainty that prepayment meters bring.</hs_Para>

meters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:29:26"></hs_TimeCode> are not
ideal, however, and have many drawbacks. Typically, they have been one
of the most expensive payment methods, and when exchanging one for a
credit meter, many suppliers have charged a fee or requested security
deposits. As the hon. Lady said,
if<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:29:49"></hs_TimeCode> a customer
cannot afford to top up their prepayment meter, they may
self-disconnect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:25:51"></hs_TimeCode>.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:29:49"></hs_TimeCode> is a
difficult area, with many other factors that can confuse the
figures—second homes, holiday homes and so on—but we are
talking to suppliers to try and get a better grip on this important
group of customers. We take the issue seriously 
<?notus-xml column=134?>and are currently looking at some proposals that I and my officials
would be happy to talk through with the hon. Lady.</hs_Para>

these<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:29:49"></hs_TimeCode> issues
underline the importance of ensuring that prepayment meter customers
are not prevented from accessing the benefits of competition or
innovation in the market. Recently, several changes have improved the
experience of prepayment meter users. Since 2010, most suppliers have
chosen to equalise their prepayment tariffs with standard credit
prices, while any remaining price differences from other suppliers are
likely to fade out with the roll-out of smart meters. Suppliers,
including some smaller providers, have also been competing hard for
customers who pay by prepayment meter. Recent innovations include
offering to change for free, scrapping security deposits and replacing
meters with smart
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:27:27"></hs_TimeCode>prepayment
meters—that is obviously not universal among suppliers, but it
is an encouraging trend in the market.</hs_Para>

now offer more ways to top up a meter, such as paying over the phone,
online or through an ATM, showing that the prepayment market is far
from uniform. There are welcome changes taking place. Prepayment
consumers can still access considerable price savings and other
benefits by comparing the market for the best deals, and smart metering
has the potential to bring further benefits to prepayment customers.
Every smart meter will have the functionality to operate in either
prepayment or credit mode, so will enable easy switching between the
two payment methods as customers’ circumstances
change.</hs_Para>

is vital that suppliers take proactive steps to protect their
prepayment customers, particularly the most vulnerable. They are
currently obligated under their licence to take account of a
customer’s ability to repay when setting a repayment schedule,
and there is evidence to suggest that they are fulfilling this
obligation. Average weekly debt repayment rates for prepayment
customers have declined. In quarter 4, they were £6.94 for gas
and £6.31 for electricity. This compares to £7.87 and
£8.31 respectively in 2010. Furthermore, the majority of
indebted customers are on standard credit, not prepayment meters, and
repay through a variety of means, suggesting that repayment is tailored
to the individual
customer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-20T22:29:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Moreover, all suppliers now provide emergency credit on prepayment
meters.</hs_Para>

Territories on beneficial ownership. The issue was discussed at the
Joint Ministerial Council on 26 November where I explained why the UK
firmly believes that a public registry of company beneficial ownership
provides the best outcome for sound corporate behaviour; more effective
law and tax enforcement; and helping authorities prevent misuse of
companies for illicit purposes. We will continue to work with them as
we implement our action plans and further develop policy.</hs_Para>

Baker</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 13 January 2014]:</I> The Home
Office has established a National Group to tackle sexual violence
against children and vulnerable people. This brings together agencies
including the Crown Prosecution Service, the police and key
organisations such as the National Society for the Prevention of
Cruelty to Children, Rape Crisis and Barnardo’s to better
identify those who are at risk and to urgently address missed
opportunities by agencies to protect the most vulnerable. The National
Group’s first progress report and action plan was published in
July 2013 and can be found at the following

addition, specific work is being undertaken to support local areas to
tackle sexual exploitation. The National Group has overseen the
publication of an early findings report for local areas, such as
Peterborough, to consider key themes and barriers encountered in
delivering multi-agency working and information sharing models. These
approaches bring together key agencies to provide early intervention to
combat a range of

of regional Gross Value Added (GVA), which is a very similar economic
concept to GDP. The main difference is that GVA is measured at current

unit of goods or services excluding any taxes less subsidies on
products. GDP is measured at market prices which reflect the price paid
by the purchaser and therefore includes the effect of taxes and

for the provision of rehabilitation: the clinical treatment of medical
conditions arising from illness, wounding or injury. Once personnel
seriously injured in operational theatre are sufficiently healed, most
start a rehabilitation programme at the Defence Medical Rehabilitation
Centre (DMRC) at Headley Court. When discharged from the DMRC, other
rehabilitation might then be provided to personnel at one of the 13 DMS

families positive behaviour scores increased significantly after one
year of Change4Life support. The Health England/Matrix Knowledge Group

Government has made clear that further precautionary measures will be
introduced on fixed odds betting terminals if the industry fails to
implement its player protection measures, if it does not share data for
independent research, or if the balance of evidence indicates that
further action is required. The new industry-led player protection
measures are being introduced from 1 March and will provide new
controls on gaming machines, allow players to set voluntary limits on
time and spend within the limits of existing
regulations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012034001735" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140120/text/140120w0003.htm#14012034001735">The

and other measures that build on them as soon as possible. The
Government has demanded the industry develops a tangible plan to better

to for the switch to happen, and there is no need for consumers to
contact their existing provider (so called ‘gaining-provider

The revised NMW naming and shaming scheme which came into effect on 1
October 2013 made it easier to name employers that break national
minimum wage law. By naming and shaming employers, it is hoped that bad
publicity will be an additional deterrent to employers who would
otherwise be tempted not to pay the NMW. We anticipate naming employers
very soon. The Government also announced that we will be increasing the
NMW financial penalty in February 2014 subject to regulations receiving
