Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr George Osborne):</Member></B> The most
important thing that we can do to support women in business is
supporting the economy to grow. Today’s gross domestic product
figures show that our economy grew by 0.7% in the last quarter,
bringing four-quarter growth up to 2.8%. I am sure that that news will
be welcome across the House. These numbers are a boost for the economic
security of hard-working people. Growth is broadly based, with
manufacturing growing fastest of all. It is more evidence that our
long-term economic plan is working, but the job is not done, and it is
clear that the biggest risk now to the recovery would be to abandon the
plan that is delivering jobs and a brighter economic

tax cut was this Parliament: it was for working people through our

it is clear that the shadow Chancellor has learned absolutely nothing
from the economic mess he brought upon this country. He said that
Labour should have spent more money in the boom; he has set out fiscal
plans that allow billions more of borrowing; and on the top rate of
tax, he announced a plan that was attacked by Labour Ministers whom he
served with in government, by the people who lent the Labour party
money and by credible business people across the country—and his
costings were shot down by the Institute for Fiscal Studies last night.

personally dislike the industry but I am not seeking to ban the clubs.
I just want to create greater recognition of what their presence can do

Licensing Act 2003 aimed to consolidate the licensing procedure for
different types of venue. That was a noble aim, but it had the
unintended consequence of making it much easier to open lap-dancing
clubs, and they started to mushroom in number as a result. Many people
felt uncomfortable at this rapid increase and felt that the licensing
regime was not adequately reflecting the concerns of local
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012854000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012854000202">A

the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods) and Lynda
Waltho, the former MP for Stourbridge, campaigned in Parliament for the
changes, and were backed up by excellent work from both Object and the
Fawcett Society. The previous Labour Government listened to them and
responded by introducing a special licensing category for sexual
entertainment venues, which allowed councils to implement specific
licensing conditions on lap-dancing clubs. They were adopted powers,
which means that there was no requirement on local authorities to use
them. However, if councils did choose to use them, they had a range of
measures open to them, including governing the areas in which such
clubs could open, taking into account their proximity to residential
areas, schools or places of worship; the hours in which they could
open; what type of advertising they could conduct; and what they could
show on the outside of the premises. The change in the law also gave
councils the ability to cap the overall number of venues if they so
wished<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:40:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012854000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012854000203">My

the powers have been adopted, we see communities again having their say

Haringey was a pioneer in adopting these powers and setting a
borough-wide limit of zero clubs. I pay particular tribute to 
<?notus-xml column=767?>councillor Nilgun Canver for trailblazing the use of such powers. Other
cities have also begun to adopt them. Swansea, for example, adopted a

all areas to make better use of the powers. I want to spread good
practice and stop the postcode lottery. This is about including local
communities at an early stage of the licensing process and giving
locals a voice about whether or not they want these types of

asked of all communities and that everyone should feel able to

amendment to the law would assist local licensing committees. I want to
contrast licensing authorities that give communities a strong voice
over these establishments and have a clear policy with licensing
decisions that are taken on an individual basis, which is still a
proper and legal way of doing things. Let us take, for example, a local
authority that has chosen to adopt the sexual entertainment venue
powers, but has not issued a specific licensing statement. When that
local authority then receives an application, it considers it on an
individual basis. If communities want to assert themselves, individuals
have to make specific objections. They have to show how that club will
impact on their lives, and they need to relate it to vague licensing
statements<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:43:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012854000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012854000207">It
is often difficult for a community collectively to argue about what
such a venue means for their area or community. Indeed, considering
such general concerns may render the authorities’ decision open
to legal challenge, which can be expensive and off-putting. Adopting a
clear licensing statement and a cap on the number of such venues
negates the risk of a court challenge and both simplifies the process
and ensures that the wider community is able to be clear and supported

am delighted to introduce this important Bill. It has been widely
consulted on outside and inside the House and our understanding is that

of the Bill is our determination
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:46:05"></hs_TimeCode>to build and
enhance a climate of trust in which UK business operates, restoring
trust, which is often needed, in markets and market transactions. The
consumer law reforms that we are discussing lie at the heart of a
crusade towards trusted business and trusted capitalism. We see them as
part of the overarching overhaul of UK competition and consumer
legislation that we have been undertaking over the past four
years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:46:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012854000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012854000220">Essentially,
the coin has two sides: competition policy and consumer protection. Let
me start with the competition reforms. A competition regime is
essential to encourage efficient and innovative businesses, allowing
the best to grow and enter new markets, driving investment in new and
better products, and pushing prices down and quality up. That is good
for growth and good for consumers. That is why earlier in the Session
we introduced reforms of competition policy and the new Competition and
Markets Authority, which will come into effect in April with strong new
powers to take robust decisions more quickly. Changes we have made to
the criminal cartel offence will enable the CMA to address the
pernicious influence of
cartels<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012854000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012854000221">What
we are doing in the UK is mirrored in what is happening in the European
Union. There are people who think that the European Commission is
entirely about regulation, but it does important work in opening up
markets, deregulating and increasing competition. It is worth citing
several examples. Last year, fines of almost €1.5 billion were
imposed on companies engaged in fixing the price of TV and computer
monitor tubes and fines of €1.7 billion were imposed on
companies that had established a cartel to fix interest rate
derivatives. The European Commission is conducting a competition
investigation into Google’s business practices. Among other
things, the Commission is considering how Google uses third-party
content without consent and how it structures its search
results<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
domestic Consumer Rights Bill will enable us to strengthen that
framework by making it easier for individuals and businesses to seek
redress through private actions where they have been harmed by
anti-competitive behaviour. That is covered in one of the
clauses.</hs_Para>

also relies on consumer law and the framework of protection for
individuals who suffer from unfair business behaviour. That is why we
are 
<?notus-xml column=769?>reforming the landscape of consumer bodies funded by Government to
improve consumer protection and give greater
clarity about where consumers need to turn for help and advice. I hope

cannot expect consumers to be confident when they do not understand
their rights or when they find it hard to know what they are entitled
to if something goes wrong. Unclear rights and remedies mean that
businesses can also find it costly to understand their
responsibilities. We seek to address those concerns. We have set out in
one place key consumer rights and what consumers are entitled to. The
measure covers goods, services and, for the first time, digital content

much of the law pertaining to this area is 30 to 40 years old. We have
tackled the complexity that makes compliance burdensome for companies
and confusing for consumers by setting out in one place the standards
that have to be met. For example, we have defined a 30-day period
within which goods have to be inspected. We have made it clear that,
where consumers have a faulty item repaired or replaced, that repair or
replacement must remedy the problem the first time round, or they can
insist on some money
back<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:52:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Survey

have introduced a new category of digital content with a set of quality

part of the Bill deals with consumer protection in relation to
services. We know from reviews by the Law Commission that the law
governing the provision of services is difficult to understand and,
when things go wrong, there is no statutory redress regime to put them
right. However, we are talking about 75% of the British economy. That
is why the Bill provides new statutory rights and introduces new
statutory remedies when things go wrong. There is a great deal of
debate about the specifics: the Business, Innovation and Skills
Committee has suggested a statutory quality right, which we looked at,
but we found it too complex. We considered the evidence from Australia,
and we are certainly happy to engage in further debate on the
matter.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_28_PT_1/9F780813DBE54E72016FCC0F0F7928BDBFB98EF4" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 January 2014">Tuesday

an example of how the new rights would apply, we can look at the case
of cowboy builders. Almost all of us have dealt with such cases in our
constituencies, and they cause particular anger. A cowboy builder is
doing domestic work and altering someone’s bathroom. They start
the work, but there are problems, with debris strewn around the house
and disruptions to the water supply. Currently, it is unclear what the
householder is entitled to, and a lot of frustration flows from that.
Under the Bill, there will be a statutory right to ask for a poorly
performed service to be redone if possible. If it cannot be redone
within a reasonable time or without significant inconvenience there is
a right to money back. I stress the example of cowboy builders, as I
think that the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy), who may well want to
discuss this, issued a press release this morning in which she singled
out cowboy builders and said that there was no reference to them in the
Bill. In fact, these measures will improve significantly consumer
protection in that area.</hs_Para>

area in which the Bill introduces reform is unfair contract
terms—essentially the small-print problem. Legal ambiguity
arises from recent landmark court 
<?notus-xml column=771?>cases—the so-called banks case in particular—and our
reforms endeavour to protect consumers from the small print while
making it easier for businesses to understand how they can prevent
contract terms from being challenged in court. In a typical example,
someone joins a gym in January with a lot of enthusiasm, but they have
not read or fully understood the details of the small print. When they
cancel the contract in March, as many people do—I seem to
remember cancelling my gym contract rather earlier in the
year—they have to pay for a full year’s membership.
Currently, it is not clear whether a court would find that unfair.
Under our proposals, it is clear: a court can find it unfair, and if it
is unfair the consumer is not bound by
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T12:57:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012859000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012859000003">The
reforms endeavour to make clear what the courts can and cannot consider
in assessing fairness. In particular, we make it a key test that price
and subject matter in a contract need to be transparent and

“prominent”—to ensure that it cannot be challenged

important. It is not a statutory obligation, and councils vary in their

enforcement action will be eventually taken. At national level, as the
hon. Gentleman will know, we put £13 million a year into the
National Trading Standards Board, which provides training support, for
example, and helps trading standards authorities to co-ordinate

consumer law enforcement powers establish a primary authority to
improve co-ordination. The enhanced consumer measures relate to the law

enforcement. At the moment, consumers rarely get their money back when
a business breaks consumer law. That is partly because criminal courts
are reluctant to award consumers redress and enforcers are often unable
to seek redress in the civil courts. There is a common law remedy, but
it is often difficult to realise it. What then tends to happen is that

me talk about the provisions in the Bill that relate to competition law
and the role of private actions. Competition is good for growth and one
of the pillars of a vibrant economy, so a key part of the work is
tackling anti-competitive behaviour. The European Commission—I
quoted some examples a few moments ago—has estimated that
cartels can raise prices by between 20% and 35%. Despite the strong
competition framework that the Government are putting in place, the
Office of Fair Trading has shown that businesses believe that the
current regime for private actions is too slow and costly. As a result,
businesses and consumers rarely get redress when they have been harmed
by anti-competitive behaviour. In 10 years, there has been only one
collective action case in this country, and only one 10th of 1% of the
consumers who were eligible signed up to it.</hs_Para>

to strike a careful balance. We do not want an American-style system of
prodigious and constant litigation, which would be costly and benefit
only lawyers. None the less, we believe that there is some imbalance in
the current system that needs to be redressed. We will try to
discourage parties from engaging in costly court cases by encouraging
alternative dispute resolution. We propose reforming the Competition
Appeal Tribunal by introducing a fast-track regime so that small and
medium-sized companies can get quicker and cheaper

have had to take costly legal action in the High Court, possibly
bankrupting itself in the process—it is a small company up
against a big one. Under the Bill, the garage could take the case to
the Competition Appeal Tribunal, which could swiftly issue an
injunction resulting in the supplier having to restart its
supply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012859000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012859000035">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T13:17:08"></hs_TimeCode>

conclusion, the Bill represents a radical and far-reaching set of
reforms designed to streamline the law, making it clearer and more
accessible. It will enhance consumer rights and deregulate for
business. It will benefit consumers by reducing the time and cost of
finding out how to deal with problems. It will protect consumers from
the small print in contracts and increase the redress they get when
things go wrong. It will benefit businesses by reducing the need for
ongoing legal advice, and it will save legitimate businesses from
losses from anti-competitive practices.

the Secretary of State celebrates the idea that consumers have dipped
into savings that they hold for a rainy day, I have to tell him that he
is mistaken to presume that they have done so only for long-term
investments. His own Money Advice Service shows that a third of British
people have no money put aside for rainy days, due to the everyday
costs of living, and that those who have such savings have been forced
to dip into them to cover those costs, with three quarters of the
people surveyed having been hit by a bill that threw them off-budget in
the course of the past year. Indeed, a third of people in our country
who now have no savings at all have said that not having a high enough
income is the problem causing them not to save.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T13:25:56"></hs_TimeCode> agree that we
should be extremely worried about an economy in which, every day,

that when the Government are presented with an opportunity to do
something about that, they stand aside. They talk strongly about
national debt, but say nothing about personal
debt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012859000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012859000052">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T13:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>

personalisation in products, goods and services. However, in many
markets in Britain, people are paying over the odds for essential goods
and services because the barriers to entry into those markets have
created dominance for a small number of providers or because there is
outdated regulation. The existence of many companies does not always
mean that there will be competition either. The ability of small firms
to compete with larger providers is a key element of a free and

entrant has managed to challenge that dominance suggests that there are
significant barriers to newcomers that inhibit competition. That is
reflected in the prices that consumers pay. A lack of competition in
the retail market for energy has resulted in consumers paying
£3.6 million more than they need to every year. Switching levels
in that market are the lowest that they have been for years. The low
levels of switching mean that the big energy companies have a captured

a lack of competition is clearly causing problems for consumers. Not
every consumer in that market gets into financial difficulty, but
enough of them do because the way in which it operates causes huge
detriment to the consumer and huge problems for our economy. The
National Audit Office estimates that unscrupulous behaviour by firms in
that market costs consumers at least £450 million a year. The
lack of competition to provide services to the customers of those
companies, as well as a barrier to accessing alternative services being

raw deal that consumers get. The pricing power of big banks means that
they dominate the market in key products such as mortgages. Banks are
able to retain their dominance by making it hard for customers to move
their custom. Some 1.3 million people have switched their current
account in the past year, which is a churn rate of just 2% to 3%.
Studies show that a truly competitive industry would have a switching
rate nearer to 10%. It is not only in the dominance in the current
account market that we see problems. When banks are able to set their
own terms, they can set requirements such as those for buy-to-let
mortgages that force borrowers to offer only short-term tenancies,
which are causing problems in the housing

second question that I want to pose for the Bill is about the
importance of information flows, which is linked to free markets. What
are the Government doing in the Bill to address the information gaps
and asymmetries that enable consumer detriment? We know that data are
vital to ensuring that consumers may compare goods and services in
order to make their own choices. We know that a lack of information
helps providers to hide behind confusion and a lack of transparency.
The Government’s own research shows that if consumers knew more
about products, they would be able to gain £150 million to
£240 million a year. However, only 13% of those who use price
comparison sites get the lowest priced deal. The Government admit that
one reason for that is that people do not have accurate information
about their past usage and therefore find it difficult to predict
future
usage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012859000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012859000079">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T13:38:32"></hs_TimeCode>
are at the bottom of the European league for consumers being able to
switch and shop around to get the deals that they want. The contrast
with countries 
<?notus-xml column=783?>such as Australia is clear. Mass movement switching campaigns have led
to one in four Australian citizens being part of schemes that get them
better deals not just on energy, but on health insurance and financial
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T13:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012859000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0001.htm#14012859000080">Consumers
have legal rights to request access to personal data, but half the
respondents to Which? were not even aware of that right and very few
people have exercised it. I am sure that the Secretary of State will
point to the midata project, which is a voluntary scheme to give
consumers access to their energy, mobile and financial services data.
However, that scheme has struggled to have any impact for a simple and
obvious reason: companies have little incentive to release commercial
data that could convince a customer to go elsewhere. We welcome the
fact that the Government took an order-making power through the
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 to compel certain businesses
to release such data, but that affects only four core sectors and has
not yet been applied. It could be applied more widely if secondary
legislation was used. That is another missed opportunity in the Bill.

informationLet us revise the Bill to unlock the

Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr Denham) has
run a tireless campaign, for example, on the lack of clarity in
supermarket pricing. We have seen how some deals and special offers
mislead shoppers when clear information is not provided. There are
products that are more expensive than the original price when they are
in a multi-buy offer; products that have been at a sale price for
longer than the original price; and products whose prices are increased
immediately before they go on offer, to make the discount appear more
significant.</hs_Para>

complaints a month from people sent unsolicited text messages, usually
for debt or payment protection insurance claims. With 75% of landlines

the Bill does offer input is on contract terms. It sets minimum
standards that supplied goods must meet, sets out that they should be
fit for purpose and satisfactory, and provides a legal right to reject

consumers will ask whether that will deal with the real problems with

what our money will buy us. Prominent pricing is not the same as

Making that difficult is one thing that the companies in question do.
It is fair to ask how we can empower consumers, but it is also fair to
ask what we can do to ensure that someone knows precisely what they are
buying. That does not need to be an unreasonable requirement on terms

Bill also fails to address the problem of people paying for services
that they cannot get the details of. I beg the House’s
indulgence to mention a second case  in my constituency. At

their leases, on top of which they pay a premium for terrorism cover.
According to the freehold manager, that is on the basis that the plane
bomber lived in my constituency. Indeed, the freehold manager has sent
me newspaper coverage to justify that additional charge of £80 a
household to leaseholders in my community on top of their buildings
insurance. Yet my constituents cannot get the details of the policy
that they are paying for, because the insurer claims that its deal is
with the freehold manager, not with the leaseholders. It seems that

tries to bring secondary ticketing within the scope of the Bill. That

to drag all that in.</hs_Para>

Creasy:</Member></B> I think the hon. Lady does not quite recognise
that a contract involves both a vendor and a purchaser, and the terms
of a contract can apply to both. That is the point of the amendments we
will table. On secondary ticketing, for example—the Secretary of
State should be interested in this as the Member for
Twickenham—legislating to make the rugby world cup an event of
national significance would require tickets to be resold through
recognised ticket vendors at face value, as happened in 2012. It would
then be illegal to sell tickets through any other means. Indeed,
viagogo already has tickets on sale for that event at huge mark-ups,
and tickets do not even go on sale until the autumn. Some 2.3 million
tickets will be sold at between £7 and £15 for children,
with a top price of £700 for adults. That means that touts will
be able to cash in on those prices on top of that, and damage the
affordable ticketing policy of the organisers. Surely it cannot be
right for us not to include in the Bill a way of ensuring that if
someone wants to sell a ticket at a certain price, they
can.</hs_Para>

vividly why the Government believe there must always be winners and

get the framework right, it would cover a range of industries. My point
in describing the many different problems with current pricing and
contracts is that if we took a different—indeed,
stronger—approach to the laws on pricing and contract than that
currently in the Bill, we could deal with a range of detrimental
problems. Indeed, I would wager that if we get this right, two-thirds
of the casework that many of us see would disappear overnight. Surely
the merits of such a proposition alone would cause the hon. Gentleman
to reflect on whether we can make the Bill stronger, and therefore

about the lack of action on poor services, and I know she feels
passionately that in her constituency, where residents are not
receiving a mobile phone service they should be refunded. Despite
raising the issue for months, she must be frustrated because nothing
has happened, and I query whether her constituents are also frustrated.
Although she is in charge of the Bill, and therefore has an opportunity
to clarify when a refund for poor service would be due, the Bill will
do little to help that issue. We would all like stronger powers of
redress.</hs_Para>

why, if the Bill will simply consolidate powers that she says are
already effective, she does not use the opportunity to go further and
deal with matters that she considers to be outside the legislation. She
cannot have the argument both ways—either we need new consumer
rights in this country, or we do not and she is wasting
everybody’s time. Labour Members think there is a case for a
new, stronger consumer rights legislative 
<?notus-xml column=789?>framework, which we are trying to set out, and part of that is about
redress. I am delighted to hear that the Minister’s constituents

because as well as when a mast breaks down, there is also a lack of
sharing and networks across the UK are incomplete. A customer of a
certain network can travel to certain places and find no coverage at
all. Mobile phone companies could share masts, but the renting and
price structure around them militates against that and makes it an
expensive thing to do. If something in some Bill somewhere were to
tackle that, consumers who use mobile phones would have far better
services in the UK than they do at present.</hs_Para>

mind—I am conscious of time—I will press on to the final
question that we will set for the Bill in Committee, which concerns
whether it has a clear enough framework for when things go wrong. We
know that absence of enforcement gives an advantage to firms that break
the rules, whether in a local community or nationally. Consumers are
getting a poor deal and providers are getting away with it because
there is little accountability or likelihood of prosecution. Giving
consumers a stronger voice in the regulation of goods and services
would enable consideration of the consequences of the different way
that services are managed among different groups in
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012859000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012859000121">Again,
the Bill could have led on that and tackled the problem. The concept of
an ombudsman is clear in principle, but confused in practice. There are
at least  17 different ombudsman services including the
Financial Ombudsman Service, the local government ombudsman, the
housing ombudsman, the pensions ombudsman and the legal ombudsman, as
well as the parliamentary ombudsman and the health service ombudsman.
In addition, there are also 14 recognised complaints handling services,
including the Advertising Standards Authority, the commissioner for
young people, the Information Commissioner and the schools adjudicator.
However, not all ombudsmen and adjudicators are the same. Some exist
through European and UK statute, such as the housing ombudsman, but
others have been set up by the industries as voluntary
bodies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012859000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012859000122">Let
me return to the point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Bridgend

industry where we see such problems at first hand. The furniture
ombudsman was set up as part of the Furniture Industry Research
Association and is the only profit-making ombudsman service in this
country. Some sectors have one ombudsman, but others have many.
Businesses can pick and choose which they sign up to, further
complicating matters for consumers. The lack of clarity about what an
ombudsman 
<?notus-xml column=790?>could do and what powers it has is a problem for all consumers, and I
say to the Secretary of State that tweeting about the issue or using
social media is not the way to address it. My hon. Friend the Member

of Farepak consumers, which seems exactly the point at which a stronger

loans and can have their cars repossessed if they miss so much as one

is that even the best businesses still spend significant time and

support for the Bill is genuine, but I wanted to mention one or two
aspects of it that reveal, within our society, a view of consumer
rights that is, at times, rather too narrow and that does not embrace
broadly enough a concept of true consumer and citizen empowerment on
the scale we need to drive a sustainable recovery and to reform how we
deliver public services and put this country back on its feet. There
are three specific areas in which the challenge of unleashing citizen
and consumer power are
urgent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000033">First,
some markets—banking, utilities and telecoms—are holding
back our recovery. Secondly, I am struck that the consumer rights
conversation is framed around consumables, point-of-purchase rights and
commercial rights in the commercial market. Many of those concepts
could and should apply equally in the public sector and public
services. Thirdly, it is also important to have active and empowered
consumers in supply chains to drive them. That subject may not
entertain all hon. Members, but I know that the Secretary of State
feels particularly strongly about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000034">In
the bigger markets—banking, utilities and
telecoms —we inherited from the previous Government an
extraordinary concentration of power. One or two institutions had a
very unhealthy predominance in each 
<?notus-xml column=793?>of those key markets, which are vital to the proper functioning of a
free market economy. What we need as we try to recover from that toxic
legacy of debt and dysfunctional markets is an insurgency of empowered
consumer citizens to drive a new paradigm of choice, and to demand and
insist that that which is available in so many fields of public life is
available in banking, utilities and
telecoms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000035">In
banking, why is it still so difficult for bank customers to take their
accounts to different banks? I would like to see consumer power, and
consumer frustration with some banks, driving much more insurgency and
the creation of new banks. First Direct appeared nearly 20
years ago, which was a stunning moment for our generation, who had
never seen an online bank. We tapped the mouse and wondered whether it
could be trusted and whether it would work. It turns out that First
Direct was a stunning new entrant that catalysed all sorts of reforms
in banking market. Why not have more now? Our banking sector is
dominated by too few big banks, which were propped up by a very
unhealthy burst of crony of capitalism under the previous Government
and shored up in the crisis that that incubated. We need to release
customers to drive that insurgency in
banking.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:10:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000036">I
would argue that the same is true with some of the utilities. Following
privatisation in the ’80s, we saw those markets consolidate
under the previous Government. For 13 years, we did not see or hear
very much about that. We have inherited, particularly in energy, a
small number of big companies that now pass on substantial global
commodity price rises to customers, who have all too little real choice
and power to drive across the market. To a lesser extent, the same is
true for telecoms and broadband. We still see a very powerful monopoly
provider in BT. Of course, other providers are able to operate on the
railway tracks, but I do not think that in the telecoms market, given
the extraordinary empowering impact of the underlying core technology,
we have seen a parallel opening up of consumer power. Going the final
mile to get broadband into deep rural areas to drive a rural
renaissance, in my constituency and in East Anglia more generally, will
require us to support consumers through some sort of voucher
mechanism—I welcome the steps the Government are taking on
this—to be more empowered to choose satellite, digital or any
one of the insurgent broadband providers appearing on the
market.</hs_Para>

public services, as important as the measures in the Bill are and as
important as this subject is, they are still framed, as is the wider
public debate on consumer rights, within the notion of
point-of-purchase and consumerist trade descriptions legislation. It is
principally concerned with the rights of the consumer at the point at
which they buy a consumable. However, the concepts, ideas and rights
enshrined in this useful Bill could and should go further. In fact, a
number of the reforms that the Government are rightly unlocking in
other areas of government will demand that they do. For example, why
can patients in the health service, parents in the education system, or
even pupils—possibly not young pupils, but sixth-form
pupils—not have greater choice, transparency and consumer rights
in the public services they receive? I would argue that a sixth former
in a failing school who is receiving a bad education has just 
<?notus-xml column=794?>as many rights as the consumer of faulty electronic goods at a
supermarket checkout. We need to extend this principle more broadly
across public
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:12:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Main" PimsId="4829" UID="14012861000362" xid="890" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000362">Mrs

Freeman:</Member></B> My hon. Friend, as ever, makes an extremely
interesting and shrewd observation. The truth at the heart of public
services is that the taxpayers provide the money and the Government, as
best they can, the service. In that loop, something is lost: a direct
connection between the recipient of the public service and the point of
payment. Most of the recipients of public services have, of course,
already paid for them through their taxes, but the sacred moment of the
empowerment of the consumer gets lost in a complex chain of public
service delivery. She makes the point that we need to look across our
public services at how we can restore that moment. I would like more
parents and pupils in schools to feel that the choice they
make—choosing which school to send their child to—is a
choice that the system respects. I wholly welcome the reforms that the
Secretary of State for Education is putting in place to that
end.</hs_Para>

want to mention health care, in particular, as we are seeing an
extraordinary change in modern health care. I do not think it is too
profound or bold to claim that health care is going from something that
traditionally, in the 20th century, was done to us by Governments when
they decided we needed it, to being something that modern consumer
health care citizens do for ourselves. We are seeing across the NHS
much greater patient demand for information, transparency and choice.
We are seeing click health care and modern patients wanting to be able
to access information and be empowered. That is all to the good if we
want a new generation of citizens empowered to understand what causes
disease—how lifestyle, diet and even genomics affect
one’s predisposition to disease. We want to empower consumer
citizens to prevent disease. We will not do that without empowering
them to make choices and receive information. That is why I have a
ten-minute rule Bill on the very subject of releasing patient data to
patients within the framework of acknowledging that it is their
data—our data. By giving patients back their data, we empower
them to use them better for public health
care<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:14:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Freeman:</Member></B> Yes, I do. My hon. Friend makes an excellent
point and I think this is a subject that we will debate more in the
House. I am struck that some in the media are beginning to suggest that
it is dangerous to release health care data because it challenges how
health care is delivered and will create all sorts of unfortunate
misunderstandings. It seems to me that those are prices worth paying to
drive the revolution of transparency 
<?notus-xml column=795?>and accountability that the Government’s reforms are beginning to
deliver with such benefit. We have seen in health care in the past two
or three years a very difficult, at times, but powerful transparency
revolution in which failings in the system have been exposed and those
responsible for them held to account on behalf of the patients who
ultimately paid for the service and have the right to expect that that
service is delivered. That genie is out of the bottle and it is not in
anyone’s interest to try to put it back. In fact, quite the
opposite: at the heart of modern democracy and a modern economy, the
notion of empowered citizens who are able to exercise choice in their
supply chain—in public services, every bit as much as in private
commerce—is an important idea that, although I appreciate the
limits of the Bill,  we ought to embrace in the rest of this
Parliament and the next.</hs_Para>

supply chains, globalisation and technological change mean that in all
sorts of sectors many of the goods, services, products, medicines and
foods we buy have global supply chains. That globalisation and the
extending of the distance of supply chains removes the
consumer in many cases from the point of origin of the goods they are
buying. In some areas, consumers do not appear to care very much, but
in some, such as food, consumers are passionately interested in the
source. We saw that most recently illustrated with the horsemeat
scandal. Something interesting is going on: globalisation and
technology are extending supply chains, but technology is also
requiring, allowing and encouraging people to take more interest in the
source of the products they buy. That creates a huge challenge. Many of
the goods we buy digitally come from global websites that could be

want to talk about the two areas I have most experience of: the
Government’s industrial strategies for life sciences and
agricultural technologies. The central thrust of the agri-tech and food
strategy, which we launched last summer, is that corporate interests in
reducing costs and dependence on agrochemicals, energy and labour are
now very much aligned with consumer interests and demand for
increasingly green food with low-carbon, low-plastics and low-water
footprints. The challenge in global agriculture is how to measure those
inputs and communicate to consumers clearly and simply at the point of
purchase that the thing they are buying comes with a low-carbon and
low-water footprint. A proper system for measuring that will also make
Britain a leader in the technologies required to hit those targets. I

reinvent itself and move away from spending 15 years and $1 billion on
developing a blockbuster drug that it can present to Governments as

different patient groups, the more we know that different people get
the same disease in different ways, and the challenge is to help the
industry develop drugs around the patients who we know will benefit.
Then we can give the right drugs to the right people, instead of
wasting drugs and having to set dosages at levels that make drugs
ineffective in those for whom they work well in order to prevent side

patients as having the right to be involved in NHS research; to access

rights are not the sexiest subject in public debate—it is not
something one hears discussed in those terms down at The Dog and
Duck—but it sits at the heart of a lot of the issues the
electorate, citizens and taxpayers in this country are grappling with.
I do not want to be overly partisan, but under Labour we had 13 years
of what increasingly—and perhaps surprisingly—became an
example of crony capitalism, and the nation is now grappling with that
inheritance: an overconcentration of wealth, privilege and power, and
in key markets, such as banking and elsewhere, a small number of
providers. As a consequence of that crisis—the black hole in the
public finances, the structural deficit—we will have to unleash
the powers of modern consumer citizens to drive enlightened public
services and a more entrepreneurial and innovative recovery. Consumer
rights—consumers of public services as well as private
goods—sit at the heart of that. Consumers must be able to
understand and demand the right standards from all those supplying them
goods and services—whether at the till in the supermarket, on a
global website or in the public services on which we all
rely—and to hold them to
account.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_28_PT_1/8F1A65687D9B53CE2565E8F52101C8827AC17808" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 January 2014">Tuesday

opportunities to rip off the consumer. I agree with hon. Members who
have said it is impossible to devise consumer rights legislation that

basic elements of legislation that will at least inform consumers and
make them less susceptible to being ripped off in what is a rapidly

Secretary of State himself said that the Bill was only part of the
picture. The much bigger picture includes competition and transparency,
and the idea that we can solve all consumer rights problems with one
piece of legislation is fanciful. It must be accompanied by a range of
policies across Government designed to improve competition and
transparency, so that those who wish to exercise their consumer rights
have the right information basis on which to do so. I would single out
three elements as being essential for everyone: first, clarity of
pricing; secondly, clarity of contracts; and thirdly, and in some
respects most important of all, clarity in the mechanism by which
someone can obtain redress if they are not satisfied with either the
quality or pricing of a particular good or service. The Bill tries to
address some of those, but could be improved in certain
areas.</hs_Para>

Government and local government organisations, and received 43 pieces

rough count of the Government’s responses would indicate that
they have accepted about 70%, which is a decent hit rate for
pre-legislative scrutiny. We recognise the Government’s

them on

will not pick out those that the Government rejected and re-argue the
arguments from the Committee, as I am sure that they will form part of
the debate that will take place in the Public Bill Committee. Having
said that, I will single out some issues where I feel the Government
have not delivered and which merit further debate in Committee. The
first is the sale of goods. The Bill retains the provision for
“deduction for use” which, in effect, is a discounting of
the refund for something that is faulty that may be made if the
consumer exercises his or her final right to reject. The
Committee—based to a certain extent on the Law
Commission’s recommendation—said that that should be
removed. The Government’s arguments for not doing so, which they
will no doubt rehearse during the Bill’s progress, is that that
would lead to complications in terms of the time scale involved, the
level of use and so on. They asked whether it would be fair to give
anybody a total refund or replacement for something that they had had,
and had used, for a while.</hs_Para>

fallback position, which happily the Government accepted: if the
Government retained the deduction for use provision, they should have a
formula that was fairer than the ones that were debated beforehand. I
will not go into the technical elements of that but basically the
provision should reflect the cost to the 
<?notus-xml column=799?>consumer for the loss of use rather than the market condition or the
cost to the business providing that
product.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000061">On
digital content, we felt that the remedies for tangible
content—for example, CDs—and intangible content, such as
a download, were inconsistent. There are again some complex legal
issues surrounding that but we felt that the Government had taken the
safest position and perhaps should try to equalise the rights of
redress so that anybody could get a refund for downloaded content as
well. I recognise that the Government have gone some way towards that
but the issue is complicated and needs further
examination.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000062">On
services, it is fair to say that that was a subject of considerable
debate and disagreement among witnesses in the evidence that the
Government and the Committee have had. Where there is the provision of
a service—the Minister mentioned cowboy builders—it is
true that  the Bill contains the opportunity for redress. But
the Government have retained the legal liability standard of where a
service is provided with reasonable care and skill, rather than the one
that the Committee preferred, which was basically an outcomes-based
model; if the service were not provided, full stop, the person who paid
for the service should be entitled to a
refund.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000063">To
encapsulate the different perspectives on that, there was an argument
that one could have a very competent and expert French teacher who took
somebody on a course for which that person paid but, at the end, the
person—for various personal reasons—was no better at
speaking French. Would that person have a right of redress
notwithstanding the quality of the teaching received? I agree that
there are issues there. However, I would have thought it possible to
build into the legislation some conditions that recognise that one
could measure reasonable care and skill rather than the
outcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000064">The
Government looked at the other perspective in their reply to the
consultation, using the example of an electrician who rewired a house
very competently but, for one reason or another, could not wire it up
to the mains. The Government said that because that electrician had
exercised reasonable care and competence in rewiring the house, the
person who paid for the service should not get the full compensation.
In effect, the electrician would be entitled to discount the
compensation because he had done at least part of the job correctly.
That was the Government’s example but I could not help but feel
that if an electrician did not start off on the basis that he could
connect a house to the mains, that would be a fundamental flaw in their
competence. We would reasonably expect a person, whatever the
electrician’s skill, who could not access electricity in their
house to be entitled to a full refund.</hs_Para>

those examples to demonstrate the different perspectives and
complexities involved, but the Committee would have preferred a harder
line to be taken, not least from the point of view of the consumer,
because it is much more difficult to prove that a person has not
exercised reasonable care and skill—and much more difficult for
a consumer to take that through a legal process—than if there is
a simple outcomes-based standard based on the failure of someone
providing a service to deliver that
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000066">On
unfair contract terms, the Bill does not add a term to the grey list,
with which MPs may not be familiar; it is the indicative list of
contract terms that 
<?notus-xml column=800?>may be regarded as unfair. The Bill does not add a term concerning a
change by the trader where the consumer is not free to dissolve the
contract without being disadvantaged. Again, that is an arcane point
but here is an example to give it some depth. In at least one quoted
example, a bank changed its interest rate halfway through a mortgage
period and a person paying that interest was highly disadvantaged.
There was an option in the contract to get out but there was no
alternative provider. It was felt that, where a person was locked into
a contract—even by default—they could be severely
disadvantaged by a change in the terms of the contract. If that change
were for no reason other than the desire of the company to get extra
profit, that should be put in the grey list of unfair contract terms. I
hope that the Government will look at that further in
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000067">Earlier
I outlined three elements where it was essential that the Bill should
demonstrate that it empowered consumers; pricing, contracts and
redress. Members may not have seen the excellent briefing from Citizens
Advice, whose recommendation of a legislative requirement for a trader
to promote that statutory right to the purchaser at the point of sale
was supported by the Select Committee. It should be possible for a
receipt to contain information about how and where the purchaser of a
good or service can obtain redress if for any reason that good or
service is not up to scratch. The Government have made sympathetic
noises, but they have yet to agree to implement that
recommendation.</hs_Para>

ambitious of Bills—it is essentially a consolidating Bill, and
it has a long way to go before it can realise the visionary objective
of transforming consumers’ awareness—I think that it is a

I have said, the Bill will empower consumers and enable them to make
choices. It will also simplify regulations—particularly those
governing small and medium-sized businesses, which are the life blood
of the economy—and help small businesses and consumers to tackle
manipulative, anti-competitive and monopolistic practices by creating a
form of speedy redress. Above all, it will help us to continue the
process of facilitating the fierce competition between businesses that
will not only improve public and consumer services, but help to lift
the economy further in the future.</hs_Para>

is a Bill that takes competition seriously, and raises the game for
everyone. It empowers people, and it backs British businesses. I
listened carefully to what was said by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:44:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy), and I accept that some small changes
may be required in Committee, but, on balance, I think that 
the Bill and the principles behind it will be good for the United
Kingdom’s
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000075">Competitive
markets are a successful country’s bread and butter. They are
what we need in order to lift all the boats, not just the yachts. I
fear that unless companies compete fiercely to sell goods and services,
the future of the nation will not be particularly successful.
Competition raises standards and pushes down prices: every person who
has been in business knows that, as does every person who has ever
bought a product or service, including those who have done so
online.</hs_Para>

know that if we can choose where to buy a product, and if the contract
terms and the information about what we are purchasing are clear, the
means of exchange will be facilitated, and our ability to make a choice
will drive down prices. I believe that any business that does not
respond to those signals from the market and from consumers, and to the
extra signals that will be conveyed by the Bill, will in fact no longer
be in business. Principles such as that are at the heart of the Bill,
and at the heart of the competition that will enable businesses to
create a better country.</hs_Para>

Bill will give the consumer the power to shop elsewhere, and it will
also drive innovation. If businesses have clear, fair contracts which
their customers understand, they will need to work harder and innovate
more quickly to remain in business. That, indeed, is the joy of being
in business: competing, innovating, and knowing that the business is
not only making profits for its owners and shareholders, but lifting
economic growth nationwide, and providing better goods and services for
everyone
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:46:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000078">I
also think that the Bill should be welcomed by Members on both sides of
the House because, for the first time, consumers’ rights are
contained in a single piece of legislation. To that extent, the Bill is
a consolidating measure, but I can say with my business hat on that
consolidating those rights in one simple piece of legislation will
enable business productivity to increase. Instead of spending hours
being trained and briefed on legislation that does not actually help
anyone, staff will be able to 
<?notus-xml column=802?>concentrate on providing better services for their customers, and on
making a return for the business—as well as a return for the
Exchequer in the form of the increasing tax takes that that will
generate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000079">The
simplification in the Bill is no small matter. Estimates vary, but it
may scrap up to 100—perhaps up to 1,000—pages of existing
legislation, and bring measures together in a package that is easier to
understand. I hope that it will also close many loopholes created by
disparate pieces of legislation, some of it dating back to the 1800s
and certainly much of it to the 1970s, which have enabled unscrupulous
businesses to escape from the spirit of the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:48:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000080">Given
that many others wish to speak, I shall make only a couple of
observations about part 3, which I believe should also be welcomed with
open arms. For the first time, consumers and small businesses will be
able to challenge anti-competitive practices. We all know, as
consumers, that if a company does not quite deliver what it is supposed
to deliver in the case of a low-value item bought on the internet or
perhaps in a supermarket, it is futile to suggest that we should
attempt single-handedly to argue that competition was not working
effectively, or that monopolistic practices were involved. The Bill and
the competition tribunal will make it a great deal easier for smaller
businesses to get together, and consumers to get together, to ensure
that their voice is heard, not by means of incredibly expensive court
battles with corporate companies that have multi-million-pound budgets
for lawyers, but by means of a simple and cost-effective tribunal
route<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:49:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000081">The
principles that guide the Bill are the principles that will guide us
further out of recession and further into economic growth. I very much
hope that Opposition Members will support those principles. I also hope
that any modifications that they seek to make will be proportionate,
will have the consumer’s interests at heart, and will not
overlook the fact that the purpose of the Bill is to enable fiercely
competing businesses to drive down prices, giving citizens and
consumers the choices that they need.</hs_Para>

time. I secured a Westminster Hall debate on the subject only last
week. I see that one of my sparring partners, the hon. Member for Bury
North (Mr

Chamber today.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:50:57"></hs_TimeCode>That debate was

all markets, the secondary ticketing market serves a purpose. It meets
a need, and that need is for people who have bought tickets for an
event they can no longer attend to sell on those tickets, and for
people who decide late that they want to go to an event to purchase
tickets nearer the time. However, the refusal of successive Governments
to get involved in this issue means that the market has moved far
beyond simply performing that role, and it is now fundamentally failing
consumers.</hs_Para>

anyone needs proof that these secondary ticketing websites are not
about legitimate fans selling tickets they cannot use, they need only
watch what happens on the day that tickets for a major sporting event,
concert, or stage show go on sale. Within minutes—sometimes even
seconds—an event or series of events for which there are
thousands of tickets completely sells out on the official market, only
for thousands of tickets to appear instantaneously on the secondary
market at a significant mark-up. Nobody buys a ticket at 9
o’clock in the morning, only to realise at 9.5 am that they
cannot go to the event. Those are tickets that are harvested in vast
quantities, by fair means or foul—the foul means involve the
misuse of computers or back-channel dealing—and then either
dumped or drip-fed on to the secondary market for profit by industrial
touts.</hs_Para>

last week, the BBC highlighted the resale of state-subsidised theatre
tickets at the Donmar Warehouse and the National Theatre for up to 10
times their face value. Those tickets are rightly subsidised to
increase access to the arts, but those arrangements are being exploited
by faceless individuals who are pricing out the very people the tickets
are supposed to be for. The same happens with art tickets—the Da
Vinci exhibition in 2012 and the David Bowie exhibition last year are
prime examples. This applies to more commercial enterprises as well.
The last big example of that was tickets for the Monty Python reunion
being snapped up and resold at eye-watering mark-ups within

band has done more than most to try to stop touts cashing in on its
hard work. Even it cannot stop the practice, however, despite trying to
do so and despite doing nothing to encourage it, as some bands and
promoters are accused of doing. If the Secretary of State wanted to see
the Arctic Monkeys at Finsbury park in May, the minimum he would have
to pay for a ticket on the secondary market would be double
its

is not about random gig-goers; this is large-scale manipulation of a

individuals who put nothing into the industry that they are
capitalising on. It is a parasitic market that is now out of control.
In many cases, the practice severely undermines the strategic
objectives that are factored into ticket pricing decisions, such as the
need for artists or sports to develop long-standing relationships with
fans or, as in the case of National Theatre and exhibition tickets,
access to the arts.</hs_Para>

importantly for me, this practice is obviously bad for consumers. Many
never get a chance to buy a ticket at face value, and if they can bear
the cost of going to the secondary market, they do not know who they
are buying from or whether the ticket will be genuine or still valid,
as event holders have the right to cancel tickets they identify as
having been resold. They cannot even be sure whether the ticket was
ever available on the primary market at the face value printed on it,
as more and more event-holders try to cash in on the secondary market
by directly allocating tickets to it, passing themselves off as fans
selling to fans so as not to damage their reputation with
fans.</hs_Para>

likely to use illegal means such as botnets to harvest genuine tickets,

that Radio 4’s “You and Yours” produced in
conjunction with ticketing expert Reg Walker last summer, which
uncovered a large-scale fraud being perpetrated through the main
secondary websites by their so-called power sellers, whose privileged

better way of addressing this kind of problem than through the Consumer
Rights Bill? At the very least, the Government need to ensure that
there is a right to transparency. After all, there are very few markets
in which we think that it is fine not to have at least some basic
knowledge about who we are buying from. To ensure that consumers have
the information they need to make an informed choice, these websites
must ensure three things. First, they must ensure that all ticket
listings display the face value, and seat number where appropriate, of
the tickets being purchased. That would prove that it was a real ticket
that was already  in
existence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T14:58:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

websites selling tickets that they have acquired themselves, or that
have been directly allocated to them by an event-holder, must disclose
that clearly to buyers, instead of passing the tickets off as being
sold by fellow fans. Thirdly, individuals selling tickets via the
websites must be able to provide proof that they actually own the
ticket. When we buy from eBay or Amazon, we are at least able to see a
profile of the individual or company we are buying from. We can see
what they have sold in the past, and what other consumers are saying
about them. The secondary ticket market could learn a lot from that
approach.</hs_Para>

measures would cover the right to information, but there must also be a
right to recourse when the market lets consumers down. As I
demonstrated earlier, the way in which the market works at the moment
is allowing fraud to be perpetrated under the anonymity that the
secondary websites offer to sellers. When someone turns up at a venue
and finds that they cannot get in because they have been sold a
fraudulent or invalidated ticket—or a ticket that has rightly
been cancelled because it has been resold without permission, in
contravention of its terms and conditions—it is not just the
price of the ticket that that person loses.</hs_Para>

illegal activities to Action Fraud are finding that the offence is not
being taken forward. Perhaps it is because it is seen as a minor fraud
or a minor criminal offence. The Metropolitan Police have recommended
that we pass legislation to ensure that we take forward such offences
as criminal activity. We need to put such a measure in the Bill so that

new report by UK Music on music tourism and its value in our economy
calls on the Government to tackle the problems of the secondary market.
It says that people who travel from one country to another or from one
end of the country to another for the sole purpose of going to a gig or
seeing a show incur substantial costs, such as those for travel,
airfares, accommodation and subsistence. Consumers who are sold fake or
invalid tickets should not expect to have just the cost of the ticket
refunded promptly. That guarantee, which they actually pay for as part
of the service charge that is slapped on the tickets when they buy from
these sites,  is not always honoured judging by some of the
stories that people have sent me over the years. Consumers should also
have the right to be able to reclaim all of the associated costs they
have incurred where they can be proven with receipts.</hs_Para>

unlimited amounts of money off the hard work and investment of others.

Ultimately, what has happened is that the quality ingredients in the

products and, because no obvious flash is placed across the product,
saying, “30% less good ingredients”, consumers are not
able to make proper choices. They are not able to recall the weights

also urge the Government to consider the regulators. They have consumer
representatives on their boards, but do they design their markets

habits and other trends. I dare say that if we went into certain
supermarkets, they could tell us what we purchased every week, what we
changed every week and, more to the point, what we were probably
enticed to buy when there were “Buy one, get one free” or
“Three for the price of two” offers. It is that sharing
of data that leads to another consumer experience: nuisance or
persistent calls in which people are told, “We know what you
buy, we know what you like, and we know what you might buy.” We
live in a different world in which we are told that we should not wait
and that we have to buy something now—“Get it now;
don’t wait”—which is in stark contrast to the
experience of a previous generation, who thought that if they could not
afford something, they should not buy it. There are pressures to
impulse buy as a result of the sharing of that sort of information.

Wharton</B> (Stockton South) (Con):</Member> I welcome this important
Bill. We have heard much about its impact and the positive benefits
that it will bring to consumers, and I will talk about that shortly.
When I was even younger and a law student studying the myriad
regulations and legislation that made up consumer protection, I
remember spending many a sober hour late into the night trying to get
my head around a very complex area of law, which was beyond the reach
of many lay people who would not have been able to devote the time that
I, as a student, could. Occasionally, I suspect, it was also beyond my
reach as a law student. Therefore, it is welcome that we see a real and
genuine attempt by the Government to consolidate much of that
regulation and legislation into a clear and straightforward Bill which
will, I hope, become a clear and straightforward Act, and will empower
consumers and enable them to enforce the rights to which they are
entitled<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:25:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000131">As
a starting point, this consolidation Bill, which is part of what it is,
is welcome. Compared with other consolidation Acts, such as, to recall
again my days as a young law student, the Trade Union and Labour
Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992—a monster of an Act, which
tries to do many things and to bring together many pieces of
legislation, and is so complex that it is very hard to
decipher—this is clear and straightforward. We know what it says
and what it means. We know what it means for our constituents and what
it will mean for consumers in this country and for our economy. That is
a positive
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:25:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000132">It
is also worth noting that the Bill updates our consumer law for the
21st century—not my words, but the words of the chief executive
of Which?—because it talks about protection for digital
downloads and digital content. It is a glaring omission that our
consumer regulations have not been able successfully and adequately to
keep up with what is now such an important part of our economy. In
2012, more than £1 billion was spent downloading digital
content, and more than 16 million people who did that had a problem of
one sort or another with what they downloaded. That is not a good
situation, but it is even worse when we have a regulatory framework
that does not address it and does not directly give people the sorts of
rights that they need in order to be protected in an increasingly
important part of our
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:26:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000133"><Member ContinuationText="Andy McDonald" PimsId="6004" UID="14012861000386" xid="1243" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000386"><B>Andy

Wharton:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point. I welcome
the fact that competition regulation can be properly done across
borders, across Europe, in a way that allows us to continue to trade
together and to have a functioning free market within the European
Union. I welcome the directive. It is something that we can do
ourselves, and are doing ourselves, but that  does not mean
that I am against it in principle. It is an 
<?notus-xml column=812?>important point. This is something on which we can unite across the
House because it is about getting the right deal for our constituents.
This is about protecting people, some of whom—we have heard
examples of constituency casework—are vulnerable, are pressured
by unscrupulous sellers and need protection in the form of legislation,
and others of whom, while they may not be vulnerable, find themselves,
through unfortunate circumstances, with goods or services that do not
meet the standards that they expect. It is right that we have a clear
and straightforward framework that offers them the protection that they
should be able to expect to rely on. That is what the Bill does, and
that is what the Bill extends to digital content, which is incredibly

do not intend to detain the House for long, but it is important that,
on behalf of law students throughout the country and consumers in our

and consolidates an important area of law and regulation, and it will
make life better for people who buy goods and services and rely on the
functioning economy that lies behind the selling and providing of goods

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:28:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South Thanet (Laura Sandys) said that she had previously worked for
the Consumers Association. Earlier in my career I worked for the
Scottish Consumer Council. It is important to recognise that
Governments of all colours have wanted to strengthen in various ways
the rights of consumers. The National Consumer Council and its Scottish
and Welsh equivalents were set up by the Labour Government of the
1970s, so everyone has aspired to putting the consumer at the heart of
things. The problem sometimes is how to make that a reality for those
consumers. How can we ensure that people understand how to use the
rights that they are
given?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000137">People
often encounter the greatest difficulty when dealing with smaller
retailers, because in larger companies staff are generally better
trained and so better able to respond. Indeed, some larger retailers
would rather allow the consumer to go away happy, even if that means
going beyond the basic statutory minimum. Many smaller retailers,
however, either seem unaware of what the law states or deliberately
obfuscate when a consumer complains. They say, “You have to go
to the manufacturer for that,” even though that has not been the
case for many
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000138"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:30:34"></hs_TimeCode>Citizens
Advice has suggested amending the Bill—perhaps the Minister will
consider this—to make it a requirement that information on
consumer rights is provided at the point of sale. It has made some
suggestions on how such information could be presented, because it is
aware that it could be quite difficult to convey simply. I think that
that information, whether it is on a notice in the shop or on the till
receipt, would be helpful, as consumers would be clear about what to do
if something goes
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000139">Another
relatively minor amendment that Citizens Advice proposes is including a
time limit for repairs and replacements. I remember what things used to
be like, when I had to try to explain to people what was going 
<?notus-xml column=813?>on with repairs, when they could get a refund and whether accepting a
repair put them in a difficult position. The simplification is to be
welcomed. However, the question remains whether there should be a limit
on the time a company can take to repair and return a product. Citizens
Advice suggests a 30-day limit. I would like to know whether the
Minister will consider such a change.</hs_Para>

have always been more difficult to regulate than goods—when we
buy an object, it is much clearer what we are buying. The relevant
legal wording, which effectively requires one to make a judgment on
whether reasonable care and skill has been used in the performance of
the service, has always been quite difficult. It is good to have that
made explicit, rather than implicit. It is not an implied term; it is
to be taken as an expressed term in the provision of services. However,
that still leaves open the question of precisely what that means. Could
it be measured in some way?</hs_Para>

Innovation and Skills Committee, my hon. Friend the Member for West
Bromwich West (Mr Bailey), had to say on that and about the
Committee’s recommendation. I hope that it can be explored more
fully to see whether other measures could be used, at least in relation
to some services, to give a clearer and more explicit measure of
whether a service has been performed in the way it should have been,

we must also look at how people exercise their rights. Ideally, they
should be able to exercise them face to face with the person providing
the service or selling the goods. Things should be sufficiently clear
that the consumer can go back, exercise their rights and get a good
response, but we know that that does not always happen. We must
therefore look at the means by which people can get
redress.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:34:29"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000143">Citizens
Advice also wants the Government to consider the question of collective
redress in relation to competition cases—if there is a
particular kind of mis-selling or product or service
failure—that affect not just individuals, but people in
particular localities or up and down the country, and on which a
collective response is available, because there is strength in
numbers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000144">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:36:14"></hs_TimeCode>
allowing an individual consumer to have all their rights and choices is
clearly important, they are sometimes a small cog in the wheel, and it
can be very difficult for them to push a
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:35:34"></hs_TimeCode>. Many
people simply give up, because it is not worth the effort: if they are
rebuffed at first, they will not necessarily pursue their case further,
because they do not know how to do so or find the whole process so
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000145">Even
for people who contemplate going to court, the process can be quite
expensive. Other hon. Members have spoken about the difficulty of
getting legal aid to go to court or even for legal advice. A court fee
can be a considerable block to people’s ability to exercise
their right. For example, in Scotland, an action for a small claim can
be made for something worth more than £200, which is not a huge
amount in relation to various consumer purchases, but it costs
£71, which is quite a lot for someone to risk if they feel that
they might not win the case. We therefore have to consider the whole
idea of
redress<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T15:36:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

developing proper small claims courts to which people could easily go,

cannot be taken forward. That is where the collective becomes
important. For one individual, the cost and effort of pursuing a case

is an irritant for those of us who cope with that sort of thing very or
reasonably well, but it can be worse than an irritant for others.
My father, who is now in his 90s, has got to the
stage where he hardly ever answers the phone, which is not particularly
practical. He certainly will not answer the phone if it is an unknown
number. As Members will know, if somebody phones from an institution,
such as this place, it comes up as an unknown number. He is not only
exasperated by such phone calls, but anxious about answering the phone.
It is highly harmful that nuisance calls are being made and it is
important that we legislate to deal with

has approached various Members for support. It is one thing for
companies to say that direct debits are so much more convenient and
cheaper to process than other forms of payment that they will give
direct debit consumers a discount and everybody else will pay a
standard charge, but companies have gone beyond that and are making
other customers pay an additional charge. Not only energy companies but

the only way in which he could pay by cash was to use PayPoint. It is

direct payment of housing benefit. The DWP would like people to get
bank accounts and pay by direct debit, and that would certainly help
housing associations as well, because it would help people to be
responsible for their own payments. The problem that the housing
association found was that a lot of its tenants were not comfortable
with doing that, either because they had had bad experiences of being
charged because their direct debit went out at the wrong time of the

they wanted to pay, preferably in cash or through some other payment

that people will have bank accounts. The Government have stated that
they want to make that assumption in relation to universal credit

that happening, which would be all the better. I am sure that Members

the core of the Bill is the principle that people have a right to get
what they pay for. In 2012, UK consumers spent more than £1
billion on downloaded films, music and games. I confess that, as you
would expect, Mr Deputy Speaker, I was one of those consumers. Until
now, the law has lagged behind in protecting consumers who do not get
what they pay for or who receive poor-quality content. Apple’s
iTunes service is dominant, and I am sure that its customers nearly
always get what they have paid for to the correct standard. However,
there are new entrants to the market all the time, seeking to take some
of Apple’s market share, that may not provide a proper service
or genuine content. Consumers in my constituency deserve protection
from shoddy or spurious content providers, and the Bill certainly goes
a long way towards protecting their hard-earned money when they make
online
purchases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000163">In

savvy, but it is easy to get caught out by an attractive price

and medium-sized businesses by reducing unnecessary red tape and
regulation, and the Bill helps to deliver that aim. Enforcers such as
trading standards officers will be required to give 48
hours’ notice to businesses when carrying out routine
inspections, saving businesses an estimated £4.1 million per
year—a welcome saving. Trading standards officers will still be
able to carry out unannounced inspections where illegal activity is
suspected. Therefore, the new start-up businesses in my constituency,
and all the growing SMEs in the black country, can go about serving
their customers to the best of their ability and introducing innovative
new products and services, without the worry of unexpected, unannounced
and unnecessary inspections by trading standards. There is something to
fear only when there is something to hide. We need trading standards to

improvement of the standards and requirements for point-of-sale
information, the fact and quality of that information should not of
itself become a new marketing lure, where businesses imply to customers
that they are doing everything in their interests as consumers. Many
hon. Members have complained about claims management companies. Claims
management companies ring people and tell them they are ringing on
behalf of, for example, the Department of Justice. They imply that they
have been appointed by the Department to tell people they have a claim
simply because they have been licensed as claims management companies.
We do not want to assist any firm or supplier, whether online or

they are giving point-of-sale information to new consumer legislation
standards to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0002.htm#14012861000169">Many
hon. Members have heard complaints from their constituents about
extended warranties. They have become something of a racket. People
find it very hard to buy goods without being spooked into buying
extended warranties. The small print that attaches to extended
warranties is not matched by small prices. People often find that they
have cancelled out any headline discount by buying an extended
warranty, but also that, if they need to use it, it does not do the job
for them. Many people mistake an extended warranty for an extended
guarantee—they believe that it absolutely guarantees against any
problem, but do not realise that they are buying a fairly narrow form

the important concept in the Bill which suggests that, if action is
taken by consumers in relation to a product or service, the eligibility
to benefit from it should apply to other consumers—people need
not be party to the action to benefit. Of course, it would not apply to
anybody who had specifically opted out. That raises an interesting

limits on repairs and refunds, and on collective redress in respect of
known faults that are identified and pursued, there is a glaring
omission in the Bill on product recall. Even if faults become known to
the product manufacturer and the supplier, they might remain unknown to

relation to electrical goods. The Electrical Safety Council runs a
recall check and says that only 10% to 20% of the products it tracks
are 
<?notus-xml column=819?>subject to successful recall. We should remember that those products are
recalled because of a risk to people and property. Hon. Members have
argued about what the Opposition want and what the Government want, but
we should remember that we are talking about products that go inside
consumers’ houses and represent a real risk. There is something
of a dereliction in the law in terms of what is expected or required in
product recall. Under existing legislation and under the Bill,
consumers will have their rights asserted and addressed only in respect
of faults that they know and identify, not in respect of serious and
risky faults that are known to others.</hs_Para>

Electrical Safety Council also says that for many of the products on

Many products are supplied under the names of other brands, so the
actual manufacturer is unknown. Recalls are made according to
codenames, so even if people have accessed any of that information they
will still not be sure whether they have the product. There is such
diversity in sales and distribution chains—hon. Members have
made significant points about supply chains—that the issue
arises of whether the standards we set on product recalls are tight
enough. Only this month an article in <I>The Guardian</I> highlighted
the risks and dangers of unsafe products and the incidences of fires in

am pleased that the Bill is before the House. Like everyone in the
Chamber, I am often contacted on the need for tighter legislation and
greater rights for consumers and others. Staff in my advice centre
regularly refer cases to the Consumer Council, and sometimes they have
to contact the council themselves to ensure that it pushes a matter
strongly. It does not always do that, so we have to underline what we

in my office complaining about particular retailers, but in true
British form, rather than complaining, they say, unlike Arnold
Schwarzenegger, “I’ll not be back” to make a
complaint. Someone might have lost £100 on a pair of shoes

hear complaints in my office about flights that have been cancelled,
about the service and about the fact that prices quoted are often
different from the actual prices. These are issues that regularly come
to my attention. Many retailers get away with selling substandard
merchandise. When somebody brings something back, they simply point to
the sign that says, “No sale return”. That is not
correct. It does not affect a consumer’s statutory rights. Why
does the consumer sometimes have to push so hard to get their
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:08:21"></hs_TimeCode>? Many

that debate. It frustrates and angers me, and it certainly angers my
constituents, that people advertise insurance premiums on the

Ireland. I am as British as anyone in Edinburgh, Cardiff or London and

regulatory measure will reduce the effort both consumers and businesses
have to make to resolve problems. Consumers will now have the right to
get some money back after one failed repair of faulty goods or one
faulty replacement, to demand that substandard services are redone or,
failing that, to get a price reduction and a repair or replacement of a
piece of faulty digital content such as a film or music download,
online game or e-book. It is clear that the more we shop online, the
more regulation there needs to be in place. After Christmas, the
newspapers indicated that there were greater sales online than there
have ever been in the past. In my constituency that is an issue as
well; the trend is for online shopping.</hs_Para>

a sale or return policy. That gives the consumer the opportunity to buy
a good, which they are doing in increasing numbers. That business has

experience of consumers is a litmus test for future economic success.
When consumers are confident, they can reward good business practice
and respond to innovation. When their treatment is shoddy—as it
was in recent notable cases such as those involving unsafe breast
implants and payment system failures in the long-drawn-out saga of
payment protection insurance—goods and services can become stuck
in a cycle of weak demand and low trust. The essential element of a
successful economy is the ability to ensure that consumers have that
confidence, and to support their role as a primary driver in making
markets work effectively—as we heard from the hon. Member for
Dudley South (Chris
Kelly)—not<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:16:06"></hs_TimeCode>

a number of Members have observed, the Bill represents a welcome step
towards the simplification of a complicated matrix of consumer law and
the adoption of an up-to-date approach to the changing world of the
consumer in these digital times. It is not difficult to demonstrate the
ways in which consumers can suffer detriment. For instance, how would
the Minister feel if she went into a hardware store to buy a number of 
<?notus-xml column=823?>handles for her garden forks and left with four candles? Such incidents
should be resolved quickly and efficiently for the benefit of the
consumer. <I>[Laughter.] </I>I thank my hon. Friends for their

must be a number of building blocks for effective consumer confidence.
First, there must be a fair framework: a framework of behaviour,
expectations and rules that seem to work fairly for both consumers and
producers, and which encourage innovation. Secondly, there must be
effective enforcement. The rules governing any exchange between
consumer and producer must be enforced so that persistent malpractice
does not take place in the industry or any sectors of it. Thirdly,
there must be trusted advice. When people want advice or support that
they can trust, it must be easy for them to find it. Fourthly, there
must be simple means of redress: when things go wrong, they must be put
right without difficulty.</hs_Para>

United Kingdom has a record of good practice in all those respects, and
the Bill will improve the position further. However, although it does a
good job in relation to, for example, the fair framework, Ministers
appear to be ignoring other critical pieces of the jigsaw such as
enforcement, advice and funding. Let me give two examples relating to
enforcement. First, the changes in consumer protection provision that
the Government have introduced since 2010 have been muddled, and have
created uncertainty and confusion on the consumer landscape. They
abolished Consumer Focus and transferred some of its resources and
responsibilities to Citizens Advice, but then they did not really know
what to do with Consumer Focus, so they came up with the wonderful idea
of rebranding it as Consumer Futures, so that it could do pretty much
the same job as it had been doing before.</hs_Para>

trading standards, making it harder for consumers to uphold their
rights and seek redress. Aggregate trading standards funding has
dropped from £245 million to approximately £142 million

the importance of the European Union in relation to competition policy,

actions on competition issues.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:20:31"></hs_TimeCode> would be
good, however, if the Government could examine an extension to the

hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)
is a passionate advocate of tackling the abuses in the secondary
ticketing market. She mentioned the Monty Python reunion show in her
speech. My father-in-law is a massive Monty Python fan, and I decided
to try to get some cheap seats for him for Christmas. The tickets went
on sale at 9 o’clock on the Monday morning, yet I was able to
purchase them on a secondary ticket site before the official site had
opened. That shows that there must be something wrong. Those were not
really secondary ticket sales, but there must have been some kind of
collusion between the promoter of the event and the secondary ticket
market. The Bill could be an opportunity to look at some of those
things. Although that is a specific issue around secondary ticketing,
the overall concept of consumer detriment from secondary sales is
something that we should be looking at quite

sensible approaches in the Citizens Advice briefing, one of which must
be about giving information to consumers when they are purchasing goods

in a store, with a nice sign that says that my statutory rights are not
affected. I know that that is a statutory requirement, but it is
completely beyond me what it means. If we turn over till receipts from
many organisations, we would find a whole plethora of legislation that
a Philadelphia lawyer would find difficult to pick through never mind
someone who just wants to return a pair of shoes that are either too
large, too small or not to their liking. There is something in that
Citizens Advice briefing that I hope the Committee will look at when it

it consolidates the current law, which, as a number of Members have

Trading Regulations 2008, it is illegal for a trader to mislead
consumers to the extent that the average consumer is likely to make a
decision that they would not otherwise make. That is slightly wordy,
but it includes giving a false impression of cost, such as charging for
something that would otherwise be free. That encompasses the example

the specific matters raised,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:39:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for West Bromwich West mentioned the issue of deductions for use when a
product is returned to the trader.  As he said, we accepted
some of his Committee’s recommendations, and it is vital that we
begin the debate by recognising the fact that current legislation
allows for a deduction for use whenever the customer exercises their
second-tier right to reject. The Bill strengthens that by saying that a
deduction for use cannot be made until after the first six months from
purchase with a limited exception. As a result of the pre-legislative
scrutiny, ably led by the hon. Gentleman, we decided to tighten and
limit that exception even further. It is important to maintain the
ability to deduct for use, but to ensure that there is a fair balance
between the rights of consumers and the pressures on
business<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:40:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000238">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) raised the issue of time-
limiting the period available for repairing products, as did another
hon. Member. A number of factors will be beyond the control of the
trader and a fixed time limit may impose a significant burden on them.
When providing a repair the trader 
<?notus-xml column=830?>must carry out a number of actions, including taking delivery of the
goods, diagnosing the faults, and perhaps sending the goods away for
repair or ordering in parts. Similarly, the trader may have to order in
a replacement. We are concerned that imposing a time limit may lead to
a reduction in the quality of the repairs, which may in turn lead to a
loss of faith in the repairs, and ultimately to an increase in the
number of goods being rejected. We do not want to see that, so we do
not propose to lay down a specific time limit in legislation because it
could be counter-productive to the interests of
consumers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:41:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000239">A
number of hon. Members raised the issue of digital content. For the
first time, the Bill introduces consumer rights for digital content. We
are one of the first countries in the world to legislate in this area.
I hope that as well as benefiting consumers, this will help to give
this sector of the economy a competitive edge in the future. Such an
important and rapidly growing industry needs to be governed by a clear
and effective consumer framework. Many consumers assume that they have
rights at the moment and are confused and concerned when they find out
that they do not. We heard from a number of Members about the scale of
this. During the last year, 16 million consumers have had a problem
with downloaded material. I accept that, where possible, we should
align the digital regime with goods and services to make it as clear
and simple as possible for consumers, but we should do that only where
it makes sense, and we need to ensure that we neither over nor
under-regulate this important sector to ensure that it can

issue that was raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:42:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for West Bromwich West concerned the outcome-based quality standard for
services. The Bill reflects the current position, which, as he knows,
requires services to be undertaken with reasonable care and skill. As
part of the consultation ahead of the Bill, the Government asked for
comments on additional proposals to move the services regime closer to
the regime for goods by introducing an outcome-based quality standard
for certain services, but the responses that we received gave a wide
range of views, including contradictory views on whether an
outcome-based standard would be easier to understand. While in some
cases, such as repair or certain installation services, it may be quite
simple, in other cases a view on the quality of a service is
subjective, and therefore much harder to
determine<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:42:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000241">As
the hon. Gentleman said, the issue is complicated and difficult. I
completely understand where he and his Committee are coming from, but
the Government feel that the evidence does not fully support the
conclusion that they came to and we have decided to stick with the
current legal position requiring reasonable care and skill rather than
introducing an outcomes-based quality standard. The current system is
understood and it seems easier to apply, rather than introducing a new
system that could be complicated and subjective, particularly as there
are strong views on either
side<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:43:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000242"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Bailey" PimsId="3848" UID="14012861000404" xid="22" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000404">Mr
Bailey:</Member></B> I hesitate to have a mini-debate, but the
difficulty is that under the reasonable care and skill provision,
anybody who felt that they had a case to bring against a service

is extremely difficult for them to prove that if they are not
professionally qualified in the service that has been provided for
them.

broad and varied, what is the case in one area would not necessarily be
the case in another. For example, I like the way my hair has been cut,
but someone else might not have the same view. That is much more
subjective and difficult to identify, whereas whether or not it has
been cut with due care and attention is a totally different matter. It
is clearly a difficult issue, and one to which I am sure we will return
in Committee, because there are strong arguments on both sides. It is a
matter of weighing up the evidence and deciding which side to come down

dispute resolution and an ombudsman service were mentioned. I believe
that we must first consult on how to implement the alternative dispute

pre-legislative scrutiny. Having a single consumer ombudsman is one of
several options that we are considering, but it would not be
appropriate to legislate for that until after we have properly
consulted and decided which avenue to pursue and how to pursue it. We
intend to publish a consultation document shortly, and I look forward
to hearing people’s views on what approach we should be taking

collective redress. The proposals in the Bill on competition-based

broader issue of whether small businesses should be eligible to access
more of the rights in this legislation, I understand that research by
the Federation of Small Businesses will be produced fairly shortly. I
am interested to see the case it makes. I am fairly sympathetic to the
idea, but I do not think that this legislation is the place to
introduce it, because it is specifically about business-to-consumer
relationships, not business-to-business or consumer-to-consumer
relationships. We want to maintain that clarity. However, this is an
issue that will come up again, so I look forward to reading the FSB

unfair terms legislation relates to a very complex area of law. The
Bill will make it easier for businesses to apply the law in practice
while ensuring that consumers are not tripped up by the small print.
The Government agree that consumers should be protected from terms that
allow traders to make unilateral changes to a contract, and the
so-called grey list of potentially unfair terms already includes terms
that permit the trader unilaterally to alter the characteristics of a
consumer contract. Through the Bill, we are protecting consumers from
terms that are not made prominent and are left in the small print,
because they can be considered for fairness by the court. We think that
will address many of the problems that have occurred.</hs_Para>

John Elam was convicted of a conspiracy to commit fraud and received a

released on licence. He has always maintained his innocence and has

constituent of mine came to see me to raise his concerns about the
safety of the conviction and the role of certain officers in West
Yorkshire police. As you will know, Madam Deputy Speaker, Members of
Parliament are approached by many people who feel that the legal system
has operated against them. Sometimes it is difficult to unravel what
the issues really are. As any other constituency MP would do, I wrote
to the appropriate Departments and West Yorkshire police, and I
contacted Mr Elam’s then solicitors, Keith Dyson and
Partners.  I also had meetings with the West Yorkshire police
commissioner<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:58:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000280" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000280">My
interest was stirred even more when differing accounts of the case
emerged. According to West Yorkshire police, Mr Elam was an
international criminal who had connections to the Russian mafia and was
involved in money laundering and the drugs trade. However, according to
his solicitor, Mr Elam was the victim of police intimidation and a
dirty tricks campaign, which included a lack of disclosure at his
appeal. I am not a lawyer, so I was unsure what legal avenues were
available to resolve the conflicting stories. As MPs do, I asked
around, seeking advice and receiving information from many sources. The
responses led to my interest in the case deepening
further<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T16:59:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000281">Mr
Elam had only one previous conviction, for common assault—he
threw a Toby jug at a pub landlord. How did that minor criminal evolve
into an alleged international 
<?notus-xml column=836?>criminal? According to West Yorkshire police, they were interested in Mr
Elam in 2005 and sought approval to have him monitored and placed under
surveillance as a dangerous criminal. Operation Teddington was set up,
and a very large amount of resources was spent on the process. Covert
action was used to monitor the bank accounts of the Medina Trading
Company, which consisted of a restaurant and a car wash. Mr Elam has
always admitted his involvement with the Medina company and its
directors<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:00:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000282">The
Yorkshire bank held the accounts of the Medina company, and an employee
of the Yorkshire bank at that time, Mr Richard Shires, passed on
information relating to the accounts, and cheques, to DC Casey of West
Yorkshire police, as confirmed by affidavit. During my investigations
into the matter, I have submitted a number of freedom of information
requests to West Yorkshire police, through which I have discovered that
a person called Mr Richard Shires was a serving special constable in
West Yorkshire police at the time the information was passed on. I have
also discovered that a person called Mr Richard Shires subsequently
became a paid constable in West Yorkshire police and continues to serve
to this day. I have tried to discover through a recent freedom of
information request whether those Richard Shires were one and the same,
but at this time I have not been provided with that

those Richard Shires were one and the same, there was a clear conflict
of interest, and more to the point, the credibility of the information
and cheques passed to DC Casey would be called into doubt. I think all
would agree that it would never be appropriate for a bank employee who
was also a serving special constable to assist with the inquiries of
the very same police force he worked

Elam’s case, supported by his legal team, portrays an entirely
different account of the chain of events. Mr Elam claims
that he was approached in the summer of 2004 by a police officer
demanding £150,000 in cash to be paid immediately, and
£30,000 annually thereafter. In March 2005, the police
investigated Mr Elam’s business practices using the covert name
Operation Teddington. It is alleged that, in June 2005, 49 officers
were redeployed from the anti-terrorist taskforce to work on Operation
Teddington<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:03:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000288">As
I said, in September 2005, Mr Richard Shires was a paid employee of the
Yorkshire bank. He accessed bank accounts relating to the Medina
restaurant and secured more than 3,000 cancelled cheques. A written
affidavit by Mr Shires confirms that he delivered a bundle of those
cheques to DC Casey. The Yorkshire bank also confirms that it never
received an order to produce from the
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:03:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Elam was arrested, and then the Crown court trial
began. Despite a wide-ranging three-year investigation, involving more
than 300 officers, Mr Elam faced a single charge of conspiracy to
commit fraud. He was convicted and served his sentence in Wakefield
prison as a category A prisoner, the highest security level. He had
also been treated as a category A prisoner during his time on remand.
Mr Elam suffered a stroke in prison and needed external medical

is my contention that, whatever the true situation, a number of
questions remain unanswered and there are a number of public interest
concerns. First, was a production order properly served to Yorkshire
bank, and what was the role of PC Shires? Secondly, what was the true
cost of Operation Teddington, and were officers diverted from the
anti-terrorism taskforce, who at the time were dealing with the 7/7

category A prisoner, and who was the police officer that demanded
money?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000291">I
know the Minister cannot respond directly to individual cases and that
the Criminal Cases Review Commission will take a fresh look at this
case, but I am seriously concerned enough to raise these issues and the
fact that, while out on licence, Mr Elam still faces issues related to
the recovery of the proceeds of crime. A hearing that was suspended in
October is due in February. I have tried to contact West Yorkshire
police on a number of occasions about those issues, and I will continue
to do so. I was heartened today when I had a more co-operative response
from West Yorkshire police because they knew this debate was taking
place, and I hope to take the matter further.</hs_Para>

serious allegations and this is a serious case—as I said, I do
not usually promote and push issues where I do not feel that a cause
needs to be looked at. This is a sensitive case, but it is important
that as constituency MPs we raise such matters when they are put to us,
and that we try to get the best result for the constituents we
represent, particularly where justice and the work of the police are
concerned. It must always be held utmost that the police operate in a

Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims (Damian
Green):</Member></B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Bradford South
(Mr Sutcliffe) on securing this debate and thank him for recognising at
various stages in his speech that I will inevitably be constrained in
what I can say in response to the specific points he has raised. He
served in a distinguished capacity in both the Ministry of Justice and
the Home Office under the previous Government, so he will recognise
that as a Minister in both Departments I am doubly constrained in what
I can say. I will, however, respond to his points about miscarriages of
justice, applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission, and
police matters.</hs_Para>

of alleged miscarriages of justice is a matter for the independent
Criminal Cases Review Commission, and ultimately for the appeal courts.
I am aware that Mr Elam has made an application to the commission. It
is therefore not a matter for the Government and it would be
inappropriate for me to comment on that case on their behalf. I
understand that Mr Elam has made a complaint to West Yorkshire police
that is still ongoing and being investigated by the force’s
professional standards department. Again, that disqualifies me from
commenting on it.</hs_Para>

Gentleman mentioned the background to the case, and I understand that
Mr Elam and a number of co-defendants were prosecuted as a result of a
major operation by West Yorkshire police. There were a number of
criminal trials against Mr Elam and other defendants in 2006, 2008 and
2009. Mr Elam was convicted of offences including assault and
conspiracy to pervert justice, conspiracy to defraud, and doing acts
tending or intending to pervert the course of justice. Custodial
sentences were imposed following conviction, which have been served,
and I understand that Mr Elam has appealed unsuccessfully to the Court
of Appeal, against sentence on one occasion, which was heard in 2007,
and twice against conviction—both those appeals were heard in
2010.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012861000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000297">As I have
said, Mr Elam has made an application to the Criminal Cases Review
Commission, which was established by the Criminal Appeal Act 1995. Its
purpose is to review possible miscarriages of justice. Since
31 March 1997, the commission has operated with the power to
investigate alleged miscarriages of justice and refer convictions and
sentences to the relevant appeal court for a new appeal. Its remit
extends to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The commission replaced
functions that were previously carried out by the Secretary of State.
Parliament established the commission specifically to be a body that is
independent of the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000298">A
commission review is rightly a long and thorough process. If Mr
Elam’s application to the commission concerns all the criminal
proceedings to which he has been subject over a number years, the
review will be complex and
lengthy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000299">It
should be noted that the commission has strong statutory powers to
enable it to discharge its functions. It can direct and supervise
investigations; approve the appointment of officers to carry
investigations on its behalf; and gain access to documents and other
relevant materials. I draw the hon. Gentleman’s attention to the
power in section 17 of the 1995 Act, under which the commission can
reasonably require any person serving in any public body to produce to
the commission any document or other material that can assist it in the
exercise of any of its
functions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000300">Of
course, “public body” includes the police, so the
commission’s powers pursuant to section 17 operate irrespective
of any duty of confidentiality and allow the commission access to
information of the highest sensitivity. Accordingly, as I am sure the
House can see, the commission has the power to obtain and review the
papers and materials held by West Yorkshire police, provided the
commission believes it reasonable to do so, in connection with its
review of Mr Elam’s conviction. I hope that that reassures the
hon. Gentleman that, when the time comes, the commission can access and
consider all material relevant to the review of Mr Elam’s
application.</hs_Para>

has confirmed that an application from Mr Elam was received in January
2013. Mr Elam is now at liberty and, as I understand it, the case is
not yet under active review. The commission has informed me that it
recently wrote to advise Mr Elam that the estimated date for the
allocation of his case for review is January 2015. I appreciate that
that is some two years after the original application was made and
that, given the complexity of the case, it is likely to be some time
before an outcome is reached once the review is
underway.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000302">In
addition, the commission has explained to me that it operates a system
of priority for applicants who are in custody. For cases requiring a
substantial review, the review is generally started 12 months earlier
when applicants are in custody than when somebody is at liberty.
Currently, the wait for those in custody is unduly long. The commission
is concentrating on allocating those cases to reduce the maximum
waiting
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000303">As
I have said, although the commission prioritises applications from
people in custody, I am advised that it has a policy for affording
priority to any individual case when appropriate. Perhaps Mr Elam
wishes to pursue that, or perhaps the hon. Gentleman can discuss with
Mr Elam whether that is an appropriate course of action in his case. I
should take the opportunity to repeat that the Government should not,
and indeed cannot, in any way intervene or be seen to be intervening in
a matter for the commission and, if appropriate, the appeal
courts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012861000304" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000304">On
the West Yorkshire police investigation, I understand from them that Mr
Elam’s solicitor contacted them at the end of last year to make
a complaint about an officer involved in the 2005 investigation. West
Yorkshire police’s professional standards department is
currently in correspondence with Mr Elam’s solicitor about the
matter and currently awaits a response. As the hon. Gentleman has said,
Detective Chief Superintendent Brennan, the head of the West Yorkshire
police professional standards department, has spoken to him and
informed him of the sequence of events surrounding the original
complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012861000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000305">The complaint
was thoroughly reviewed, and the response was sent on 18 September
advising that there was no evidence to support the allegation. A formal
complaint was recorded by West Yorkshire police’s professional
standards department and, although Mr Elam and his
representatives have been advised that the complaint will be subject to
disapplication on two occasions, there has been no response to the
letters.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012861000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000306">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:18:35"></hs_TimeCode>
understand that the hon. Gentleman was advised that the process would
not stop West Yorkshire police’s professional standards
department from taking action  
<?notus-xml column=840?>on the information, especially if there is a suggestion of misconduct or
criminality. I believe that Detective Chief Superintendent Brennan has
also offered to meet the hon. Gentleman to go through any outstanding
allegations or suggestions of misconduct. As well as that
offer—it is obviously a matter for him to decide whether to take
that up—the professional standards department strongly
encourages Mr Elam, or any other person, to contact it should they have
information that they believe may be relevant or of value. I think that
that is all I can appropriately say at this stage.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012861000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000307"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:16:11"></hs_TimeCode>If
after those stages Mr Elam is not satisfied with how his complaint to
West Yorkshire police was dealt with, or how he was notified of the
outcome, he can appeal a decision to the Independent Police Complaints
Commission, which is the statutory guardian of the police complaints
system. There are, therefore, further steps that he can take if he
wishes to do so.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012861000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000308"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:16:36"></hs_TimeCode>The
hon. Gentleman raised three important specific points at the end of his
speech. Let me address them as far as I can. The issue of the
production order to Yorkshire Bank and the role of Mr Shires is
specific to one or more of the criminal cases brought against
Mr Elam. If that is a case he has asked the Criminal Cases
Review Commission to consider, it will investigate the issues fully. It
is therefore not appropriate for me to speculate on them. Information
on the costs and diversion of police resources for the purposes of
Operation Teddington is an operational matter for West Yorkshire
police, so I refer the hon. Gentleman to it for the answer to that. On
the question of where Mr Elam served his custodial sentences, the
decision on which custodial facility a convicted prisoner is sent to is
made by the National Offender Management Service. Its decision is
informed by information and intelligence from various sources, and the
directorate of high security has a responsibility to act on that
information. It is not within its remit to investigate the details of
the information provided by the sources it uses.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012861000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/debtext/140128-0003.htm#14012861000309"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-28T17:18:01"></hs_TimeCode>It
is clear from the important matters raised by the hon. Gentleman that
there are issues that need to be looked into further. As I have
explained, the relevant and appropriate bodies are looking into those
matters now. I therefore think that the sensible way forward is to
allow the application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission to take
its course. I hope that that satisfies the important points raised by
the hon. Gentleman.</hs_Para>

December last year, without any prior notice or consultation and before
any impact assessment had been published, the national director for
young people at the Education Funding Agency announced a 17.5% cut in
funding per full-time student aged 18 at the start of the academic year
2014-15, as part of a strategy to achieve the savings required in the
2015-16 spending review period. The cut, which it is estimated will
affect 100,000 students and save £150 million, means that the
funding per student would be reduced from £4,000 to
£3,300, at an average cost to FE colleges of
£600,000 per college, although some will suffer much
greater cuts—in some cases, in excess of £1 million.
Sixth-form colleges will also be hit, many of which have already
suffered substantial funding cuts; some face the loss of as much as a

on sixth-form colleges, does she agree that this is not a double but a
triple whammy, because sixth-form colleges are facing the VAT problem,
in that they have to pay VAT whereas other schools do not? In a sense,
it is a really unlevel playing field. Colleges such as Brighton, Hove
and Sussex sixth-form college and Varndean college in my constituency
simply cannot understand why there are double standards, particularly
when we add in the fact that academies are being set up and getting

have argued that the cut announced just before Christmas is justifiable
because they want to focus spending on 16 and 17-year-olds, and because
18-year-old students would already have received two years of post-16
full-time study. Perhaps Ministers believe that the affected students
are undertaking a repeat year of study in order to resit their A-levels
and upgrade their results, but that is not the case at all. As has been
pointed out by the Association of Colleges, the 157 Group

students may have achieved good GCSE results at school but may have had
no opportunity to undertake vocational study at key stage 4. If they
wish to pursue a technical route, they cannot begin level 2 vocational
studies until they enter college post-16. Colleges report a reluctance
among, and lack of incentive for, schools to co-operate with them to
provide early vocational training to students aged 14 and 15, and it

college offers a vital second chance. These are the students who may

college setting. They may have had their education disrupted by health
problems or difficult family circumstances. Some will have started out
their studies in a school sixth form but will have left after the first

comment about potential alternative sources of funding that would allow
us to avoid the need to introduce this cut. On his comments about which
students will be most affected, an analysis of the situation at
Trafford college, which serves my constituents, bears out his concerns.
Ministers know that level 3 is the standard that employers increasingly
look for, and it is the standard that we should expect students to
achieve as a minimum. It is worrying that the majority of students at
Trafford who will be affected are studying vocational courses at level
3. The majority had low attainment at age 16 and, contrary to the
suggestion in the Government’s impact assessment, the majority
come from the borough’s most disadvantaged wards.</hs_Para>

carefully at the breakdown of the courses that students at Trafford
college are taking. They include English, maths, biology, chemistry,

maintenance and cabin crew training—a testament to the important
relationship that the college has forged with nearby Manchester
airport. Those courses could not be more pertinent or relevant to the
career prospects of young people, so it comes as no surprise that
college principals have expressed concern that a cut in funding, which
will have the effect of reducing access to such courses, increases the
risk of these young people becoming NEETs—not in education,
employment or
training.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000020"><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Gilbert" PimsId="5554" UID="14012852000149" xid="1188" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000149"><B>Stephen

Austell, and Truro and Penwith college. They say that very vulnerable
people, whom we should be helping the most to get that second chance in

are also, it is fair to say, a number of flaws in the methodology used
in the Government’s impact assessment. It compares 18-year-old
students with all 16 to 18-year-olds, not with 16 and 17-year-olds,
which means that the distinct circumstances and backgrounds of
18-year-old students and their particular needs and characteristics are
obscured. It fails to do a comparison with students in school sixth
forms, and so underplays the disproportionately diverse backgrounds of
FE and sixth-form college students. It ignores 18-year-olds studying
for between 450 and 539 hours, and it makes no mention of the disparity
between the funding for five to 15-year-olds, and the funding for 16 to
18-year-olds, which the Association of Colleges has pointed out already
stands at
22%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000026">Even
so, as the hon. Member for Cornwall—I forget the exact
constituency—<I>[Interruption.] </I>It is not all of Cornwall.
As the hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert) pointed
out, the impact assessment does acknowledge that there is a
disproportionate impact on disadvantaged students. A disproportionate
number of black and ethnic minority students are affected. It also
recognises that the majority of students affected are undertaking
vocational courses of
study.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000027">The
impact assessment recognises that five out of six students affected are
in FE colleges. That means in practice that the effect of the policy
overall is a 5% funding cut for FE colleges, compared with a 1% cut for
schools. It is likely that, in colleges, the effect will be felt not
just by 18-year-old students, but by all 16 to 18-year-old students,
because they are often taught together as a single
group.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000028">The
impact on colleges is compounded by the lagging in their funding, which
was highlighted when the Secretary of State appeared before the Select
Committee on Education on 18 December 2013. That lag means that the
effect of the introduction of a cut in August 2014 is that the funding
received for students who have already started two-year courses will be
at a rate lower than had been anticipated and budgeted for in their
second year. That means that colleges are having to rethink
fundamentally their budgets and business plans for next year, and their
future admissions policies. I was encouraged by the fact that the
Secretary of State recognised that point when it was raised with him at
the meeting of the Select Committee and agreed to give it further
consideration, including the possibility of delaying the cut until
September 2015. I very much hope that this Minister will be able to
update us today on what further thought has been given to
that.</hs_Para>

there are real concerns about the impact of the cut both on
institutions, especially further education colleges and sixth-form
colleges, and on the students that they teach. The
policy appears to run counter to all the Government’s ambitions
to increase social mobility, to invest in vocational education, to
increase the employability of young people at risk of becoming NEET,
and to level the funding playing field for colleges and
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000030">Of
course everyone understands the scale of the challenge, given the
financial settlement in the spending review 2015-16, but as has been
pointed out, other spending choices could have been made. As the Chair
of the Select Committee, the hon. Member for Beverley and Holderness
(Mr Stuart), pointed out on 18 December, colleges are losing out, while
free schools and academies are being funded for what he graphically
described as “phantom students”, often in areas where
there is already plenty of
provision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000031">The
Sixth Form Colleges Association points out that nine free schools for
16 to 19-year-olds established since 2011 will educate just 1,557
students when they have recruited fully in line with their
plans—if they manage to do so—compared with an average of
1,687 students per single sixth-form college, so the investment in free
schools certainly does not look like an efficient use of funds at a
time when spending for this age group is under such
pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000032">Against
that background, the choice to cut funding for vocational training, and
to cut funding that is more likely to reach students from less
advantaged backgrounds—the very group that the system has
repeatedly failed—seems at best ill informed and at worst simply
perverse. That approach is likely to have a far-reaching impact on the
life chances and prospects of the very group of young people for whom
we should want to do most. I very much hope that Ministers will take a
step back for further reflection and rethink their approach, given the
widespread concerns, and I very much look forward to the
Minister’s response to those
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000033"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="14012852000153" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000153">Several

students and, I guess, most people in this room have followed a fairly
orthodox path in education: attending school from 11 to 16, staying on
to 18 or going into further education, and subsequently going to
university or into employment. That is a fairly characteristic profile.
Most people, when they look back at their own 
<?notus-xml column=196?>educational history, will see that they have that characteristic
profile, but some people find themselves at the age of 18 still in FE.
These are to some extent the exceptions, rather than the rule, and a
decision has in effect been made to fund them less, so colleges will
provides less for them, opportunities will diminish for them, and
courses specifically for them will decrease. We have to ask ourselves,

fairly clear on some things. These people are certainly not the
disabled, for whom special provision is made. They are not those
without qualifications in English and maths, because they will not be

and that seems to be agreed both by the colleges and by the Department
for Education. There is some dispute between the Department and the
colleges about whether they are disproportionately from socially
deprived areas, because I understand that the impact assessment from
the Department says that they are not. They are certainly not repeat
grade hunters, as the hon. Lady made clear; they are not people just
looking to enhance an already good educational career. They are not
eternal students—people wanting to do courses just for the sake
of it. They are people who are there for a specific

are talking about people who are likely to have had a slightly
unorthodox educational career. They are likely to be people who have
made mistakes, either in course choice or in their adolescent life, as
many people do. They are likely to be people who have encountered
social or emotional problems during their education. I notice that the
hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes), who will
speak later, has tabled several questions along those lines, asking
what happens to children who, through no fault of their own, have lost
out on a year or two because of illness. During my A-level years, I had

will be affected are disproportionately likely to be on vocational
courses, and they are more likely to suffer as a result of not
completing their course. The cost of not funding those students is
potentially considerable, and the risks are appreciable. The Government
will respond that savings must be made somewhere, and that it is not
fair to criticise the Government without suggesting other ways in which
savings might be made. I agree with the hon. Member for Stretford and
Urmston that an audit of the academy and free schools programme would
realise significant funds that could be used to defray those costs,
because, frankly, money is being squandered in that area. The
Government can do some good by making that move, and they can reduce
the risk.</hs_Para>

John Denham</B> (Southampton, Itchen) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate
the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) on obtaining
this important debate. I want to start by asking the Minister a
question that sixth-form colleges have raised with me—how he
thinks colleges should respond to the cut. Now that full-time students
aged 18 will be funded by some £700 a year less than other
students, it is not clear whether he thinks that colleges should
continue to support those students in their third year with the same
quality of education despite not having the money to do so, or whether
he wants colleges to offer such students only two years of education.
It is important to have a clear answer to that question on the
record.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012852000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000045">I want to
focus on a few matters to do with Southampton. Two consequences of the
policy have not been made clear by the Government. Although the
Government have said that they will try to protect the base budget,
colleges do not teach the students in question separately, so the
effect will be felt across the college. The decision will concentrate
the cuts on a subset of colleges, particularly those in areas with a
higher than average level of deprivation and areas of historically
weaker school performance, which will throw up more able students who
require a third year to reach level 3 or A-level. The decision will
target colleges in relatively small areas, because a concentration of
students from more deprived backgrounds with weaker prior school
attainment will not be offset by a wider catchment area of students who
do not suffer such disadvantages.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14012852000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000046">That, in a
nutshell, is the position that Southampton faces. There are two
sixth-form colleges and City college, which is the FE college. They all
perform well on inspections and completion rates, but they have a
disproportionate number of students with weaker  prior school
attainment and higher levels of deprivation. The principals estimate
that the cut across the three colleges is approximately
£500,000. In City college, of the 246 18-year olds, 78% have not
yet achieved a C at GCSE English or maths, so they have yet to achieve
the basic level of attainment that we are all aiming for; 44% are from
disadvantaged postcodes; and 44% are taking level 3 courses. At Richard
Taunton sixth-form college there are 212 18-year-olds, of whom 46% come
from priority neighbourhoods. Of those third-year students, 49% took a
level 2 course before progressing to level 3, 28% are on bursaries to
support their attendance and 24% speak English as a second
language.</hs_Para>

Minister not only to clarify the aim of the policy but to understand
how his decision targets institutions such as those in Southampton. In
the impact statement, the estimate of the impact on sixth-form colleges
is 1.2%. I can only say that some sixth-form colleges must be barely
affected, because the effect is nothing like that for the sixth-form
colleges that my constituents
attend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000048"><Member ContinuationText="Kerry McCarthy" PimsId="4810" UID="14012852000157" xid="812" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000157"><B>Kerry
McCarthy</B> (Bristol East) (Lab):</Member> I have had an e-mail from
the principal of the sixth-form college in my constituency, who says
that the cut to that institution is 17.5%, which will affect 120
students. The college will lose £85,000 of funding that had
already been committed, so it will be hit incredibly hard. I agree with
my right hon. Friend; I just do not know where that figure

a fine tradition of sixth-form colleges. Some of the best in the
country can be found in our fine county, including Peter Symonds
college, which I attended. However, my constituency has no sixth-form
provision whatsoever in the state sector, which means that virtually
every 16 to 19-year-old is sent elsewhere. The colleges that they
attend have different specialisms and are of very different sizes. Some
focus on vocational training and others are highly academic. They cater
for different types of students from different backgrounds, some of
whom have excelled at GCSE and some of whom have not.</hs_Para>

mention some of those colleges, not as an exercise in name checking my
favourite college principals but to highlight the variety of
experience. Some are huge, including Peter Symonds college, Barton
Peveril sixth-form college and Brockenhurst college, all of which cater
for well over 3,000 students. Others are much smaller. It is a pleasure
to follow my neighbour, the right hon. Member for Southampton, Itchen
(Mr Denham), who mentioned Richard Taunton college, which is less than
half the size of some of the bigger colleges in the area. Brockenhurst
has a particular specialism in special educational needs, and when I
visited last year I was particularly impressed with its dedication to
those who faced different learning challenges. Sparsholt college, one
of the country’s leading land-based colleges, provides a
significant focus on vocational qualifications. It has emphasised that
it has only 44 18-year-old A-level students, but it has 358
18-year-olds on vocational courses.</hs_Para>

students need an additional year at college, and what would be the
financial impact on colleges? I will not revisit the VAT issue, but the
Minister is well aware of it. There are many reasons why a young person
might not achieve the results to which they aspire at GCSE, at A-level
or in a vocational course. We all remember the problems with GCSE
English last year, which in Hampshire particularly affected boys, and I
recall how the colleges I have mentioned really stepped up to the plate
and met those challenges. They compromised, put on additional classes
and held resits of English GCSE. How much less flexible might they have
been if they had thought that a fiscal penalty would result from their
keeping those young people for another year?</hs_Para>

Brockenhurst, which has a phenomenal track record of helping those with
physical disabilities and special educational needs? Why should it
receive less funding for a third year of study for a student who has
overcome physical problems, as a result of which they need an extra
year of study? Surely, we want to 
<?notus-xml column=199?>encourage young people to stay in education to achieve their maximum
potential and we do not want to give colleges a reason to say
no.</hs_Para>

mother of a 15-year-old, so I have been completing college application
forms recently. I was struck by the additional information form that
was required by the outstanding college in Hampshire, which asked for
any additional reasons why a student might not complete their study,
and I wonder how much more rigorous such forms will become. Two years
ago I visited April House, a specialist eating disorder unit in the
constituency of my neighbour, the right hon. Member for Southampton,
Itchen. I emphasise that although eating disorders can affect anybody,
they particularly strike 17-year-old girls who are high achievers
academically. Three of the girls I met were at the same sixth-form
college, but their studies had been disrupted—forced to a
temporary halt—by their condition. It was not their fault, it
was not the college’s fault and it certainly was not their
parents’ fault, but all three girls had been negatively
affected. Nevertheless, they were hoping to go back to college. I do
not want colleges to have an excuse to say no to that type of
student—to see illness as a reason not to accept them back on to
their course because they can foresee a negative fiscal impact in
having them
back.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000056">There
are some great colleges that do a brilliant job of getting teenagers
back on the road to education. I cite in particular Richard Taunton
college, and we have heard the figures from the right hon. Member for
Southampton, Itchen: 212 of 1,159 full-time students are 18, and 30% of
them have come from other colleges. I always used to say to students,
“You’re a long time old. Education is critical, but
getting it wrong, admitting that you have made a mistake, making the
necessary changes and moving on is all part of the learning
process.” I will be a lot more reluctant to say that to them
now.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000057">I
have 20 seconds, but I wanted to touch on the subject of summer-born
babies, who we know are statistically likely to perform less well than
their older classmates. That is measureable through GCSEs, A-levels and
university admissions. What about those teenagers who, just through a
freak of their date of birth, might require resits to achieve the
required
grade?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000058">I

Burden</B> (Birmingham, Northfield) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) on
securing this debate, and I am happy to follow some excellent
Back-Bench speeches. The policy we are debating will stop people
getting the second chances that they need. If they do not have such
chances, their life opportunities will be restricted, but it will also
be bad for us and for the
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000060">We
all proclaim how much we support apprenticeships and welcome measures
that are taken to boost them. Often, however, we know that far too few
apprenticeship schemes reach the hardest-to-reach young people; the
ones who, for good or ill, have been passed over by education up to and
sometimes over the age of 16. Education has not given them the start in
adult life that 
<?notus-xml column=200?>they would want. As well as being bad for young people, that is bad for
the economy. It actually costs us as taxpayers in the long run, as well
as the Government. That cost will not be taken away simply by cutting
housing benefit for young people at some point down the
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000061">We
also need those young people. The level and number of apprenticeships
is often most advanced in the larger companies. They have the cushion
of size—the human resources departments and the rest of
it—to cope. For small companies, taking on apprentices can seem
complicated and daunting. They are not sure what is at end of it. That
is why they need the confidence that they can go forward with
young—sometimes not so young—people who are job-ready, or
at least ready to be upskilled. That is where further education comes
into the picture to provide the necessary education, training and
aspiration, which are precisely what the policy is going to
hit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000062">Of
those in further education, 71% of those over 18 are studying
vocationally based courses. Two thirds of the young people affected are
disadvantaged in some way and require additional support. As other
Members have said, we may be talking about black and minority ethnic
students, or those with lower attainment at 16. At Bournville college
in my constituency, 68% of those affected are likely to be
disadvantaged in some way, including by previous poor attainment,
deprivation, disability and learning difficulties. What impact will
that have on the young—sometimes not so young—people who
need support so that they have life chances? Who will provide job-ready
or training-ready people for the firms that need
them?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000063">A
lot of what I and other Members have said about post-18 education
sounds like we are talking about people who are just over 18, going
into their 20s. I have said several times that they are sometimes not
so young—people who need chances later in life will also be hit.
Look at the numbers of people we are talking about in my constituency.
In December 2009, there were 100 people aged 24 and under
who had been claiming benefits for more than 12 months. In December
2013, there were 240. That has more than doubled. There is a persistent
problem of long-term unemployment among young people. If we look at the
equivalent figures for people over the age of 24, there were 360 in
December 2009 and 785 in December 2013. If we are to do something about
increasing the chances for young people hit by persistent, long-term
unemployment—even if there is a dip in unemployment
overall—the policy we are debating will take us in the opposite
direction from achieving
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000064">I
know that the Minister will say that hard choices have to made, and
they do, but we cannot simply do the sums and trade off chances up to
16, at 16 to 18 and post-18. We can do the sums in a different way. Let
us start factoring in the cost to us, to taxpayers and to the young
people themselves if they do not get life chances because their
education is cut in an arbitrary, ill-targeted way. That is what the
Government are doing with this policy. I plead with the Minister to
think about it again. He will see that the objections do not come just
from the Opposition; they come from the Government Benches as well. I
really hope that he will rethink on this
issue.</hs_Para>

concern is that the funding cut will disproportionately affect those
towns where further education and sixth-form colleges are playing a
major role in the education of 18-year-olds. That is the situation in
Lowestoft in my constituency. I am grateful to the Minister for
listening to the concerns that have been raised with him in recent
weeks. In this instance, I am concerned that although the Government
have carried out an impact assessment of their decision, they have
failed to highlight the fact that the impact of the policy is
concentrated in specific locations where it will hit
certain—often vulnerable—communities
hard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000067">There
are four reasons why I believe that the proposed cuts will hit
Lowestoft particularly hard. First, schools in Suffolk are not
currently doing as well as they should be. Lowestoft college and
Lowestoft sixth-form college are doing important work to address the
situation, which often involves students staying on in education or
training for an extra year. As a fellow Suffolk MP, the Minister will
be familiar with the need to raise standards and levels of achievement
in schools across the county. A variety of measures have been put in
place, by both the Government and the local education authority, to
address challenges and raise standards, but they will take some time to
come to fruition. In the meantime, the two colleges are playing an
extremely important role which should not be
undermined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000068">A
high proportion of the students who have become disengaged while at
school either need to resit GCSEs or are following a vocational course.
Lowestoft college advises that only some of its students follow the
traditional course of completing GCSEs at 16, doing two years at
A-level and then going to university. Instead, many pursue a variety of
different paths that may include, for instance, a year at level 2
followed by two years at level 3. As a result, 25% of the 16
to 18-year-old students are aged 18 at the start of each academic year.
That brings me to my second point: all post-16 mainstream education in
Lowestoft is provided in the two colleges and there are no other
schools or colleges where students can take A-levels. That is because
four years ago, when the schools moved from a three-tier to a two-tier
education system, it was decided to discontinue the individual sixth
forms in each high school and replace them with a single sixth-form
college—a centre of excellence. That was a good idea, and it is
working, but the reduction in funding could undermine much of the good
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000069">My
third point is that in Lowestoft there is a higher than average
percentage of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds living in deprived
areas. Research by the Association of Colleges shows that 18-year-old
learners are more likely to live in deprived areas than 16 or
17-year-old learners. There is a real worry that disadvantaged students
will be hit the hardest as they are the ones who take longer to finish
courses. That could have a negative knock-on effect on the number of
NEETs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000070"><Member ContinuationText="Jason McCartney" PimsId="5697" UID="14012852000162" xid="1044" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000162"><B>Jason
McCartney</B> (Colne Valley) (Con):</Member> I declare a personal
interest. I never went to university; I attended a vocational college
course. Kirklees college in Huddersfield is transforming young
people’s lives under the inspirational 
<?notus-xml column=202?>leadership of Peter McCann. My hon. Friend has rightly highlighted what
colleges give post-18 learners and the challenges that they face: in my
area, for example, there are pupils who have recently moved to this
country, who have behavioural difficulties, who have been in care, who
are pregnant or for whom English is not their first language. Will he

should be pointed out that larger colleges with larger budgets are
better placed to handle reductions in funding; they may have more room
to manoeuvre and put in place their own mitigating measures. Lowestoft
college and Lowestoft sixth-form college are relatively small. Although
they are performing extremely well in challenging circumstances, they

should also be noted that the late announcement of the decision has
made it difficult for colleges to make contingency arrangements. I am
grateful to the Minister for listening. For the reasons that I have
outlined, I believe that the measure hits Lowestoft particularly hard.
As I look around the Chamber, I realise that there are numerous such
communities all over the country. In Lowestoft, we have two colleges
that are playing a vital role in difficult circumstances, raising
educational standards and providing young people with the skills that
they need to take up a variety of opportunities. The two colleges need
the resources to carry on with that excellent work, and the proposal
both handicaps them and penalises 18-year-olds living in Lowestoft,
where there are no school sixth-form colleges for them to
attend.</hs_Para>

issues here: the cut itself, and the unfairness of it—not just
the £700 per student, but the impact on individual institutions
and the manner of its introduction, which has not been particularly
mentioned and which I will discuss in a moment. The Government’s
own impact assessments says that the measure will hit further education
colleges disproportionately, much worse than schools. I quote from the
impact assessment:</hs_Para>

highlighted, the measure clearly hits vocational students much worse
than academic students, due to the need to stay longer on vocational
courses. Critically, it hits London worse than other regions, including
Hackney community college in my constituency, which has imaginatively
gone with the flow of many funding changes over the years but is once
again being penalised for doing excellent work with 18-year-olds. Only
last week I visited the college, meeting three students who had had
difficulty achieving at GCSE level but had found at the
college—one was becoming a chef, one went into painting and
decorating and another was on a fashion course—vocations that
worked for them and gave them the opportunity to achieve and secure
jobs. However, they were over
18.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000080">Areas
with high numbers of black and minority ethnic pupils and disadvantaged
students are particularly hit, which is a double whammy for Hackney
South and Shoreditch and other disadvantaged areas. I take the
Government at their word about their desire for greater social
mobility—I represent an area where that is an important
issue—yet I say to the Minister that I cannot see how the
measure will help social mobility. It is disadvantaged students who
need a second chance sometimes, as highlighted by the hon. Member for
Romsey and Southampton North (Caroline Nokes), or who often just choose
a different path of study that does not fit within the traditional
tramlines for 16 to 18-year-olds. In further education environments,
particularly Hackney community college, classes are very mixed, so it
is not abnormal for 17 and 18-year-olds and much older pupils to be
there. Sometimes students in a class range from mid-teens to late
adulthood, as the painter and decorator to whom I talked last week
highlighted, so 18-year-olds will often be in a class among other
people.</hs_Para>

would discuss the manner of the announcement. It was made very late, at
the end of last year, with little, if any, discussion and no time for
colleges to prepare. Colleges plan their academic studies ahead.
Suddenly shifting course at such short notice is challenging. They will
have made commitments to teachers and lecturers and tried to secure
students through recruitment routes. Although they can often adapt at
short notice, it is ridiculous and not very sensible for a major
education sector—one that is within the Minister’s
purview—to have to cobble things together in that way. It is not
as though it were a great surprise that the Government are trying to
manage the budget in this way and by taking such measures, so a little

colleges as it does, the measure goes against the policy intent and
last year’s moves to equalise school and college funding. Can
the Minister clarify one particular point? If a child is 18 years old
on 1 or 2 September—old for their cohort, but within the normal
cohort—will their funding be cut? I imagine not, but it would be
good if he were explicit about it. I also point out that as others have

alternative to a smoothing budget might be a flat-rate reduction across

be a fairer spread, allowing colleges to plan better. We recognise the
challenge in funding, but this way is the wrong

education and sixth-form sector has been neglected and under-supported
for many decades. It has not had the rightful support that it needs,
which is a great shame, because it does extremely well with the
resources that it has. We have heard that education for 16 to
18-year-olds gets about 22% less funding than for pupils up to 16,
which seems problematic. We in Cambridge are hit particularly hard,
because our county gets the lowest funding in the country for all
schools, followed by poor funding afterwards. That is a separate issue
and not for the Minister, but I hope the Government will correct the
long-standing anomaly that pupils in Cambridgeshire get £600
less each per year than the English average. That does not seem fair to

Hills Road sixth-form college has a national reputation for leading the
way in the sector. If one looks at entry into Oxbridge, which I do not
think is the only way to measure success, its performance is right up
there; it gets more pupils in than anywhere other than Eton and
Westminster, and it is a state-funded sixth-form college. That is what

Government changes, of which the measure we are discussing is one, will

that next. I have debated this matter in the House, as have many other
hon. Members. One big problem is that the general education sector does
not have to pay VAT, but the sixth-form sector does. If equal money is
given at the beginning but one sector has to pay VAT and the others do
not, that is a huge problem. A sixth-form college’s VAT load is
typically £300,000. If the Minister could fix the problem with
the Treasury, that would be solved. Cambridge Regional college pays
£1 million in VAT. That is a huge difference and there should be

high-funded sixth-form colleges, and it gets hit by another
£70,000 or so, and pupils will miss out as a result. It was also
hit years ago, because the Learning and Skills Council told it to put

post-16 there are two types of institution: widening participation
institutions, which include further education colleges and about half
of sixth-form colleges, and selective institutions, including most
schools and some sixth-form colleges. Essentially, the measure will hit
widening participation colleges, which take a gamble, or work to
invest, in students that are highest-risk in respect of Ofsted outcomes
and in terms of needing the most work in them while they are there; and
now they are the highest-risk in terms of cash. Hon. Members are right

types of students are affected: first, those who have not achieved
their five A* to C grades at the end of compulsory education, coming to
16, and need an extra year to do their intermediate level, before going
on; secondly, those who change course during their level 3 provision,
often for good reasons, and take three years 
<?notus-xml column=207?>to do their level 3; and thirdly, students who have to take a year out
to care for somebody or to have a baby, or for other crises that
happen. These are the hardest students to support and they are the
biggest risk, and now they bring in the least money. So the measure is
damaging in that regard. It also contradicts the Government’s
framework. To raise participation age, for example, there should be
rewards, not penalties, for taking these students forward. There is a
desire to close the achievement gap and these are the very students to
whom that applies. There is a desire to invest in vocational education
and the Government’s own impact assessment demonstrates that
this is hitting vocational education worst of all. Everybody recognises
that the forgotten 50% need further investment and these

said that, in the area of Leicester in which his inclusive college

might start to say, “Thank you, goodbye” to these

that schools would at the end of the first year send students with Ds

students will be too high-risk. There is a danger that we will let down
a generation—this forgotten 50%—yet again. There will be

Their funding from September is based on decisions that they and the
students took a year previously, so there is no way of escaping from
that or adjusting the intakes. I do not argue, in any case, that
intakes should be adjusted. The colleges are there to help people who
will benefit. To go back to the analysis, I take the view that about
10% to 20% of people in their teens should be able to get out of the
school and college system a year early, and about 10% to 20% could take
an extra year at least. I do not think that we are all so normal and

people get to college at all: Worthing college was built 40 years ago
for 600 students and there are now about 2,000, which is a sign of
growth not just in population but participation. Northbrook college has

Steve Reed</B> (Croydon North) (Lab):</Member> The proposal to cut
further education funding for 18-year-olds disproportionately will have
a major impact on disadvantaged young people in Croydon North. I spent
some time last week at Croydon college so that I could better
understand the impact of the decision, and was  
<?notus-xml column=209?>alarmed to learn that the college believes that it will be the worst-hit
general further education institution in the country
if the cuts are imposed as the Government
intend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000118">Many
incorrect assumptions underlie the Government’s decision. The
assumption that 18-year-olds require fewer taught hours is simply
wrong. At Croydon college, as at many other FE colleges, students with
a range of ages are taught together, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) described. Eighteen-year olds cannot
be separated out from their classmates and put on to different
programmes with fewer hours’ teaching time, so the cuts will
affect students of all ages—something that the Government have
said they want to avoid. Further, 18-year-old students are often the
ones with the most risk of not being in education, employment or
training, as a result of failure to achieve in education at an earlier
age. They are often returning to make up for past failure and they need
additional support, not less, to achieve. The Government have often
stated that they want to reduce the number of young people who are not
in education, employment or training. Yet the proposal will have the
opposite
effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000119">Croydon
North has a higher rate of unemployment than any neighbouring
constituency and high levels of poverty and disadvantage. Many of my
younger constituents attend Croydon college, trying to better
themselves and make themselves more employable, but the cuts are
particularly acute for the college. Nationally, 22% of learners in the
16 to 18 group are aged 18, but at Croydon college the figure is 35%;
students in that age group are more likely than 16 or 17-year-olds to
be from deprived backgrounds or minority ethnic groups, and are the
least likely to have achieved level 2 by the time they enter
college.</hs_Para>

impact on Croydon college will be upwards of £511,000. That is a
higher percentage of the college’s total budget than elsewhere
because of the higher proportion of students that will be affected. The
college informs me that that is the highest percentage reduction in
funding for any college in the sector. Given the level of deprivation
that many of the students live with, and how hard they are trying to
turn their fortunes around, cuts on that scale are a bitter blow that
will severely damage our community as a whole. The cut, which comes
without consultation, runs contrary to the Government’s policy
on raising the participation age and supporting young people to stay
longer in education and training, to develop the higher-level skills
that the economy needs. That is vital if we want to improve our
competitiveness
globally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012852000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012852000121">The
young people affected are not, as the Secretary of State imagines, in
need only of a short period of study to resit their A-levels. They may,
for instance, need a longer programme of study to improve their maths
and English so that they can secure a traineeship or make themselves
employable. I urge the Minister to reconsider the proposal and to
minimise the impact on the most disadvantaged young people by adopting
a different funding formula that recognises the needs and aspirations
of young people from the most deprived communities, instead of cutting
their future off at the
knees.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_28_PT_1/709651F6CC80AF164391E225FD4AA034000DBA62" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="28 January 2014">Tuesday

pointing out that the effect on students in our town will be hugely
damaging. Hopwood Hall does a fantastic job, providing young people
with vocational skills and enabling them to achieve their educational
and employment goals. It also runs an excellent trainer restaurant,
where I have eaten—the Riverside restaurant. It is an excellent
venue with great food. There is a catering department, which provided
the cake for my relatively recent wedding; the hair and beauty salon at

am extremely concerned that the good work done by colleges such as
Hopwood Hall will be undermined by the cuts. I am told that it is
expected that more than 400 students will be hit by the changes, and
the college stands to lose some £400,000 in teacher funds. We
all know that inequality in society is partly caused by inequality in
education, and the funding cut will serve only to widen that
inequality. As Derek O’Toole, the college’s excellent

the Department’s impact assessment, which is clearly faulty, as
other hon. Members have pointed out. I find it shocking that the

limiting the potential of students such as those who attend Hopwood

particularly in FE colleges. I represent a London constituency and have
received representation from the FE college that I attended. There will
be a disproportionate impact in London because of the high number of
young people who continue their post-16 education in FE colleges and
the high number of ethnic minority students. The Government’s
belated impact assessment also highlights the disproportionate impact
on ethnic minority groups, white people from disadvantaged backgrounds

worried about lack of consultation and the irresponsible and reckless
way in which the decision was made. The Minister should know better

with a set of decisions that will cause disruption. I appeal to the
Minister to listen to my hon. Friends, and his many hon. Friends, who
said that the decision must be rethought. At the very least, we need
some breathing room for FE colleges so that there is no disruption in

likely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000010">There
is deep and genuine concern that there will be a disproportionate
effect on young people who desperately need a second chance. Almost all
hon. Members highlighted that. For various reasons and in various
circumstances, as the hon. Member for Romsey and Southampton North

women who are high achievers, may suffer crises—bereavement is
an example—and may need an additional year. It is unbelievable
that the Government are so short-sighted that such circumstances are
not taken into account, because those young people may end up with the
other 900,000 who are not in education, employment or training. Surely
we should not increase the number of people in that category. Surely
the Minister wants young people to stay in the education system and
take vocational courses, so that they can service our economy, which
needs the technical skills and high-quality apprenticeship schemes that
FE colleges are increasingly delivering.</hs_Para>

a response from them. We will certainly look at the issues and at how
we respond when we form a Government. There are deep concerns about the
issue, and we need to look at how to ensure parity across providers. He
should focus his question at the Minister. Too often, the Government
throw questions back at the Opposition as though we were still in

want to highlight the issue of the education maintenance allowance,

adding to the number of people in that category, which surely cannot be

conclude by reiterating points that colleagues in all parts of the
Chamber have mentioned: the disproportionate impact on those who need a
second chance; the pressures on the FE sector at a time when it already
faces drastic changes and cuts; and the fact that the FE sector often
takes risks with students whom other institutions are not prepared to
take, as hon. Friends have
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000016">The
Government’s decision and their belated impact assessment, which
acknowledges the disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups,
suggest that the Minister is, at best, indifferent to the impact on
some groups. Considering the high number of black Caribbean boys and
white working-class boys who are affected, it is shocking that the
Minister is not taking the issue seriously. I hope that he will do so
today, because we cannot tolerate the creation of greater inequality
and social immobility. The Government’s policy is damaging for
young people in general and particularly those  who need a
second chance, and it is damaging for our economy, our society and our
ambition of promoting equality of opportunity and social mobility. It
is a complete contradiction of the Government’s rhetoric. I hope
that the Minister will think again and consider the issues that hon.

is a great pleasure, Mr Williams, to respond, under your chairmanship,
to a forthright debate. I am grateful for the opportunity to set out
the context and some of the issues surrounding our decision, which was
not an easy one to take. Many of the points raised were not quite
accurate, so I hope to provide some reassurance on them, and on how we
will deal with the impact on individual colleges, not least because
several hon. Members raised the concerns of colleges that are
particularly hard hit; I am looking at the hon. Member for Croydon
North (Mr Reed). At the moment, we are confirming with colleges the
individual allocations.</hs_Para>

to the meat of the debate, let me say that the process for making the
decision was completely in line with the process for making such
funding decisions under this Government and the previous Government.
Say that following the overall allocation in a spending 
<?notus-xml column=213?>round, it becomes clear that savings have to be made in the Department
for Education, outside the ring fence for education for 5 to
16-year-olds; the overall funding policy for the following academic
year should be set out before Christmas, in December, in a letter from
the Education Funding Agency. That is the normal way of doing things.
Someone implied a criticism of the EFA, but there should be absolutely
no criticism of the EFA over this, because such decisions rightly rest
with Ministers. In February, normally, we come up with the allocations
for individual colleges. That is the process we are going through: we
are looking at the impact on colleges. We have estimates of those
impacts, but we need confirmation from each college. That is the normal
process, followed by the previous Government as well as this one. There
has not been a problem in the process, but we can go into the
individual
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Nic Dakin" PimsId="5672" UID="14012853000116" xid="1143" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000116">Nic
Dakin:</Member></B> First, earlier information about a cut would have
been helpful and welcomed by colleges. Secondly, although the process
described by the Minister is accurate, for the first time that I can

they are on a two-year course, the cut will impact on them and, because
of the lagged funding, that is particularly
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000020"><B><Member ContinuationText="Matthew Hancock" PimsId="5575" UID="14012853000117" xid="1157" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000117">Matthew
Hancock:</Member></B> I will certainly respond to that point. The irony
for those already in education who are affected by this decision is
that the funding is being returned to the 2012-13 level that it was at
when they enrolled. An important piece of context has not yet been
mentioned: the decision, which regrettably had to be made because of
pressures on the public finances, changes funding for 18-year-olds back
to the 2012-13 level. I understand and appreciate the pressures on the
budgets of FE colleges, but in 2012-13, pupils were funded for 450
hours, and we raised that to 540 hours—an increase of 16 and two
thirds per cent.—and we are now debating a cut of 17.5%, which
is of almost exactly the same order of magnitude. The discussion about
the impact on colleges and the conversations with college principals
need to happen in the context of the fact that this changes the funding
rate per pupil for 18-year-olds back to 2012-13 levels, which was only
last
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000021"><Member ContinuationText="Rehman Chishti" PimsId="5607" UID="14012853000118" xid="1077" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000118"><B>Rehman

were faced with a cut across Government to make savings to reach our

even bigger deficit three years ago. We all know who is responsible for
that. There is tension on the Opposition Benches between those who
recognise and acknowledge the need to deal with the problems left by
the Labour Government and the others. Not least, I recognise the
reasonable approach taken, and the suggestion of alternatives, by the
hon. Members for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) and for
Rochdale (Simon Danczuk); that is in contrast simply to complaining
about things and saying, “Aren’t we in a terrible
mess?” It is difficult being a Minister when there is no money
left, but we all know whose fault that is. I will not stress that any
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000024">I
care about the individual impact on colleges. For example, I would be
delighted to visit Cambridge—I think I have a campaigning visit
in the diary. According to our figures, which we are in the middle of
confirming with colleges, as a result of the decision, Long Road
sixth-form college will have a reduction in funding of 0.7% and Hills
Road college of 0.2%. Those figures are to be confirmed with the
institutions, but that is the scale in those instances. The impact
assessment sets out the effect for types of
colleges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000025">The
reason for our decision is partly that it is in tune with other things
that we are trying to do, not least raise the participation age. Many
people have talked about NEETs, and I bow to no one in my support for
FE colleges and their work in reducing the number of NEETs, but the
biggest impact comes from the level of education at the age of 16, and
from those who are in FE at 16 and 17 and whom we have to keep there.
We are raising the participation age up to 18 years, with cross-party
agreement, and are insisting that everyone stays in some form of
education up to that age. We are focusing the funding on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000026">The
reasons underpinning the funding decision, therefore, are the decision
to return funding for 18-year-olds to last year’s levels; our
raising of the participation age; the need to do so much work to ensure
that people stay in education at 16 and 17; and the fact that on
average—this is not the case for everyone—18-year-olds
spend less time on their education, even when it is full-time
education. Furthermore, as the impact assessment says—this ought
to be recognised in the debate—those who are 18 in education are
no more likely to be disadvantaged than anyone
else.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Julian Lewis" PimsId="1486" UID="14012853000120" xid="358" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000120">Dr

sixth-form or FE college has a private sector designation from the
Office for National Statistics that leads to the VAT charge, but it
also gives the college much more power over borrowing. On the one hand,
a sixth-form or FE college has much more power to 
<?notus-xml column=215?>manage its finances, but on the other hand, it has to pay VAT. I note
that in the past couple of years, there have been two new sixth-form
colleges. Yes, there have been new 16-to-19 free schools, but there
have also been new sixth-form colleges, so some people have taken the
decision, even though they know that they will have to pay VAT, to go
down the sixth-form college route, because they get extra flexibility
in managing their finances. I completely acknowledge the VAT issue, but
there is a flip side to the argument, which is why some people go for
paying the VAT, even though they might not need to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012853000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000030"><B><Member ContinuationText="Eric Ollerenshaw" PimsId="5665" UID="14012853000122" xid="1229" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0001.htm#14012853000122">Eric

Rights is not a modern invention. Indeed, next year we celebrate the
800th anniversary of Magna Carta, which was agreed not too far away
from here and is the root of so much that then followed. The need to
enshrine our basic rights against arbitrary executive power is just as
necessary and just as resisted as it was all those centuries ago. It
was not until after the English civil war that, in 1689, the expression
“Bill of Rights” was first used, in an important statute
passed to define the role of the Crown. One hundred years later, it was
used not for a separate list but as the beating heart of the
constitution of the United States. These days, the expression is used
to refer to a document that has  some degree of constitutional
status and that declares the fundamental rights of all people by virtue
of their common humanity. A Bill of Rights is the human engine of our
democratic settlements, without which our constitutions, written or
not, are just hollow organisational charts.</hs_Para>

are described in different ways: basic, fundamental, inalienable,
inherent or natural rights, the rights of man or, in a limited context,
constitutional rights. We know that the expression “human
rights” was probably first used in Tom Paine’s
translation of the French Declaration of the Rights of Man. If I may, I
will wish Thomas Paine a happy 277th birthday for tomorrow. He was
England’s greatest political philosopher and democratic export,
and I dedicate this debate to him.</hs_Para>

Kingdom added to that rich vein in the 1940s by gifting to the rest of
Europe its convention on human rights, to enshrine the inalienable
rights that Tom Paine first put into words in 1791. That convention was
written by British lawyers and British politicians, and has been
adopted by 43 countries and over 800 million people. The
United Kingdom then ratified the convention in 1951 and with the
introduction of the Human Rights Act 1998, the European convention on
human rights was repatriated into UK law, allowing UK citizens to seek
redress in UK courts for human rights offences covered by the
ECHR.</hs_Para>

that is not the end of the story. As someone involved in this field on
the Front Bench in the early 1990s, I can personally testify that the
intention was to build on the ECHR and move forward to a British Bill
of Rights. However, the Executive power of today is just as anxious as
King John to avoid constraint and definition of its power. Our failure
to put in place that fundamental of democracy, a separation of powers,
means that the Executive have a control of Parliament that even Charles
I could only have dreamed about. The Government who should be held to
account by citizens are the very body who authorise the rights of those
citizens. That contradiction presents its own danger. As Professor

am pleased that the hon. Gentleman did not forget to say what we are

the rights, but I will state the convention rights that, at the moment,
are the nearest we have to a Bill of Rights. The Human Rights Act 1998
allows people to exercise those rights in our courts, and I think they
matter hugely to the people of Nottingham, Southwark, Hampshire, east
London and elsewhere, and we should get the message out loud and clear.
We do not do enough to ensure that people understand that they have the
following rights: the right to life and the abolition of the death
penalty; the prohibition of torture and inhuman or degrading treatment
or punishment; prohibition of slavery and forced labour; the right to
liberty and security  of the person; the right to a fair trial;
prohibition of punishment without law; the right to respect for private
and family life; the right to freedom of thought, conscience and
religion; the right to freedom of expression; the right to freedom of
assembly and association; the right for men and women to marry and
found a family; the right to peaceful enjoyment of personal property;
the right to education; the right to free elections; and the
prohibition of discrimination. There is no citizen or resident of this
country who would not sign up to those rights. Between us we clearly
have not done enough to get out the message on what we are talking

the basis that any such Bill would need to incorporate and build on all
the UK’s existing obligations under the European convention on

settlements. That was in line with the terms of reference that the

to own the constitutional settlement in our country and do not
understand that it is theirs and for them. It should be for the people,
not for the Government. Some of those in the majority favouring a Bill

neither the commission’s two consultations nor the

public support for a Bill of Rights in the responses received to the
two consultations that the commission held. They were concerned that
any move to a UK Bill of Rights would lessen the rights protection that
is currently available. They were also concerned that developing such a

dissenters, but a much larger majority, the commission could not reach
agreement on all its conclusions, and therefore, it put back to the
Government issues and places that they should consider for future

will appreciate that as a Plaid Chairman, Mr Williams, as I do very
clearly, as someone with Welsh, Scottish and English blood—and
the current state of devolution settlements, particularly with the
referendum in Scotland later this year, means that we should wait until
we know what the outcome of that is. Starting to talk about UK Bills of
Rights when we do not know the future of the UK would be unwise.
Of

de Bois:</Member></B> My hon. Friend anticipates me neatly. That 230
hours a year is equivalent to about 10 days—or, if we are more
realistic, 20 daylight days—which, over a working life of 40
years, is a year spent on a train. A commuter from my constituency will
pay £1,560 annually for the privilege. Is it any wonder that our
constituents rightly consider it a major issue? After all, it is a
question not of how much of their time is spent travelling to and from
work, but of their quality of life. If the daily commute does not go
well, it can affect the whole working day—our punctuality, our
reputation at work and, let us face it, our mood and our whole working
environment for the day.</hs_Para>

not good of having a pleasant experience, even if punctuality is not an
issue. At average peak times, commuters on most suburban lines face
tired rolling stock with precarious heating systems or, in summer,
carriages that feel like mobile greenhouses. They have a one in three,
possibly a one in four, chance of getting a seat, yet they pay the same
fare as their luckier neighbours. Often, to pick up the point made by
my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne (Mr Walker), my constituents
are undertaking only the first part of a two-part journey, as they will
then embark on the tube.</hs_Para>

our lives spent commuting is probably, in reality, more like two, which
is why the quality and reliability of our franchise operators, and
Network Rail’s maintenance of, and investment in,
infrastructure, is one of the big issues facing my constituents. That

terms.</hs_Para>

and superbly. Let us face it: technology should not bar that. I have
often seen, much to my surprise, a 
<?notus-xml column=230?>refund on my Oyster card. I am often not sure why  the Mayor of
London is being so generous in giving me that money back, but I have
seen it. It is a technology transfer; it works. With thousands of
commuters travelling every day, the introduction of a system like that
would, for the first time, truly represent the value of the
considerable buying power that these passengers should have. It is
interesting to note that on every pound spent by the fare-paying
passenger, FCC sees a net return of 3%—a 3% net profit. That
would not be unreasonable if service standards were maintained at the
highest level. Fares have increased substantially, but customers are
not benefiting from real choice. Let us at least give them real
influence.</hs_Para>

of accountability is not only one for FCC and its customers. What of
the relationship between FCC and Network Rail, from which FCC purchases
track access? That accounts for 48p in every pound that the customer
spends. Network Rail does not have accountability to passengers, but it
acts as a supplier to rail operating companies such as FCC. What
compensation do operators receive from Network Rail for service
failure, and if such an arrangement exists, what are the criteria for
receiving such compensation, and how is it accounted for? If such an
arrangement does not exist, surely it should. Without such a system, I
suggest that there is no accountability—perhaps not even
commercial accountability—between the provider and the customer.
Why should not compensation be passed down to passengers through the
excellent system that my hon. Friend the Member for Broxbourne has
advocated?</hs_Para>

heart sinks, because they know that there will be a queue of East Coast
trains in front of the FCC trains. In addition to the delay caused by
the diversion, all those trains will arrive at Finsbury Park and
King’s Cross at exactly the same time. This morning, for
instance, there was a problem at Hitchin—the points failed, I
believe—and I was delayed for about 35 minutes. When we got to
King’s Cross, we all sat outside the station as East Coast
trains came firing in and took all the berths. After passengers have
been delayed for more than 30 minutes, they are entitled to receive

interesting to see how my constituents use the Hertford loop. We often
get a fast train at Stevenage, so that we do not have to go on the
Hertford loop line, and then we change at Finsbury Park and continue on
the Hertford loop line to Liverpool Street. My constituents often get
off the train at Finsbury Park only to be told that there are problems,
so they have to wait for the next east coast main line or FCC main line
service to take them to King’s Cross, where they take the tube

high-ups—the suits—remain squirreled away in the train
company’s headquarters, rather than coming out to meet their

Friends and I made the same point in the meeting that I have just
mentioned. I was pleased that both companies apologised for the service
that our 
<?notus-xml column=232?>constituents received and tried to explain some of the reasons for it.
In fairness to FCC staff, many of them do a very good job. I understand
that during the recent delays, some of the higher-ups went out to
stations—they could not get to work either—and tried to
placate customers. We need to see more of that. I often tweet about how
good some of the FCC staff are on my journey to work.</hs_Para>

that particularly irritates my constituents is when their train is
delayed and they ask the ticket inspector what is causing the delay,
but the inspector—or payment protection officer, as they are
called—does not know. That poor member of staff may get grief
along the 12 carriages of the train as he checks tickets. That creates
dysfunctionality and reduces the quality of the passenger experience a
great deal. FCC needs to do a lot more work on getting information down
to staff, to ensure that those on the front line can communicate with
passengers.</hs_Para>

On a Monday evening, I am often using it at half-past 11, and if I see

know about repayments from my own experience. I buy what is called a
carnet that allows travel from Stevenage to King’s Cross via a
variety of routes. I could be reimbursed for my journey today, but I
will be perfectly honest: I cannot be bothered to fill in the paperwork
on a daily basis. I know that thousands of people in Stevenage will not
even bother to try to reclaim the cost for today from their season
ticket, because it is pointless. It is a waste of a huge amount of
energy and time; it would cost more than it is worth. Repayments should
be automatic. During some of the worst of the winter storms, First
Capital Connect said that tickets would be valid for use the following
day. That was a great improvement for some in my constituency, but not
for the majority who have season

railway system is broken. The previous Government did not invest and
co-ordinate in the way we would have hoped, but some problems that we
have seen on the line are actually the result of new investment. We
understand that one huge delay was the result of a new signalling 
<?notus-xml column=233?>system being installed and the circuit breaker burning out. The company
is trying to improve the signalling system, which must be fully
replaced in 18 months, but the amalgamation of the two systems is
causing great problems. I raise that issue because the whole line is 40
years old and must be replaced completely in the next five years. One
can imagine the horror felt by MPs and constituents who live along the
line at the thought of what is coming down the track towards us, or
possibly not coming down the track at all. There are huge
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000060">When
I met Network Rail and First Capital Connect with my hon. Friends the

what the root causes of the problems were. What really depressed the
three of us was the simple fact that there did not seem to be a root
cause. There was a variety of problems, one after the other. As they
fixed one, they moved on to another. I do not want to bore Members too
much, but on the Hertford loop line, they use class 313 carriages,
which are old-fashioned London Underground and Overground carriages. As
a result, the Hertford loop line is turned off of an evening. One
morning, when they tried to turn the electricity on the line back on,
it did not work. Perhaps someone had not paid the energy bill. No

would like to move on to some of the positives regarding First Capital
Connect, because I feel that it is getting a bit of a kicking from
Members, even though a lot of the problems—at least two
thirds—are the responsibility of Network Rail and are due to how
it integrates with First Capital Connect. During the First Capital
Connect franchise, more trains have been stopping at Stevenage, so we
have gained thousands more seats, many of which I have secured over my
past two or three years as an MP. We have had huge improvements to
bicycle racks, which have almost doubled in number. That is a big issue
in Stevenage. We are the only town in the country with an integrated
cycle network. Tens of thousands of us cycle everywhere in town. We
have had the platforms resurfaced and we now have 12-carriage trains
stopping at the town; the station is secure and we have better waiting
rooms; and both the signage and the customer information system have
improved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000062">In

to secure more than £578,000 from the Minister at the time, the
hon. Member for Lewes (Norman Baker), so if the current Minister is
listening, there are a number of things that I would like. That money
is being used to upgrade the goods lifts to fully automated passenger
lifts. The station has 4.2 million passenger movements, but it was
built in the ’60s—we still do not have fully automated
passenger lifts, and it is 2014. Thankfully, the work on that is now
ongoing. First Capital Connect is doing a good job—its mobility
teams help passengers with mobility difficulties up and down the
stairs—but the lifts will be a lifeline for the disabled and the
most vulnerable in our community. The station is also being

has been a huge range of improvements, but one of the main concerns of
my constituents remains the simple fact that we pay only for our
journeys. No matter how long the journey takes, the ticket does not 
<?notus-xml column=234?>entitle us to a seat on the train. It just entitles us to go from
Stevenage to London, or to Hertford,
Watton-at-Stone, Cuffley or Enfield. We pay for the journey only. As my
hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North said, it feels like there are
very few ways in which constituents and passengers can make their
points heard to the train operating companies because the franchises
last for so long. The debate is opportune because the franchise is due
for renewal in September this year. Like my hon. Friend, I would dearly

Enfield Chase, Winchmore Hill, Palmers Green and Bowes Park stations

that the train was no longer going to call at Enfield Chase, Grange
Park, Winchmore Hill, Palmers Green and Bowes Park, owing to an earlier
broken down train. Sadly, that is typical. There are not only delays,
but complete cancellations. People’s travel plans are thrown
into disarray by the fact that no trains will be stopping at certain
times. Commuters in particular must get to work on time. When they pay

my constituents have had to get used to tolerating the intolerable in
many ways—to the overcrowding and overheating of carriages, as
well as the delays. As my hon. Friend the Member for Enfield North
carefully outlined, the past three months have been totally
unacceptable. Passengers have been left literally stranded. They have
had to take a bike or find some way to get a bus—when it
arrives—to take them to tube stations. That is not

Network Rail, particularly, and others—and it hides behind its
specific contractual responsibility, saying that it is not responsible

different—“There is a 43% satisfaction rate; you should
be pleased with that.” It boasts that there has been a 10%
improvement on the previous year, and that the figure is 5% greater
than the average for London and the south-east. I hope the Minister
realises that those rates are not acceptable. Whether or not they are
the average, and whether or not there has been a 10% improvement, our

In the private sector and elsewhere, that satisfaction rate would not
be accepted. Those sectors would have to bring about serious changes to

because a lot of maintenance has been going on. Every Sunday, ever
since I can remember, Winchmore Hill and services to Moorgate have been
shut down, with a replacement bus service—a big coach trundling
along our roads. People have seen that there is investment, but they

last September, commuters using both Hertford North and Bayford
stations have endured what can only be described as a third-rate
service from First Capital Connect. Admittedly, during the same period,
Greater Anglia has hardly covered itself in glory, but those on the
Hertford loop have suffered the most. As we have heard, for more than
four months, there have not simply been occasional problems, but daily
delays and frequent cancellations. When customer information has been
provided, as my hon. Friend accurately described, it has been
inconsistent, confusing and very often wrong, leading to our

that last autumn the weather was appalling. I understand, as do my
constituents, that the type of problems one has in a storm can be very
destructive for a rail service, but we do not understand why First
Capital Connect’s service was hit far worse and for far longer
than the service on comparable lines; nor do we understand why, three
or four months later, the problems have persisted through Christmas and
into the new year, and apparently will go on for weeks to come. Many of
my commuters have had to file claims for compensation—three to
four a week at the moment—for the lengthy delays that they are
enduring on almost every journey. Three to four claims a week is an
appalling indictment of what is meant to be a service.</hs_Para>

that, very often, however well-intentioned and genuinely motivated and
hard-working the front-line staff are—which they are—the

Hertford or Bayford. As somebody put it to me, “We often feel

to the Chamber and to my hon. Friends that this autumn’s
problems are not unusual for the line. In 2009 and 2010, passengers
from my constituency went through month after month of delays and
cancellations. We were told, first of all, that it was because of the
lack of drivers; that seemed to persist for several months. We then had
my favourite, which was “the wrong kind of snow”—a
novel explanation that the communications department would clearly have
been proud of. We then had signalling failure at a certain
point—it was never quite clear where that was, but it was always
at some stage along the line. What it meant in reality was that for
almost 12 consecutive months, we had a service that was, frankly,
lamentable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000086">Much
has rightly been made of punctuality and service. I looked at where the
company lies among its competitors; that would be grounds for a
reasonable judgment. The official statistics showed that in the year
2012-13—after the problems I have just described, when 
<?notus-xml column=238?>apparently things were settled—it achieved just 82.8%
punctuality, when the industry average was up to 88%. One might
reasonably assume that it would try to improve its game the following
year and get ahead of that, but not at all. In fact, the following year
it fell from that point down to 76%, which was among the worst in the
entire rail sector.</hs_Para>

described as a third-rate service is not new on this line. My
constituents have endured it for years. One only has to look at the
different passenger satisfaction surveys, rightly mentioned by my hon.

surveys on punctuality, value for money, or overall satisfaction, time

Capital Connect of course relies on Network Rail and has cited it as a
regular cause of its failure. It is true that the state of the
40-year-old infrastructure on the loop is—let us be
polite—below par. The condition of the tracks and other
infrastructure has been the cause of many delays. There are frustrating
comparisons to be made, because commuters are told that their line
needs repairs, but other lines to the west, east and north have been
repaired and are back in service. They wait day after day for their
line to be repaired. I will try to find out in the next few weeks from
Network Rail why the rail lines and other infrastructure on the
Hertford loop continually fail. That is a particular issue in
comparison with the main line. Does Network Rail not maintain the loop
to the same standard as the main line? If not, why not? That raises an
interesting safety question for the
Minister.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000090">Another

the Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland) pointed out that the
carriages in question go back to the 1970s. I am not as expert on
carriage numbers as he is; I bow to his knowledge on that. The

2011 there was some hope among the passengers on the loop in my
constituency that First Capital Connect could be replaced as the
franchise neared its end. However, the contract was renewed, and we
were told that that was necessary to allow Thameslink investment to
proceed. I want to make it clear that I agree about the need for that
investment, but we on the Hertford loop do not benefit from
it—either from the main line improvement 
<?notus-xml column=239?>or the new rolling stock. Those to our west and to the north will
benefit, certainly, but those on the loop will not.</hs_Para>

underscores a theme that has emerged in the debate—a wider
concern about the Hertford loop and the way in which the rail sector
and policy makers regard it. All too often, it seems that the service
on the Hertford loop is just an afterthought for the railway sector.
Thus, when there are problems on the main line, inter-city trains are
redirected along the loop and our local trains are cancelled. If there
is congestion, the Hertford service is told to wait. As to rolling
stock, we find that it is provided for the main line but not for
us.</hs_Para>

my constituency feel that they have been neglected by the rail service
for which they pay: by First Capital Connect, certainly by Network
Rail, and by a national strategy that seems routinely to put inter-city
and long-distance passengers’ needs ahead of theirs. We
understand the need for balance, but commuters find it difficult to
accept its being continually tilted against them. That is why I want to
tell the Minister that we are not satisfied with First Capital
Connect’s service; I could not support the extension of its
franchise without radical changes, and I am doubtful that those can be
achieved.</hs_Para>

happy with Network Rail’s performance, either. The Minister will
know, because he studies such matters closely, how bad the service
delays on the loop have been. I want his assurance, if he can give it
today, that he will challenge Network Rail’s senior management
on the issue. I intend to do so, but the Minister will know how
important it is for them to hear it from him. Lastly, it is very
important that he should explain that passengers on the loop should not
be treated as secondary to those who travel on the main line.</hs_Para>

particular—this is perhaps the most tangible thing from the
point of view of my constituents—a vital principle in future
franchise negotiations should be the sharing of new rolling stock for
the benefit of all passengers on the main line and the loop. There are
different ways to do that. It would not mean that everyone would get an
equal share, but all passengers should feel that they benefit from the
changes in part, and are not excluded simply because they are served by
only part of the franchisee’s overall business. That is an
important principle, which can and should be knitted into the franchise
arrangements for the coming period, in the autumn and afterwards. I
should like the Minister’s response to it, and I hope he will
support it. I look forward to his
response.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_28_PT_1/1377B3E783F7266E710509F75075B04EE9EE78F3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="28 January 2014">Tuesday

Greenwood</B> (Nottingham South) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
serve under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea. I congratulate the hon.
Member for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) on securing this important
debate. Many of the concerns that he raised—overcrowded,
uncomfortable trains, frequent cancellations and inadequate customer
services—will be familiar to commuters throughout the country,
but there are clearly particular challenges on the Hertford loop line.
I listened carefully to the examples that the hon. Gentleman and other
hon. Members gave of recent disruption on the line. Passengers
undoubtedly expect better, and it is clear that action by Network Rail
and First Capital Connect is needed.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=240?><hs_Para UID="14012862000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000099">Network Rail
is responsible for maintaining and improving the
line, but train operators also have an important
role in managing disruption, providing public information and passing
compensation on to passengers. Today’s debate has raised
concerns over how well that relationship functions. Several hon.
Members have highlighted the vital importance of the way in which
operators deal with delays, especially when infrastructure leads to
unavoidable disruption. The disruption on the line has affected
passengers acutely, because by London standards people in the borough
of Enfield are unusually dependent on national rail services. The
unacceptable performances of recent months have thrown the quality of
those services into sharp focus, and we can all understand
commuters’ anger at the frequent disruption, especially
against a backdrop of rising fares.</hs_Para>

fares have risen by 20% since the election, and there have been much
higher rises in some unregulated fares, but commuters on the First
Capital Connect franchise have had to endure some of the worst
punctuality figures in the country. Perhaps unsurprisingly, passengers
report some of the lowest satisfaction rates. Between  8
December and 4 January just 74% of trains on the Great Northern routes
arrived on time. The hon. Member for Enfield North highlighted periods
of even lower punctuality. That is not to underestimate the challenges
that Network Rail and operators face in running busy London commuter
services, or the pressures on the local infrastructure and the rolling
stock, some of which, as has been mentioned, is decades old; but as
hon. Members have made clear today, passengers have, over the past
three months in particular, had to endure an unacceptable standard of
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000102">Given
the level of investment that is due to go into the part of the commuter
network in question, it is easy to understand why the Government have
opted for a management-style contract for the combined Thameslink,
Southern and Great Northern franchise. However, that means that
Ministers must take a greater degree of responsibility. Perhaps the
Minister will outline how he expects that new approach to contracting
to work in practice. How will the reclassification of Network Rail
affect things? Will the reclassification make it possible to get more
co-ordination between the infrastructure manager and passenger
operators with a management-style contract? There are opportunities to
deliver more frequent or otherwise improved timetables as part of the
new franchise; that will be made possible by the infrastructure
improvements.</hs_Para>

the Minister acknowledges that there are issues that will not be
resolved by the franchising process, including the rolling stock used
on the line. The hon. Member for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland)
mentioned the class 313s, which are among the oldest trains still in
regular commercial use. If they are still in use when the new contract
ends in 2021, some of those units will be 45 years old. I understand
that there are particular challenges, as trains on that route have to
operate with both overhead and third rail electrification systems, but
even in the light of that restraint we need to know what the Department
is planning for the future. What assessment has the Minister made of
the long-term viability of these trains?</hs_Para>

be good to have the Minister’s comments on the record about the
long-term management of the lines. The West Anglia lines, including the
route to Enfield Town, mentioned earlier, are due to transfer from the
Greater Anglia franchise next year. I am sure that passengers hope that
London Overground will deliver the same benefits it brought to other
areas that were previously managed by Silverlink, namely investment in
the trains, improvements to stations and increased staff presence. That

look at the east coast main line’s inter-city services and how
they relate to First Capital Connect’s commuter provision, just
as we look at improvements to the Hertford loop in the context of the
wider Thameslink programme. In recent years, the quality gap between
inter-city and commuter services on the east coast main

Coast has gone from strength to strength since the last private
operator failed in 2009. Record passenger satisfaction and punctuality
ratings have been achieved and all profits are reinvested in the

those who change on to East Coast services from north London and
Hertfordshire, but it underlined the absurdity of the

have to say that I feel rather guilty, because although I travel down
from Yorkshire as a weekly commuter I suspect that I have had fewer
problems in the past year than some commuters from north London, and
further afield, experienced during just one week before Christmas.
Although some of that could be down to the St Jude’s storm and
other inclement weather, and the need to clear tracks of fallen trees
before services could resume, I appreciate that the service has, on
many occasions, fallen below the standard that people would expect. I
am very much in the picture, having heard a number of contributions on
this subject. I will ensure that the Under-Secretary of State for
Transport, my hon. Friend the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond),
who deals with rail franchise policy, is also in the picture, and that

is clear that if we are to continue the strong growth in rail travel
over recent years, passengers must be confident that the service that

continue doing so in the years to

hon. Friend mentioned specifically the services provided by First
Capital Connect in his constituency. As one would expect, the
Department monitors rail performance closely. I should like to spend a
moment providing a little more detail on some of the recent performance
trends. I will also explain some of the issues involved, but I stress
that it is not my job to make excuses on behalf of the operator; my job

key headline indicator for rail performance is the public performance
measure, which measures the percentage of services that arrive on time.
Data from the start of the financial year up to 4 January, the most
recent period for which data are available, show a total PPM score for
the Great Northern route, of which the Hertford loop is a part, of
85.16%. That is 6.07 percentage points short of the target agreed by
the operator and Network Rail. My hon. Friend has already alluded to
the inconvenience that that has caused to his constituents and to other
passengers on the line. Only about a fifth of the total delay minutes
over the year to date are attributable to a fault of the train
operator. Some three quarters of all such delays were the
responsibility of Network Rail, with the remainder being attributable
to the knock-on effect of actions by other operators on the
network.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000124">My
officials regularly discuss performance with First Capital Connect, and
I am reassured that a number of key measures are in hand to ensure that
the situation improves over the coming months. The two main causes of
delays within the operator’s control are issues with drivers and
issues with the train fleet. On the former, regular passengers will be
aware that there have been some isolated cancellations due to train
crew. Passengers will naturally be frustrated by those cancellations,
which have occurred for a number of reasons. Passengers should,
however, also note that First Capital Connect has been steadily
recruiting and training new drivers 
<?notus-xml column=244?>across a number of key routes. The latest cohort of drivers will be out
on the network, ready to drive trains, from this month. That rolling

level of delays on the First Capital Connect network due to
fleet-related problems has also been increasing, despite expected

have mentioned that the majority of delays on the Great Northern route
over the year to date have been attributed to Network Rail. Such
delays, however, include significant and, to a large extent,
unavoidable delays due to the severe weather over recent months. The St

did severe weather just before Christmas and since. In such severe
weather it is inevitable that some disruption will occur. On a number
of occasions, Network Rail has been forced to order the suspension of

caused major

broke the camel’s back and caused annoyance and anger among
passengers. When we have such weather situations, safety must remain
the highest priority, and it is in no small part due to Network

Goodwill:</Member></B> I was involved in conference calls following the
St Jude’s day storm, and the main issue was fallen trees. A
decision was taken that, before services could commence, proving trains
would be put through the routes so that large numbers of commuters were
not stranded, possibly with trains backed up on the line behind a
number of fallen trees. Where the embankments or the margins of a rail
line are wooded, there are likely to be more fallen trees on the line.
That was a particular problem north of London and in the south-east
during the St Jude’s day storm. From a safety perspective, the
right decision was taken. I gave evidence to the Select Committee on
Transport stating that, before trains carrying commuters could use a
line, proving trains ran to ensure that the lines were clear so that
the trains could reach their destination.</hs_Para>

so much fallen trees as compacted leaves. The equipment necessary to
unpack those leaves took a long time to get down the lines. The delays
getting to us to ensure the safety of the line was a particular
operational issue, and I understand that that problem has been repeated

element of every line, but there is a clear differential in the
standard to which the loop is administered by Network Rail. It would be
helpful if he could confirm that he will take that point away,
challenge Network Rail’s management and come back to us in
writing in due course on the standard to which the Hertford loop is
kept. Is that standard directly comparable to the main line? If so, why

has not been a glorious success. In fact, it has been among the worst
in the country, and it is vital that Network Rail’s performance
improves. It has been highlighted, for example, that vegetation
management has been an issue on the Great Northern route. Although
“leaves on the line” has become the stuff of satire, the
fact is that autumn brings significant challenges for train operators,

before you, Dr McCrea, and the Minister. I initiated this debate and I
was lucky to secure it, so it is only fair that I should be able to say
what its focus is. It is important to say that because it is not about
free schools and academies in general. We have had such debates, so it
is not for or against such schools, but about one particular school:
Kings science academy. I am not interested in what has been done in the
last year or so to improve things at the school or the achievement of
pupils, the quality of teaching, the behaviour of pupils, or the
leadership and management. I am passionately interested in all those
things because I care about Bradford, but that is not what this debate
is
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000159">I
am interested in what seems to be the collusion between the so-called
benefactor, Alan Lewis, the currently suspended principal, and the
Department for Education. I am interested in the DFE’s role in
allowing a rich Tory vice-chair to become even richer to the tune of
millions of pounds of public money, and how it allowed an inexperienced
young man to become principal of the school and to remain in control
long after the DFE knew he had admitted that fraud had occurred in his
school. How could that
be?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000160">I
would like the Minister to prove me wrong in what I believe has
occurred and the preferential, favourable treatment received by Mr
Lewis by ending the speculation and making public the options, analysis

to see the evidence that the near £300,000 per year rent is not
far in excess of what Mr Lewis could reasonably have expected to get
from the partially tenanted and largely derelict site—I have
given the Minister three photographs from before it was developed, and
I can give more. What evidence is there that Mr Lewis has not made
excessive profits from the school that now stands on that site? The
Minister has the pictures before him. I believe that the school was
only ever going to be built on that particular site—neither the
principal nor, certainly, Alan Lewis would have been interested had it
been anywhere else. Prove me wrong, please, but the DFE failed in its
duty to ensure that a fair and robust options appraisal took place, and
I have evidence to suggest that it did not take
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000162">As
for the personal involvement of Mr Lewis in the running of the school,
there is this big debate about “was he or wasn’t

mistakenly believed that a vice-chair of the Conservative party was
chairman of governors at a free school for 12 months? How can the
Department have been confused about that? I had a letter from Mr Lewis

truth is that Mr Lewis was personally and heavily involved in the

fabrication of invoices had taken place, so even if the DFE did not see
the CCW report in August of 2012, at the very least it must have known

for the school itself to decide whether the issue was a disciplinary
one. How on earth can an organisation highlighted in an audit report as
responsible be the organisation responsible for looking at itself and
dealing with its own disciplinary issues? It beggars belief. A
Government audit uncovers misconduct so serious that it needs to be
passed to the police for criminal investigation, and yet the DFE feels

that the nub of this question is that Alan Lewis is a very senior

the Secretary of State for Education simply could not come clean on

Ward:</Member></B> That is an excellent point. We have to ask why.
There must have been a justification for the cover-up. It can be one of
only two things. It is either because free schools are such a flagship
policy for the Conservative party that it could not afford the
embarrassment or because of Alan Lewis’s involvement and his
association with the Tory party. If there are any other reasons, I
cannot think of them.</hs_Para>

the point again about deception—I cannot use any other word,
really. As I said, the Department’s original report was made on
25 April 2013, a long time after it knew about the matter. We are told
that Action Fraud inadvertently logged the report as an
information-only report, and subsequently apologised for that error.
But how did that occur? If, as the Department claimed, information on
fabricated invoices was submitted to the National Fraud Investigation
Bureau, how could that be? Unless there was just a passing reference in
a short telephone call, it is hard to believe that the correct message
could not have got through. How could it have been logged as an
information-only report if the audit report had been made available? In
that case, the reaction could have been nothing other than a decision
that the matter required a criminal investigation and needed to be
dealt with quickly.</hs_Para>

is also egotistical, and is led on by politicians and senior civil
servants to believe that for him the normal rules of integrity, honesty
and propriety simply do not have to apply? Or is it the Department for
Education, which became a Government agent of change and forgot that
the basic rules of public accountability and scrutiny in the spending
of millions of pounds of public money must always take precedence over
the desire to support its political masters?</hs_Para>

surprise is not that, eventually and thankfully, we have been made
aware of what has happened via the whistleblowers, but that there were
not more whistleblowers earlier—people within the Department,
who were looking at what was going on and saying, “This is just
not right.” That is the real problem. I have been to the
Department recently and seen the whole floor that has been taken over
by the academies and free school organisation within the DFE. The
massive shift that has taken place has also, I believe, brought about a
cultural change in the Department. The policy has become such an
important driver and part of the Government’s strategy that
anything goes.</hs_Para>

once, with this particular school, how many other academies and free

will now turn, in the time that we have, to the matters raised by my
hon. Friend that are specific to the case of the Kings science academy.
He said he feared that I would hide behind—I think those were
his words—the fact that there is a criminal investigation. There
are some things that I cannot touch on in this speech because they are
subject to a criminal investigation, and we all understand the
constraints that that imposes on us all. Subject to that, however, I

science academy opened in September 2011. The Education Funding Agency
had already planned a full financial management and governance review
at the academy, which would look at aspects such as financial and other
internal controls, when it received allegations about practices at the
school in October 2012, some of which related to possible financial
irregularity. Those allegations were included in the EFA’s
financial management and governance review, as my hon. Friend is aware.
The EFA carried out its financial management and governance review in
December 2012. It looked in detail at all aspects of governance,
including the chair’s position, financial controls and conflicts
of interest. Following the usual procedures, the EFA sent the draft
report, showing the inadequacy of the financial management and
controls, to the academy in January 2013 so that the academy could
correct any inaccuracies. Thereafter, the EFA sent the final report in
February 2013, which confirmed the assessment of
“inadequate” and requested the academy’s response
to the findings and recommendations in the report.</hs_Para>

of the EFA’s review led to a further investigation, as my hon.
Friend knows, by the Department’s internal audit investigations
team. The Department’s investigators began their on-site work at
Kings science 
<?notus-xml column=255?>academy on 24 January 2013. The investigation team sent its report to
Kings science academy at the beginning of April to allow for the
correction of any inadequacies. John Bowers became the new acting chair
of the academy in March 2013, and he tightened control by, among other
things, assuming the important role of accounting officer for the
academy in April of that year. The EFA also received the
academy’s improvement plans at the beginning of April in
response to the findings of the financial management and evaluation
report. Both the EFA and the Department’s investigation team
continued contact with Mr Bowers to monitor progress in responding to
both reports. We remain grateful to the new chair for the real efforts
that he has made to address some of the issues that are now
public.</hs_Para>

our zero tolerance of fraud in all schools—free schools,
academies and maintained schools—we reported the evidence of
possible fraud to Action Fraud at the earliest opportunity on 25 April
2013. I will return to cover that aspect of the case, which my hon.
Friend has mentioned, in more detail in a second. Because both the
financial management and governance review and the investigation found
serious failings in financial management, the Secretary of State issued
a warning notice in May 2013 requiring the full recovery of relevant
funds and confirmation that Kings science academy would respond to the
findings in both reports.</hs_Para>

the EFA confirmed that Kings science academy’s new finance
policy provided a firm basis for establishing proper internal controls
at the school, and we wrote to the academy in July 2013 recognising the
progress it had made and confirming that the report of the internal
audit investigation team would be published. That is in line with our
policy to publish investigation reports, which is clearly set out in
the “Academies Financial Handbook”. We had planned to
wait before publishing the investigation report until the disciplinary
processes had been completed, but we decided that it was right to
publish when the investigation report was leaked in the

EFA’s financial management and governance report and the
Secretary of State’s warning notice have also now been
published. We insisted that Kings science academy address identified
failings urgently. While its internal evidence gathering continued, we
confirmed the repayment sum at £76,933. We also sought
confirmation that the disciplinary process was being taken forward. It
is right that the relevant funding is being recovered from the academy
in full, as it always will be if an academy or free school is unable to
demonstrate that funding has been used for its intended
purpose.</hs_Para>

2013, any evidence of fraud found by the Department would have been
reported to the relevant police authority. Action Fraud was established
from April 2013 and since then has been the correct organisation with
which to engage. The KSA situation was the first occasion that the
Department had needed to contact Action Fraud, so it made a further
check with West Yorkshire police on the same day—25
April—to confirm that the report had been made in the right way.
I put it to my hon. Friend the Member for Bradford East that if there

we made a further check with Action Fraud, which told us that the

10 January to confirm that the arrested man was Mr Raza, the principal,

investigation was completed and finalised. Beyond that, it is not
appropriate to comment. The parameters of the investigation are, quite
rightly, for West Yorkshire police to determine. Until such time as the

turn to the matter of Alan Lewis’s role at Kings science

that Dr Asim Suleman would be chair of governors from 25 October 2012.
We learned in December 2012 that there had been no chair of governors
in place between October 2011 and October 2012. That was clearly a
completely unsatisfactory position and totally unacceptable. Not to
have a properly constituted governing body is a demonstrable failure to
comply with the funding agreement. It is one of the issues identified

addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012862000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012862000217">Alan
Lewis’s other connection is that his company, Hartley Investment
Trust Ltd, leases the site to the school, as my hon. Friend indicated.
The site was secured for Kings science academy at £295,960 per

involvement, Treasury approval was sought and provided before final

Nicholas Brown</B> (Newcastle upon Tyne East) (Lab):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea. This
debate is important to my constituency and to the constituencies that
neighbour mine on the River Tyne. The issues that I intend to raise
have far-reaching consequences for public policy, as I hope to
demonstrate. Essentially, I want to raise two questions: should we
continue with the long-running efforts of central and local government
to clean up the River Tyne, and should the burden of paying for that be
shared between central and local government? Ideally, of course, the
polluter should be made to pay. However, if that is not a practical way
forward, that does not relieve those of us in public life of the
obligation to find a solution to the
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000003">Until
recently, these were not particularly controversial questions. The
statutory responsibility lies with local authorities. Government
recognised the exceptional nature of these issues, the financial
consequences and the broader public interest in remediation, and
therefore made a financial contribution towards the costs. Newcastle
city council, under both Labour and Liberal Democrat administrations,
deserves credit for the way the local authority has proactively worked
to remediate contaminated sites within the city boundaries. Alongside
that, it has developed an imaginative and very successful
public-private partnership to bring new employers to the north banks of
the
Tyne.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000004">So
successful has the local authority been, working in partnership with
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and its
predecessor Departments, that there is only one significant cause for
concern remaining in the city. To have got to this position is no mean
achievement. The remedial work already completed includes two
significant antimony
sites.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000005">The
outstanding problem is the old Thomas Ness tar works site—the
subject of today’s debate. The Thomas Ness tar works was a going
concern from 1920 to 1981. Its function, as the name suggests, was to
produce coal tar. As a young official of the General and Municipal
Workers Union, I played a small part, back in 1981, in negotiating the
redundancy terms for the work force when it closed. Following closure,
the factory was demolished and some remedial work was carried out to
the site. However, it was still contaminated, and it quickly became
clear that the contaminants were leaching into the river. Underneath
the site, the sand and gravel are also heavily contaminated with tars
and oils. To this day, the site causes significant water pollution in
the adjacent River Tyne, as well as posing a risk to human health, with
reports of serious headaches being suffered by members of the public
who use the nearby foreshore in the Walker country park after only 10
minutes in  the
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000006">In
1984, the then Tyne and Wear county council sponsored an intervention
aimed at dealing with part of the problem, but the Tyne and Wear scheme
could not have dealt with the underlying problem of coal tar seeping
underground on the site and then dispersing. It was designed to catch
the tar nearer the surface and divert it through a trench into a
containment tank. That was only partly effective and in any event could
not have stopped the seepage into the river.</hs_Para>

council made a more thorough attempt at remediation in the late
1990s. Essentially, the city council’s
scheme was a pumped treatment scheme involving pumps in wells along the
site’s frontage facing the river. I should say at this point,
for those who are not familiar with the area, that the site is on the
riverbank, and therefore natural seepage from it would be downhill
towards the river. The tar clogged up the pumps, wrecking the
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000008">Government
Departments worked closely with Tyne and Wear county council and the
city council in a constructive way to try to solve the problem. That is
all I am asking for today. In a notice from the Department for

Under-Secretary, Lord De Mauley, wrote to all local authorities in
England. His opening sentence was:</hs_Para>

issued revised guidance to local authorities in April 2012 obliging
them to focus their attention on the highest-risk sites, while allowing
them to dismiss lower-risk ones. Let nobody be in any doubt: the site

Government’s financial contribution to solving the problem. The
DEFRA contaminated land grants budget has gone from £17.5
million in 2009-10 to £2 million in 2013-14. An increase of
£500,000 is budgeted for each year after that until 2017, when

the Minister will probably say that the council should pay for the
whole thing using money provided by the Government through the revenue

action-specific grant-aid from central Government. That, of course,
would lead us into a much wider debate. I hope that the Minister will

for all of us involved in public life is whether we leave things as

contain the problem. Let there be no misunderstanding: my preferred
solution would be to eradicate it altogether. If that is not realistic,
however, the very least we can do is to try to protect the river from
further contamination and contain the problem on site. That, as I

proposal.</hs_Para>

quality. Central Government have played an important part in getting us
to where we are now, and they should help us to
finish the job. We need a comprehensive plan for the river as a whole,
including the upper reaches of the north and south Tyne. We need a
latter-day Tyne improvement commission to bring public authorities and
private sector interests together, to set a clear programme of
remediation for the whole river right the way to its upper reaches, to
drive the work programme forward and to remain vigilant on any emerging
causes of pollution. That would have to be paid for. No local authority
in the north-east is in any position to make a significant financial
contribution to the project, nor is it reasonable to try to pass the
cost on to private sector interests, which are, after all, not

hon. Gentleman explained, land contamination is a complex area. The
issue of the St Anthony’s former tar works and the pollution of
the River Tyne shows that. The Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs and the Environment Agency are aware of the site and the
agency has been in regular contact for several years with Newcastle
city council, which owns the site and is designated the

acknowledge the council’s work to deal with the site. DEFRA
recognises that it initiated work in 2000 to try to prevent the flow of
hydrocarbons into the river. Unfortunately, that system failed shortly
after installation. Following that, further investigation was funded
through the contaminated land capital grants scheme at a cost of
£240,000, and that led to the site being determined under the
legislation in 2007. The council was successful in securing further
funding of £189,000, resulting in a detailed design for
remediation of the site. DEFRA has therefore already provided more than
£400,000 in capital funding to support the council in dealing
with the
site.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000020">As
the right hon. Gentleman pointed out, however, the budget for the
grants scheme has undergone significant cuts in line with the economic
downturn, and since 2010 no further funding could be made available for
the  site following the assessment and prioritisation of all
applications for funding. Other bids, such as those to do with landfill
gas entering residential properties, would be considered a higher
priority, given the greater risk to public health on the measures that
we use to assess such projects. Vapour monitoring at St
Anthony’s established that there was no health risk to users of
the walkway on 
<?notus-xml column=261?>the river bank, and there is currently no evidence that the site is

phasing out of the grant scheme is regrettable, but it reflects a
necessary change of approach following a review of departmental
priorities and expenditure. DEFRA and the Environment Agency are not
immune to the necessary funding constraints that all Departments are
under. Government can continue to support only those projects that are
considered to be the highest priority, and absolute emergency cases,

want to explain how contaminated land is dealt with in England, and the
additional work that has been undertaken by DEFRA to support local
authorities so that they can direct resources to the highest-priority
sites. The contaminated land regime, as set out in part IIA of the 1990
Act, provides a risk-based approach to the identification and
remediation of land where contamination poses an unacceptable risk to
human health or the environment.</hs_Para>

for identifying such contaminated land is a local authority obligation
under part IIA, and, since 2000, financial support has been and will
continue to be provided through the revenue support grant provided by
the Department for Communities and Local Government. That is exactly
the answer that the right hon. Gentleman predicted. The revenue support
grant is not ring-fenced, and it is up to local authorities to decide
where to allocate the money according to their individual
priorities.</hs_Para>

to the part IIA statutory guidance in April 2012 have resulted in a
more stringent, risk-based approach to identifying and remediating
contaminated land, meaning that more resources can be directed to those
sites most in need. It is a simple fact that with  far fewer
resources, we must prioritise where spending goes first.</hs_Para>

the final stages of DEFRA-funded research to develop new screening
levels that will screen out low-risk land from the need for further
investigation, thus saving money for local authorities. Once published,
the screening values will sit alongside DEFRA research published in
2012 on the normal background concentrations of contaminants to help
inform decisions. Case studies are also being published from the work
of the contaminated land national experts panel, which is a free
resource available to support local authorities that face the more
difficult, borderline decisions so that they can understand what would
or would not be required. It is important to note that the
environmental permitting regime for current activities, particularly on
redeveloping sites where there is potential to cause contamination,

research on the current state of scientific knowledge on the health

health effects from the types and levels of land contamination found in
England today. We are not complacent, however. Such effects cannot be
ruled out in all cases because it is sometimes difficult to prove
causality, and there are reasons to be concerned that some sites might
pose significant risks from longer-term exposure. We therefore

system less complex and easier to understand, thereby encouraging
sustainable development and the effective use of brownfield land where
appropriate. The key for many sites is to redevelop them and, as part
of that redevelopment, to have an agreement with the developer that
they will put right the contamination, as they have the proceeds of the
redevelopment to

point, and he understands the site better than I do, as he is the
constituency MP. There are possibilities in many instances. Local
authorities across the country hold toxic assets that are something of
a liability. We have many such sites in Cornwall. I grew up in a mining
area, and we have our share of arsenic and contaminated land. Deals can
often be reached in which the local authority effectively gives the
land to a developer in return for the developer putting right the
contamination. I have seen that work in my part of the
country—the opposite end of the country from his
constituency—where we also have contamination caused by tin
mining. We need to explore such things, otherwise we go full circle and
come back to the question of whether using public money is justified.
We have introduced a new screening process for prioritising sites that
are a direct threat to health in residential areas, and we have been
frank and honest that we cannot justify the expenditure at this stage.
I hope it will be possible to explore the approach I have
outlined.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000030">Also,
land remediation relief will support developers. The Government are
encouraging a market-based approach to dealing with contaminated land,
as much as possible. One financial incentive that the Government have
provided to encourage the redevelopment of contaminated land is land
remediation relief, which allows companies to claim back corporation
tax on 150% of the costs of dealing with contaminated land, and which
is intended to influence developers’ decisions positively by
increasing the profitability of redevelopment projects. The Treasury
estimates that the value of land remediation relief  is around
£30 million per annum, suggesting that the 
<?notus-xml column=263?>private sector is spending approximately £100 million on land
remediation relief-compliant voluntary remediation each
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000031">The
Government are also trying to encourage local authorities, LEPs and
enterprise zones to find solutions to toxic sites that have not so far
been suitable for redevelopment. Furthermore, DEFRA is working with the
Environment Agency and the Coal Authority to address water pollution
from abandoned metal mines. DEFRA has agreed to a modest and targeted
approach, initiating one to two new remediation schemes each year,
subject to funding. I appreciate that that particular fund is of little
use in relation to the former tar works at St Anthony’s, but it
is nevertheless indicative of the fact that we continue to do what we
can on the issue with the resources we
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000032">I
mentioned earlier that emergency cases will still be funded. As part of
the announcement on the future of the grants scheme, my noble Friend
Lord de Mauley made it clear that, subject to capital funding
allocations, a contingency fund of £500,000 each year will
continue to be available until the scheme ends in 2017. DEFRA is
working with the Environment Agency to agree how the contingency fund
will be administered; that will enable the fulfilment of ongoing
projects as far as possible, and provide funding in case of
emergencies. An announcement on that will be made soon, and will
include details of the qualifying criteria for such
cases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000033">To
conclude, DEFRA will review the impact of the changes to the grants
scheme for local authorities 12 months after the changes are
introduced in April 2014. In addition, it has commissioned a new state
of contaminated land survey, which will collect information on part IIA
regulatory activity, the apportioning of liability, and the funding
mechanisms used for dealing with contaminated land. The report will be
produced by the Environment Agency before the end of 2014 and will
provide information that can be used when reviewing the impact of the
changes to the grants
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000034">I
thank the right hon. Gentleman again for bringing this debate before
the House. I am sorry that I have not been able to give him any more
reassurance than the Environment Agency has, but I hope that he will
appreciate the difficult constraints that we face and the need for us
to prioritise our
spending.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_28_PT_1/6ACD3E9CD982AD4AA88894502E332FB79C308DFC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="28 January 2014">Tuesday

constituency with a rich industrial heritage that no doubt has similar
problems, albeit perhaps not exactly of the nature we have been

the Minister that the possibility of a commercial way forward for the
site is worth exploring. The figures he cited are the same as my
own—a cost  of roughly £1.2 million to £2
million for the council’s preferred scheme to try to contain the
tars and prevent them from leaching into the river, but it would
contain them on site. I do not know how commercially attractive that
would be to a developer. My preferred option would be a one-off capital
clearance of the whole site to clear it up completely and bring it back
to a more pristine standard, certainly than it has known since 1920.
However, my suspicion is that that would cost more
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14012863000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/halltext/140128h0002.htm#14012863000037">I

appeal against designation made under the Terrorism (United Nations

by this report, brought by Zana Abdul Rahim. Two civil claims relating
to designations are also ongoing, one brought by Gulam Mastafa against
the Treasury and other Government Departments, and another brought by
an individual, known as “M”, against the Treasury. The
challenge under s63(2) of the Counter-Terrorism Act 2008 brought by
Mohammed Al Ghabra against the Treasury and joined to be heard with his
claim for judicial review against the Foreign and Commonwealth Office,
was withdrawn by the claimant. In the quarter to 31 December 2013, no

is unnecessary. When a developer submits an application for planning
permission the local planning authority is required to seek the views
of members of the public, whose views will help inform any eventual
decision. It is for each local planning authority—democratically
elected and representing the local community—to ensure, through
the placing of conditions on any subsequent planning permission, that
potential noise and traffic problems are kept to a minimum. I would add
that councils’ environmental health departments already have
legal powers to  tackle statutory noise nuisance, and local
highways authorities have legal powers in relation to street works on
public
highways.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="455"><?date 2014-01-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_28_PT_1/D84221CE3AB8BB8F8C0BF3FCD4593E22BBED5276" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="28 January 2014">Tuesday

Simmonds:</Member></B> The arrangements for acquiring British Overseas
Territories citizenship in Montserrat are governed by the British
Nationality Act 1981 and are similar to arrangements for acquiring
British citizenship in the UK. In November 2013, the Premier of
Montserrat raised with UK Ministers a proposal for an economic
citizenship programme as part of efforts to encourage investment in the
territory. The Government of Montserrat has been advised that there are
no plans to provide a fast track to British nationality in the UK or
the Overseas Territories. The UK Government is encouraging the
Government of Montserrat to consider offering a fast track to permanent
residence status for investors in Montserrat in line with arrangements
for high net worth individuals in the UK and in a number of other
Overseas Territories. The Government of Montserrat is responsible for
Montserrat's immigration policy including criteria for granting
permanent residence. It would therefore be for the Government of
Montserrat to consider piloting such an investor programme.</hs_Para>

Accident and emergency (A&amp;E) Workforce. The data shown here are for
NHS HCHS doctors at the specified organisations recorded as having a
specialty of 'emergency medicine'. While this should capture all those
doctors trained in emergency medicine, it does not necessarily show
where they work. Doctors may also be coded by specialty based on the
department where they work. 'Emergency medicine' is likely therefore to
capture all A&amp;E doctors plus some that are employed in Emergency
Admission Units, although these are expected to be few. A doctor does
not need to be trained in emergency medicine to be working in A&amp;E.
For example doctors trained in general medicine could be working in
A&amp;E and may still be recorded under the specialty they trained in,
and therefore not included in the 'emergency medicine' doctors shown
here. 'Emergency medicine' is the General Medical Council (Statutory
Instrument approved) Main Specialty. It is also currently known as
Accident and Emergency within Workforce Data Standards. NHS HCHS
workforce excludes general practitioners, GP practice staff and high

Data quality-The HSCIC seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of
missing and invalid data, but responsibility for data accuracy lies
with the organisations providing the data. Methods are continually
being updated to improve data quality. Where changes impact on figures
already published, this is assessed but unless it is significant at
national level figures are not changed. Impact at detailed or local

was allocated to alleviate winter pressures for 2013-14. In September
2013, the Government announced that £250 million would be

performance over winter. An additional £150 million, from within
the national health service existing budget, was provided to the
remaining health economies to ease winter pressures on their accident

withdrawn for this year on the basis of healthcare worker vaccination

introduced a new offence of the proxy purchase of tobacco in April 2011
as part of a wider package of tobacco control measures contained within
the Tobacco and Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2010. A study
of the effectiveness of this package of measures, including the proxy
purchase offence, is currently being conducted by the University of

decrease carbon emissions from heat. As explained in our publication of
March 2013 document, "The Future of Heating: Meeting the Challenge",
heat use accounts for nearly half of all the energy use in the UK. The
heat budget does not include funding for the Renewable Heat Incentive
scheme. It funds a number of broader programmes announced in the March
document addressing industrial heat use and the growth in heat
networks, support for training the renewable heat supply chain and for
research and economic analysis as well as some direct grant funding
through the Heat Network Delivery Unit. In addition, the budget covers
two regulatory operations: the quality assurance scheme for Combined
Heat and Power plants (CHP QA) and the Standard Assessment Procedure
(SAP) for the energy performance of homes, as well as a contribution to
joint DECC-DEFRA work to support community-scale renewable projects in

Barker:</Member></B> The Global Threat Reduction Programme (GTRP) is a
cross-government programme aimed to successfully reduce the threats
posed by nuclear and radiological materials and expertise in vulnerable
locations worldwide. DECC is responsible for implementing the nuclear
and radiological elements of the GTRP. GTRP has a mature portfolio of
programmes aimed at improving the security of sensitive nuclear and
radiological materials and knowledge, and reducing the number of sites
containing such material. To date, the Global Threat Reduction
Programme has contributed to reducing vulnerabilities and improving
security and safety in 18 beneficiary
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1401291000401" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/text/140128w0003.htm#1401291000401">Much
of GTRP's work is sensitive, due to the nature of the material and
knowledge it aims to protect, and so the level of detail which can be
provided on specific projects is necessarily limited. Of the funds
identified as allocated to the Global Threat Reduction Programme in my
answer of 3 June 2013, <I>Official Report</I>, column 
<?notus-xml column=532?>953W, capital was allocated to programmes which include a planned
contribution to the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA's)
Nuclear Security Fund and a project to retrieve and store highly
radioactive sources in Ukraine, and resource was allocated to
programmes which include a series of projects to improve nuclear
information security and security, culture in a number of countries,
and the completion of a sustainability programme to support previous
completed nuclear security improvements in
Russia.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="1401291000402" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/text/140128w0003.htm#1401291000402"><B><Member PimsId="3261" UID="1401291000515" xid="203" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140128/text/140128w0003.htm#1401291000515">Caroline
