affordable. By increasing the number of hours of free Government-funded
child care to which three and four-year olds are entitled, parents are
saving nearly £400 a year more. Furthermore, by introducing

hon. Lady. The latest figures from the Department for Education show
that there are 100,000 more child care places. According to the latest
figures, there were  2 million child care places in 2011, which
was a 5% increase on 2009, so the number of child care places 
has increased. As the mother of two young children, I totally
appreciate that the cost of child care can be an excessive burden on
families. However, the Government have done a lot to offer support and
are doing more with the offer of tax-free child care from next year,
which will make a significant difference to the amount that parents
have to pay for their child care.</hs_Para>

it has become obvious that the Institute of Fiscal Studies has not only
demolished Labour’s 50p tax rate policy but has found out the
shadow Chancellor for the way he constructed his plan for reducing the
deficit. It does not involve reducing the deficit at all—by no
more than about a third of what is required—because it leaves
out entirely borrowing for investment, which is absurd. The amount of
borrowing is the amount of borrowing. We have to reduce the deficit.
The Labour Government left us with the largest deficit in the OECD, and
they continue not to understand the nature of the economic 
<?notus-xml column=1012?>problems that they created in the past and would create again in the

more people employed in the private sector and, according to a Lloyds
TSB survey, business confidence is at its strongest since 1994.
Inflation has hit its 2% target and the International Monetary Fund has
confirmed that Britain is the fastest-growing major European economy.
We are pursuing a long-term economic plan that will reduce the deficit,
cut taxes, create more jobs, make welfare work, and deliver better

scrutiny and extra time is not being given. To make matters worse, the
Government have not even bothered to table explanatory statements. They
promised that they would do that, when they opposed making them

that coheres with something I was about to say in any case. There are
really two points. First, it is up to Ministers to decide what
programming arrangements to put before the House. On 22 October, as the
hon. Lady will doubtless recall, the House agreed to a day for Report
on this Bill. It is up to Ministers whether to propose any further
time. Secondly, on explanatory statements, the House decided that they
would not be mandatory. It is indeed up to Ministers, and not to me,
whether they are tabled or not. I had been intending in any case to
say, and will now do so, that it is my understanding that Ministers
will soon be providing such statements as a matter of routine. It would
not have applied, as the Leader of the House has explained, in this
case. I hope that that is helpful. At any rate, the matter is on the

will streamline the process for appeals, reducing the number of appeals
from 17 to four. It will also, crucially, enable us, in certain
circumstances, to deport individuals before they have their appeals, so
that their right of appeal is outside of this country. It also
introduces a variety of measures, one of which I will be coming on to
speak to, because it relates to some of the technical amendments

new clause 11 is intended to ensure that the marriage and civil

part 4 of the Bill will establish a new referral and investigation

back-door route around immigration rules. The ability to do that has
been extended by the Metock case in the European Court, which has
enabled people from outside the EU married to someone within the EU to
gain free movement rights. There is concern about sham marriages not

criteria that have been set. I have seen interviews take place in a
couple of countries overseas and have seen that the ability of our
entry clearance officers to make judgments is enhanced considerably by
conducting interviews, rather than just looking at a piece of paper. We
have already achieved 100,000 interviews, but I want to see how we can
extend that further across the visa
system.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14013058000805" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0002.htm#14013058000805">11.45

hon. Friend mentioned Russia and China. In China, we have more visa

12 such centres there; most of our competitors have only three or four.
We are also constantly working with the tour groups that bring people

we offer. The ability to apply online is also important. Yes, we
require biometrics to be taken, but we are enhancing our biometric
capture capability. For example, in certain cases the biometric capture
capability can go to the individual applying for the visa, rather than
the individual being required to go to the visa application centre. So
we are enhancing these services, and we are conscious of the issues

is also strong demand for the bespoke services from overseas customers,
who want us to go to them to deliver a visa service. Up to now, those
bespoke services have been offered on a small-scale trial basis, mainly
in China and the USA, to test demand and ensure viability. It is clear
that demand for such services is strong, and we want to roll them out
further. Neither the existing fees legislation nor the current
Immigration Bill provisions provide powers that would enable a workable
charging arrangement to be made for bespoke services. That only became
clear after the Bill had been
introduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013058000421" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0002.htm#14013058000421">Charging
for statutory functions, whether connected to immigration or otherwise,
is a technical area. As well as legislation and common-law precedent,
there is much detailed guidance, such as “Managing Public
Money”, which is published by the Treasury. The legislation and
the guidance are there to ensure that the imposition of fees by public
bodies, including Government Departments, is transparent, consistent
and subject to proper
scrutiny.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013058000422" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0002.htm#14013058000422">Fees
for commercial services that are not connected to statutory functions
are treated differently. For example, there is no requirement to set
out in legislation fees for commercial services. It became clear after
the Bill had been introduced that it would not be appropriate to treat
bespoke services as commercial services and that the provisions in the
Bill, while providing additional flexibility, would not be sufficient
to enable a charging arrangement that would work in the real world. The
main issue is that the services are bespoke. In other words, they vary
considerably from one customer to another. That contrasts with other
premium services, which are generally similar where they are delivered.
For example, a bespoke service may compromise a member of staff
visiting a customer at a location close to the visa centre. It could
involve two members of staff travelling by air to another country with
security escorts and overnight accommodation. It could involve the
provision of services to several people, or several members of staff
could be hiring a venue to provide services to a number of a
firm’s employees.</hs_Para>

providing a service could vary from around £100 to several
thousand pounds depending on the precise nature of the request. It is
not possible to use 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>regulations to set out fees that take account of all the possible
service variations that could apply, so we have made a new clause that
enables fees for those services to be set without the need for
regulations. In making those changes, we were keen to ensure that their
effect was limited to this narrow but important range of bespoke
services overseas. We do not want to take away the need for regulations
on other visa and immigration fees, or deliberate restrictions on
bespoke services fees to apply to charging for other premium services.
To achieve that, we have separated out the part of the service that
involves getting staff to the location of the customers’
choosing from the immigration services that may then be provided. The
attendance service fee covers all the costs to the Home Office of our
commercial visa partners preparing to deliver chargeable immigration
functions. To put that plainly, it means that the cost of commercial
partners’ staff time, travel, accommodation, security, venue
hire and so on is charged as an attendance service fee. The fee will be
priced on application, agreed between the customers making the request
and the commercial partner based on the specific requirements of the
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013058000424" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0002.htm#14013058000424">The
cost of any related visa applications and any other premium services,
such as accelerated processing, will be charged separately based on fee
levels set out in the regulations. As a result, while the new clause
permits fees to be charged without the need for regulations, several
safeguards are in place. For example, the provisions apply only to
bespoke services overseas delivered by our commercial visa partners.
The services are optional and may only be provided at a
customer’s request, and the fees may only reflect the cost to
the Home Office of providing the service, and must be agreed by the
customer in
advance.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_30_PT_1/8039E502342EFAFBFA3EAFC7E98ED4C83C75C76F" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2014">Thursday

war was over, legislation had been passed that made provision for

anybody of their citizenship and therefore potentially make them
stateless. That is the existing situation. If somebody is stateless and
either does not apply for citizenship of another state despite having
access or is denied permission to do so, but stays in the United
Kingdom, we would have to look at the situation and at their
immigration status. Crucially, their status would not attract the
privileges of a British citizen—they would not be entitled to
hold a British passport or to have full access to certain

The previous Government changed the law because they were going to sign

the power in question would be exercised in a limited number of cases,

against those acting in a way that comes under the definition of
“seriously prejudicial” to us. It is important that we
have such a power, but I am not in a position to say to my hon. Friend

carefully constructed measure designed to give effect to our
declaration under the UN convention on the reduction of statelessness,
but it goes no further. My officials, together with those from other
relevant Departments and in consultation with our in-House legal
advisers, conduct the research and provide a recommendation on each
case, but these are decisions that I—or, on the rare occasions I
am not available, another Secretary of State—will review and
sign off personally. The persons subject to provisions in the new
clause will continue to be afforded an independent right of appeal,
retaining an avenue of judicial redress. This is not about arbitrarily
depriving people of their citizenship; it is a targeted policy that
will be used sparingly against very dangerous individuals who have
brought such action upon themselves through terrorist-related acts. I

think we are all agreed across the House—this is one of the
things the Bill tries to do—that we want to enhance the ability
of our country to deport foreign criminals from the United Kingdom
where it is appropriate to do so. The Government have taken a simple
position on article 8 of the European convention on human rights, which
is that our judiciary have not been interpreting it in the way we
believe it should be interpreted, because it is a qualified right in
the European convention itself. Having changed the immigration rules,
and that not having had the effect we desired, we are now putting it
into primary legislation and ensuring that we clarify absolutely what
the qualified interpretation of article 8 should be in relation to the
Government’s ability to remove people from the United Kingdom. I
believe that is an important change that the public, as well as Members
of the House, would wish us to put through. It is right that the
Government are taking this opportunity to include that measure in the

it weakens the Government’s proposals in relation to

me expand on a few of those points. I say to my hon. Friend the Member
for Esher and Walton, we all want to ensure that we make the Bill as
strong as possible when dealing with the deportation of foreign
criminals. The Bill makes it clear that the deportation of a foreign
criminal is in the public interest, even for those with prison
sentences of less than 12 months if that offending is persistent or
causes serious harm. New clause 15 relates only to automatic
deportation, and therefore to offenders who are sentenced to 12 months
of more. It would be for the courts to decide on the proportionality of
deporting persistent offenders or those whose offences cause serious
harm but who are sentenced to less than 12 months, and no guidance from
Parliament is provided on the tests that should apply. The new clause
weakens the Bill in relation to those offenders, and the
Government’s proposal has a stronger ability to deal with
that.</hs_Para>

clause also distinguishes between those sentenced to between one and
four years imprisonment and those sentenced to more than four years. It
provides that those sentenced to more than four years should be
deported unless there are compelling circumstances, and that those
circumstances must be over and above the unduly harsh consequences of
deportation on the criminal’s
family.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013058000535" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0002.htm#14013058000535">There
is an issue about the sort of wording used.  I think the Bill
goes further than the new clause. The new clause allows
“manifest and overwhelming harm” to a child to override
deportation, even for the most serious criminals, but the test of
whether there would be manifest and overwhelming harm to a child is
unclear. We can argue about whether that is a weaker test than
requiring “very compelling circumstances”, but I think
such issues raise concerns about my hon. Friend’s new
clause.</hs_Para>

the exclusion of certain other articles of the convention in the new

indicated that I think the new clause is incompatible with the European
convention, and I am raising some of the other practical issues that I
think would be its impact. I think we will find it harder to deport
people because of some aspects of the new clause, and that more cases
will go to the European Court as that would become the first decision
maker in a number of cases. There would be considerable litigation in
the domestic courts if we found ourselves seeking to remove someone
contrary to a rule 39 indication. Those are practical issues about
whether we can deport individuals.</hs_Para>

Friend’s point. We propose to reinforce the commitment to end
the detention of children for immigration purposes by putting key
elements of the family returns process into primary legislation. That
will involve providing a statutory prohibition on the detention of
children within immigration removals centres, subject to the exceptions
agreed in 2010, which continue to be Government policy; providing
families with children a minimum of a 28-day reflection period
following the exhaustion of appeal rights against a removal before
their enforced removal; placing a statutory duty on the Secretary of
State to appoint an independent family returns panel to advise on the
best interests of the child in every case in which enforced return is
proposed; and providing a separate legal basis for pre-departure
accommodation independent of other immigration detention facilities.

House of Lords. I hope that covers my hon. Friend’s concerns on

policies currently deter students from coming to the UK. We need to

Our new clause 13 and amendment 1 relate to an important matter, raised

will remove immigration tribunal appeals from the armoury of
individuals who wish to stay in the UK, and replace them with
administrative review, which, in my view, is already part of the
process. This is important because, while the tribunals continue to
uphold decisions, in many cases they overturn decisions made by the

the light of the Government’s own assessments, we think that the
cost of people going to judicial review, rather than tribunal, might be
about £10 million year, and that Her Majesty’s Treasury

costs will not be met. There are cost implications, never mind the

Gurung—no relation—was convicted of manslaughter. He

necessary to study the case law of the Immigration and Asylum Tribunal

the criminals, not those of their families. Far from safeguarding the
vulnerable, it can expose them to undue pressure, if not worse, from
dangerous offenders. Let me give just two
examples.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013058000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0002.htm#14013058000622">In
one case, a man who had been jailed for raping his partner twice
relied, successfully, on his relationship and daughter with the same
woman to avoid deportation. It worries me that female victims may be
coerced into being reunited with violent criminals who see them as a
legal lifeline enabling them to stay in this country. In another case,
a drug dealer who had been convicted of beating his girlfriend, and who
had been jailed twice for other brutal, barbaric attacks, successfully
cited his young daughter as a ground for evading deportation, although
he had never paid maintenance and had scarcely seen his daughter until
lawyers explained that that might help his case, and although the
mother did not want her daughter to visit him in prison. Far from
protecting children, article 8 risks making them pawns, subject to
coercion or worse, in criminals’ desperate struggle to resist
deportation and stay in Britain.</hs_Para>

covering persistent petty offenders—which would be far more
likely to attract challenges under article 8, because in the case of
less serious offences deportation is more likely to be deemed
disproportionate—they will be able to do so. However—it

slavery or something akin to it. That would automatically be caught by
article 3, which covers “inhumane or degrading
treatment”. There has never, to my knowledge, been a case in
either the Strasbourg or the United Kingdom courts in which deportation
has been trumped on the basis of article 4. It would already be covered

Straw:</Member></B> On 24 November 2003, a young girl aged
9, Amy Houston, was killed on the west side of my constituency of
Blackburn by a man driving a motor car, Aso Mohammed Ibrahim. He was an
unfounded asylum seeker with no basis for remaining in the United
Kingdom, and at the time of the motor accident, had a number of
convictions for driving while disqualified and driving without
insurance. He received a relatively short prison sentence for causing
death by careless driving. Thereafter, he developed a relationship with
a woman in my constituency who already had two children by other men.
He then went on to commit further offences.</hs_Para>

Office made efforts to deport Aso Mohammed Ibrahim, he resisted them on
article 8 grounds. The matter went before a tribunal, which found in
his favour. I was Justice Secretary by that time, and I spoke to the
then Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon
Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson), who ensured that a vigorous appeal
was mounted in respect of that tribunal judgment. A new appeal was
established, but that too was lost. Principally, it was lost on the
ground not of Strasbourg law but of the way in which the British courts
had widened the basis of article 8 beyond that of Strasbourg in order
to protect individuals in this situation.</hs_Para>

more about the background of the case than ever went before the
tribunals, my opinion was—and remains—that that man had
abused his position in this country and set out to develop a
relationship with a woman and have children with her solely in order to
evade deportation and immigration controls. It is a matter of regret to
me and to my right hon. Friend the Member for Kingston upon Hull West
and Hessle that the courts appeared to endorse his wilful decision to
evade those controls.</hs_Para>

those reasons that I, and those on my Front Bench, strongly support the
amendments to the law that appear in clause 14 of the Bill. I have
great regard for the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab), and I
have talked to him at considerable length about the merits of his new
clause. I am also listening carefully, as I said I would, to the debate
today. I have no difficulty with seeking to direct the British courts
towards a different conclusion from that towards which they are
currently directed by the higher domestic courts in this country. That
is also the purpose of clause 14.</hs_Para>

problem, however, with the House knowingly deciding to legislate in a
way that the best advice suggests would be incompatible with convention
rights. That is because I am a strong supporter of the European
convention on human rights. If the House wishes to decide to leave the
convention, or to abrogate individual parts of it, it should seek to do
so explicitly, rather than through an amendment of this kind. I accept
that the hon. Gentleman has thought carefully about this matter, but it
is with regret that I shall be unable to support his proposal
today.</hs_Para>

want briefly to comment on a point made by the hon. Member for
Canterbury (Mr Brazier) on the way in which the higher courts have
interpreted the Human Rights Act. I am proud of the Act, and although
we can always amend legislation in the light of experience, I do not
believe that it needs to be amended. It is a well crafted Act that
brings into British law the convention rights to which we are subject
anyway. The idea was that those rights should be accessible here,
rather than in Strasbourg. Abolishing the Act would not remove our
obligations under the European convention; the British Government would
still be subject to them, but those rights would be more difficult to
access.</hs_Para>

with the Human Rights Act is the way in which our higher courts have
interpreted sections 2 and 3. They place on the courts an obligation to
“take into account” Strasbourg jurisprudence, but our
courts have interpreted that as meaning that our courts should follow
Strasbourg jurisprudence. If the House had meant to use the word
“follow”, we would have put it into the legislation. We
did not do so; we used the words “take into account”. The
Law Lords, in their wisdom, decided that in practice that meant
“follow”.</hs_Para>

serious issue that we need to put right to ensure that, in future,
greater flexibility is given to the British courts. Yes, of course the
courts have to apply the convention, which was the point made in the
articles; that is made absolutely clear under section 2 of the Human
Rights Act. As for the degree to which the courts apply the Strasbourg
jurisprudence based on those convention articles, they need to take
account of it, but not follow it. It is very important that our courts
get back to the intention of this Parliament in 1998 when it passed the
Human Rights Act. Had they done so, Aso Mohammed Ibrahim would not
still be in this country. The problems we ran into there were not in
respect of the convention of the Strasbourg Court or of the Human
Rights Act, but in respect of the way in which article 8 had been
interpreted by our own courts. It is my earnest hope that clause 14
will lead to some change in that.</hs_Para>

the convention rights, section 4 of the Act makes it absolutely crystal
clear that those provisions remain in force. That was part of the
elegant architecture of the Human Rights Act. The role of the
Parliamentary Counsel was to ensure that parliamentary sovereignty over
individual legislation was maintained. The problem of the hon.

and 57 seek to impose some kind of challenge and limit on detention.
The UK detains more people under immigration powers than almost any
other country in Europe. Only Greece detains more, but it tends to
detain people only for very short periods of time as they come to the
border. In fact, we are unique in detaining people indefinitely. That
experience of indefinite detention causes profound stress to the
individuals concerned, many of whom suffer from mental health
difficulties as a result of the journey that they made to get here, and
many exhibit profound mental health difficulties during their period in
detention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013058000701" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013058000701">Furthermore,
in many cases, we have no chance of removing the people whom we have in
detention to a third country. Often, people are left languishing in
detention for extended periods because we are unable to move them to
the country of their origin either because it is not safe to do so or
because we cannot obtain travel papers. We have been repeatedly
criticised for the number of people we detain and for the length of the
period for which we detain them. Indeed, the detained fast track system
seems to be largely used for administrative purposes.

it is not effective in doing what we claim to be trying to deliver. The
people detained over a long period of time are those whom we are least

detainees and found that only a third were ultimately removed or
deported. The longer somebody is in detention, the less likely they are
to be removed. Extreme stress is caused to the individual, extreme
expense is caused to the UK and no benefit is gained for the wider

in place in the Home Office a practice of considering the best

migrant who has been in the country for less than seven years will

the point is of tabling something that is confused and contradicts what

deportation goes slightly wider than the issue of children. Further to
the discussion on new clause 15, I want to raise a constituent case. A
young man came here as an extremely young child and was given refugee
status. His parents then had some difficulties and he was taken into
care. His mother had mental health difficulties. The local authority
negligently placed him into the foster care of a couple who were drug
dealers and continued to engage in significant criminal activity during

young child. He had been given refugee status. There was no family for
him to go back to. By all decent recognition of what had happened to
him, the state had been negligent in how it treated him. I cannot see

whether new clause 15 is in accordance with the European convention on
human rights. I have had advice from the Immigration Law Practitioners
Association that the Home Secretary was unlikely to be able to sign up
to saying that the provision was compatible with the Human Rights Act
1998, which would make it difficult for it to go into the House of
Lords. There was a mischievous moment when I wondered whether, despite
my abhorrence for the new clause, I should support it in order to
destroy the Bill completely, given that I do not seem  to be

have not had much opportunity to discuss amendment 60. It relates to
limits in the use of force by immigration officers and tries to bring
it back to the status quo. This seems to be another example of giving a
blank cheque, and to an organisation that has hardly covered itself in
glory where use of force is concerned. We have had issues with use of
force against pregnant 
<?notus-xml column=1078?>women—something on which Her Majesty’s inspectorate of
prisons was extremely critical of the Home Office. We have had the
death of Jimmy Mubenga. Those are just two recent

gives all immigration officers retrospective freedom against any Act
that has previously come into force, any power that immigration
officers have and any future power that they have to use force to do
what they want to do. Given the problems that we have already seen in
making sure that contractors and immigration officers follow best

that we made in relation to treatment of children and families that we
would end child detention. The agreement was much wider, I hasten to
add, than families being kept in Yarl’s Wood. It was about
working with children and families and the extent to which force would
be used throughout the process. The power in schedule 1 is very

great deal of guff about the Bill being focused on restricting the
rights of appeal of people who do play by the rules. It is important to
stress that the restrictions on appeal in the Bill are exactly for
those who do play by the rules. They are for people who come here to
work and for family purposes. When taken together with the changes that
make it 
<?notus-xml column=1079?>more difficult to get a spousal visa, it is hard not to see this as an
attack on family life. An administrative review is simply not
equivalent to an appeal. An organisation such as the Home Office cannot

the Bill is foreign to how we want to run our NHS. It has nothing to do
with how we want to deliver our devolved services. We are not
privatising the NHS like they are down here; we want to invest in it
and ensure that it sticks to the ’45 principles of “from
cradle to grave”. We fundamentally disagree with the Government
about the need for such measures, and we want an LCM so that we can say
clearly to them, “Stay out of our devolved services. Keep your
race with UKIP out of our delivery of the NHS and other devolved
services.” I still hope, although it is probably too late, that
we will have an

number of the measures in the group are pretty chilling, one of which
is new clause 18, on which the Home Secretary spent such a good part of
her hour and a half speech. What an appalling measure. This is about
removing citizenship from people. Watching the Home Secretary’s
attempts to respond to the many searching “what happens
if” questions would almost have been comical were it not so sad.
She could not start to answer the simple question—some of my
hon. colleagues on this side of the House might want to revisit this
during the winding-up speeches—of what happens to someone who is
stripped of their UK citizenship but is not taken by any other country.
I think I heard something along the lines of, “We might give
them their citizenship back,” but if that is the case, what is
the point of doing it in the first place? Who is going to take these
people? Are we going to launch them into orbit and leave them circling
round the Earth as stateless people without any sort of citizenship? Is
France going to take them, or Germany?

depend on them? We really need to hear from her on that.</hs_Para>

which is absolutely appalling. In fact, to say that the

interrogated by the FBI. Perhaps that is what will happen to all these
people. They are being betrayed by their own Government, whose duty is

allies, which looks like what we will be doing. She said that we are

I first say how fortunate it is that the Government and the authorities
that be have ensured that new clause 15 has come up for
debate this afternoon? It is crucial that the House of Commons
should get to debate that which the House of Commons wishes to debate,

The business managers therefore deserve to be commended for
their wisdom in allowing that to happen, and those in even higher
positions of authority—I am thinking of Mr Speaker, in

ensured that the will of the House has been allowed to be expressed and
a view come to. That is good fortune for us all.</hs_Para>

our system of liberty is the fact that liberty comes with
responsibilities. One of those responsibilities is that if a

punishment is their responsibility and their fault. They cannot get out
of it because other people might be indirectly 
<?notus-xml column=1084?>affected by it. That is not what their actions have caused; their
actions have caused them to go to prison, for a minimum of a year
according to the new clause, and then to be deported because they were
foreign criminals and therefore had no automatic right to be here in
the first place. That is an important and fair
principle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000011">If
the alternative view is taken, which is that there will be knock-on
effects on other people and therefore it is unfair and unreasonable to
allow a punishment to take place, then no punishment can ever take
place and we can have no proper rule of law in this country. Whenever
somebody commits a crime and is likely to be sent to prison, they will
say that their family cannot cope with that and that it will be unfair,
and therefore their sentence must be brought down and they must be free
to carry on their life of crime. I fundamentally disagree with the hon.

punishment. The logic of the argument of the Member for Brent Central
is that if someone’s punishment had an effect on their children
that led not to “manifest and overwhelming harm” but to
either manifest harm or overwhelming harm, it would be fundamentally
and in principle unfair on the children, so that part of the punishment
should not be carried out. Surely, however, it might equally be said
that someone’s imprisonment would have an effect of manifest but
not “manifest and overwhelming” harm on the children. If
such an argument was accepted, the whole criminal justice concept of
punishing people who have committed offences would become extremely
difficult. Deportation is therefore simply a reasonable part of the
overall punishment for someone who commits a serious
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000014">I
listened with great interest to the debate about the status of new
clause 15 in European and UK law. A principle that we should always
state and restate in this House is that, by its very nature, Parliament
cannot pass a law that is illegal. We can pass laws that contravene
international obligations or that we may decide our diplomatic
relations require us to remove or repeal, but Parliament cannot pass an
illegal
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000015">That
point is important to remember, because there is a tyranny of lawyers.
They give people advice stating that they think x or y, but until it
has been judged by a court, that is no more than advice, which may be
right or wrong. If my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has been
advised by the Home Office lawyer that the new clause does not meet the
requirements of the 
<?notus-xml column=1085?>European convention on human rights, that does not question the right of
this House to pass it into law: it is our right to do so, and then to
consider the judgment that may or may not be made by the European Court
of Human Rights. That of course leaves open the question of whether the
Home Secretary can sign the declaration that the Bill is compatible
with the European convention on human rights. I am delighted that she
is returning to her place as I say
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000016">My
right hon. Friend has the right to go to another lawyer. When given
legal advice that they do not like, many people see whether they can
find one who gives different advice. Amazingly enough, when they pay a
better lawyer, they sometimes get better advice. I hope that even in an
era of austerity, Her Majesty’s Government may seek out some
better lawyers who can give improved advice that is more in line with
what my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton
said.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000017">The
question is therefore only one of incompatibility, not of legality. I
hope that the Opposition Front Bench team will also think about that.
Whether the new clause is accepted and passed into law is not
fundamentally a legal decision, because the legal position is as yet
unproved—it has not been tested in the courts—so it is a
political decision or a political statement about what hon. Members on
both sides of the House think is the right way to treat people from
foreign countries who have committed serious crimes. I would take the
political decision that it is right to expel them from this country,
and that it would be wrong to do so only if extraordinary factors meant
that they ought to have the right to
stay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000018"><B><Member ContinuationText="Yasmin Qureshi" PimsId="5523" UID="14013061000841" xid="1016" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000841">Yasmin
Qureshi:</Member></B> It is on exactly that point that some Opposition
Members have concerns about new clause 15. As the hon.
Gentleman says, there may be exceptional circumstances that mean a
decision should be made not to deport somebody, but the new clause
tabled by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) would take
away exactly such discretion, because it says, “If you get one
year’s imprisonment, you’re
out.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jacob Rees-Mogg" PimsId="5628" UID="14013061000842" xid="1186" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000842">Jacob
Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> As always, the hon. Lady makes an excellent
point, but it is a question about which bit of discretion would be
taken away. The courts would retain discretion if there was a threat of
harm or a threat to life and limb, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Esher and Walton pointed out. Discretion would be circumscribed only in
very specific cases relating to article 8, and that would be done
because the courts appear to have made some quite eccentric decisions.
What has really brought this to the attention of the British public is
the huge backlog of deportations—4,000 people are apparently
waiting to be deported—and the fact that a very high number of
challenges are brought purely on the basis of article 8 rights, which
cannot therefore involve people in fear of torture or of harm to life
and limb. I do not think that anybody in the House wants to deport
people at risk to life and limb. As a nation, we believe in offering
refugee status to people genuinely at threat, but we are not in favour
of the exaggeration of spurious rights.</hs_Para>

said, the decision is a political decision, not a legal one. It is for
this House to make a political choice about how our criminal justice
system works, 
<?notus-xml column=1086?>what rights belong to people who have committed very serious crimes and
how far such rights should go. If it became a legal decision—if
it were taken to the courts—we would find out at a later stage
whether the European Court of Human Rights thought it was compatible
with the convention. The House would then make a second choice, which
would be whether to maintain today’s political decision or
reverse it to be compatible with the convention. That is not the choice
before us today. This is a routine exercise of parliamentary
sovereignty in adding to a Bill a provision that may become law and be
justiciable at a later
stage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000021">I
know that a lot of other Members want to speak, so I will be brief on
new clause 18. I have some concerns about it. I am perhaps rather
romantic in my view of what it means to be a British subject. I always
though that Palmerston got it right on the Don Pacifico
affair—the “Civis Romanus sum” principle. Once any
one of us has a passport that says we are British, we are as British as
anybody else, whether they were born here or got their passport five
minutes ago. It is incredibly important that there is equality before
the law for all Her Majesty’s subjects who are living in this
country and have right of residence here.</hs_Para>

if we give the Government the ability to take passports away from a
certain category of British subject but not from others, it will create
a potential unfairness and a second category of citizen. There are
Members of the House who were born abroad and have been naturalised
and, on occasion, they may vote against the Government, which I hope
the Whips will not consider serious enough reason to remove their
passport. The fundamental underlying principle of equality of all Her
Majesty’s subjects is important. I am always nervous about
giving the Executive relatively arbitrary powers, because they are the
ones that can be most misused. Once a passport is in somebody’s
hands, they ought to be no different from anybody else in any legal
respect.</hs_Para>

there may well already be laws that could deal with the problem in
another way. If people have committed an offence so serious, important
and threatening to the life of the nation that their passport should be
confiscated, surely they have committed some other crime for which they
could be charged, dragged through the courts, perhaps found guilty by a
jury and then sentenced accordingly, with the penalty handed down in
the right and proper way and their rights and liberties as subjects
being maintained. They may have committed treason if they have done
something so serious that they are to have their passport removed from
them.</hs_Para>

almost complete agreement with the hon. Gentleman, which is
rare—I think unique. One should always be suspicious of the
arbitrary power of 
<?notus-xml column=1087?>the state. As we saw with today’s proceedings about whether there
would even be a vote on new clause 15, the
arbitrary power of the state can sometimes be misused. The Executive
sometimes have to come under pressure before they give way and allow
the proper proceedings to take place. I much prefer a legal process,
and I do not want to make the statement that people who have got their
citizenship more recently than I did are in any sense lesser citizens.
I fundamentally do not believe that. Anybody who is fortunate enough to

correct him on a few details. Although Palmerston thought that Don
Pacifico was undoubtedly a British citizen, merely because of his birth

They are a real problem and in certain places in the

midlands—there is a real issue to be tackled. I warmly commend
Ministers who have taken the right actions in the Bill to deal with
that. I am concerned, however, as my right hon. Friend the Member for
Delyn (Mr Hanson) said earlier, about the business of removing
people’s citizenship, not least because the way the proposal has
been drafted gives a phenomenal degree of Executive power to the

I remember going to the deportation centre at Heathrow and seeing a
young man whose state we do not know. He refuses to say where he is
from because he thinks he will be deported back to that place. He had
then been in that deportation centre for four years because for him,
that half life in a sort of prison was better than the danger of being
deported back somewhere. Some think the best way of dealing with the
problem of deporting foreign criminals involves measures to change the
rules on article 8. The biggest problem lies not with that, however,
but with an awful lot of people who get to this country and instantly
abandon their paperwork, either because that is what they intended to
do from the beginning, or because they are from countries to which we
simply cannot deport people. Again, I commend those Ministers who have
worked—as Labour Ministers did in the previous
Government—to try to ensure that people will not be subject to
torture if they are returned to their country of origin, and that they
will have a fair trial and so on There are, however, many countries
around the world where such things still do not apply, and those cases
make up the largest number of people, let alone those whose paperwork
has been lost by the Home Office—also a substantial number. Of
course I want foreign criminals to be deported and sent back to their
country of origin, but I also want their human rights to be protected.
I still believe in the right to a fair trial and am opposed to torture.

make them stateless and deprive them of citizenship, but then what? Do
we banish them? Do we pronounce exile? Does the Speaker demand that
they leave the country? Do we march them to the airport if they refuse
to go themselves? In any case, where will they go? What country will
take them? That is my problem with the proposals being advanced. There
is a mediaeval element in the Bill and it will not help us one
jot.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000042"><Member ContinuationText="Mike Gapes" PimsId="3370" UID="14013061000857" xid="219" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000857"><B>Mike

constructed. Ultimately, the absolute core and rock on which our
personal freedoms in this country are based is the rule of law. Because
of habeas corpus nobody can be arbitrarily arrested. The law will
determine, not party politics or a vote in the House of Commons. To
those who regularly trot out the argument that the House of Commons

the amendment was incompatible. I do not mind which lawyer it was and I

European convention on human rights, I cannot vote for the amendment
and do not want to see it going forward from this House as part of the

Attorney-General, or whoever was masking for him to provide that

That is not my issue. All we have to do is look at the amendment,
compare it with the European convention on human rights and see that
the one does not match the other. That may be an inconvenient fact, but
it would be illegal under our present treaty obligations. I do not want
this country to renege on the European convention on human rights. We
were right to bring it forward. David Maxwell Fyfe, who later became a
Conservative Home Secretary—a nasty Home Secretary, I
think—effectively drafted it and we should abide by it. We would

Rhondda (Chris Bryant) in a moment, but may I first say that a number
of Members have used the opportunity of the Report stage to attack the
principles behind the Bill? This is an excellent Bill that addresses
very real public concerns. I understand and share the concern that the
amendments on deprivation of citizenship were tabled at the very last
moment. Nevertheless, we must address the crisis of
hundreds—some responsible sources suggest it might extend to
thousands—of young men going abroad to be trained in terrorist
activities. There is a tradition, which goes back to the dawn of time,
of countries depriving people of citizenship where they engage in
actively hostile military acts. Clearly, the wording needs tightening
up, but it would require considerable discretion by the
Executive—albeit exercised within a narrow definition of
“hostile acts”—because it might not be possible to
put some of the material before a court.</hs_Para>

issues. I was making the same point that the right hon. Member for
Leicester East (Keith Vaz), the Chairman of the Home Affairs Select
Committee, made, which was about people who take up arms abroad.
Whether they were born in this country or not, there is a long

support new clause 15. We have heard about the various cases, including
one from the right hon. Member for Blackburn, and we have gone around
the buoy of these three centres of power—the British Parliament,
the British courts and the ECHR. I strongly support the view of Lord
Judge, the outstanding retiring Lord Chief Justice, that Parliament
needs to make it clear which, ultimately, is the supreme court for
British law. Is it the UK Supreme Court, as he suggests it should be,

while his proposal is almost certainly incompatible with recent rulings
of the European Court of Human Rights, that cannot mean that it is
illegal. This is a sovereign Parliament. We can pass the measure and
the courts can try cases under it. If we make it clear, as I believe we
should, that the Supreme Court in this country should be the supreme
court, we do not have a problem. It is by pursuing cases such as this
that we can finally sort out whether or not, as some Members on both
sides claim, it is possible to sort out these issues and still accept
the ultimate sovereignty of Strasbourg. We believe that we have to sort
it out by, as Lord Judge argued, stating that Parliament is ultimately
a sovereign body and that the Supreme Court in this country is indeed
the British supreme court. Only by having a measure like this can we
sort that

Richard Shepherd</B> (Aldridge-Brownhills) (Con):</Member> I am very
grateful to my hon. Friend, who mentioned our colleague the hon. Member
for Esher and Walton. But our course has been different historically.
In the Somerset case in the second half of the 18th century, a slave
had escaped and arrived in London and with the help of, I think, the
Quakers, made an appearance in front of the courts. It was held that
within our jurisdiction in this country he was entitled to the
protection of the law. Somerset was given habeas corpus although he was
not a citizen of this country and merely a slave who was passing
through this country. That was our tradition, you

Brazier:</Member></B> That was indeed our tradition. It has of course
been suspended many times, including for six years during the second
world war when German citizens

this: only by putting a measure through can we see whether or not it is
possible to sort out this kind of scandalous situation while still
allowing Strasbourg to be the supreme court. Can we test it? That is
the only way. Personally I think we should do what Lord Judge
recommends; we should pass an Act making it clear that the European
Court of Human rights should not be our supreme court and that it is
only there for persuasive purposes and that, ultimately, the Supreme
Court in Britain is our supreme court and that Parliament is
sovereign.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000068">I
want to touch for a couple of minutes on a subject that has not been
discussed at all and is extremely relevant to my hon. Friend’s
amendment, which is judicial activism. The legislation that followed
the Human Rights Act gave huge powers of discretion to judges; in fact
one of the most interesting comments coming out of the Court of Appeal
ruling on 8 October 2013 was its comment in passing that the reference
to exceptional circumstances in the rules—to which I objected
when it went through—was consistent with the proportionality
balancing exercise required by Strasbourg jurisprudence. In other
words, basically it did not affect judicial discretion at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000069">The
fact is that individual judges—who have accepted so little
guidance from Parliament or resolutions of the House of Commons in this
matter—have, basically off their own backs, acted in extreme
cases involving people guilty of the most revolting crimes and allowed
an article 8 ruling to overrule that. That has happened even when the
family connection here was pretty tenuous; in one case, the family
connection was desperate to disassociate itself from the individual.
That is a measure of the extent to which we are suffering from judicial
activism among at least one portion of the judiciary. I want to see the
constitutional side of this fixed and I want my hon. Friend’s
amendment to be passed. I shall vote for it. I also believe that we
will need to pass a measure to make it clear that the supreme court in
this country is the British Supreme Court. But I suspect that we will
still have a residual problem with the issue of judicial
activism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000070">Let
me end my speech by reminding the House of perhaps the most famous case
of judicial activism within a common-law jurisdiction in modern
history, the Dred Scott case of 1865. I remind those who talk about the
rule of law that had President Lincoln not stood up to the Supreme
Court in America—had he not said “I was elected as
President on this mandate: to prevent the spread of slavery into new
states”, and brushed away the court’s
finding—there would have been no civil war between 1861 and
1865, and there would have been no end to slavery in America at that
stage. I think that most people believe that what happened was

Home Secretary’s proposal to extend her powers in respect of the
removal of British citizenship from a limited and specific group of
people must be assessed against the judgment that it is in the national
interest or for the public good. I have to say that I have never heard 
<?notus-xml column=1094?>anyone give a single example of Britain’s having benefited from
some individual’s loss of British citizenship, and I think that
it behoves the Home Office, and possibly the Foreign Office, to find
out whether there actually have been any such benefits, because there
are certainly disbenefits. Harm is done, or can be done, when someone
loses British citizenship, and I do not mean that harm is done to the
person who loses his citizenship. I mean that harm is done to other
people—to the rest of
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000073">In
my constituency, a young Somali—I do not know whether he is a
terrorist or not a terrorist—went to Somalia, got married and
had children. He was going to come back to this country, for what
purpose I know not, but when he went to Djibouti he was arrested. After
his arrest, when he was being handed over to some Americans, he said
“You cannot do that: I am a British citizen.” He was then
told “You are not any more, because the Home Secretary has taken
your citizenship away.” He ended up being kidnapped by the
Americans, and is now facing a court in New York. If he has done
something that merits his going before a court in New York and he has
never previously been to America, he could presumably have been
prosecuted here for the same

substantial Somali community in my constituency. Needless to say, it
includes quite a few testosterone-exuding young men who are very upset
about what is happening in Somalia, and who are dubious about what the
British Government are or are not doing. However, a much bigger group
of young men, and young women, have been working tremendously hard in
trying to combat the extremist elements, such as people preaching
hatred. Indeed, they have been very successful in doing so, and the
Prime Minister himself has commended their effort and commitment. For
instance, they have massively improved the performance of Somali young
people in schools. One of the things that they were able to say when
countering the arguments of the extremists who were trying to lead
local young people astray was, “Always remember that you are a
British citizen now: you are British, not
Somali.”</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14013061000833" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000833">3.30

Robert Buckland</B> (South Swindon) (Con):</Member> In welcoming the
underlying principles of the Bill, I think that it is important to
remind the House that deportation is not a punishment in the legal
sense. When somebody commits a criminal offence and is convicted, the
punishment is the sentence. Deportation is a function of the Home
Office and the UK Border Agency in exercising their powers in relation
to nationality and the status of individuals within the country. It is
important that we make that distinction, artificial though it may seem,
to ensure that we have a deeper understanding of what deportation
should be about. I make no apology for the fact that if people commit
serious offences, consequences flow from that. When the offence is
serious enough, the consequences should include
deportation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000081">I
welcome the UK Borders Act 2007, which was introduced by the previous
Government. That Act changed the function of the criminal courts in the
regime. Previously, a Crown court judge had to consider whether the
continuing presence of an individual in the country was to the
country’s detriment and make a recommendation on deportation.
That was a cumbersome regime that did not lead to the results that the
public wanted. Sensibly, the 2007 Act brought in the rule that
deportation will be automatic for those who are sentenced to terms of
imprisonment of longer than 12
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000082">I
support the clauses of the Bill that amend the 2007 Act to bring
primary legislation into line with the immigration rules of 2012, which
in my opinion have significantly reduced the margin of discretion that
is open to judges, although it is possible to challenge the rules
themselves, as we have seen. I think that those clauses will answer
many of the legitimate questions that our constituents pose to us on
the effectiveness of the deportation
regime.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000083">Let
us not forget that, however many laws we pass and however much the
debate rages over immigration law, the enforcement of that law is the
most important thing in the eyes of the public. If the British public
believe that our immigration system works, that wrongdoers are no
longer in the country and that the deportation system is effective,
faith will be restored. We cannot get away from that essential
fact.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000084">Of
course, we are here to talk about legislation, so I will discuss new
clause 15 and amendment 62, which were tabled by my hon. Friend the
Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab). I know that he has taken great
care in considering these issues and we have discussed them
face-to-face many times. It is in a spirit of genuine concern that he
has tabled new clause 15. However, there are serious questions that we
have to ask about it. With respect to him, I think that he is error
when he suggests that the compatibility of the new clause with the
convention would not be challenged. I think that it would be subject to
such challenge, and I would go 
<?notus-xml column=1096?>further and suggest that rule 39 would apply and that injunctive relief
would be available. Let us imagine the consequences of that. If rule 39
injunctive relief were successfully obtained, that would gum up the
works not just for one deportation but for thousands in the years to
come.</hs_Para>

Buckland:</Member></B> I think that the new clause is capable of
achieving perfection, perhaps in the other place. As it stands,
however, it does not work in terms of what  it sets out to do.

or to oppose it
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000087">I
have looked carefully at the exceptions set out in section 33 of the UK
Borders Act 2007, and at the discretion that the Home Secretary is
given under the legislation. That discretion is based on a series of
factual events such as the existence of hospital orders or other Mental
Health Act dispositions. The exception proposed in new clause 11 gives
a subjective discretion that does not sit well with the wording of the
UK Borders Act. Once we opened the door to that kind of subjective
discretion, what would be the difference between what the new clause
hopes to achieve and the wording of the Bill in relation to the
discretion that is to be given to the courts? In a nutshell, the
Bill’s existing provisions, as amended, already do the job of
dealing with serious offending and of making a proper distinction
between offences for which sentences of more than four years’
imprisonment are imposed, and those for which under four years are
imposed. There is a clear logic to the provisions, and the new clause
is therefore unnecessary. It would create the risk of upsetting the
entire apple cart when it comes to the important work of deporting
serious criminals from our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013061000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000088"><Member ContinuationText="John McDonnell" PimsId="1799" UID="14013061000878" xid="379" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000878"><B>John

to only one amendment in the group, amendment 79, which deals with the
restriction of bail for detainees. I have 1,000 detainees in my
constituency, at the Harmondsworth and Colnbrook detention centres. The
Bill will deny many of them the right to apply for bail in the 14 days
before their removal. I deal with detainees in my office almost every
working day of my life. Large numbers of them are parents and, in those
last 14 days, they want to get bail so that they can see their
children. Others need bail because they are sick or suffering from a
mental illness. The Bill will deny them that opportunity, on the
approval of the Secretary of State.</hs_Para>

also mean that a person will be unable to apply for bail if they have
already applied 28 days beforehand. That means that there could be new
set directions under the first rule, and a rolling programme 
<?notus-xml column=1097?>could mean that people never have the opportunity to apply for bail.
Some might think that spending 28 days in a detention centre before
someone can apply for bail is not that significant. I suggest that they
visit a detention centre. I also suggest that they read the report on
visits to the Harmondsworth detention centre during 2013. It sets out
the number of people whom doctors had determined were mentally ill, had
ill health effects from their past experiences or had been subjected to
torture. Of the 125 being held under rule 35, only 12 were
released.</hs_Para>

is a crisis of mental health in detention, as demonstrated by the many
Court cases…Evidence and experience shows that mental illness is
the greatest health issue for detainees. The safeguards to prevent the
detention of those with serious mental illness are not working. The
rate of mental illness is already high in those who are subject to
detention, in part due to the stresses in their life journey to that

distress”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14013061000092" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013061000092">The
reasons for that distress are clear. When someone is detained, they may
be told that they cannot appeal for 28 days, then they may lose that
appeal and bail as well. There then follows another 28 days, and so on.

detention impacts on people’s mental health.</hs_Para>

increase harm and be counter- productive. It will deny justice to the

Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) has not sought to deny that, but
seeks to suggest that whatever this House passes it would, none the
less, be lawful as a question of domestic law—of course, in that
respect he is right. The question is whether we should knowingly
legislate in direct and conscious breach of our international law
obligations. In my judgment that is not consistent with the dignity of
this House. The right way to approach an international obligation with
which we have a legitimate dispute is to take an axe to the root cause
of the problem, and not continually to worry away like a dog gnawing at
its own tail in frustration at the problem. The root of the problem
lies in our adherence to the convention, and we cannot seek to avoid it
or to play fast and loose with it in the way that new clause 15 does.

to fail, as inevitably it will when it reaches the Strasbourg Court. We
cannot exclude from the operation of the entire convention, with the
exception of two articles, the actions of the Secretary of State, who
is a public authority. Nothing could be more clearly in direct
contravention of our obligations than to say that she may act in
violation of a human right. Of course, the courts in this country will
declare it to be incompatible and the courts in Strasbourg, armed with
that declaration of incompatibility, will unquestionably also declare
it to be incompatible and in breach of our obligations.</hs_Para>

Vaz:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to follow the hon. and
learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr Cox). I feel as though I
am in the middle of an application for judicial review rather than
discussing the politics of this 
<?notus-xml column=1099?>country. I take a different view from him. When I came into the Chamber,
I would have supported what he said. However, I was very impressed by
the speech made by the hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) and I
will support new clause 15 if he moves it. It is compatible with what
the Select Committee on Home Affairs has been saying for a number of
years. We hold the Government to account every three months on the
number of foreign prisoners that they manage to remove from this
country and every month they produce figures for the Committee. If the
new clause is a way of ensuring that that happens on a more regular
basis, I will certainly support
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000159">As
far as new clause 18 is concerned, I was also impressed by the speech
made by the hon. Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather), who has just
as big an immigration case load as I have. The Home Secretary is right:
previous Home Secretaries have sought to remove citizenship as a way of
punishing those who have broken our laws. Jacqui Smith certainly sought
to do that in the al-Jedda case. She lost when it went before the
courts, and I understand that it is still before the courts as there is
an appeal. In that case, the court determined that there was a hope
that taking away British citizenship would mean that al-Jedda would be
able to get Iraqi citizenship. The Secretary of State told the House
today that she will take away citizenship, leaving people stateless
without a way out of the
country—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> She did not tell
the House how she would get a stateless person to leave the country.
They would require a passport from another country or a travelling
document and neither are on offer when citizenship has been taken
away.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000160">I
am very impressed by how the Home Secretary delivers her speeches and
statements in the House, but I thought there was a slight reluctance
today to put her case. Yes, she spoke for an hour and a half and took a
lot of interventions but I am concerned that the measure has not been
thought through. If there was a way out and we knew how a stateless
person would leave the country, I would certainly support her proposals
in new clause 18, but this is a work in progress. There is no final
determination on
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000161">I
put to the Secretary of State the one case about which the Committee
was concerned when she gave evidence to us on 16 December—that
is, the case of Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed. He did not want to come back to
the United Kingdom; he wanted to stay in Somaliland. In evidence to the
Committee, both the Secretary of State and Charles Farr said that there
was an obligation to bring him back to the United Kingdom. He was
subject to a terrorism prevention and investigation measure, but he
then put on his famous burqa and is now somewhere in the
country.</hs_Para>

as follows. I understand that the proposal would affect people in and
outside the country and I know that it would affect only very few
people. I take the Home Secretary at her word, but if this measure was
passed today would it have affected the Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed case?
Would he have been left in Somaliland, stateless? Would there have been
no obligation, therefore, to bring him back? I will support the hon.
Member for Brent Central in opposing new clause 18. I hope that by the
time it gets to the other place there will be a plan that will finally
determine what will happen to people who become
stateless.</hs_Para>

Huppert:</Member></B> It is a pleasure as ever to follow the Chair of
the Select Committee. I welcome the comments of the Home Secretary on
my amendment 74 on ending child detention. The Government were right to
do it a few years ago and they are now absolutely right to write it
into legislation. It was profoundly wrong that under the previous
Government thousands upon thousands of children were detained purely
for immigration purposes—7,075 children in five years, and not
just for a day or so but in one case as long as 190 days. That was a
disgrace to this country and I am delighted that the Government ended
it and have made sure that, whatever the next Government and the one
after that, they will not be able to reintroduce it. It was a great
shame that the Labour Front-Bench team refused to be as pleased as I
was that this had been written into law, and I look forward to the
legislation in the Lords reflecting Government policy. That is
excellent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000165">I
listened carefully to what the Home Secretary said on statelessness. I
thank her for coming to talk to me and many of my colleagues about it;
we had many questions. I have a lot of sympathy with the problem that
she faces. There are instances in which citizenship should be taken
away, and one is where fraud has taken place. I have no problem with
someone who has acquired British citizenship by fraud not being allowed
to keep it. That is easy. There are then issues about dual
nationals—again, that is an easier case—and mono
nationals who are in the UK. I share the concerns of the right hon.
Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz) any many others about the
problems of taking citizenship away from someone who is in this
country. The Home Secretary hopes that they will be able to acquire
citizenship of another country, and in some cases that may be possible,
in which case they would not be stateless, but we cannot be
sure.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14013062000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000166">It seems to
me that the country that may be able to give someone citizenship may be
less keen to do so when we have just ruled that they are a danger to
this country. They would be far more reluctant in that situation. We
would certainly be much less keen to grant citizenship to someone who
had just been deprived of citizenship of another country. There is then
the question of what happens to that person. The Home Office advice
about people who are stateless is that they can have two and a half
years leave to remain and can then apply for a further two and a half
years, after which they get indefinite leave to remain. Are we saying
that we will grant people indefinite leave to remain while they cannot
leave the country? Do we really want people who are so dangerous, who
have been involved in such awful gang behaviour, to be trapped inside
this country? I find that deeply alarming.</hs_Para>

the idea of creating two-tier citizenship. So while I respect what the
Home Secretary is trying  to do, I will not support the new
clause; I will vote against it.</hs_Para>

talk in great detail about the other amendments that I and my hon.
Friend the Member for Brent Central (Sarah Teather) tabled about the
interests of children except to say that it is odd that, in a time of
austerity when we are trying to save money, we still spend a huge
amount detaining people for a long time who will not be able to get out
of the country in the end.  
<?notus-xml column=1101?>It is costing us millions and millions of pounds and it seems to me that
this is a saving that the Home Office should be keen to make. I hope
that it
will.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000169">In
the last minutes remaining, let me turn to the new clause tabled by the
hon. Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab), who spoke, as ever,
extremely well. I agree with what the Home Secretary said about his new
clause. It is clear that it would be illegal and would undermine what
we are trying to achieve. She argued, and I see no reason to disagree,
that it would weaken the deportation. My hon. Friend spoke eloquently
about it, saying that it was phenomenal how far it ran against the
interests of children. It is not something that I or that Liberal
Democrats can support. All of us will vote against the proposal. We
will stand up for the Government’s original legislation on this
issue whether or not other Government Members do. I hope that hon.
Members such as the hon. and learned Member for Torridge and West Devon
(Mr Cox) will persuade many of their colleagues to stand up for the
Government on this issue and vote against the new clause. I hope that
he will be joined by colleagues in the Labour party; I believe that
they have now finally settled their position. I look forward to the new
clause being comfortably
defeated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000170"><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Lucas" PimsId="1568" UID="14013062001972" xid="1022" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062001972"><B>Caroline

nature of the Bill. I also associate myself with the views of the hon.
Member for Perth and North Perthshire (Pete Wishart), who spoke with
his customary eloquence and reminded us that we should be under no
illusion that this miserable piece of legislation has very little to do
with national security, but everything to do with out-toughing UKIP. No
one would argue that our immigration system does not need fixing or
that it is not blighted by inefficiency and error, yet rather than
taking positive steps to fix the problems, the Government have brought
forward proposals that will drive standards down, not
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000174">All
the amendments in the group that I support would make the immigration
system fairer and more accountable, such as amendment 1, which would
delete clause 11. It is important that we support that amendment
because the latest figures reveal that 32% of deportation decisions and
49% of entry-clearance applications were successfully appealed last
year, yet the Government’s depressing response to that large
margin of error is not to try to improve the quality of decision
making, but to reduce the opportunities for challenge by slashing the
scope for
appeal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000175">Amendment
79 was tabled by the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John
McDonnell), who spoke movingly about it, and co-signed by the hon.
Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn). The basis of clause 3 is
utterly flawed, given that it sets out the idea 
<?notus-xml column=1102?>that directions for removal within 14 days are somehow sufficient
grounds to assume that bail should not be granted. On any common-sense
analysis, there are factors that bluntly challenge that assumption.
Plenty of people suffering from psychological or physical illnesses, or
who have been bereaved or have caring responsibilities, should not be
detained, but will not be able properly to challenge that
detention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000176">I

May:</Member></B> With the leave of the House, I shall respond to some
of the points that have been raised. I do not agree with the manuscript
amendments to new clause 18 that were tabled by the right
hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson). It is right for the Secretary of
State, as someone who is democratically accountable, to take the
initial decision, but I confirm that there will be a full right of
appeal, so a judicial process will apply. I accept that the Opposition
have concerns about the new clause, so I will be happy for the Minister
for Immigration to sit down with the right hon. Gentleman and go
through his concerns before the provision is considered by the other
place. I hope that that will be of benefit to him and that it brings
him some
comfort.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000179">I
stress again that I strongly support the intention behind new clause
15, which was tabled by my hon. Friend the Member for Esher and Walton
(Mr Raab). Everyone in the House wants to ensure that we can deport
more foreign criminals, but it is absolutely clear that the provision,
as drafted, is incompatible with the European convention on human
rights. Crucially, it would weaken at least two aspects of the Bill,
given that it does not deal with persistent offenders who have been
subject to sentences of less than 12 months. I am also worried that it
provides for an exception to apply when a child has not lived in the
country for a significant time and does not have a relationship with
their parent. Our Bill requires that a child must be British, that they
must have lived in the country for a particular period of time, and
that there must be a genuine and subsisting relationship with the
child. Given its drafting, the new clause would cause problems in the
sort of cases that the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)
talked
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000180">There
are also concerns that the drafting of the new clause would lead to a
number of rule 39 cases. However, I recognise that there are
issues—the right hon. Gentleman said this—with some of
the language in the new clause, which we can consider and come back to.
As drafted, I do not think that it is appropriate, but Conservative
Ministers will abstain from the
vote.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0003.htm#14013062000181">I
said that I would mention rule 39, on which I intervened earlier. The
reasons why I am concerned that the amendment would lead to fewer
deportations are: 
<?notus-xml column=1103?>first, because the language in the amendment in relation to children
would lead to significant litigation; and secondly, because although
article 8, under the current system, does not lead to rule 39

me remind the House why the Bill is so necessary. It will bring
clarity, fairness and integrity to the immigration system, and will
address long-standing problems that have prevented the effective
operation of immigration controls. It will do that by ensuring that
those who are refused permission to stay are required to leave the
country, and know that they must do so; by streamlining the appeals
system to reduce the scope for playing the system; by ensuring that
foreign criminals can be deported first and appeal afterwards, unless
there is a real risk of serious irreversible harm; and by ensuring that
courts must have regard to the will of Parliament when considering
article 8 in immigration cases.</hs_Para>

make it more difficult for illegal migrants to live in the United
Kingdom by denying access to the tools of everyday life. That will
include giving landlords a duty to check the immigration status of
tenants and imposing penalties on rogue landlords, and denying illegal
migrants access to bank accounts and driving licences. We will also
strengthen the enforcement of penalties for employers of illegal
workers. The Bill reinforces controls to counter sham marriages and
sham civil partnerships, conferring new powers and duties, and it will
ensure that temporary legal migrants contribute to our national health
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001465" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001465"><Member ContinuationText="Ms Diane Abbott" PimsId="3572" UID="14013062003171" xid="1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062003171"><B>Ms

May:</Member></B> We have given a great deal of thought to the way in
which our measures will operate. The changes that we propose will
strengthen our ability to deal with those who are here illegally. We
are, for example, strengthening our ability to enforce penalties for
those who employ illegal workers. The system enabling employers to
determine whether the workers whom they employ are here legally or not
is in place, is well known and is running properly, and the same will
apply in the other areas that we are
discussing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001467">The
Bill will also help to discharge the Government’s commitment to
introduce exit checks on people leaving the UK in order to tackle
overstaying and prevent people from fleeing British justice.</hs_Para>

into a little more detail, although not too much, because I know that
others wish to speak. The Bill substantially reforms the removals
system, and ensures that illegal migrants who have no right to be in
the UK can be returned to their own countries more quickly. We
inherited a complex system involving multiple stages before an
individual can be removed, allowing numerous challenges to be issued
during the process. The Bill will ensure that we adopt a system whereby
only one decision is made. Individuals will be informed of that
decision, and if the decision is that they can no 
<?notus-xml column=1125?>longer stay in the UK, immigration enforcement officials will be allowed
to remove them if they do not leave of their own accord. The Bill also
reforms the system whereby illegal migrants held in detention centres
are allowed to apply for bail, and it gives immigration officers
stronger powers so that they can establish the identity of illegal
immigrants by checking fingerprints and searching for
passports.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001469" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001469">The
current appeals system is also very complex. There are 17 different
immigration decisions that attract rights of appeal, but the Bill will
cut that number to four, which I think will prevent abuse of the appeal
process. It will also ensure that appeals address only fundamental
rights. It will make it easier to deport foreign criminals by requiring
individuals to appeal from abroad after deportation, unless they face
the prospect of serious harm.</hs_Para>

Teather:</Member></B> I do not intend to make a speech, because I know
that others wish to speak, but an issue that has not been mentioned at
all today is health. The organisation Doctors of the World, whose
clinic I visited last week, is very worried about the Bill’s
impact on those who do not have residence status. Such people are often
extremely vulnerable, and many have been
trafficked.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001471" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001471"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs May" PimsId="1758" UID="14013062003174" xid="420" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062003174">Mrs
May:</Member></B> The hon. Lady has raised a number of concerns about
aspects of the Bill, and has indicated her objection to it overall. A
number of the changes that we are making relate to migrants’
access to services, but I think that the issues to which she has just
referred are within the purview of the Department of Health, and are
therefore not relevant to the Bill.</hs_Para>

strengthening our ability to deal with cases in which it has not been

deprivation of citizenship is an important new power. As I indicated to
the shadow Minister for Immigration, we are happy to discuss with him

Government are getting to grips with immigration. Net migration is down
by nearly a third since its peak in 2010. Net migration from outside
the EU is down to 140,000 and is at its lowest level since 1998. The
reduction is being driven by cuts in the number of people coming to
this country. In 2013, there were nearly 100,000 fewer people
immigrating to the UK than in
2010.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001476" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001476">We
are making good progress with our reforms. We are transforming the
immigration and border system. We have abolished the UK Border Agency,
established two new operational commands, tightened immigration 
<?notus-xml column=1126?>routes where abuse was rife, strengthened the system of granting
students permission to enter or stay in the UK,
reformed the family visa system, and set an annual limit on the number
of non-EU economic migrants who are admitted to the UK. All those
reforms are working well and are doing much to tackle the chaotic and
dysfunctional system that we inherited from the previous Government,

further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001477">The

to start by putting the Bill in its proper context. Under the last
Government, the level of migration was unprecedented and hugely
unpopular with the public, 
<?notus-xml column=1128?>and it has led to an unacceptably rapidly growing population. This
Government have carried out sensible reforms for work, study and family
migration in the face of fierce lobbying from vested interests, and
they have done that with the wholehearted support of the Conservative
party and the coalition. On that they should be congratulated. The
Immigration Bill builds on that good work. Whatever the right hon.
Member for Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper) says,
there is no doubt that it represents a big step forward and deals with
major issues.</hs_Para>

well-functioning immigration system needs to tackle illegal
immigration. Given the nature of the system, however, we simply do not
know how many illegal immigrants are here. Let me give the House an
example. We issue more than 1.5 million visit visas each year, but we
do not know how many of those people leave at the end of their visit.
If just 1% overstay, that will mean that an additional 15,000 people
remain here illegally every
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001497" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001497">With
respect to accessing public services, the outstanding business of the
first importance relates to controlling access to the national health
service. Although the Bill is important and achieves a great deal,
there remains the first-order business of dealing with that access. I
would be pleased if the Government were to have another look at the
question of whether people should gain access to the NHS only on
production of an identity card to show that they were entitled to use
the services. Having said that, the Bill represents a welcome step and
it will go a long way towards building a robust immigration system. I
commend it to the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14013062001899" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001899">4.54

Mary Glindon</B> (North Tyneside) (Lab):</Member> I want to address an
issue that has not been covered today—I had hoped to address it
when we discussed the new clauses tabled by my party. It is the issue
of migrant workers who are legitimately in this country. A number of
them were discovered at the former Swan Hunter site at Wallsend. They
were living there in unsafe conditions. I pursued the issue and
discovered that a local engineering company had hired them through an
employment agency in Romania. It was a legitimate situation, because,
under the law, temporary workers are allowed to work for a number of
months in this country. However, what I did unearth, via the UK Border
Agency, was that some of those workers were on permanent
contract.</hs_Para>

the jobcentre whether the jobs, which the company maintained they could
not fill with local workers, could have been taken by welders. Everyone
knows that the north-east, especially an area such as mine, is awash
with people who have welding skills and who were employed in the former
heavy industries. The jobcentre confirmed that there were in fact more
than enough unemployed workers who could take the jobs. Not only were
these east European workers living in unsafe conditions, but they were
probably being paid less than the minimum wage and the going rate for
that job.</hs_Para>

the building in which the workers were living was brought up to
scratch. After speaking to the employment agency in Romania about the
workers on permanent contracts who should not have been here, the UK
Border Agency allowed it to change the contracts 
<?notus-xml column=1129?>to temporary contracts. Although people in Wallsend felt sorry for those
workers who were living in such bad conditions, they were upset that
they were coming over and being paid less for the work than skilled
people in the area. I am sorry that we were not able to discuss those
issues further or the new clauses proposed by those on the Labour Front
Bench.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14013062001900" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001900">4.57

the rhetoric. The way that both the Conservatives and Labour seem to be

should be proud of the benefits of immigration. The important point is
the Home Office and the Border Agency, as was, and their competence in
making decisions promptly and correctly. The Minister has done some
very good work on that but until it is sorted the public will not have
the assurance they need. We need our exit checks and we need decisions
to be made promptly and fairly so that everybody knows where they

Greatrex</B> (Rutherglen and Hamilton West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I do
not intend to detain the House for long, but I am pleased to have the
opportunity to raise an important and sensitive issue of which I have
become aware due to a case in my constituency. In dealing with that
case, it appears that I have stumbled on a gap, at the very least, in
how prisoners who are transferred from England to Scotland are treated
with regard to funeral expenses. The process of trying to secure
answers from the Scottish and English authorities has been less than
satisfactory. I understand that the Minister’s responsibilities
cover the English authorities, not the Scottish authorities, so I do
not expect him to respond on behalf of the Scottish authorities, but I
hope that he can clarify some issues that are relevant to the English
authorities, which was why I ensured that his private office was given
a précis of the case before the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001836" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001836">Before
I outline the case, it is important that I point out that my concern is
for my constituent, who is a cousin of the deceased prisoner. I make no

constituent, Mrs Margaret Coyle, had a cousin, James Campbell, who was
convicted and given a custodial sentence for an offence committed in
England. He began his sentence in an English prison. Part of the way
through his sentence, his elderly mother was close to death, and
following contact by my constituent, a restricted transfer was arranged
whereby the remainder of his sentence could be served in a Scottish
prison—first in Kilmarnock prison and later in Greenock prison.
The process was instigated by my constituent out of compassion for her
cousin’s elderly mother and a desire that they should be in
contact before the end of her life. Because my constituent was dealing
with the process, she became her cousin’s next of
kin.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001838" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001838">Later,
towards the end of his sentence, my constituent’s cousin
developed cancer and became seriously ill. At the point my constituent
contacted the Scottish Prison Service to seek guidance on whether her
cousin could secure compassionate release. She was informed that
although he was serving his sentence in Scotland, because he was on a
restricted transfer he was effectively an English prisoner and the
matter should therefore be taken up with the English authorities. She
understood that and accepted
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001839" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001839">My
constituent’s cousin died while still serving his sentence. He
had been provided with a handbook by the English Prison Service. Its

constituent had discussed the matter with her cousin prior to his
death. It meant, they thought, she would be entitled to call upon that
support because he was an English prisoner. She was well aware that she
would be unable to afford the funeral expense and knew that her cousin
was sadly likely to die before the end of his 
<?notus-xml column=1134?>sentence. She was also advised by a social worker she had been engaging
with that she would not have to bear the funeral costs. That is the
basis on which she
proceeded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001841" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001841">After
my constituent’s cousin died and she had arranged the funeral,
she contacted the Scottish Prison Service and was told that it was a
matter for the English Prison Service. She contacted the English Prison
Service but was told that it was a matter for the Scottish Prison
Service. At that point, just before the end of last year, I became
involved. As I am sure the Minister can appreciate, those are sad
circumstances, but there is also a degree of confusion in the case. I
sought, on behalf of my constituent, to get some clarity on the matter.
It was for that reason that I eventually sought this debate.</hs_Para>

contacted the Scottish Ministers responsible for the Scottish Prison
Service in early December, I was told that they would pass the matter
on to the Scottish Prison Service and provide me with a response, for
which I was still waiting. However, they told my office by phone that
is was indeed a matter for the English Prison Service because of the
prisoner transfer. At that point I raised the matter in the House
during business questions. I also corresponded with the Ministry of
Justice, but my correspondence was automatically passed on to the
Scottish authorities without my having received a response. My sense is
that this is being passed backwards and forwards between authorities,
which means I am unable to get a clear answer on where responsibility
for the situation properly lies. It is for that reason that I sought
this debate. I hope that the Minister will be able to provide some
clarity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001843" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001843">I
would like to make two further points. First, the way in which my
constituent and I have been advised and passed between authorities in
these circumstances is unacceptable. I realise that the matter is not
completely the responsibility of the Minister and his
Department—it also involves the Scottish authorities—but
something should be done to ensure that in future similar cases are
dealt with more appropriately and sensitively.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14013062001844" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001844">Secondly,
because my constituent was provided with advice and worked on that
basis, she has now been left responsible for a bill for funeral
expenses of about £2,000, which she cannot afford. The
Government should therefore show sensitivity and deal with this matter
by using their discretion to ensure that she is not left in her current
situation. She is unable to pay a bill because of the conflicting
advice that she was given in good faith, after she sought to support a
dying relative and showed her personal compassion by getting involved
after the prisoner’s mother became seriously
ill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001845" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001845">My
first concern is that the appropriate authorities have not dealt with
the case well, and my second is for my constituent who, in relation to
her income and resources, faces a severe financial problem in dealing
with the costs. Different conditions appear to apply in English as
opposed to Scottish prisons, but with the transfer of my
constituent’s relative between them, it almost feels as though
he was an English prisoner while he lived but became a Scottish one
when he died. Passing such cases backwards and forwards between
authorities is not acceptable or appropriate. I hope that the Minister
will clarify the situation and provide some comfort to my constituent,
who faces not only the trauma that comes with the loss of a relative,
whatever the circumstances and background, but a severe financial
penalty as a
result.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_30_PT_1/3F932857A95F8E4770AEB2CA7786E63CF33EDC5D" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2014">Thursday

occurs can offer a financial contribution to cover reasonable funeral
expenses. It is reasonable and decent to do so in those circumstances,
but the offer is not unlimited. A financial contribution will be
offered only if the deceased prisoner did not have a pre-paid funeral
plan. Families may also be entitled to claim a grant from another
Department, such as the Department for Work and Pensions, or from a
local authority. An offer of a contribution of up to £3,000 may
be made to the family, and if they accept it, the money is paid
directly to the funeral director they appoint and may be used to pay
for any funeral director’s fees, a hearse, a simple coffin, and
cremation or burial fees. It cannot to be used to pay for items such as

I have said, Mr Campbell died in a Scottish prison, as the
hon. Gentleman knows. Although Mr Campbell was convicted and sentenced
in England and Wales, he had elected to transfer to Scotland to be
close to his family and friends there, and he had been in a Scottish
prison since 2002. I understand that the nature of his transfer may
have caused confusion about who was responsible for assisting the
family with the funeral
expenses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001852" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001852">There
should not have been any confusion in this case; that there was is a
matter of regret. As the deceased died in the custody of the Scottish
Prison Service, the Scottish arrangements apply. I understand that the
Scottish 
<?notus-xml column=1136?>Prison Service does not make discretionary payments towards funeral
expenses. That, of course, is a matter for the service, and the hon.
Gentleman might wish to take it up with the Scottish Justice Minister.
However, I understand that the deceased’s family may be able to
make an application in Scotland to the social fund for help with
funeral expenses. As the Minister responsible for prisons in England
and Wales, I cannot comment further on those arrangements or on whether
a payment would or could be made to his
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001853" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001853">The
hon. Gentleman rightly indicated that Mr Campbell was convicted and
sentenced in England and Wales and then transferred to Scotland on a
restricted basis. It may help if I explain what that means in practice.
The transfer of prisoners between United Kingdom jurisdictions is
governed by schedule 1 to the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997, which was
intended to enable prisoners sentenced in one UK jurisdiction to
transfer to another to serve their sentence close to their family and
in the community into which they will be released.</hs_Para>

provides for transfer on either an unrestricted or a restricted basis.
When a prisoner is transferred on a restricted basis, as in Mr
Campbell’s case, responsibility for their release, supervision
and recall remains the responsibility of the sentencing jurisdiction.
However, for all other purposes the prisoner is subject to the rules
and regulations governing prisons and prisoners in the receiving
jurisdiction. That position was confirmed on 28 October 1997 when the
then Home Secretary, the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw),
set out in a written answer to a question from the right hon. Member
for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears) how the new transfer arrangements
would work. He

the duration of his or her transfer, subject to the law governing
release on licence, automatic release, post-release supervision and
recall applicable in the sending jurisdiction…A prisoner

purposes, other than those specified in any conditions attached to the

Mr Campbell’s release arrangements remained subject to English
law, he was for all other purposes a Scottish prisoner. As such, any
support to the deceased’s family, financial or otherwise, is a
matter for the Scottish authorities. I hope that the hon. Gentleman
will accept that and recognise that I am not trying to pass the buck. I
understand that he has received differing advice on the issue from
officials in England and Wales and in Scotland, but I can confirm that
the position that I have described is accepted by both Prison
Services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013062001856" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/debtext/140130-0004.htm#14013062001856">I

might be wondering what on earth is left to debate if the topic is such
a love-in, but the truth is that there is an enormous amount to be done
if we are to seize the opportunity to change our society radically for
the better. An NSPCC study shows that only 64% of NHS trusts have a
perinatal mental health strategy. Other recent research shows that 42%
of GPs feel that they have very little knowledge about the specialist
services available for severe mental illness. Nearly a
quarter—23%—of all maternity professionals say that they
have received no education on maternal mental health, and the Royal
College of Paediatrics and Child 
<?notus-xml column=332?>Health estimates that the annual short-term costs alone of emotional,
conduct and hyperkinetic disorders among children aged five to 15 in
the UK are £1.58 billion, and the annual long-term costs are
£2.53 billion.</hs_Para>

of Health Visiting is delighted by the Government’s commitment
to significantly increasing the number of health visitors, and progress
in training new health visitors is on target. However, in a recent
survey by the institute, 87% of midwives said that their work loads had
increased and that they were seeing the following worrying trends: 65%
were seeing increased child behaviour problems, 61% reported seeing an
increase in the prevalence of speech delay, 73% were seeing an increase
in poverty that was having a bad influence on families, 82.5% were
seeing an increase in domestic violence and abuse and 70% reported an
increase in the incidence of perinatal depression. Perinatal depression
includes antenatal depression—that is, before a woman has her
baby—as well as the depression that can arise during birth as a
result of a traumatic birth experience and, of course, post-natal
depression, which is the  main subject that people talk about
when they talk about depression in the perinatal period, if they ever
talk about it.</hs_Para>

would agree that prevention is better than cure. Everyone, or pretty
much everyone, would agree that many of our society’s greatest
problems stem from alcohol and substance abuse and mental illness. But
too few people realise that in a vast number of cases, those in our
society who cause the most damage and cost the most money have been
permanently set up for disaster from their own infancy. The absence of
a secure bond between baby and carer in the 1,001 critical days has
profound lifelong consequences for the baby. I am convinced that once
the strong link between experiences in the earliest years and
whole-life outcomes becomes more widely accepted, we will start to make
huge progress in tackling society’s most intractable
problems.</hs_Para>

we were to shut down prisons, not because of overcrowding or poor
conditions but because we did not have enough criminals to fill them.

are unique in the animal kingdom  in the extent of their
underdevelopment at birth.  What other animal cannot walk until
it is nearly a year old and cannot fend for itself in any way at all
until  it is at least two years old? However, the physical
underdevelopment is only a tiny part of it. The human brain is only
partially formed when a baby is born. The billions of neurones in the
brain are largely undifferentiated at birth, and parts of the brain are
simply not there. Humans are born with only the fight-or-flight
instinct and the earliest experiences of the human baby literally
hardwire his or her brain and have a lifelong impact on the
baby’s mental and emotional health.</hs_Para>

baby’s earliest experiences? It is quite simple. When a baby
cries, he does not know that he is wet, tired, hungry, bored or too
hot; he just knows that something is wrong, so he relies on a loving,
adult carer to soothe his feelings. Most parents will remember, as I 
<?notus-xml column=334?>certainly do, long nights spent walking up and down, hugging a baby,
saying, “Go to sleep, go to sleep,” desperate for sleep
ourselves and determined to try one thing after another to sort the
situation out. The baby whose basic needs are met learns that the world
is a good place, and he or she will retain that sense as an instinct
for life. That baby will be more emotionally more robust than the baby
who does not have his needs met.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14013068000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000024">For the baby
who is neglected or abused, there are two critical impacts on
development. First, a baby cannot regulate his or her own feelings at
all. If the basic needs are not met, he or she will simply scream
louder and louder, and eventually take refuge in sleep. The first
impact is that a baby who is left to continually scream night after
night will experience raised levels of the stress hormone, cortisol.
Excessive amounts of that damage the baby’s immune system
permanently, and evidence suggests that a baby left to scream for hours
at a time, day in and day out, will develop a higher tolerance to their
own stress level, meaning that in later life, they will have more of a
predisposition to high risk-taking behaviour than a baby who has only a
normal level of cortisol. A lot of evidence shows that violent
criminals have a high tolerance to their own stress levels. However, it
is not only that—for a mother who is very stressed during the
time that her baby is in the womb, the outcome is that the baby can
physically be very desperately damaged. For example, maternal stress
during pregnancy can lead to a thinning of the baby’s arteries,
which has profound consequences later in terms of congenital heart
disease, diabetes and obesity.</hs_Para>

a very real physical impact on the brain. The pre-frontal
cortex—the social part of the brain—only starts to
develop at about six months, and the peak period for that part of the
brain to develop is between six and 18 months old. Growth is stimulated
by the relationship between the baby and carer, and peek-a-boo games,
gazing into each other’s eyes, singing songs, saying, “I
love you, you gorgeous little thing!” and lots of cuddling all
play a really strong role. Love literally shapes the baby’s
brain. The brain develops millions of neural connections during that
period and the pre-frontal cortex physically grows in
size.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=335?>my right hon. Friend the Member for Surrey Heath (Michael Gove), is not
responding to the debate, so we are all right, but the point is about
being a good enough parent, and if a baby knows

o’clock in the morning when they are at their wits’ end.

development of babies has deep implications for society. A human being

New Zealand study showed that a child with substantial antisocial

Analysis of spending in local authorities shows that that cannot go on
for much longer. The wonderfully named “Barnet graph of
doom” shows that on current trends, spending on
children’s services and adult statutory services alone will
outstrip the income of the local authority of Barnet by 2025. That

we need specialist mental health midwives and health visitors in every
local authority area. We must enable women with a history of mental
illness to receive tailored antenatal and post-natal care, and thereby
reduce the risk of later post-natal depression. Secondly, those
families experiencing difficulties should be able to access
evidence-based services that promote parent-infant bonding, such as
video interaction guidance and parent-infant psychotherapy. Thirdly,
all parents should have access to antenatal classes that deal with both
the physical and emotional implications of childbirth, as well as the
baby’s own mental health
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000038">Fourthly,

centre in Manchester Central, where the hon. Member for Manchester

intervention, is a fantastic example of how registration in
children’s centres can help new families. It has been offering
birth registration for more than a decade, and its reach to new
families has grown from less than 50% in a very deprived ward to 87.5%.
In addition, its re-engagement rate with families is astonishing: for
young parents, it is 100%. All parents have access to the services that
they may desperately need, to help them to get the best start in life

that point. Benchill has that amazing ability to reach new families by
offering birth registration. As hon. Members will know, if a man is not
married to the mother of the child, the only way to have his name on
the certificate is to be present physically at the registration as the
father. Therefore, the advantage of offering registration in
children’s centres to families is that it offers the opportunity
for the children’s centre to look at the parents together.
Benchill certainly encourages its staff to chat to dad. It encourages
them not to focus just on mum or baby, but to talk to dad and the other
children if they are there—to engage with them, try to give them
support and let them see what services are offered to dads and babies
and not just mums and babies. That is a perfect example of how to
support the entire family. In one fell swoop, Benchill deals with the
problem of stigma—everyone goes to the children’s centre,
so clearly there is no stigma—and those families who are deemed
hard to reach and who so often need services but do not get them are
automatically
engaged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000041">The

professionals. Through the proliferation of MASHs—multi-agency
safeguarding hubs—and through local safeguarding children boards
and other bodies, professionals now come together regularly to share
strategy, and they 
<?notus-xml column=338?>should be able to change that information as well. The regulations do
not deter them from doing that, so it is an excuse and in practice that
excuse should not be
tolerated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrea Leadsom" PimsId="5676" UID="14013068000237" xid="1204" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000237">Andrea
Leadsom:</Member></B> Yes. Even my hon. Friend’s harder line is
absolutely right: there should be a presumption in favour of data
sharing. It should not be a case of people saying, “Oh, I
didn’t know” or, “I didn’t think it was
allowed.” It should be a case of people being told, “If
you didn’t share information, you should have done.” At
the moment, that is not understood strongly
enough.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000046">Of
course, data sharing is relevant not only in child neglect or child
abuse cases. Let us say that a midwife meets a mother antenatally and
is aware that that mother is terrified at the prospect of giving birth
because of the physical implications, because she is afraid that her
partner might leave her or because she is afraid that she will lose her
job as a new mum. Often, when such issues are picked up antenatally,
there is, first, a lack of places to refer that mum on to and,
secondly, a lack of a communication path to enable the midwife to think
about whom they should be talking to.</hs_Para>

therefore, a very strong argument for creating formal links between
midwives, health visitors and children’s centres to ensure not
only that they can talk to someone else, but that they must talk to
someone else. The relevance of that to the mum’s experience is
that if a midwife is concerned about a mum, they can perhaps refer her
on to a mental health specialist midwife and a mental health-focused
health visitor. That could all take place under the auspices of a
sensitively attuned children’s centre, so that the mum’s
needs can be met throughout the perinatal period, giving her the best
chance of forming the vital secure bond with her baby. Data sharing is
relevant not only to cases involving severe child protection issues; it
is also about supporting mums who are just struggling. As we know, the
statistics suggest that as many as 100,000 mums a year may be just
generally struggling. It is not that there are severe physical or
neglect threats to their babies; it is just that those mums need a bit
of support, and at the moment we are not giving them
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000048">That
takes me on to our sixth proposal. There is a huge need to provide
proper training for front-line health and social care professionals in
the importance of attachment and early brain development. I have been
involved for about 15 years with parent-infant partnership charities
that provide psychotherapeutic support to families. We also provide
training to front-line professionals. It is astonishing how many
post-training evaluation forms we get from midwives, health visitors,
GPs and social workers that say, “Wow! I wish I had known before
how important the earliest relationship is.” That is not as much
about the physical health as about the emotional health and the
attachment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000049">Our

eighth proposal is that childminders and nurseries should consider how
they can better meet the attachment needs of babies in their care, and
that Ofsted inspections should specifically provide guidance and assess
their performance. As a member of the Committee considering the
Children and Families Bill, which passed through 
<?notus-xml column=339?>the House of Commons recently, I was pretty shocked, when we had Ofsted
in to give pre-Committee evidence, to be told that Ofsted inspectors do
not routinely assess those looking after the very
youngest—potentially babies from the age of three months to two
years old—on how well the care setting is meeting their
attachment needs. There is this sense of schoolifying in the inspection
regime. It forgets about how well the key worker is playing with the
baby, responding to the baby, smiling at and cuddling the baby and
being the key person who changes the nappy, does the feeds and so on.
All those things are absolutely crucial for secondary attachment if mum
or dad is out at work.</hs_Para>

hat off in the Chamber to the Labour party for creating Sure
Start—I was subsequently told 
<?notus-xml column=340?>that props were not allowed in the Chamber—but the problem is
that they are not universally understood. If we ask the proverbial man
on the Clapham omnibus what a school is for, we will get the same
answer from every man on that omnibus. If we ask what a
children’s centre is for, however, we will get all sorts of
different answers. The fundamental problem with the Sure Start
children’s centre system is that there is no common
understanding of what they are for and the extent to which they should
be provided.</hs_Para>

opinion—this is not part of our manifesto—is that
children’s centres should have a statutory footing like schools
do. If a school year 4 is failing, we do not say, “Well, shut it
then, and those children can just go without learning to read and
write.” The profound implications of children’s centre
services on a child’s development may be far greater than
whether they learn to read and write at the age of four, and far more
fundamental for their life chances, but we are willing to shut
children’s centres. I appreciate what the hon. Lady has said
about cuts, but we need to improve understanding of children’s
centres and spread the good practice that undeniably exists in some. We
must persuade local authorities that children’s centres are not
for cutting; they are profoundly important—at least as important
as schools and hospitals. That is my opinion, but I hope that answers
the hon. Lady’s good point.</hs_Para>

interventions from parent-infant partnerships have changed lives for
the better for thousands of families. For those families whose babies
now have the best start in life, rather than a disastrous one,
politicians can count the savings to the public purse. Early years
intervention has the potential to save billions of pounds from the cost
of dealing with poor mental health, antisocial behaviour, crime and
violence. My hope is that all political parties will adopt the
achievable and sensible recommendations of our manifesto “The

real prize, which is, surely, to change our society for the

might be surprised to see a Scottish MP contributing to the debate,
because Scotland and England have such separate and distinct approaches
to child care, maternal care and paternal care, but there are lessons
that we can learn from each other, and that is why I was keen to make a
contribution today. In addition, I have been working closely with two
third-sector organisations, the National Childbirth Trust and Bliss, on
problems that arise when babies are born prematurely, and I want to

babies are born prematurely.</hs_Para>

personal experience of the strain that that causes, having given birth
to twin boys eight weeks prematurely when I also had a two-year-old and
a four-year-old. When anyone asks me how I do the difficult job of
Member of Parliament, I assure them 
<?notus-xml column=341?>that it is a piece of cake compared with being a mother of four children
under four. My first-born—my daughter—has cerebral palsy,
and when my twins were born I was living in rural Oxfordshire and not
driving, so I faced multiple barriers to making that important bond
with my premature babies. It is an awful experience for a mother to
arrive home when it is more or less obvious that she has given
birth—it is especially evident when twins have left the
uterus—but because the babies are not with her, no one comes up
to ask what happened. The mother is deprived of the opportunity to
celebrate the birth of her
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000062">There

their lives, and parents have to take each day at a time. I pay tribute
to the staff in the special care baby unit in Banbury who brought my
babies—who are now 6 feet 2 inches and feet 3 inches
and making a useful contribution to society—through that time.
The right hon. Member for Banbury (Sir Tony Baldry) had newly been

particular strains for working parents. I was not a working parent at
the time, so I did not have to make choices about maternity pay. People
frequently do not understand that a baby who is born significantly
prematurely often does not catch up, in terms of age and stage
development, until they are at least two years old—I believe
that it can take longer than that, and it certainly did in the case of
my boys—and maternity pay does not allow for that. A mother is
faced with the difficult choice of whether to take paid maternity leave
while her baby is in hospital and possibly critically ill, or wait
until the baby returns home. I would like the Government to look at
that, because it puts such a strain on parents.</hs_Para>

deprivation are certainly not the only factors that contribute to a
lack of secure attachment or the health and well-being of parents and
children, they can make a huge difference. In my case, we suffered from
the combination of four children under five and huge financial pressure
on our family, and we were at risk of losing our home. I started
childminding the children of wealthy parents, so that they could have
piano lessons and beauty spa treatments, to try to make ends meet. That

empowered the mother was. She was talking about the need to create a
calm atmosphere and be consistent. It was the most 
<?notus-xml column=342?>inspiring and optimistic thing to see a parent given such skills. The
way to do that is not by punishing them or withdrawing benefits, but by
getting alongside people, showing them that we are on their side and
understand, and giving them the necessary skills. I very much hope that
the children from that family will grow up happier, healthier and able
to contribute to society, and that they will not need that kind of
support when they are parents. Investment in the early days is so

is so distressing—no child chooses where it is born. No child is
born bad; bad things happen to children. It is really depressing to
face the idea that a child’s outcomes should be determined by
the streets they were born between. At NCH, which is now called Action
for Children, I worked with children who were at risk of being removed
from their family. I always felt that that was an ironic term, because
the best thing for some children was to be removed from their family,
as it was for the parents, too. For those children, there was really no
opportunity. Many had suffered emotional and, at times, physical and
sexual
abuse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000068">I
urge the Minister to look at the excellent children’s panel
hearing system that we have in Scotland, because it works well. It is
great, because the child is absolutely at the centre of the process.
This is not about what happens in the first 1,001 days, but seeing a
child finally disclosing the abuse they have suffered, with us all
having to leave the room until they felt able to tell their story, was
the most remarkable thing, as was knowing that, hopefully, it was the
beginning of a process of survival and recovery from that abuse. It was
desperately sad to hear a 10-year-old boy say to me, “I know I
can never be a parent, Fiona, because I couldn’t be
trusted.” It is unthinkable that children should have to face
such choices. As the hon. Member for South Northamptonshire said, we

mother has a psychotic incident, which happens in up to 1% of births

return to my point about the importance of breastfeeding and supporting
mothers in providing nourishment for their child. That is especially
true in the case of premature babies, because the recommended start
date for a mother to breastfeed is three weeks post-term. Maternity
leave rights and—particularly when parents cannot afford to take
unpaid leave—maternity pay are therefore vital. This was 27
years ago, so some time ago, but when I had premature twins, the
support and encouragement for mothers of premature babies to breastfeed
was not what it should have been. I hope that that has improved,
because it is a vital part of the bonding process. Although the mother
cannot put the baby to her breast, at least being involved in putting

want to take a slightly different angle and talk a little about social
mobility and the effect of the first days and years of life on
children’s eventual chances. When considering child development,
it is always helpful to have in mind a sort of pyramid—in fact,
there is such a pyramid in the manifesto. It creates a hierarchy of
need. The sharp end of the pyramid is the very sharp end of the
scale—the acute cases where, frankly, social mobility is not the
top priority. The top priority is child protection, basic safety and
health; social mobility is a worry for another day. At the base of the
pyramid is the massive part—the world at large; most people. In
the middle is the section of children I want to talk about today: those
born into poverty and disadvantage who are not quite in the acute
bracket.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000076">We
know that social mobility in this country is low by international
standards—we are usually bracketed with Italy and the United
States—and it has not been improving. On average, those of us
here in our forties—including, as of a couple of days ago, my
hon. Friend the Member for Winchester (Steve Brine)—have been
less mobile in our lives than those of us here in their fifties. That
is a poor state for any advanced democracy to find itself in. Why is
that the case? When I was on the Education Committee, we used to find
that everyone blamed the 
<?notus-xml column=344?>stage before. If we spoke to universities, they said that they were not
getting the kids coming through from sixth forms; the sixth forms
blamed the teachers doing the GCSEs; the secondary schools blamed the
primary schools; the primary schools blamed the nurseries; and the
nurseries said, “We are just not getting the kids through the
door
anymore.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000077">There
is an element of truth in what they all said. The more one studies
social mobility and children’s life chances, the more one
realises that it increasingly does come down to the very earliest age.
The all-party group on social mobility published a report called
“Seven key truths about social mobility”. Truth No. 1 was
that the point of greatest leverage for children’s life chances
is what happens between the ages of zero and three—that is what
we said, although it could equally be what happens between the ages of
zero and two. The problem is that, of course, this is the public
sector—we are trying to influence the Government and so
on—and most of what happens between the ages of zero and two or
three does not happen in a state-controlled or influenced setting; it
happens at home. That makes things much more
difficult.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000078">Why
is this a social mobility issue? How children are brought up is not
particularly, or does not have to be, dependent on parents’
income, but there is quite a strong correlation. Figures from
“An Anatomy of Economic Inequality in the UK”, a report
made by the previous Government at the end of their term, show that on
school readiness, for example, children from the poorest fifth of
households reach about a third of the way up the percentile scale at
age 3, versus more than 60% of children born into the wealthiest third.
There is a bunch of statistics like
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000079">It
is frightening that even toddlers’ cognitive ability test scores
vary more dramatically according to their parents’ income than
according to innate differences in ability. In the millennium cohort
study, which tracks children through time, that gap does not narrow
between the ages of three and five; in fact, it seems to widen as
children go through school. Why? I am careful not to infer any direct
causality. All sorts of factors may be involved, but there are
significant differences in some things that people associate with home
learning environments, and so on, according to socio-economic groups.
In the lowest socio-economic group—the poorest fifth of
households—only about 40% of children are read to every day at
age 3, as opposed to more than 80% in the top 20%. Again, those figures
are from “An Anatomy of Economic Inequality in the UK”.
Those things can be tracked with a series of measures, including bed
time, and so
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000080"><B><Member ContinuationText="Fiona O'Donnell" PimsId="5516" UID="14013068000248" xid="1054" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000248">Fiona

child development. There is a particular difference in London. When
people are told this, they assume that child development is worse in
London than elsewhere, because of all the issues in a big city like
this. However, that is not so. There was another report last week about
the different school results of children growing up in London, versus
those growing up elsewhere. That is often attributed to the London
Challenge, which started in 2003. There are a number of reasons to
believe that the London Challenge was not the sole or primary cause of
those improvements. One reason to disbelieve that is that the
difference in attainment scores for disadvantaged children is apparent
way before they get to secondary school; in fact, it is apparent even
in pre-school assessments: on average, disadvantaged children in London
seem to do about 20% better on the “good level of
development” scale than disadvantaged children in the rest of
the country. A bunch of things are different about London children and

want to test your patience, Mr Weir, by debating the London Challenge,
rather than early child development. I will talk in a minute about
societal differences that may or may not be driving factors. The honest
answer is that we do not know, but there are reasons to
disbelieve that the simple explanation for London’s improvement
is the London Challenge. First, the differences are apparent long
before children reach secondary school, and the hon. Gentleman will
recall that it only started in 2003. Secondly, when translated from
London to the black country and Manchester, there were not the same
results. Thirdly, so many other things that are different about London
are worth looking

Leadsom:</Member></B> My hon. Friend speaks so authoritatively on
social mobility. It is always interesting to listen to him. However, I
put it to him that one reason 
<?notus-xml column=346?>for London’s exceptionalism could, of course, be that its large
immigrant population comes from a different cultural place. My opinion,
as opposed to a research view, is that immigrant populations have not
suffered the same degree of family breakdown. We found, through my work
with the parent-infant projects, that often in immigrant populations
there is much more of a family network. Therefore the bond is often
quite secure, even in areas of great deprivation, because of the
support for the earliest period of the baby’s
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000088"><B><Member ContinuationText="Damian Hinds" PimsId="5583" UID="14013068000253" xid="1059" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000253">Damian
Hinds:</Member></B> My hon. Friend anticipates where I am going. We are
into the realm of speculation. We do not know. It is true that many
things are different about family structure, and so on, in London,

outcomes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000089">Let
me start by mentioning some of the things that are the same. There is
no significant difference in gender mix, age and birth weight of babies
born in London; mothers tend to be older—we know that that is a
factor in child development—and better educated; families are
bigger in London, and children are more likely to have brothers and
sisters; and the mix is massively more diverse than in the rest of the
country, both in terms of ethnic diversity, recent immigrants and
families with English as an additional
language.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000090">In
London, there is a slightly lower percentage of children with either a
single mother or both parents working; in other words, there are more
families where at least one parent is at home. This surprises people.
There is also lower participation in pre-school provision and use of
formal child care, which, again, surprises people, because ordinarily
we expect that participation in early years settings and use of formal
child care is associated with positive improvements in child
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000091">Finally,
as my hon. Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire mentioned,
although it is, bizarrely, difficult to get reliable statistics, it
appears that London is above the national average for the proportion of
families with children in which parents are married. That flies in the
face of what most people would assume about this city. However, that
raises an important question. A massive debate has been going on in
America in the past couple of weeks about a Harvard report by Chetty et
al. called “Where is the Land of Opportunity?” which
presented a number of challenging results in the US context, in terms
of social mobility. Its No. 1 conclusion is that family structure is
the single most important determinant of social mobility in America and
that, interestingly, it affects not only the immediate family, but has
a broader effect. In other words, in a neighbourhood where most
children are born to two-parent families—specifically, families
where the two parents are married—even if people are not in one
of those families, by being in such a neighbourhood, they have more
chance of getting
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000092"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tim Loughton" PimsId="1558" UID="14013068000254" xid="368" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000254">Tim
Loughton:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is making a fascinating point. I
entirely agree with the personal views of my hon. Friend the Member for
South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom) on the different complexion of
London, but one only has to look at Mediterranean countries to see the
far lesser influence of family breakdown, which is related to
inter-generational support. We have spoken 
<?notus-xml column=347?>about support for parents, the preference for having two parents and how
marriage makes for greater stability. Places such as Barcelona have
been rebuilt with a view to having different generations living on top
of each other, whereas in this country, grandfather and grandma
increasingly do not live round the corner, or within easy distance, to
help look after the children, which adds extra pressure on the family.
There is a bit of a clue, if we look further south, about the
influences that may result in different outcomes in
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000093"><B><Member ContinuationText="Damian Hinds" PimsId="5583" UID="14013068000255" xid="1059" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000255">Damian

such support can be an
advantage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000094">Where
does all that leave early child development from the perspective of
social mobility? First, the Government have to address, head-on, the
thorny question of how to help parents to parent, while keeping in mind
the pyramid of need, with acute cases at the top, children born into
poverty and disadvantage in the next layer down and everyone else below
that. I suggest that that should start pre-natally, which is a big part
of the manifesto “The 1,001 Critical Days”. Speaking as a
recent dad, it is amazing how little we were told or read about what
was going to happen after birth, because we were so fixated on pain and
the other things that people worry about at the moment of maternity.
Sure Start and Sure Start outreach can play an important part in that.
I echo what my hon. Friend the Member for Winchester said on the
variety of views on what Sure Start is. On the Select Committee, I
always used to ask people to define Sure Start, and even when talking

out of the library, to read to our children, it is not a problem that
will be solved by being given two or three books when the child is

the importance of evaluation also comes out of the manifesto

there are lots of things that we can do in the earliest years of life

later opportunities, but it is difficult to persuade other people of
what those things are. Evaluation therefore trades at a huge premium.

we should not be afraid of talking more about the wider social context
and what some of the impacts might be. While respecting people’s
life choices and celebrating the diversity of society—families
now come in all shapes and sizes—we should not, for the sake of
children, be agnostic about what those choices are. We should also see
what we can learn from the differences between communities in different

Members will be familiar with the work of the Centre for Social
Justice, which was set up by the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions when we were in opposition. The CSJ produced a report last
year called “Fractured Families: Why stability matters,”
which built on the seminal 2006 work “Breakdown Britain”
and the 2007 work “Breakthrough Britain.” Basically,
“Fractured Families” re-examines how family breakdown
continues to plague our society, and it is blunt in saying that,
despite the scale of the problem continuing to increase, Government
action has been extremely weak. The report shows that the outcomes for
children and adults who suffer from family breakdown are often
terrible, and that there are huge costs to society. Someone mentioned a
huge figure earlier, which I will repeat because it is so staggering.
Family breakdown is currently estimated to cost the country some
£46 billion a year, which is set to rise to just under
£50 billion a year by the end of this Parliament. That is more
than the Government spend on the defence budget—talk about ideas

staggering evidence. The good thing that must come out of that is to
find a way to help families form the loving and secure bond that she
talked so much about. That bond should come naturally when there is a
new baby in the house but, as we know, post-natal depression, problems

a light of perspective. When new parents are exhausted, perspective is

Texas, where it is called the nurse family partnership. I was there
with the Justice Committee and saw the partnership at work in Harris

policies and the data we were shown were very impressive. The programme
is expensive but the outcomes are good, with 60% fewer arrests and 72%
fewer convictions among children of mothers participating in the

the June 2013 spending review, the Government gave a commitment to
extend the programme through the next five-year parliamentary period
and confirmed £200 million from several Departments for a wider
focus in 2015-16. That is sensible. I am regularly updated by Hampshire
country council and Hampshire troubled families mapping, which have
confirmed that 70% of client families are located in the top 30% of

hon. Members who spoke referred to the importance of early

the most enduring in public health. As the “The 1001 Critical
Days” manifesto details, more than a quarter of all babies in
the UK are estimated to be living in complex family situations that
present heightened risks to their well-being. The sad reality is that
babies are far more likely to suffer from abuse and neglect, and up to
seven times more likely to die in distressing circumstances, than older
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000118">We
have a duty to reach out to families in difficult circumstances, and to
maximise opportunities for them to access support. Not only is it the
right thing to do, but it is the best thing for the public purse.
According to the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, there
is increasing evidence to show that spending on early-years
intervention can yield a return on investment as high as 6% to 10%. If
it is done in the right way, early intervention can save money, save
lives and improve the well-being of parents and
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000119">An
example is the pioneering work by Manchester city council and its

workers and health visitors work together to identify at the earliest
opportunity the families most in need. It is an inspiring project, with
which my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester Central (Lucy Powell),

the scheme, every new mother is visited eight times from about 12 weeks
before the birth of their child until just before the
child’s fifth birthday. Crucially, all the professionals who are
supporting those mothers hold joint fortnightly meetings and can let
each other know if a parent needs additional help. Their work is
integrated and intelligence is shared between
organisations —a very strong theme in the “The
1001 Critical Days” manifesto. It is a world away from some of
the haphazard experiences of the past. Hon. Members may have heard the
anecdote about how health visitors in the past would wait by the nappy

nutrition, in particular in their early years. In another, more
affluent, part of my constituency, the children’s centre is
tailoring its services to the need in that area, because this ward has
a high incidence of multiple births. That Sure Start centre is

a multiple

<I>The Lancet</I>, Britain is ranked 33rd out of 35 countries with
similar income levels. The charity Sands has linked that to maternity
care, issues to do with inappropriate risk assessments for potential
mothers, and low uptake of perinatal services. Given that neonatal

3,000 new midwives during this Parliament. Again, regretfully, that

many midwives in training, but the high drop-out rate and impending

heard from a number of Members about the importance of maternal mental
health. Mental ill health is one the biggest risks to a pregnancy, with
one in 10 mothers suffering a mental illness before or after birth.
Last November, I asked the Under-Secretary of State for Health, the
hon. Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr Poulter), what
proportion of midwives were trained to provide expectant mothers with
mental health support. Unfortunately, he was not able to provide a
figure, but I am sure that both he and the Minister agree that we need

estimated that as much as 50% of the UK lacks any kind of specialist
perinatal mental health service. There are only 17 mother and baby
mental health units across England, and they are geographically
disparate. There are just two in Scotland and one in Wales, and none in
Northern Ireland. As both the hon. Member for South Northamptonshire

A number of Members thanked Home-Start for the work it has done and the
way in which it so helpfully supports parents. We have also heard about
specific challenges on early intervention, maternal support and
maternity care. However, we know that the challenge of improving early
years development reaches far beyond those specific issues. The hon.
Member for East Hampshire raised the issue of social mobility, for
example; many social determinants extend well beyond the reach of the
Department of Health. The hon. Member for South Northamptonshire
suggested that the issue could be looked into more widely, perhaps at
Cabinet level, and I take that point on
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000147">Both
my hon. Friend the Member for East Lothian and the hon. Member for East

social networks. They are indeed important, and I welcome the work done
by Mumsnet and Netmums, but I would like to put on record the
challenges there are for many mums who do not have access to the
internet, or perhaps do not know how to use computers. Although digital
networks are important and can help to support parents—both mums
and dads—one issue that we need to look at further, which is far
beyond the reach of the Department of Health, is access to the internet
and to broadband, particularly for people living in rural areas. There
is also the issue of being able to afford that internet access: people
might not want to have to go to a public library to connect and reach
out about specific personal issues. We should be thinking about those
matters.</hs_Para>

other issues we should address, which again reach far wider than the
remit of the Department of Health. For example, there is the problem of
parents who are struggling with the cost of living, and those who are
working all hours and do not have the time to be with their children
because they are working all day. We must establish genuine parity of
esteem between mental and physical health, across the board. We have to
protect babies and children from specific dangers—just yesterday
in the House of Lords, for example, there was a debate about protecting
children and babies from smoke in cars. There is no better investment
that we can make as a society than in our
children.</hs_Para>

get that care, love and affection in early life, and those who do not.

children’s exposure to smoking in cars. There was good news this
morning from the Government: there will be a free vote on the issue.
Back in the mists of time, my very first private Member’s Bill
was on banning children from being carried unrestrained in cars. There
was a tremendous backlash against that Bill in certain parts of the
House; people said that it breached human and individual rights. We won
that battle, and I hope that we can win the next one. It is wrong that

the opportunity to expand on this serious political issue, with which
we are engaging in the House at the moment. He rightly points out the
opposition there was to rules on wearing seat belts. The discussions on
that issue are relevant to our discussions about banning smoking in
cars when children are present. When we had no rules on wearing seat
belts, only 25% of the population wore one; since the introduction of
the rules, more than 90% of the population wear a seat belt, and that

happens in the vote. It is also worth putting on record that when there
was a vote on a private Member’s Bill on the issue in 2011, 22
MPs from the coalition supported it, including a current Health

formalise matters through the Early Intervention Foundation—and
the information, knowledge and evidence base that has been established
because of that—will be extremely important. Evidence is
important in this context because, to pick up the point about pressure

in the system when people suffer damage, and how much better, safer and
kinder it is to make interventions early in people’s lives, to
prevent such problems. That message sits well with the
Government’s pledge to improve the health outcomes of children
and young people so that they become some of the best in the world.
That is a challenging goal, but the Government are determined to rise
to
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000162">I
want to touch on the risks associated with pregnancy. A healthy
pregnancy provides the best foundations for a healthy life. Poor diet,
smoking, using illicit drugs and consuming alcohol at that time can all
have an impact on the child’s later cognitive functioning and on
their health and well-being. As my hon. Friend the Member for South
Northamptonshire said, a fetus exposed to extreme stress in the womb
will have higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol, which can
create higher levels of stress later in life. There is a highly
relevant example of that in another part of my portfolio. Domestic
violence can peak during pregnancy and, as a very significant stress
factor, it can cause the very conditions in the womb that have
long-term consequences for children.</hs_Para>

have articulated the early years risks very well during the debate.
There is a growing consensus about the agenda and the fact that early
years intervention offers the greatest opportunity to create secure,
happy and healthy adults. Moving forward in accordance with that shared
agenda is the key. I will mention one or two of the risk factors.
Smoking in pregnancy is highly relevant to much of my work in public
health. It can lead to low birth weight, which is linked with heart
disease later in life. The key messages on smoking in pregnancy are
getting through to many people, although not to everyone. We still have
some way to go, but in 2012-13, 12.7% of mothers were smoking at
delivery. That is lower than the 2009-10 figure of 14%. However, the
regional variation is extraordinary. Figures that recently came across
my desk showed enormous regional variation, and responding to that is a
challenge that I  
<?notus-xml column=359?>have put to public health directors in the regions. It is a good example
of the way that a regionalised public health system can focus intensely
on problem
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000164">Experts
are still unsure exactly how much alcohol it is safe to drink during
pregnancy, so the safest approach is not to drink any that time.
Drinking heavily in pregnancy can lead to low birth weight and damage
brain development in the womb. Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders are a
range of cognitive and functional disabilities that can be caused by
exposure to alcohol in the womb. In short, smoking and drinking alcohol
while pregnant can cause irreparable damage to a child and make them
more susceptible to illness throughout life. The manifesto highlights
the numbers of babies affected by those issues, and I reassure the
House that those are on our
radar.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000165">Perhaps
less obvious is the impact of events in early childhood on later health
and well-being. A drive towards wider understanding of that, among
parliamentarians and in local government and the voluntary sector, is
very important. I think that initially it is difficult to take on board
the detail of the issue, and that is why it is so important that my
hon. Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire has persisted in
making the case to colleagues, and explaining it in detail, with the
evidence to back it up. Many of us now have a wider understanding of
what may not be as intuitively grasped as messages about not smoking or
drinking during pregnancy. Traumatic emotional experience in childhood
can translate into a greater risk of disease and mental health
problems. Many hon. Members focused on that during the debate. We have,
I think, learned that the old adage that time heals all wounds is not
true. Adverse events in early childhood can resonate down the
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000166">According
to the emerging research, growing up with exposure to multiple adverse
childhood events can have a lasting impact. For instance, growing up in
a household where the mother is treated violently, where a parent is
chronically depressed, mentally ill or suicidal, or where someone uses
drugs can increase a child’s risk of a range of conditions.
Those who experience multiple adverse childhood events achieve less
educationally, earn less and are less healthy. All those consequences
were articulated in the debate. The hon. Member for East Lothian (Fiona
O'Donnell) spoke of some sad examples, and about sitting with very
young children and talking about their personal experience.</hs_Para>

saddest papers that I have read as a Minister was one that I submitted
to the Chair of the Select Committee on Home Affairs, about gang
violence. It was about the early lives of children who, at a young
age—under 10—were on the fringes of being drawn into gang
violence. I set myself a challenge, before reading the attached case
history, of guessing what was happening in the child’s life.
Every guess I made about the factors that were present was right, and I
am sure that other hon. Members would have made the same ones. The case
history showed that a child much younger than 10 was already showing
signs of post-traumatic stress disorder. There is a lot of emerging
evidence to show that such children are far more likely to be drawn
into gangs. Good work is being done, particularly in London, on
understanding how to diagnose that. It all goes to support the case
being made through the debate for intervening very early; otherwise,
children grow used to high levels of stress and aggression.</hs_Para>

%—that is 1,380 additional midwives. I of course understand the
challenge, in that there is always a call for more midwives; that is an
important area. There has been £35 million of capital investment
in the environment where maternity care is provided and where women
give birth to their baby. We are working with NHS England to ensure
that women receive better care during pregnancy, with every woman
having a named midwife responsible for providing personalised antenatal
and post-natal care. Women can now make more informed choices about
their care. Again with the support of Health Education England, we have

must ensure that we provide all-round support for women to detect and
treat such conditions. Again, Health Education England is taking
forward work with a range of partners to ensure that training is
available for health care professionals in perinatal mental health. It

Leadsom:</Member></B> I would just like to make the point that although
politicians attempt to say, “Family and the first couple of
years are really private, and you mustn’t interfere,”
often, in my experience of 15 years’ work with charities, people
are actually desperate for help, and they do not know where to go. It
is completely the opposite. It is not as though we were trying to ram
support down people’s throats and tell them how to live; it is
that they are desperate for it. I have lots of meetings with people who
have set up charities to support mums who are desperately depressed or
tearful or who cannot cope. They do that because they themselves went
through it and there was nobody there to help them. I think it is the
exact opposite. We kid ourselves if we think that we are interfering.
We are not; we are simply providing support that people desperately
want.</hs_Para>

Ellison:</Member></B> I think that is right. My experience mirrors my
hon. Friend’s. I suppose the sensitivity is always about people
being tempted to stray into saying how everybody should live their
lives, but I agree with her. My experience is just the same as hers.
Most people are crying out for support. I guess that the key thing is
how that is delivered and how people are asked whether they would like
to receive it. There are ways of doing that, and I think we are close
to breaking that taboo. It is all about how the support is offered.
Rather then telling people, it is about saying, “We are here to
support you and we think that we can nurse you through this difficult
time,” so I think she is right. Common sense dictates that that
is nearly always the case, but it is not an area that Governments have
previously dealt with. It is an area that people have been nervous to
go
into.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000194">I
am glad that my hon. Friend mentioned charities. I want to touch on
some work done in the area, because giving people the best possible
start in life is not only a job for parents, the NHS and Government.
Charities such as the WAVE Trust—Worldwide Alternatives to
ViolencE—and the Early Intervention Foundation, which is funded
by the Government, are contributing to, even 
<?notus-xml column=365?>leading, the debate in crucial areas about early child development. The
Big Lottery Fund is working with both those charities and many others
on the “A Better Start” initiative, where it will invest
£165 million over the next 10 years to stimulate new and
innovative preventive approaches in pregnancy and the first three years
of life, again to improve life chances. I congratulate it on that work,
and Ministers and parliamentarians will want to keep in touch with that
significant programme of work and look at the outcomes it
achieves.</hs_Para>

off charities, I pay my own tribute to Home-Start and many other
charities like it. I am privileged to be the patron of Home-Start
Wandsworth, so I have seen at first hand the great work that it does,
which I know is mirrored up and down the country. I have spoken to many
mums who said that Home-Start were the people who stood by their side
when they felt they had no one else to help them. They talked about the
difference that it made to them at a difficult time in their
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000196">On
the points about integration, we can definitely do more to look at
ensuring that all those initiatives are joined up. My ministerial
colleague the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the
Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, is hosting a round table
on the subject of integration, with a specific focus on the early
years. That will look at what more we can do to ensure that children
and families get that integrated support. A number of Members have
mentioned that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14013068000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000197">That is only
one part of the system, however. The challenge of data sharing was
brought up in earlier contributions. The sharing of information between
NHS services and across the health, education and care system underpins
good integrated working. It is not really possible to do it without
that, and it is important for promoting good outcomes. In recent years,
there have been a number of attempts at a national level to improve
information sharing, including through specific work in foundation
years services.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14013068000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000198">As my hon.
Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire and other Members will
know,  the Government commissioned Jean Gross, a former
communication champion for children, to explore ongoing barriers to
information sharing in early years and to identify examples of good
practice. I reassure my hon. Friend that Ministers from the Department
for Education and the Department of Health welcome that report and its
excellent analysis of the issues on information sharing. Much local
good practice is outlined in it, and we are working with places such as
Wigan, Warwickshire and Hackney to move that agenda forward through the
programme to introduce integrated assessment of children aged two to
two and a half. We know that there is variation across local areas, but
we are working to try and understand how to reduce that.</hs_Para>

Department for Education’s statutory guidance for
children’s centres is clear that health services and local
authorities should share information, such as live birth data, with
children’s centres on a regular basis. The Department of Health
is taking forward work with NHS England and others, including the
Health and Social Care Information Centre, to explore how regular
updates of bulk data on live births can be provided to local
authorities, including the benefits of local sharing 
<?notus-xml column=366?>versus sharing nationally held data. My hon. Friend the Member for East
Worthing and Shoreham said in an intervention that sometimes there is a
culture of using it as an excuse. As highlighted in the Caldicott
reviews and reports, we know that culture and relationships need to
change, and we need to make sure that there is an understanding of the
existing framework in law that supports much greater information
sharing than perhaps is always undertaken.</hs_Para>

Gross’s report also made recommendations about training on
information sharing. We are working with the Royal College of
Paediatrics and Child Health and with the DFE’s strategic
partner, 4Children, to explore how an e-learning package on information
sharing can be developed that is accessible to and appropriate for both
health and early years professionals. We are hoping to see progress
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000201">To
summarise, system-wide change is required to achieve all of this. Each
part of the system, at each level, has a vital contribution to make. As
the response to the debate has illustrated, work is going on across
different Departments, and how we integrate them is critical to it. All
of us see the manifesto “The 1001 Critical
Days” as a rallying point for all those who have an interest in
ensuring that, as the Government state in their pledge, we improve the
health outcomes of children and young people so that they become among
the best in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000202">The
manifesto comes at an exciting time, because the evidence on the
importance of a healthy pregnancy and on the early years is growing. As
I have said, the evidence is becoming clearer, which makes it easier to
make the case. It makes it easier for those who make decisions about
how to structure services to do that with the confidence that they are
doing something that will make a real difference, and that the
consequences of a poor start for long-term physical and mental health
will be addressed. Government, the NHS, charities and others are
working well together to take the agenda forward, and I know that my
hon. Friend the Member for South Northamptonshire will continue to
champion it in Parliament and continue to improve the understanding
that we all have of this important
agenda.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000203">I
pay tribute to everyone who has taken part in such a good debate. I
will follow up a number of points, and I will of course report back to
the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my hon. Friend the Member for
Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, on the debate that we have had. I
look forward, as do officials in the Department of Health, to ongoing,
dynamic and constructive relationship working to take the objectives of
this important manifesto forward into the
future.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_30_PT_1/332D68F2798AD1E8C3D5B2DC4397BFA968BA8426" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2014">Thursday

Leadsom:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to speak under your
chairmanship, Mr Amess. I, too, thank all right hon. and hon. Members
for their contributions here today. This has been a very interesting
debate. Some particularly different aspects of the subject have been
raised. My hon. Friend the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds)
raised the very important question of social mobility. My hon. Friend
the Member for Winchester (Steve Brine) raised the very important
contribution made by Home-Start to the help for families in the vital
early years.</hs_Para>

earlier, I am delighted that the right hon. Member for Dulwich and West
Norwood (Dame Tessa Jowell) has come to the debate to make her own
contribution on the importance of the early years, not just here in the
UK but, potentially, in the post-millennium development goals. That
would mean that we were looking at early years intervention right
across the world. Other hon. Members have also made very valuable
contributions to the
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000206">I
shall finish by calling on the Government and all parties to try to
focus on making the perinatal period a period of holistic support for
new families. There are some examples of superb practice
but—rather like the situation with Sure Start children’s
centres—there is no agreed customer perspective, shall we say.
Mums who are pregnant come in all shapes and
sizes—literally—and from all demographics: all sorts of
age groups, ethnic backgrounds, social backgrounds and economic
backgrounds. There are working people and non-working people. They all
have varying needs, but unfortunately the provision for the crucial
perinatal period tends to be one size fits
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000207">A
woman is allocated a midwife and then she is stuck with her. If she
does not like her, bad luck. She is lucky if she sees a health visitor
before the baby is born, so there is no chance of bonding with someone.
Someone turns up in the woman’s home. This happened to me. I was
in tears at the time. Someone turned up and decided to take my baby
away and give the baby a heel prick without my permission. To me, it
was a case of “You’re torturing my baby!” I had to
be restrained by my husband. Women who have just had a baby or are
pregnant are extraordinarily vulnerable, even those of us who like to
think that we have got life sorted. Also with my first-born, I remember
that one day we were 
<?notus-xml column=368?>snowed in. He was due on 15 December, but he decided to hang around
until the 29th, so having cancelled Christmas, I had to reinstate it on
Christmas eve. I remember going to midnight mass and our lovely old
vicar saying, “Can you imagine? There’s the Virgin Mary,
sitting on a donkey, heavily pregnant.” I was thinking,
“Yes, let’s not talk about this any
more!”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013068000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/halltext/140130h0001.htm#14013068000208">For
pregnant women, there are those extraordinary sensitivities. We need to
imagine things from their viewpoint and ensure that we do not provide
services at our convenience. My all-party group had an extraordinary
meeting with registrars recently. The registrar in question said that
it was much more convenient for the registrars if people went to the
civic centre to register their babies—that it is much more
convenient for registrars and therefore that is what families should
continue to do. That is not good enough. We have to go to them; we
should not expect them to come to us, but at the moment that is the
case in almost every area of the perinatal service, even
children’s centres. Far too many of them expect the families to
find them: “If you don’t come to us, you’re hard
to reach, so that’s your fault.” We must go to
them.</hs_Para>

limited the right to protest and the democratic space in Ukraine. There

was held on 23 and 24 January in Athens. I attended the interior day on
24 January on behalf of the United Kingdom. My right hon. Friend the

the justice day due to commitments in Parliament, but he was

justice day began with a discussion of the future development of the
justice and home affairs area.  There was widespread support
among member states for implementation and consolidation of
existing  EU legislation, mutual recognition, exploiting new
technologies, and greater coherence between internal and
external EU justice and home affairs activities. Fundamental rights and
minimum criminal procedural standards were also a theme for many member
states. 
<?notus-xml column=45?>The UK supported concentrating on the implementation of existing EU
law rather than creating new legislation, and
argued against further harmonisation. The presidency concluded that
mutual recognition should remain the basis of judicial co-operation and
that existing legislation needed to be implemented and codified. It
also said that there was a need to make full use of e-Justice and new
technologies, and to have much greater coherence between internal and
external EU JHA
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000077">Next,
the Commission set out its package of measures on procedural rights in
criminal law. The chair of the European Parliament’s LIBE
Committee said the package would be a priority for the new European
Parliament. There were mixed views from those member states who spoke
in response, with support expressed in principle but some concerns
raised about the detail of what the package would mean in
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000078">Over
lunch, the presidency asked for views on the proposed amendments to the
European small claims procedure regulation. The UK joined the majority
of member states in agreeing that the threshold should rise but there
was a difference of opinion about what the new level should be. Most
also agreed with the greater use of electronic communication methods,
provided member states retained some discretion in their use. Although
not raised by the presidency, some member states also expressed
concerns about the proposed changes to the cross-border restriction and
the introduction of a cap on
fees.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000079">After
lunch there was a discussion on data protection and the issue of
international transfers of personal data. There was broad support among
member states for the principle of extending the rights of EU residents
to third countries where possible but also concern among some
delegations, including the UK, about the lack of an effective
enforcement mechanism outside the EU, the potential for controllers to
be confronted by conflicting legal obligations and a lack of certainty
for data subjects about their precise rights. The UK maintained that
the focus of effort should be on chapter 5 of the draft regulation, and
its rules on international data transfers which are enforceable within
the EU. Nonetheless, the presidency concluded that Justice Ministers
agreed to the geographical scope of the proposed regulation while
highlighting that there were issues about enforceability outside the
EU. Further discussions will now take place at the technical
level.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000080">The

Commission also described the content of its communication on
countering radicalisation and violent extremism. Member states and the
EU’s counter-terrorism co-ordinator (De Kerchove) broadly
welcomed the communication. A large number of member states stressed
the importance of making progress on EU passenger name records (PNR)
and called upon the European Parliament to unblock
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000083">The
UK argued that EU PNR was essential to enable authorities to track the
movements of terrorists across 
<?notus-xml column=46?>borders. The UK also suggested that other member states consider a
system using advance passenger information (API) data to implement a
“no fly” system, as we do. On smart
borders, the UK stressed the need for joined up
co-operation with third countries, in particular Turkey. Finally, the
UK offered to share its experience of legislation to prevent people
travelling to conflict zones for terrorist
purposes.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000084">The

second session focused on the future development of the JHA area where
the presidency introduced its paper and underlined the importance it

burden sharing in the migration field, and solidarity with those member
states under the most
pressure.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000087">The
Commission said that the strategic guidelines on the future of the JHA
area needed to take account of a range of new security and migration
challenges. There was also a need to step up work on counter
radicalisation and a number of serious crime areas, including
trafficking in human beings and cybercrime. The European Asylum Support
Office had an important role in supporting some member states to deal
with excessive pressures on their systems. These issues would be
considered in more depth at DG Home’s conference on the future
of the JHA area on 29 and 30
January.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000088">The
UK highlighted that burden sharing was not the solution and that it
would simply increase the pull factor. Nor should we call into question
the Dublin system, which had only recently been strengthened. Instead,
there was a need to strengthen the external border and reduce illegal
immigration into the EU through practical co-operation, with a focus on
returns and reducing abuse of migration and asylum systems. The UK
stated that future JHA priorities should include better exchange of
criminal records as well as action to tackle trafficking in human
beings and modem slavery, where the UK was introducing new
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14013057000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/wmstext/140130m0001.htm#14013057000089">The

Act”) both as it applies for the purposes of the Act itself, and
as it applies to the Environmental Information Regulations (EIR) 2004
(“the regulations”) by reason of regulation 18(6). This
certificate relates to the Information Commissioner’s decision
FER0467548 of 6 June 2013 (“the decision notice”). That
decision notice found that the Cabinet Office had failed to comply with
its obligations under the EIR in refusing to disclose a project
assessment review (“PAR”) report concerning High Speed 2

inflation. Across all rail fares, the increases that came into effect

communications regulator, Ofcom, is conducting the release process of
the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD) radio spectrum in the 2.3 GHz

Inputs" consultation seeking the views of interested parties and will
shortly be publishing its technical coexistence proposals. Ofcom has
indicated that the earliest the spectrum could be awarded would be in
financial year 2015-16. In the meantime, the MOD is progressing with
its work to clear existing military/Government users from the 2.3 GHz

disease and, for this reason, recommended that trans fats should
contribute no more than 2% of food energy. The Government has kept
abreast of emerging evidence including evaluations by international

A FAE is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within
one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year or month in
which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the
number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission
within the
period.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3.
Hospital episode statistics figures for the count of FAEs with a
primary diagnosis of mesothelioma are available from 1995-96 onwards.
Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context
of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier
years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity
(particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example,
changes in activity may be due to changes in the provision of
care.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_Para UID="14013093000472" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/text/140130w0001.htm#14013093000472">The

The latest update of the project was produced in
August 2013 and is based on statistical modelling of mesothelioma
deaths up to and including the year 2010. The results suggest that
annual deaths will peak towards the end of the decade and then start to
fall reflecting a reduction in asbestos exposures following its peak
use in the 1960s and
1970s.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
The statistical model used for these projections provides a reasonable
basis for making relatively short-term future predictions of
mesothelioma mortality in Britain, including the extent and timing of
the peak number of deaths. Longer-term projections can also be made but
are associated with considerable
uncertainty.</hs_TableFooter></entry></row></tfoot></tgroup></table></TableWrapper><hs_8Question UID="14013093000061" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/text/140130w0001.htm#14013093000061">NHS:

These are safeguards which ensure that any deprivation of liberty is
carried out in a person's best interests. The report shows greater use

more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14013093000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/text/140130w0001.htm#14013093000539">The

Ellison:</Member></B> The incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in
the general population in 2012 was 7.2/100,000. 3.8% of the cases of
active pulmonary TB notified in 2012 had a history of homelessness. As
we do not have reliable figures for the size of the homeless
population, we cannot calculate the incidence of pulmonary TB in the
homeless population. However, a study in London in 2003 estimated that
the prevalence of TB in the homeless population was nearly 30 times as
high as in the general population. In March 2014, Pubic Health England
and NHS England will be launching a national TB
strategy.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_30_PT_1/E7D8EAF3BF44044798C45C21D84473F1EC7511D5" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="30 January 2014">Thursday

information from the immigration service about children who might be
missing from education. Schools treat all pupils' attendance in the
same way; they monitor attendance and address it where it is poor. The
law requires all schools to send the name and address of every pupil
that has been absent continuously for 10 school days or more without
the school's permission to their local authority. It is the
responsibility of local authorities to investigate why a pupil might be
missing education in these circumstances. Statutory guidance to local
authorities on children missing education advises local authorities to
work with UK Border Agency  where there may be immigration
concerns regarding a missing

firearms licensing system are proportionate and fair. Any review of
firearms licensing fees must, therefore, properly reflect efficiencies
being made to the system. We are working with the police and members of
the shooting community to assess how the cost of the firearms licensing
process will change once eCommerce for Policing has been
introduced.

companies that run the electricity and gas networks. There is no
natural or structural monopoly for supply and distribution in off-gas
grid fuels, so regulation by Ofgem may not be appropriate. A market
study conducted by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) in 2011 found few
competition concerns, with 97% of heating oil consumers having access
to four or more different

way to protect the interests of off-gas grid consumers. The third
Ministerial Roundtable on heating oil and LPG is due to be held in May,

environmental assets of the UK Overseas Territories, which are
internationally recognised. In the inhabited Territories, the Territory
Governments are constitutionally responsible for the protection and
conservation of their natural environments. The Territories may develop
their own strategies for marine protection, commensurate with the
biological and economic resources available to them. The UK Government
is working in partnership with Territory Governments to provide the
technical advice and support they need to fulfil their environment
commitments and develop robust marine management frameworks, which may
include the designation of marine protected areas (MPAs) in the future.
Of the uninhabited Territories, South Georgia and the South Sandwich
Islands and the British Indian Ocean Territories have designated MPAs.
The UK continues to work with other members of the Commission for the
Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources to propose the
establishment of further MPAs around

subsidy that has been used to incentivise woodland creation to help
reduce flood risk; though it does not have a specific category or
criterion called contour afforestation. National targeting towards that
objective took place between April 2012 and the end of December 2013.
It is too early to assess the effectiveness of the recent planting in
reducing flood
risk.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="14013094000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/text/140130w0002.htm#14013094000179"><B><Member PimsId="488" UID="14013094000254" xid="515" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140130/text/140130w0002.htm#14013094000254">Chris
