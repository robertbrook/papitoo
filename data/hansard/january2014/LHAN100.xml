going down? It concluded that the current policy is failing and

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, is it not a fact that
in the United States bread is already fortified not only with folic
acid, which of course prevents spina bifida in newly born children, but
also vitamin D? At present there is a great deal of concern here that
none of us is getting enough vitamin D due to the lack of sunlight in
winter. Would it not be a good thing for us to have that benefit? Can
the Minister also assure me that if this applies to wheat it will cover
wholemeal as well as ordinary loaves, as we recommend people to eat

Howe:</Member></B> On my noble friend’s last question, we are
slightly jumping ahead of ourselves because we need to decide
on the principle before we decide on 
<?notus-xml column=568?>which types of wheat might be fortified. However, I recognise my
noble friend’s main point. Indeed, the Scientific
Advisory Committee on Nutrition, in recommending mandatory
fortification of flour with folic acid, sought to highlight the
benefits of fortification as well as the risks. It was a balanced
recommendation. We value it and we will look at the advice very closely
indeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:39:51"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Krebs" PimsId="5196" UID="14012175000741" xid="1952" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000741">Lord

other countries, but, as I am sure the noble Lord will accept, we need

Turnberg (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the case for fortifying flour
with folic acid is now incontrovertible. It is both safe and effective
in preventing spina bifida. I should like to follow up the question of
the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner, about vitamin D fortification, as
there is a rising incidence of rickets in children, particularly Asian
children,<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:41:32"></hs_TimeCode> and we
really should take that
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:41:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="14012175000744" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000744">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> The noble Lord is absolutely right. I agree with him
that the incidence of rickets is a cause for concern. At the same time,
he characterises the case for mandatory fortification as
incontrovertible. There are risks that SACN pointed out. Its advice to
government stated that fortification of flour with folic acid might
have adverse effects on neurological function in people aged 65 years
and over with vitamin B12 deficiency. Treatment with folic acid can
alleviate or mask the anaemia and therefore delay the diagnosis of
vitamin B12 deficiency, which can lead to irreversible
effects<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:42:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Patel" PimsId="116" UID="14012175000745" xid="1772" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000745">Lord
Patel (CB):</Member></B> The noble Earl referred to two things. His
immediate answer just now suggested that folic acid levels might
interfere with B12 anaemia in older people. That would require a dosage
of about 15 milligrams per day; the dosage we are talking about
for fortification would hardly reach 1 milligram per day. The risk,
therefore, is pretty minimal. Secondly, he suggested in his opening
Answer that the folate level of the population might help to devise the
policy. How would that help to devise the policy for women in early
pregnancy who need the folic acid to reduce the incidence of neural
tube
defects<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:43:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="14012175000746" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000746">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> I am sure the noble Lord would agree that we have to
take a decision based on the most up-to-date data. The data that we had
prior to this were 10 years old and it is important to take a decision
in the context of the nutritional state of health of the 
<?notus-xml column=569?>population. On his first question, all I can say is
that the risk to which I referred was considered as part of
SACN’s overall assessment and we will draw on that in reaching
our decisions on the fortification of flour and give it the appropriate
weight that it
deserves<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T14:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Hunt of Kings Heath" PimsId="1076" UID="14012175000747" xid="1755" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000747">Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, on the issue of
up-to-date information, as the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, has said, we
now have the Wolfson study, which actually leads that organisation to
recommend that all countries should introduce folic acid fortification.
The Government already have the recommendation of the Scientific
Advisory Committee on Nutrition for mandatory fortification. Yes, it
says it should be accompanied by actions to restrict voluntary
fortification of food with folic acid for the reasons to which noble
Lords have already referred. Why on earth are the Government delaying

which was that taking this step would be a major step by any

anti-social behaviour powers are designed to protect the activities of
the law-abiding majority. The Government are certainly not seeking to
restrict reasonable behaviour and activity, and we do not believe that
these powers do. Live music and street entertainment play an important
role in community life and can generate a positive atmosphere that is
enjoyed by all. As a result, these reforms are completely consistent
with our policies on busking and live

Clement-Jones (</B><B>LD</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, I welcome that
statement from my noble friend but there appears to be a considerable
difference between the approach of the DCMS and that of the Home Office
to busking. The DCMS has been enthusiastic about deregulating live
music. The Home Office, by contrast, is enthusiastic about its new
public spaces protection order, which creates new dispersal powers and
which could be used disproportionately and pre-emptively by local
authorities, if the existing behaviour of some London borough councils
such as Camden is typical, by contrast to that of the mayor and the
GLA. Can my noble friend confirm that the statutory guidance to be
issued to local authorities will ensure that these powers are exercised
with proper consideration of the balance between freedom of expression
and respect for private and family life, and will also point out the
considerable existing body of nuisance and noise-abatement powers which
local authorities already have to hand? Should we not be encouraging
rather than discouraging busking, which is such an important part of
our urban
culture?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000022"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="14012175000756" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000756"><B>Lord
Taylor of </B><B>Holbeach</B><B>:</B></Member> I can certainly give my
noble friend the assurance that the guidance will achieve what he and
the Government wish to see from it. I do not think that there is a
difference across government on this issue. We believe that the tests
and safeguards set out in the new anti-social behaviour powers will
ensure that they will be used only where reasonable. Where behaviour is
having a positive effect on a community, and I see busking as having
that effect, it would not meet the tests for the new powers. Instead,
the powers are directed against the anti-social minority who give
street performers a bad name; I might illustrate them as being
aggressive beggars and drunken
louts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000023"><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Clancarty" PimsId="2608" UID="14012175000757" xid="2038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000757"><B>The

Camden case because it is subject to judicial review, as the noble Earl
will understand. However, perhaps I can convey to the House the
sentiments of the Mayor of London, who clearly believes that busking is
an important part of street life in London. He is keen to encourage
street entertainment and live music, not least because of the positive
aspect it brings to the life of the city. As I have made clear, the
Government 
<?notus-xml column=571?>believe that live music and street entertainment can play an important

implementation of legislation can cause problems. Will the Minister
respond to the noble Lord’s specific point about making things
clear in guidance? When looking at the public spaces protection order,
will he also consider guidance for community protection notices and
dispersal powers because, with this whole new architecture of
arrangements for dealing with anti-social behaviour in the Bill,

will have seen on the news the offer to Iran to take part in Geneva II.

Tyler (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment seeks simply to tidy
up an anomaly created by the government amendments here and on Report.
My noble and learned friend informed us on Report last week that the
threshold for registration would be £20,000 in England,
£10,000 in each of Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland, or £9,750 if the spending was to take place in
one constituency. In other words, the lowest of the spending limits in
the Bill—the £9,750 constituency limit—is exactly
equal to the threshold for registration if the activity is focused in
that
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:13:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000064">The
Government’s approach is the same as that I took in my
initial amendments on thresholds in Committee. However, I was then
persuaded by the Electoral Commission, with the very explicit advice
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012175000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000234">“this
approach would cause significant workability problems, since in
practice campaigners will either remain below the registration
threshold or will be in breach of a spending
limit”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="14012175000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000168">It

very valid point it was making was that, if you need to have a point of
registration, it must be lower than the spending limit with which the
activity is concerned, so there are two quite separate processes.
First, an organisation says, “I am spending X, so I need to
register”. Then it goes on to say, “I have now spent Y,
so I cannot spend any more”. The commission has said very
clearly on a number of occasions that X and Y cannot be at the
same level, but that is the effect of the present situation arising
from the recent government
amendments.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14012175000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000065">My
amendment therefore sets X, which is the threshold for registration if
you are spending in just one or two constituencies, at £5,000
and leaves Y—the Government’s proposed constituency
limit—at £9,750. This provides the process of spending,
registration, more spending, then reaching the limit—which is
exactly what the Electoral Commission has indicated is desirable and
essential. I therefore hope that the Minister will recognise that, even
today, the Electoral Commission is saying that the Government’s
amendments in this area are just not quite right. Importantly, they are

have to register if their spending in a constituency reached
£9,750. However, it is really serious if anything is not clear,

I said on Report, even if the Bill does what my noble friend intends,
it would still leave a position where a limit in the Bill could be
reached—or very nearly so—without any expenses return
having to be submitted. I cannot think of any other area of
electoral law where this is the case. It is necessary for the
constituency threshold to be lower than the constituency spending
limit. None of that affects the very welcome and desirable changes to
the effective national thresholds made by my noble friends on the Front
Bench. These changes were desired by all sides and will ensure that
smaller, national organisations are not brought within the purview of
the legislation. However, it is crucial to get the operation of the
constituency limits right. Their introduction is at the heart of what
the Bill is for. If we get that wrong, people will ask why on earth we
brought it in in the first place. I am sure the Minister will not
introduce the red herring of RPA limits which are not relevant because
if they were sufficient to deal with this problem much of this section
of the Bill would not be necessary at all.</hs_para>

the changes I am suggesting, there is not only the workability question
raised by the Electoral Commission but an in-principle problem.
Somebody could spend £19,499.98 in two English
constituencies—£9,749.99 in each—without even
registering. I am not wedded to the figure of £5,000, but it is
quite a considerable sum for any organisation to which we are currently
referring to spend in a particular constituency. If my noble friend
wishes to look at it again, it could be £6,000 or £7,000.
The key issue is that it must be less than the limit figure. I remind
noble Lords on all sides of the House—especially
ex-MPs—that there are stringent, carefully monitored
constraints on the amount that a candidate can spend and paperwork is
required for well below £9,750 from every candidate in every
constituency. Leaving things as they are would create a real loophole
whereby a campaigner could exert a significant effect on a constituency
result without any public knowledge of the spending or the source of
the money. Where is the transparency there? This could undermine the
whole purpose of the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:18:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000070">On
that basis, I hope the Minister can either accept this amendment,
perhaps knowing he will need to tidy it up tomorrow in the
other place, or undertake to bring forward tomorrow anyway a
government amendment in lieu to sort out lines 38 to 40 on page 16. I
am sure that the Electoral Commission would support any such change.
This is no big policy change: it is just recognition of a chance to get

of feeling with which my noble friend Lord Tyler moved his amendment;
indeed, it is one to which he has spoken in the past, and one which he,
I and—at some stage—my noble friend Lord Wallace of
Saltaire have discussed. We debated this issue last week when the

third-party registration thresholds to £20,000 for England and

for a new “third” registration threshold of £9,750
was also tabled and accepted. If that was not made clear, I apologise.
The point has been picked up by the Electoral Commission. Perhaps I may
give some clarity. This third threshold has been introduced to provide
alignment with the constituency limits. It ensures that a third party,
whether or not it is already registered with the Electoral Commission,
will have committed an offence if it spends more than £9,750 in
a constituency. In other words, if a third party is already registered,
it will be subject to the constituency limit, exceeding which will be
an offence. If it is not registered and exceeds the constituency
registration threshold, it will also have committed an
offence.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012175000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000073">I
hope noble Lords will recognise that this third registration threshold

applies to the other registration thresholds. It has not been
introduced to bring third parties into the regulatory regime. Instead,
its principal purpose is to ensure that the offence of exceeding the
constituency limit operates as intended. For this reason, the

threshold lower than the constituency

these words have brought greater clarity. I can also tell your

guidance the operation of the various registration thresholds so that

that the fears which my noble friend expressed on Report, that it would
not be possible to keep account of what a third party was spending in a
constituency, are resolved by this.</hs_para>

Government have spent a significant amount of time listening to the
concerns of campaigners. Perhaps I should address my noble
friend’s suggestion of a £5,000 limit. He said that
£9,750 is a significant amount. We took seriously the
representations made by campaigners, organisations, the commission
chaired by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of
Pentregarth, and other Members of your Lordships’ House. One of
the largest criticisms the Bill received, which was made abundantly
clear to us, related to the registration thresholds. They were
originally set at £5,000 and £2,000 in the Bill but the
Government tabled an amendment last week to raise these to
£20,000 and £10,000. This major concession was made with
the intention of reassuring campaigners that the Bill would not seek to
promote the principle of transparency by imposing onerous and
unnecessary burdens on third parties. It was a direct response to the
debates in and outside this House and I thank again all those who
contributed to them. The increased thresholds 
<?notus-xml column=583?>mean that small campaigners need not worry that they
will be unduly burdened by the Bill’s reporting requirements.
The thresholds have been set at a level such that those campaigners who
spend only small amounts of money will effectively be excluded from the
regime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000076">I

Williams of Crosby (LD):</Member></B> Perhaps I may add to the point
made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. The amendment of my
noble friend Lord Tyler very much simplifies the administration. It
sets a clear limit—rather clearer than the percentages in the
original Bill. Given that, given the real problem about bureaucracy and
fights with transparency in the Bill, and given that all of us
appreciate the major changes made already, would the Minister not
consider the advantages of both clarity and transparency in accepting
this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:24:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000079"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="14012175000799" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000799">Lord
Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> Both interventions raise the same
point. I say to the noble Lord, Lord
Camp<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:24:49"></hs_TimeCode>bell-Savours,
that I tried to explain how the £9,750 registration limit comes
into play, but I also went on to indicate that the Electoral
Commission, in its guidance, will make very clear the operation of the
various registration thresholds, including this one with regard to the
constituency limit, so campaigners should be in no doubt. In response
to that and to my noble friend Lady Williams, I have a lot of sympathy
with the point, but the figure of £5,000 is better than a
percentage. I do not want to embark on the theology of the percentages
because they run through the Bill, but the figure itself will appear in
the guidance from the Electoral Commission.</hs_para>

about the administrative burden is that smaller organisations could be
caught up. It may be that in one particular constituency there is one
constituency issue with which a small campaigning group has become
engaged. If we set the limit at £5,000, they may find suddenly
that they have to put in place a bureaucracy and administration to deal
with that. The higher limit of £9,750 would probably address
such concerns, which is what we want to try to ensure. It is often so
when you have an individual campaign in an individual constituency. I
accept that there is no perfect answer to this. It
was a judgment call as to 
<?notus-xml column=584?>whether we should keep the limit as low as
£5,000 or, having listened to those who thought that was too low
for individual constituency cases, whether it might be possible to
raise the sum. For that reason and to strike that balance, we thought
that £9,750 was an appropriate amount. Therefore, I invite my
noble friend to withdraw his amendment. I give way to the noble and
learned Lord, Lord

Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Gardiner of Kimble. The failure to be
aware of how well used the Welsh language is in campaigning, in
documents and in many
other<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:27:41"></hs_TimeCode> ways, has
become obvious. It is very different from the time, long ago in the
1960s, when I was a young Transport Minister struggling with
officialdom to meet the demand for Welsh forms and licences. As the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, said, the oversight goes back to
the 2000 Act. If this short debate does nothing else, it will remind
policymakers and draftsmen that the Welsh Language Act 1993 was passed
and that there was a sea change in the use of the language.</hs_para>

that argument, but an organisation could publish a modest amount of

interpretation of Amendment 25, an organisation might be inhibited from
actually producing Welsh material. In my view, you have to produce
paper to be able to translate it, and I argued accordingly. I believe
that the Minister was then taking a more restricted view. However, the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, said that there was not much
between us and that we should try to reach a consensus without creating
loopholes whereby much more material was produced. I suggested that, in

give regarding the interpretation of this amendment. The words
“in consequence of” 
<?notus-xml column=585?>can have a wide connotation. If it is a wide connotation we have no
fears, but if it is narrow and restricted the problem will remain. For
example, I was e-mailed in the past few days by, I believe, a
representative of an organisation that had to publish its reports
bilingually. The full cost of its recent annual report—design,
print and second-class postage—amounted to £9,508. The
translation cost was £835—about 9%. It believes that the
full cost of the bilingual translation was 50% of the total. It would
appear that while 9% would be discounted on a narrow interpretation of
this amendment, 41% could not. Therefore, the Minister’s
guidance on this amendment is crucial, otherwise organisations will be
inhibited from providing Welsh-language material, which is a mischief

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, it may be helpful if I
respond to the points made by the noble and learned Lord. I had already
indicated that the Government are willing to accept Amendment 25. The
noble and learned Lord, along with the noble Lords, Lord Wigley and
Lord Elystan-Morgan, raised this important issue on Report. It is the
case that costs should not be limited to the fee of the translator but
should include other costs that arise as a consequence of that
translation. We believe that Amendment 25 achieves that aim. It
certainly enjoys the full support of the Government. All costs incurred
as a consequence of the translation of materials to or from Welsh will
not count as controlled expenditure. For example, when a three-page
leaflet in English is translated into Welsh and becomes a six-page
document, the additional costs of printing and paper will not be
counted as controlled
expenditure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000087">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:32:52"></hs_TimeCode>
was a general consensus when we debated this in the past. Certainly the
Government do not wish to see a situation in which a campaigner could
increase their effective spending by clever use of materials in
different languages. That is not a result that any of us wanted. We
believe that Amendment 25 achieves the right balance between excluding
costs in connection with translation without creating the loophole. I
think that we have struck the right balance, but as the noble and
learned Lord said, there will be a review after the 2015 election. If
some practical difficulties arise in the course of it, that matter will
almost certainly be discussed; it would be appropriate to discuss it in
the context of that review. I hope that that gives the noble and

It is not just my judgment with which he has a problem; it is the

not my advice but the advice of the Electoral Commission. That is its
judgment call. Therefore, I must invite my noble and learned friend to
think carefully before this element of the Bill is considered by our
colleagues in the other place tomorrow—as it will be, since
there will be government amendments that they will be
addressing—as to whether there is not some way that we can deal

that the Government are determined to have Clause 29, which I

necessary to reduce the perception of undue influence. That is curious,
because there is no evidence—I have not heard any in the course
of any of the lengthy debates—to support a claim that there is
any such public perception or that the current combination of PPERA and
the Representation of the People Act has been in any way ineffective in
relation to non-party campaigning so far. There is no evidence that
non-party campaigners are currently exploiting the existing law by
focusing their spending on a particular constituency. Indeed, no data

Bill is passed there will be no restriction on either candidates or

constituency’s boundaries where no other spending is proposed?
Instead of requiring the Electoral Commission, which faces the
nightmare task of preparing guidance once this Bill passes, to consider

concentrate the constituency limits on the direct approach—the

where the people whom you are calling live and to allocate those costs
to a constituency limit. The amendment on Report was about

my noble and learned friend the Minister made a compelling point on
Report last week. He said that materials could be distributed within a
constituency other than by delivering them directly to electors’
homes—they could be handed out in town centres, for example. The
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, has rightly
tried to meet that point in proposed new sub-paragraph (1) of his
amendment, but the complication of considering whether materials handed
out in a town centre are trying to influence a constituency result has
led him and his

cumulative effect is to ask those campaigners—many of them small
operations, as we have been constantly reminded—to consider
their spending against not one test, as I advocated last week, but
three. First, there is my test, which I have already given: are the
phone calls and election material directed at a particular elector or
household? That is easy. Then we have in this amendment, secondly: does
the material have a significant effect just in the constituency to
which it was sent? Who can tell? When can they tell? Perhaps they can
tell only after polling day. Therein lies another problem. Then there
is the third qualification: can it reasonably be inferred that the

not know how one can be sure of either of the latter tests, either in
terms of the Electoral Commission and its very proper responsibilities,
to which my noble friend Lord Cormack has just referred, or of the

I can see that it may be necessary in relation to the narrow issue of
handing out leaflets in a town centre. After all, leaflets handed out
in the town square of my old North Cornwall constituency would almost
certainly be directed at North Cornwall’s results and voters,
but leaflets handed out in Trafalgar Square might not be directed only
at voters in the City of London and
Westminster.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000116">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>

legitimate concern about the distribution of leaflets in a town square.
If we had more time for drafting, I would be able to find some
additional tests, but only for this additional activity of handing out
leaflets rather than for all deliveries that could take place. It is a
rather complicated point and I apologise for that to Members of your

influence the constituency result. I do not buy that, and at this stage
it leaves a real lacuna. If you write to a voter in a constituency to
promote or procure the electoral success of a party or candidate, I am
confident that you are trying to promote or procure their electoral
success in that constituency. That is a simple rule, and one it would

a constituency limit. There needs to be a constituency limit. A revised
amendment along these lines would make that more effective and much

listened to the arguments surrounding this amendment. The noble
Baroness is quite right that we cannot get perfection, but I wish that
we could put on record and give due consideration to the men and women
who, when a general election or municipal 
<?notus-xml column=595?>elections come, put their names forward as
parliamentary candidates. I had the good fortune to be in a
constituency where, although I hated the term “safe Labour
seat” and cringed whenever anyone said it because the seat had
to be worked at, I had significant admiration for those candidates who
came into that constituency and said that they were flying the flag for
their party—Conservatives, Liberals or the SNP. Remember that
many of us get to our feet and talk about the new democracies in Africa
and those that used to be behind the iron curtain, but one thing that
we have to do as parliamentarians is to teach people how to be
parliamentary
candidates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000130">That
brings me on to these campaign groups and it is why I asked the noble
Lord, Lord Cormack, whether they might be registered charities. The
noble Lord, Lord Tyler, said that they might be, if I picked him up
correctly. Let me look at the registered charities which embark on
campaigns. I know that the situation is different now when a general
election is called, because we have got ourselves this five-year
election term and people see that we can go right to the wire on a
given date, five years from the previous election. In the old days, we
used to sit in the tea room in the House of Commons wondering when the
Prime Minister was going to go to the country, which meant
that the campaign groups could not put the kettle on and say that it
would be on a certain date—even those who were
closest did not know that. Now that we have this five-year situation,
perhaps I might send a message out to people in charities that they
should use their heads. If they want to campaign, they have four years
and three months, I think, in which to campaign. They should
let the general election take its course with the parliamentary
candidates because there is a danger here.</hs_para>

closures, which the noble Lord mentioned. We all hate to see hospital

put up score-cards and say, “This is a good candidate, who has
campaigned against the closure of a given hospital”. What if it
was a Minister in that constituency who was holding office and had
another portfolio? That Minister would not be allowed to say,
“Don’t close that hospital”, yet some of these
campaigners choose not to see that and say, “This is the good
guy who is prepared to campaign, while your sitting Member of
Parliament has been silent”. We know full well that the reason
he or she has been silent may be that they are holding the office of

say to the charities that they really have to watch what they are

public purse and they should be careful about what they are doing.

constituencies. The major problem has already been articulated: it is
not their intention or purpose, in the words of the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, but their workability. Charities and
campaigners simply do not organise or do their accounts or even think
in constituency terms. They focus on the proposed path of the HS2, the
flight paths around Heathrow, the ground under where fracking will take
place, the location of badger sets or the location of a polluting

them, therefore, a requirement to record and account for their staff

enormous bureaucracy when, as we have said before, the Government are
elsewhere trying to reduce red tape. Accounting for expenditure on the
basis that it might have an effect on a constituency would require
those charities and other groups to develop a whole new financial
accounting system, a demand which surely cannot be achieved even by the

September.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000137">Our
second concern is also one that has already been mentioned. It is the
worry of the Electoral Commission about whether the new constituency
limits are enforceable in the timescale of an election.
There is nothing worse than having a rule or a law that is
unenforceable, because it undermines the rest of the law.
The Electoral Commission considers that Amendment 11 would
at least reduce its enforceability worries, although it still fears
that it would often be difficult to get the information and evidence
for any breach of constituency-level spending and deal with it before
polling day. Amendment 11, which, as we have heard, limits the new
reporting requirements to telephone calls, literature to households and
physical distribution in a defined area, seems to us eminently
sensible. That sort of spending is preplanned and easy to measure. As

possible to do their accounting in that way, and it would give the

stages of the Bill’s passage. It is appropriate that we give
consideration to this, which members of the commission might see as the
outstanding item still to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:14:56"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendments are very similar those tabled by my noble friend Lord Tyler
on Report. My noble friend’s amendment, which we discussed last
week, sought to narrow the range of activities which would be
considered controlled expenditure for the purposes of constituency
limits<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:15:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Although
I made no commitment on the part of the Government to returning to this
at Third Reading, I indicated at the close of the debates on Report
that we would ensure that officials raised these matters with the
Electoral
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000140">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:19:24"></hs_TimeCode>
understand the point about simplicity. We have sought in many respects
to reduce the administrative burden, but it was clear from the
discussions that took place subsequently with the Electoral Commission
that there was no technical fix. My noble friend Lord Tyler was almost
asking me the same again at the end of his contribution to the debate
on this amendment.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:19:24"></hs_TimeCode> was not a
technical fix but
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:19:24"></hs_TimeCode> might be a
policy fix. It is a policy fix that is inherent in the amendment of the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, which would remove some
categories of expenditure from being counted towards the constituency
limit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>. For
reasons that I will explain, the Government are unable to accept that

I acknowledge that, in moving the amendment, the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, accepted the principle of constituency
limits and sought to address one of the points of concern I had raised
with regard to the amendment of my noble friend Lord Tyler. He also
sought to address the practical issues raised by the Electoral
Commission. In the context of trying to relieve some of the
administrative burden—going back to the earlier debate, just to
remind your Lordships’ House—it is also important that
the original proposals had a limit for the constituency spending and a
smaller limit for the post-Dissolution period. There was a much smaller
limit for campaigning activity that could be spent between the date of
the Dissolution of Parliament and the election. We have taken away that
interim
threshold<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>, again
in an effort to help smaller organisations which may be campaigning in
one constituency.</hs_para>

believe that these amendments would require that any expenditure on
election material addressed or delivered to households, and any
unsolicited telephone calls made with a view to ascertaining
households’ 
<?notus-xml column=598?>voting intentions, would be attributed to a
particular constituency or constituencies for the purposes of the
limits. The noble and right reverend Lord’s intention appears to
be that only expenditure on such activities should count towards
constituency limits. He goes further than my noble friend Lord Tyler
did last week to suggest considering the costs associated with the
distribution of materials otherwise in a constituency—which was
the example I gave. I fully accept the example that I gave of activity
in a shopping centre, which clearly would relate to the one
activity<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000143">I
was somewhat bemused by the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Mallalieu, when she complained that there was a loophole. It appears to
me that if you take away other activities which have to contribute
towards controlled expenditure, the loophole gets bigger. She indicated
that it could be a loophole to have a rally just over the constituency
boundary. First, whether a rally against a hospital closure that
promotes the electoral success of one particular candidate counts
towards a constituency limit depends on whether it has a significant
effect in that constituency. Albeit that it takes place over the
boundary in a neighbouring constituency, it could still have a
significant effect in the first constituency and would therefore come
within in it. Of course, the loophole that would be created by this
amendment would be the rally in the constituency itself—over the
boundary it would not count at all. I believe that is a criticism:
there are activities that would not therefore come within the
definition of “controlled
expenditure<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:19:46"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

third parties mean that they cannot outspend and overwhelm candidates
and political parties, who after all are the main actors in an
election. The noble Lord, Lord Martin of Springburn, made an important
point, reminding us that elections are about the names of candidates on
the ballot paper. It is not right that a candidate or a party
campaigning in a constituency could be targeted by a third party with
greater means and a greater spending limit at its
disposal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000145">Taking
into account both the long and short campaigning period limits, the
most a candidate at the last parliamentary general election could have
spent was £55,000; that is for the entire period. I may have
misunderstood what the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, said, but I
thought she said at one point that parties could spend without limit.
That is not the case. There is a limit on political parties. Indeed, in
the course of the election period—the short campaign from the
Dissolution of Parliament—it is roughly £12,000 to
£13,000, depending on the number of electors, a figure that was
mentioned by my noble friend Lord Cormack in one of our earlier
debates.</hs_para>

could choose to spend the entirety of its current spending limit in one
small area, campaigning against that and other candidates or the
parties they represent. That could be very substantial if one allows a
range of activities not to be in any way brought into controlled
expenditure. We have previously heard concerns that third parties,
although an important part of the democratic process, can also be so
closely aligned to a political party as to be effectively campaigning
to promote that
party<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
right that we take account of that. That is why the Bill introduces a
number of provisions to give greater transparency to the activities 
<?notus-xml column=599?>and expenditure of third parties. The limits on
constituency spending are a key element of the entire package in the
Bill. The controlled expenditure incurred on the entire range of
activities, not just those few proposed by the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries, should be attributable to constituency
limits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000147">Third<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:21:49"></hs_TimeCode>
parties are not merely in the business of distributing leaflets. They
arrange and hold events, rallies and press conferences. They bus
campaigners from area to area, delivering large groups of people to
distribute those leaflets, or to take part in rallies or other events.
Not to include these activities would mean that third parties could
still continue to hold local media events on a weekly, or even daily,
basis in the run-up to an election without any of that expenditure
being brought within controlled limits. It would mean a third party
could hold a rally on the eve of an election, secure in the knowledge
that it need not account for the cost other than on a nationwide basis.
It would mean that a third party could bus hundreds of campaigners into
marginal constituencies and overwhelm the work of the candidates in
that
constituency<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:22:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000148">These
are all significant activities, and it is right that third parties
should be required to account for them on a constituency basis.
Narrowing the scope of constituency limits would address only half the
problem. On that basis, recognising that in an election the actors are
the candidates themselves, it was unfair, particularly in the period
from the Dissolution of Parliament until the election, that they were
limited to a relatively small sum of money—£12,000 or
£13,000—while if you got two third-party groups in the
same constituency, they could spend up to £19,750. We do not

to this amendment for very long. We very much welcomed the
Government’s commitment to have a review of the Act after the
2015 general election and that they will set up a person to monitor the
election itself. That is all very much to be welcomed—not least
of course because, even with the amendments that the Government have

are necessary. I beg to

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, has indicated, the Government brought
forward at Report an amendment so that there will be a review. The
Government are committed to appointing a person to undertake the review
within 12 months of this Bill receiving Royal Assent. That came out of
one of the meetings that we had with one of the campaign groups, which
suggested that it might be useful to have someone in place during the
election. We thought that that was a very sensible suggestion and one
for which we have
provided<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:49:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000162">I
have discussed with the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries,
the merits and demerits of perhaps putting more in the Bill about what
the review might or might not do, and we concluded that the minute we
start adding things it begs the question as to what has been left out.
There is no intention to limit the review, and I take the point made by
the noble Baroness, Lady Lister. If people wish to make representations
on that point in terms of the review, we would not anticipate anything
stopping it—certainly there is nothing in the Bill that would
stop it. I emphasise, however, that we believe that freedom of
association and expression are vital. They are not impinged by the
Bill; rather, what we have is transparency. We are not trying to stop
people campaigning, but if they are campaigning in a way that seeks to
influence an election it is not unreasonable that that should be
transparent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:50:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012175000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0001.htm#14012175000163">The
next scheduled general election will be the opportunity on which the
Bill will operate, and will provide a timely opportunity to review the
effectiveness of those controls. On completion the person conducting
the review must produce a written report which must be published and
laid before Parliament by the Minister. The noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, tabled the amendment proposing that
the report must be laid before Parliament within 18 months of the
general election. It is right that Parliament should have the
opportunity to consider the outcomes of the review well before the
following 2020 election. It is appropriate that the review is done to
an established timetable, and the Government are therefore pleased to

the person who is appointed to undertake the review or in any way
constrain what he or she will do. It might be an opportunity to
reiterate something, not just in the context of the review, but on the
point made in the previous debate by my noble friend Lord Cormack. I
accepted the point that he made on the constituency issues: there might
be merit in having groups—not just parties, but campaigning
groups—involved in any guidance that emerges from the Electoral
Commission. I readily expect that any review would involve submissions
from the political parties that have been involved in the election,
from charities, non-charitable campaigning groups, and people who have
something relevant to contribute. As I said yesterday, we can always
bet our lives that some issue will emerge that none of us has thought
about, in spite of our very exhaustive discussions and debates. That is
why it is important not to be

know that the intention behind the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson, is to probe the Government’s plans for commencement
of Part 3 and to ensure that trade unions are given sufficient
time to be able to comply with changes requiring them to report
annually on their membership registers. On Report, I offered to meet
the noble Lords, Lord Stevenson and Lord Monks, to discuss this matter
in more detail. Indeed, as they alluded to, that meeting took place two
days following Report, on 15 January. Noble Lords may like to be
reminded that, on Report, I suggested that the earliest the provisions
would be commenced was October 2014. I am pleased that I was able to
say at the meeting last week, and can confirm to the House today, that
commencement will not occur before April 2015. This follows careful
consideration

to be later than that for many unions, as many have a calendar
reporting year and would not be required to submit their first
certificate until June 2017. Noble Lords will recall that this is
because unions will submit a membership audit certificate for the first
full reporting year after the changes become law. The 17-month period
that I referred to on Report is a combination of the union’s
12-month reporting period and the five months that is allowed after

towards commencement, in particular by discussing with them the
guidance that will be needed as well as consulting on the draft order
that identifies eligibility to be an assurer. I believe that an April
2015 commencement date will give trade unions the time that they need
to prepare and to amend their rules, and understand that the general
secretary of the TUC agreed that this was achievable. I have written to
the noble Lords, Lord Stevenson and Lord Monks, and placed copies in

consequences may indeed include the workload and the efficacy of the
Electoral Commission, which has been greatly commented on today and in
previous debates. The noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, talked about
headaches and nightmares for the Electoral Commission. I hope it is not

legal language in which the remit of the Electoral Commission is

while fairly common in this Bill, is unusual generally in legislation
and is doubly so when one considers that the Electoral Commission is
not a government body but one that reports to Parliament through the

is commendable but, on closer scrutiny of the Bill, it is not helpful.
The main thing Clause 38 does is to change “general
function” to “duties” and change taking
“appropriate steps” to taking “all reasonable
steps”. The problem with this is that it reduces the flexibility
of the Electoral Commission to deal with spurious or politically
motivated allegations that are clearly unfounded. The lawyers in the
House will appreciate the difference between
“appropriate” and “all reasonable” steps.
The problem is compounded by the fact that, as a result of the Bill,
many more campaigners are likely to be regulated, as has been
acknowledged by the Government and other speakers. Any allegations may
peak at the climax of the election and thus lead to confusion and loss
of confidence in the new regime.</hs_para>

has been acknowledged, many provisions are untested. On the one hand,
the Government are giving the Electoral Commission more to do; on the
other, they are making it harder to deal with simple and
unsubstantiated cases quickly and cost-effectively. I am sorry to raise
this point so late in the deliberations on this Bill, but I think that
the Electoral Commission has shown admirable self-restraint in wanting
the House to concentrate on the content of the Bill rather than on the
problems that it may have in enforcing it and regulating subsequently.
It is important to raise that point before the Bill is finalised here.
I would therefore be grateful if the Minister would ensure that the
Government talked to the Electoral Commission about this problem, which
may occur over the next few months, and if necessary take
corrective action by means of the powers which they are taking under
this new
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012183000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000025">Finally,
perhaps I may say as a new Member of your Lordships’
House that the debates on this Bill have brilliantly illustrated this
House’s role as a scrutineer of legislation. The Bill has been
much improved as a result of the House’s efforts, and pride of
place in that respect must go to the noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries, and his supporters on the Commission on Civil Society.

their supporters outside the House have gone over the top. A certain
co-ordinated “holier than thou” attitude has sometimes
been apparent. I have lost count of the number of campaigners who have
told me in identical words, “This is a deeply unpopular Bill the
need for which has yet to be substantiated”. Letter after letter
contained that particular clause; they could have been a little more
differentiated in the way in which they approached this issue. Those
campaigners have also attempted to portray themselves as defenders of
democracy. Actually, in my view, it is the Government who are in this
case the defender of democracy. As my noble friends Lady Williams and
Lord Tyler have said in a <I>Guardian</I> article, this Bill has a
noble intent, which is to defend the democratic process from distortion
by excessive interference by outside interest groups. Quite rightly,
the Government want to make the electoral process as level a playing
field as possible. The noble Lord, Lord Martin of Springburn, whose
great expertise in this area we acknowledge, made that point forcefully
in the previous debate. The Government have also shown a creditable
willingness to be flexible, having originally consulted too little and
drawn the Bill too tightly. I commend my noble friends for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012183000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000027">The end

that should happen and I commend my noble friends on making provision
for it. I therefore commend them on the way in which they have handled

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, concerns have been
expressed about this government amendment allowing a Minister to have
these powers on an Act which will go to the very heart of
democracy—they are rightly called Henry VIII powers, I believe.
The Government have given assurances that these powers are strictly
limited and that they will consult the Electoral Commission. In view of
the lessons learnt as a result of this Bill going through the two
Houses, they may think that it is worth consulting more widely if they
feel the need to bring orders before this House. It should be
put on record that concerns have been expressed, but we are grateful,
from what the Minister said, that the powers are strictly
limited.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14012183000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000301"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T17:15:00"></hs_TimeCode></I>5.15

briefly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T17:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>, we are
much indebted to my noble friend Lord Horam for what he said. He has
clearly demonstrated admirable restraint during this Bill,
knowing—as he has now made clear—that the Electoral
Commission was far from happy and that he, as a member of that
commission, shared at least some of that
unhappiness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012183000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000031">This
is an object lesson in how not to do things. I warmly commend my noble
friend and my noble and learned friend—the brace of Lord
Wallaces—for all they have done to make a very bad Bill
palatable. They have exercised infinite patience, great care and
unfailing courtesy, and we should all be extremely grateful for that.
But that does not absolve the Government from blame for bringing in a
Bill of this complexity in this way. I have said before, and will say
again for the final time on this Bill, that if ever a Bill cried out
for pre-legislative scrutiny it was this one. I sincerely hope that
that lesson has been learned and that in future complex Bills of this
nature, touching as they do on constitutional and parliamentary issues,
will have the benefit of pre-legislative scrutiny. We have had a series
of patch, make-do and mend amendments, many of them introduced by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Wallace, himself. I repeat: we are
grateful for that, but that is not a substitute for a carefully
drawn-up Bill that really meets a
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012183000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000032">My noble
friend Lord Horam touched on the complexity of the Bill. Legislation
should be readily understandable by those to whom it applies. When one

which the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, has been
involved never anticipated, they really should have the benefit of
consultation. We now have placed before us what is a bit of a
catch-all, Henry VIII clause. In principle I do not like Henry VIII
clauses, but I concede that in this particular Bill something like it
is probably
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012183000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000033">I

Commission directly. I suggest those involve leaders of the Opposition,
too, because this Bill is likely to last quite a long time. As it is

said, with typical modesty, that she had only a tiny knowledge, but she
has more knowledge than most of us present in the House put together on
the subject of Henry VIII clauses. I entirely endorse what she said. In
fact, I do not think this is a Henry VIII clause because of
its very limited impact. I think it is more, in terms of longevity,
like an Edward VI clause, as Henry VIII ruled for quite a long time
whereas Edward VI ruled for a relatively short time. It is more likely
that that is the more appropriate historical
analogy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T17:20:11"></hs_TimeCode>. As my

Amendment 17 inserts into the Bill a new clause that will allow the
sector to establish collective procurement arrangements. Under the new
clause, the Government will, by regulations, make provision for certain
authorities to have their auditor appointed by an “appointing
person” specified by the Secretary of State. This will allow the
Secretary of State to designate a sector-led body as an appointing
person, and give them the necessary powers and duties to act as a

Amendments 1 to 3, 13 and 33 would make minor changes to the definition
of a local auditor in the Bill. These minor amendments are necessary in
the light of the wider amendment to enable sector-led collective

Lady Hanham. I think we would agree, on all sides of the House, that

sometimes she might have agreed but might not have been able to say so.
Certainly she would always listen, and if a reasonable case was made
she would do her best to see

She<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T17:41:24"></hs_TimeCode> commented
that there was not huge interest in this Bill. She might not be aware
that perhaps that was in part because, at the start of this Bill, the
Secretary of State was reported to have said of this Bill, “It
is not as interesting as it sounds”. Those of us who have worked
on the Bill tirelessly through the summer would not necessarily echo
the reported comments of the Secretary of the

has been achieved. I reminded myself by looking back to our Second
Reading debate in this House back in the summer. Indeed, the issue of
joint procurement was raised at that stage. It received, I think it is
fair to say, a sympathetic response, and here we come to the last stage

amendments also bear the hallmark of the diligence of my honourable

the Secretary of State to appoint auditors to smaller authorities,
Clause 5(3)(d) is deleted by Amendment 7. These provisions are replaced

annual value of £85 million and will continue to run until 2017,
at which point we intend to introduce local or sector-led appointment
of auditors. Noble Lords will be aware, however, that the contacts
include provision to allow them to be extended for a further three
years to 2020. While it remains our intention to introduce local
appointment from 2017, no formal decision is needed on extension until
closer to the scheduled end of the contracts. At that point, this will

departments and delivery partners, my officials have agreed a set of
criteria against which all options should be assessed. They are now
working with counterparts in interested organisations and have shared a
set of requirements, roles and responsibilities alongside an invitation

should add some remarks on another topic which I was not sure whether
the noble Lord had raised in his question to me; if he did not I should
perhaps have covered it in my opening remarks. Grant certification is a
further critical issue raised in both Houses during the passage of the
Bill. When the commission closes, the few remaining grants requiring
certification will be certified through arrangements agreed between
grant-paying bodies, the recipients and their auditors. There is one
exception to these arrangements: the Audit Commission will continue to
make arrangements to certify the housing benefit subsidy scheme for the
2014-15 return, due to its complexity and size, before the move to
universal credit. However, work to complete this and oversee
auditors’ work in autumn 2015 will then need to be undertaken by
the designated transitional body. We are therefore drawing on the
commission’s expertise to ensure that appropriate measures are
put in place to support this work and also that Section 28 of the Audit
Commission Act is saved so the designated transitional body can take on
this

council, a parish meeting has only one elected member: its chairman.
However, all local government electors in the parish are entitled to
vote at a parish meeting and are therefore, arguably, members. Where
there is no separate parish council, the chairman and the proper
officer of the district are together known as the parish trustees, and
the parish trustees are the body corporate of the parish
meeting.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012183000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000100">The
principle we have used is that, where a function is of an
administrative nature—which is the case in the majority
of functions—it would be exercised by the chairman on behalf of
the parish meeting. For example, the chairman will be responsible for
ensuring that a local government elector may inspect the statement of
accounts. This rule is set out in Amendment 36. Where a function is of
a deliberative or decision-making nature, it would sit with the parish
meeting itself rather than be delegated to the chairman. For example,
the decision to appoint an auditor, and the consideration of a report
in the public interest, will sit with the parish meeting itself. These
exceptions to the general rule are set out in Amendments 16, 44, 45,
48, 53, 68 and 71.</hs_para>

20 would ensure that certain duties that would otherwise be placed on
members of the parish meeting are restricted to the chairman and the
proper officer of the district and are not placed on all local
government electors. These functions include supplying information and
attending meetings with the auditor. This approach is consistent with
the treatment 
<?notus-xml column=627?>of parish councils in the Bill, where the functions
are placed only on council members and do not extend to local
government electors.</hs_para>

would remove disproportionately onerous and costly burdens from the
chairman of a parish meeting. He will not be required to supply a copy
of a report in the public interest to all local government electors.
Local government electors will be able to access a report in the public
interest or a written recommendation under provisions made in Clause
24. Amendment 34 would insert a definition of “parish

that

expect that contracts between authorities and auditors will set out how
auditors’ costs are to be recovered. The Bill currently gives

further amendments enable auditors to recover reasonable costs for

advisory notice; and, thirdly, whether to apply for judicial review of
an authority’s decision.

question is: who audits the health and well-being boards? They have a

different bodies are spending money, and are therefore audited for that
role, but there is a broader question about how those boards steer
policy and make good decisions that reflect acknowledged best practice,
and achievements in other areas by other health and well-being boards.
I would like to think that an auditor has a clear role in identifying
whether value for money is being achieved by individual boards—I
suspect that this will become important over the next two to three
years, as the success of those boards is assessed—and whether,
indeed, the health service investment and the sum of money available to
local authorities are adequate for
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012183000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000147">To
this end, I suggest to my noble friend the Minister that one of the
National Audit Office’s thematic studies that are promised as
part of the Bill could look at the joining point between local
authorities and the health service, specifically in relation to adult
social care but more generally in terms of improving health, preventing
a decline in health and to reduce inequalities in health outcomes. I
think that there is a role for an auditor in that area. An auditor
would have to provide only an opinion on value for money if he or she
is not satisfied in respect of a specific matter. I think that the
issue goes a little further than this. I would like to think that some
strongly proactive work would be undertaken by the National Audit
Office and auditors who are looking at the role of health service

detailed explanation of the amendments in this group. Our discussion on

Lord Shipley. We have generally seen these amendments as tidying up and
consequential measures. We have issues around: the duty of auditors of
health bodies to prepare a report; the provision of sequencing of
electors’ rights concerning unlawful items of accounts; the
procedures for auditors to be able to recover costs when there is no
formal action they can take; copies of recommendations or public
interest reports of functional bodies of the GLA to be sent to the GLA;

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> I am very grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, for confirming that he is content with these amendments.
As regards the 
<?notus-xml column=632?>query of my noble friend Lord Shipley about the health and well-being
boards, the arrangements for reporting on the accounts and the value
for money conclusion, I shall give him what I have and, if I need to,
perhaps we can follow up the matter after the

Bill places auditors of both health and local government bodies under a
duty to satisfy themselves that the body has made proper arrangements
for securing economy, efficiency and effectiveness in its use of
resources, which is known as the value for money conclusion. Unlike
local government, the accounts of health bodies are consolidated within
their sponsor Whitehall department resource account. Local authorities,
on the other hand, are directly accountable to the local electorate in
a way that health service bodies are not. Because of the different
accountability arrangements for health service bodies, the Government
consider it necessary to put the requirement to have opinions on the
accounts in the Bill rather than in the code of audit practice, to
provide assurance to the accounting officer and Parliament that budgets
have been used for the purposes Parliament intended. We believe that it
is unnecessary to do this for non-health service bodies because of the
statutory power for local auditors to apply to the courts for a
declaration that an item of account is unlawful. Furthermore, for
non-health service bodies, we expect the code of audit practice will
set out what auditors must report against this duty, as is currently
the position under the code produced by the Audit Commission. Overall,
we consider that this allows for greater flexibility in reporting for
non-health service bodies, but for health bodies the different
parliamentary accounting framework includes a strict requirement for
regularity to be reported

have just been reminded that the health and well-being boards are not

have just been passed another note which I hope may be helpful because
I am not sure how much of what I have already read out is entirely
helpful to the noble Lord. The provisions in the Local Audit and
Accountability Bill on value for money inspections do not cover health
service bodies. I think we know that. The NAO’s existing powers
in relation to value for money inspections are wider than those in the
Bill, so the latter does not need to include provision on this in
relation to health service bodies. I think that is the killer point
that I have finally got to. On the basis of that additional
information, I beg to

Lords will be aware that these are new provisions. These amendments
insert a new clause into the Bill that would give greater rights to
report at local government meetings and to have access to documents. We
believe that this is an important extension to reflect greater

also to have an element of control over the information and the access

Amendment 26 gives the Secretary of State the power to make regulations
that would allow members of the public to report proceedings at public
meetings, allowing people to film, audio-record, tweet and blog at a
meeting of a local government body. This will allow those who are
unable to attend the meeting to follow the proceedings and, as I have
just said, perhaps promote discussion about proceedings thereafter. It
will also give the public access to documents of local government
bodies. These documents may, for instance, include records of decisions
taken by officers acting under delegated powers; the reasons for the
decisions, details of any alternative options considered and rejected,
and any other documents connected with the decisions to which they

regulations may set out possible conditions to be met before such

circumstances where activities such as filming or audio recording might
not be permitted. The Government intend to work with partners such as
the Local Government Association and the National Association of Local

approach to refuse the public access. We are aware of some recent
examples of councils ejecting members of the public from meetings for

access should create additional burdens. However, I am aware that some
may be concerned about the possible disruption that filming in council
meetings might cause. Therefore, we will consider possible steps that
have to be taken by people attending 
<?notus-xml column=636?>the meeting for the purpose of reporting the

in a digital age where technology has significantly evolved and we need

this in mind, we must widely embrace the use of modern communication

better understanding of their local decision-making process and, as I

the amendments: I certainly do. I must confess that my first response
when I read about this was a little surprise that they were considered
necessary. I am sure the vast majority of authorities of all
persuasions are already doing this. It may well be that, in some cases,
their standing orders have not been brought up to date, but I am sure
that most are doing it very willingly. However, I then reflected on my
early days as a councillor, quite a long time ago, when all council and
committee meetings were open to the public, as required—if I
remember rightly—by a Private Member’s Bill introduced by
the then new and young honourable Member for Finchley, Mrs Thatcher.
The one committee not open to the public was what was then called the
planning committee; it would now probably be the development control
committee. This was, arguably, the committee of greatest interest to
members of the public but it was the one to which they were not allowed
access.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012183000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012183000136">Those
days are, fortunately, long gone but it reminded me that we need to
ensure we keep up to date with the times. I am sure all noble Lords
welcome the good intentions of these amendments. The key will be in the
drafting of the regulations. I am not sure why any local authority or
council would wish to stop someone tweeting during a meeting or, if
they did, how they could implement it without the most draconian
measures. That is well and good, but the difficult part will be making
regulations that require the greatest openness but do not allow the

local authority experience that there are some people whom everyone
agrees are simply a nuisance. It will be quite tricky to balance the
regulations to ensure that the person—it is usually an
individual rather than a collection—has a right to be a nuisance
and be irritating but does not disrupt the good order and procedure of
the meeting. I imagine that the decision will be in the hands of
whoever is chairing the meeting. They have the right now to have
disruptive people ejected, as happens occasionally, and this will, no
doubt, still be the case. However it will be quite difficult to draw

Lord Tope, has just said. I have a mental image of the small parish or

more functions and finding itself in the centre of some awfully
controversial measure. The premises might, quite literally, be crowded
out by people with cameras or wanting to record: the sort of thing one
sees on television outside the courts of justice when a person of
fame—or infamy, as the case may be—has received a
decision. The scrum that goes on out there is the sort of thing that
slightly worries me, particularly, for the reasons given by the noble

Minister for an answer at this juncture, but could she bear in mind
that uniformity of regulations across the whole of local government
might be difficult to achieve, for the reasons given by the noble Lord,
Lord Tope? There is also a question of how open-ended this public right
is. There will clearly be instances—I am sure we have all
witnessed meetings of this sort—where it can be thoroughly
disruptive and an impediment to the sober and conscientious
consideration of matters on the agenda. Perhaps there must be some
limitations. Like the noble Lord, Lord Tope, I look forward to seeing
the draft regulations in due course. I appreciate what the Minister has
said about the process for that: would she perhaps clarify the
timescale for it? That would be very helpful, particularly for parish
and town councils, a bigger proportion of which may be affected by this
measure than principal authorities which, in many cases, already have

the Minister pointed out, that they include the potential for
safeguards. I presume that these will, as she has implied, be
negotiated, or at least discussed, with the Local Government 
<?notus-xml column=638?>Association so as to avoid conduct which might
disrupt meetings and to provide clarity about what happens when, for
legitimate reasons, the press and public may be excluded. Examples
might be if there are matters of commercial confidentiality or
confidential personal details to be discussed in certain areas. I might
like to suggest, though it may not reach into regulations, that selfies

would also be helpful if, alongside any regulations, the Government
gave some information, in guidelines or otherwise, about the risks that
may be attendant on people filming, tweeting or otherwise relaying
actual events. Although one hopes it would not happen, what is said in
council may sometimes stray into the area of defamation and those
relaying matters of that sort could find themselves in a difficult
situation. Some guidance about the need to be careful would help those
who might otherwise run into difficulties. It is not likely to arise in
a large number of cases but it is conceivable it might happen.
Broadcasting authorities and so on are very alert to that danger. In
Parliament it is privilege but that does not apply to local

embodied in these amendments, which will eventually be subject to
guidelines, might not be extended to some other public bodies. For
example, the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, referred to health and
well-being boards. It is true that they are technically part of local
authorities, but health is generally a matter that clearly engages the
interest of a community. Many bodies such as clinical commissioning
groups, health trusts and so on are open to the public. A similar
regime might be useful there, and perhaps the noble Baroness can take
back to ministerial colleagues the thought that this
principle—after it has run for a period and people can see how
it works—may usefully be
extended<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T18:30:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government’s general position on this issue. They talk about
democracy when, at the same time, they are not only imposing a council
tax cap on local authorities which can be exceeded only if there is a
referendum, they are also intending to impose a lower cap than would
otherwise be the case because some authorities have levied just under
the prescribed level for a referendum. The Government seem to be taking
an absurd position. Indeed, at least part of the coalition appears
increasingly to favour referendums over elections. In this House we
will be debating at some length the proposals regarding European
referendums. This process was started by Louis Napoleon in the 19th
century and has since been extended to various other unsatisfactory

proposals are regarded as potentially helping to revive interest in the
established local democratic process. That is necessary given—as
many of us have remarked during the debates on the Bill—the

case. If that lack of coverage means that people are unable to read
such coverage in their local paper or see it on the local

will take advantage of that opportunity as it can only be for the good

the precedent is there in other kinds of public meetings, it is only
right to extend such provisions. For example, I am told that Tower

Keighley Town Council blocked some residents from filming as it would
have amounted to a breach of standing orders. Stamford Town Council
placed a ban on journalists tweeting from meetings due to the risk that

Shipley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, could I make a brief point about
Amendment 27 and the group as a whole? It relates to the issue of
principle, which it is important that we restate. I do not like
centrally imposed targets for increases in local taxation. The reason
is simply this: there is a principle that localism means local
decision-making, and those who are elected at local elections should
make those decisions. We have various definitions now of what is seen
to be relevant expenditure. Is it spending power? If you compare
spending power to the amount of government grant, or to the amount of
money paid on average by council tax payers or at band D by council tax
payers, you get very different sums. In the end, we are reliant on the
ballot box in each council area to decide who represents a ward, who
then come together and make decisions about how that council is to be
run. In my view, that includes the level of council tax.</hs_para>

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment takes us back
to the thorny issue of council tax at referendums. We have just heard
from the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, about his opposition to centrally
imposed targets; he has been very consistent on that issue. The
fundamental policy change provided for in the Bill is 
<?notus-xml column=642?>the inclusion of the definition of a relevant amount
of council tax—certain levies. Previously, any increase in
council tax resulting from an increase in levies could not have caused
a determination that the level of council tax was excessive, and would
not have triggered a referendum requirement.</hs_para>

Lordships’ House and in the other place highlighted a number of
concerns, namely that the referendum regime places the burden on major
preceptors and billing authorities who have no direct ability to
influence the amount of the levy or to cause a levy body to reduce its
levy; that factoring in 2013-14 council tax increases into referendum
criteria introduces an element of retrospection potentially penalising
authorities for decisions made before the Bill was introduced; and that
it would undermine certain infrastructure projects that relied on an
increase in levy stream and that were negotiated as part of a city

concerns have not been met, either in the other place or by the
amendments before us today. As we have heard, the amendments provide an
alternative route to the council tax at referendums coming into force,
as originally envisaged on Royal Assent, or by order. Which route is
taken depends upon whether or not Royal Assent is received by 5
February; that is the date by which the referendum principles should be
put to Parliament for approval. We hear from the Minister that it is
quite likely that Royal Assent will be received by that date; I doubt
whether anything this evening will disrupt that judgment. Should Royal
Assent be received after that date, the referendum provisions will
operate from 2015, rather than April 2014. However, even if they do so,
that does not help with the concerns over retrospection. The amendments
make clear that the Secretary of State can determine categories of
authority for that year based on whether their increases in either the
year beginning 1 April 2013 or 1 April 2014 or both were deemed
excessive on the new principles. Frankly, this does not leave a very

done for 2013-14 when he gave low-spending authorities the ability to
set a £5 council tax increase, even if that meant a percentage
rise above 2%. This provision simply makes it clear that he can take

clear before council tax and levies were set for 2013-14 that they
might take account of council tax decisions in setting future
principles. No change will be made to the money raised in 2013-14 and
both authorities and levying bodies can plan for 2014 accordingly.
Local tax payers deserve fair and equal treatment no matter where in
England they live. There must be measures to protect taxpayers from
excessive increases brought in through the back door by a small number
of authorities without seeking local
agreement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012188000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000031">I
clearly hear the arguments that have been put forward today but I am
afraid that we beg to differ. The clause and the principle of including
levies in the calculation of what constitutes an excessive council tax
increase has now been debated at length in both Houses and approved.
The principle and practicalities of holding council tax referendums
were agreed in 2011 via the Localism Act. The amendments before us do
not alter them. They were proposed to ensure that local authorities
were not disadvantaged by any delays in the Bill becoming law. As I
said, the referendum principles will be announced in due course, but we
believe that authorities should not wait for them to be published. They
should look to freeze council tax levels next year and we have made
funds available to support them in doing so. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14012188000375" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000375">Motion

These amendments would modernise the arrangements that govern parish
polls. I am grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, for bringing the
much-needed modernisation of parish polls to the House’s
attention when the Bill was last in this place. I understand, although
I was not here at the time, that he had widespread support from other
noble Lords. I am also grateful to the Members of the other place who
consented to widen the scope of the Bill to allow the addition of these
amendments.</hs_para>

Amendment 30 gives the Secretary of State power to make regulations
regarding parish polls. The clause specifies that regulations
may cover arrangements for the conduct of a poll; the subject matter on
which a poll may be held; and the circumstances in which a poll may or
must be taken. So, in line with the noble Earl’s proposed
amendment, this amendment will enable regulations that more tightly
define what constitutes a legitimate topic for a poll and
which raise the trigger threshold. On top of this, we
will also modernise the voting arrangements to increase
participation in polls by, for example, extending voting hours and
allowing postal voting. Amendment 103 simply updates the Bill’s
Long Title to reflect the inclusion of the new
clause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012188000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000034">We are
taking this action because we believe that parish polls are an
important democratic tool that allows a parish council to get a clear
indication of local opinion about a local matter. We want to protect
that. However, as the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, outlined to the House
last year, the current rules that govern the trigger and subject matter
allow for individuals to abuse them by holding polls unrelated to the
local area, at substantial cost to local tax payers. This has led to
some individuals vexatiously pursuing particular agendas, with large
financial consequences for parish councils. What is more, the present
rules can also 
<?notus-xml column=645?>operate as barriers to participation, particularly
as voting can take place only between the hours of 4 pm and 9 pm and
there are no provisions for postal or proxy votes.</hs_para>

make this important democratic process fit for purpose in the modern
world. They will ensure that parish polls enable local communities to
have a voice on issues that directly relate to parish matters. They
will increase participation by updating the archaic arrangements for
the conduct of a poll and guard against vexatious misuse. We will
consult widely on the content of the regulations, which will be subject
to the negative procedure. It is our aim to launch a scoping exercise
in the spring, followed by a formal consultation process. We hope to
work closely with the noble Earl and sector-led bodies, such as the
National Association of Local Councils, in that work. I beg to

very much welcome this. In doing so, as I expressed when this was
before us previously, I thank other noble Lords who supported this; the
noble Baroness’s predecessor, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham,

50, 51 and 52 together specify which existing professional
qualifications will be considered as appropriate qualifications for
local audit in the new framework. This will ensure that individuals
qualified under the Audit Commission Act 1998 will continue to be able
to undertake local audit in the new regime. We had previously intended
to set this out in regulations. However, to provide clarity and
certainty, it will be helpful to put it in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012188000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000044">Amendment
56 further modifies Schedule 10 to the Companies Act 2006, as applied
by Schedule 5 to this Bill, in respect of individual auditors qualified
in other EEA countries. It has two main effects in respect of these
individuals. First, it will enable the recognised supervisory bodies
for local audit to recognise the qualifications of those individual
auditors who hold the equivalent of a UK local audit qualification
obtained elsewhere in the European Economic Area. Secondly, it
specifies that recognised supervisory bodies can require an EEA
individual statutory auditor to pass an aptitude test only if he or she
is seeking to establish in the UK on a permanent basis as a local
auditor. These changes are necessary to comply with the requirements of
directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications.
Paragraph 6 of Schedule 10 to the Companies Act 2006 sets out that one
of the requirements for a firm to be eligible for appointment as a
local auditor is that it is controlled by qualified persons. Amendment
56 ensures that a firm is qualified if it is eligible for appointment
as a local or statutory auditor, or is eligible for a corresponding
appointment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012188000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000045">With

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
explanation of this quite large group of amendments. I believe they
cover quite minor and technical matters. Generally, we have no issues
to raise on them. When I was first going through the amendments, I did
wonder about Amendments 51 and 52, which replace the power of the
Secretary of State to make regulations with provisions in the Bill. As
the noble Earl explained, this is to do with which existing
qualifications will be recognised. It is unusual for Governments to
take something from regulations and put it in a Bill, but I understand

boards which are partly in England and partly in Wales from the local
audit provisions in the Bill. There are two such internal drainage
boards: Powysland and Lower Wye. Both are mainly in Wales but currently
fall under the Audit Commission regime. Last November, the Welsh
Government announced their intention to transfer the functions of the
two cross-border IDBs, along with the functions of one IDB that is
wholly in Wales, to Natural Resources Wales, and to bring them under
the Welsh audit system. The Welsh Government subsequently supported
a  
<?notus-xml column=649?>legislative consent Motion to make audit
arrangements for these two bodies under this Bill as a stopgap measure
until the new governance arrangements are in place. However, the
legislative consent Motion was not passed by the National Assembly for
Wales. In line with the devolution settlement, the amendment therefore
removes these two bodies from Schedule 2. Schedule 2 lists the relevant
authorities that would fall under the new audit

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments extend the
potential purposes for which a data-matching exercise can be carried
out by the National Fraud Initiative and make minor clarifications and
updates to the data-matching provisions in Schedule 9.
Following the helpful amendments of the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, when
the Bill was last in this House concerning data-matching exercises, the
Government introduced Amendment 76. This amendment would add the
prevention and detection of errors and inaccuracies as further
potential purposes for which a data-matching exercise can be carried
out by the National Fraud
Initiative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012188000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000057">The
amendment would allow the National Fraud Initiative to undertake the ad
hoc data-matching exercises that it does at present through the Audit
Commission’s wider powers once it moves over to the Cabinet

allow the possible extension of the National Fraud Initiative’s
potential data-matching powers to include: the prevention and detection
of crime other than fraud; assisting in the apprehension and
prosecution of offenders; assisting in the recovery of debt owing to
public bodies; and the prevention and detection of inaccuracy and
error, which is the subject of this amendment.</hs_para>

McKenzie, proposed an alternative amendment relating to the
prevention  and detection of maladministration and error when
the Bill was previously here in Committee, which  we undertook
to consider. However, although we felt that a good case had been made
for the inclusion of “error”, we concluded that there was
insufficient evidence as to how the investigation of maladministration
over and above error might be used. Furthermore,
“maladministration” has a strong association with the
work of the Local Government Ombudsman. We were concerned that its use
here might raise the potential for conflicting roles and
responsibilities. We therefore considered that the term “error
and inaccuracies” was both more appropriate and indeed wider
than the amendment proposed originally. We hope that the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, concurs with that, and I thank him for bringing forward
the original proposal that has led to this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012188000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000059">Before

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for her
explanation of these amendments and her kind remarks. As has been
noted, we had an extensive debate around data matching when the Bill
was originally before us, prompted in particular by concerns that data
matching undertaken by the Audit Commission under its audit powers
would be lost with 
<?notus-xml column=654?>the demise of the Audit Commission. These powers
were not covered by data-matching powers exercisable for the prevention
and detection of fraud. Nor were they included in the list of items
which, after due process, could be added to those powers. We pressed
the case to add data matching for the purpose of detection of
maladministration and error to the list of those powers which could be
introduced. As the Minister has explained, we highlighted information
provided by the Audit Commission as to how its powers had been used to
identify problems with GP lists, for example, which would be lost
without an amendment to the data-matching provisions. The Minister
handling the amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Wallace of Saltaire, who
coincidentally had Lords responsibility for Cabinet Office matters,
rightly stressed the need for sensitivity around data matching but said
that the Government would reflect. The point we pressed was that we
were not seeking an extension of data-matching powers, leading to
preservation of those that would be lost with the Audit Commission. We
are delighted to note that the Government have responded positively on
these matters and proposed the addition
of,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012188000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0002.htm#14012188000309">“prevention

Minister will be aware of the amendment that we and colleagues in the
Commons pressed about the prevention and detection of maladministration
and error. As we have heard, there was some debate around excluding
maladministration from the amendment, but the main thrust of the
Government’s position was the overlap with the
ombudsman’s responsibilities to look at this. I do not propose
to rerun the arguments advanced by Andy Sawford about the omission of
maladministration being a lost opportunity. However, we understand that
the Audit Commission has confirmed that the Government’s
amendment would enable the NFI to carry on the data matching it
conducts through other powers—I think the Minister has actually
confirmed that. This was our key starting point, so although we are a
tad disappointed at the omission of maladministration, we are grateful
that the Government have responded to our arguments and will not press
the matter further today. Can the Minister say when it is planned to
take the steps, including the necessary consultation, to add these
purposes to the NFI’s powers to data match? We accept that
Amendments 74 and 75 maintain the status quo in relation to the
cross-boundary work of the NFI and we have no points to raise on that.

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, for his very gracious welcome to this amendment,
which, as I said before, stems from an amendment that he originally
proposed. I will just confirm to the noble Lord, and indeed your
Lordships’ House, that we are in discussions with the
Cabinet Office regarding the future operation of the National Fraud
Initiative and the commencement 
<?notus-xml column=655?>of the relevant parts of the Bill that are required to ensure the safe
continuation of the commission’s data-matching exercises. This
is something that is very important and I can confirm that this will
continue when the National Fraud Initiative moves to sit with the
Cabinet Office. The enactment of the further purpose which we have been
discussing tonight is not required to support the transition of the
National Fraud Initiative but, as we have identified through the course
of the Bill, it is a useful addition to the potential powers for which
exercises can be undertaken. It will allow the national fraud
initiative to undertake the ad hoc data-matching exercises that it does
at present under the Audit Commission’s wider powers once it
moves over to the Cabinet Office in 2015. The addition of this
potential extension also fits well with the Cabinet Office’s
overarching remit, covering fraud, error and
debt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012188000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-0003.htm#14012188000064">As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T19:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>

the Cabinet Office determine that it intends to bring them forward.
However, I hope that I have been able, through the introduction of this
amendment, to give the noble Lord the reassurance that the extension of
these powers will be possible at such time that the Government decide

noble Lords taking part in this debate today and for this timely
opportunity to draw to your attention some important developments in UK
general aviation. GA involves far more aircraft and perhaps twice as
many flights per annum as does commercial air transport. These are
small aircraft in the main but there are significant gains in terms of
economic and social benefit. If we effectively encourage the GA
community there could be far more gains. An appropriate regulatory
environment is fundamental to
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000004">Last
year, a particularly successful effort was made in the aviation red
tape challenge, the RTC. For reinvigorating and driving through this
endeavour, I offer my thanks and congratulations to the work of my
right honourable friend the Minister without Portfolio, Grant Shapps,

am a private pilot and have fully declared my interests in aviation.
The General Aviation Alliance, of which I am vice-president, is an
important grouping of GA voluntary organisations. It represents,
particularly, sports recreation aviation, which includes parachuting,
hang-gliding, gliding, ballooning, plus sports and recreation flying in
light and microlight aircraft and helicopters. The GA Alliance
represents some 72,000 members, including the operators of around 60%
of the UK’s registered aircraft fleet, and perhaps 70% of the
total fleet.</hs_para>

GA<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:32:14"></hs_TimeCode> Alliance
engages with the Government, the CAA and other bodies on regulatory
matters concerning aviation. Last year there was a strong response to
the aviation RTC, identifying many instances of unnecessary
restrictions of gold-plated regulations. The CAA, as the UK’s
national aviation regulator, had the task of processing this input. To
give it credit, its response was generally strong and well considered.
It consisted of a document entitled <I>CAP 1123</I>, describing a
strategy for improvement. One key change is the setting up of a GA unit
within the CAA, recognising the interests of that community and how
different it is from the airline focus. I welcome this
unit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:32:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The GA
Alliance now looks forward to an early dialogue and consultation on the
promised full reform programme for the sports and recreation
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:33:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

response highlights two guiding principles within a more proportionate,
risk-based regulatory regime. I welcome these principles and urge the
CAA to hold firmly to them, although I wish to highlight the need to
fully evaluate the consequences in consultations with
stakeholders.</hs_para>

CAA’s first principle is to deregulate wherever possible. This
contains three aspirations which I strongly support. First, the removal
of CAA oversight rule making in areas where the UK has no specific EU
obligation. Secondly, identification of areas that could be removed
from EASA oversight, primarily those that are nationally based and
where previous self-regulation regimes had good safety
records—for example, gliding and
ballooning<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:34:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
Finally, the CAA wishes to take an evidence and risk-based approach
proportionate to the risk appetite of participants. An informed consent
concept will move the onus on to participants to demonstrate their
awareness of the risks involved in GA activities.

necessarily retain overall accountability but responsibility for
delivery of regulation would be delegated to so-called qualified
entities. These might be commercial or they could indeed be the
existing GA associations. For example, the Light Aircraft
Association—the LAA—of which I am a director, as is my
noble friend Lord Goschen, holds an approval to regulate the
airworthiness of several thousand aircraft on behalf of the CAA.
Interestingly, the CAA charges this association for the privilege of
carrying out this work.</hs_parafo>

delegation possibilities considered across the entire sports and
recreation sector, ranging from CAA oversight through delegated
accountability to full delegation where a competent body is available.
The GAA’s member associations are mature national bodies with
effective governance, run on behalf of their members. They are not
commercial organisations and will be concerned by the entry of
commercial qualified entries into their sector. Such competitive
positioning would inevitably seek to cherry pick the best business
opportunities while leaving the less lucrative activities to the
associations. This would not promote the social or economic benefits
that I referred to. In a worst case scenario, capable voluntary
organisations might be damaged to the point of liquidation.</hs_para>

two principles at some length but <I>CAP 1123</I> also identifies other
general areas raised by the RTC. I found the general tone of the CAA
and the Department for Transport helpful and flexible, but I also noted
how responses sometimes only reiterate the current approach. In two key
areas, further change is needed. First, CAA fees and charges are
annually brought before its influential Finance Advisory Committee,
which has long been dominated by commercial interests. <I>CAP 1123</I>
merely reiterates this status quo without an apparent intent to promote

<?notus-xml column=321?>fair stakeholder representation. Better pre-discussion with GA and a
wider consideration of CAA costs and their proportionate allocation are
essential.</hs_para>

mention airspace, the allocation of which is a key CAA function. The
ever expanding UK controlled airspace is a major concern because it
increasingly excludes light aircraft from large areas of our country.
Sadly, there is not the time today to discuss the details of this
complex
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000013">Finally,
I should mention implementation. The CAA’s response is strong on
announcement and intent but, for real success, it also needs
outstanding implementation, including consultation with stakeholders.
Currently there is a mechanism—the challenge
panel—involving GA experts selected to help the Department for
Transport and the CAA to move forward. Timescales for this process are
short, and I am concerned that it may run out of time before enough has
been
achieved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000014">All
parties need clarity on the likely “steady state” shape
of regulation in 12 to 18 months’ time. This is essential, as
much work will be required from organisations using volunteer
resources. Partnership mechanisms must now be established to achieve
effective and sustainable change. A dynamic and expanding GA sector can
nurture new opportunities and jobs across the country, from a
reinvigorated flight training industry, through aircraft manufacturing,
to the many professions and industries needed to support thousands of
light aircraft.</hs_para>

is an old saying in aviation that there are old pilots and bold pilots,
but not many old, bold pilots, so I consider myself very lucky and
fortunate to be able to take part in this debate today. My noble friend
Lord Rotherwick will certainly remember that in the late 1990s we were
both part of an Air Squadron wing which took about 12 light aircraft
across Europe to the north-east border of Pakistan and back again.
Flying over the Himalayas and through the mountain passes was a
wonderful experience, not without a few hairy moments, but we all got
back safely. The only reason I dare to mention this to your Lordships

aviation is worth about £1.4 billion to the UK economy and
supports around 50,000 jobs. As a result of the red tape challenge
which the Government have initiated, a number of areas have been
identified where existing regulations are unduly onerous, as my noble
friend has stated. This problem is being addressed with vigour and
commitment. I shall quote from a press release, which is slightly old
now as it is from 6 November 2013. The chair of the CAA Dame
Deirdre Hutton said:</hs_para>

absolutely committed to improving the way we regulate GA. We have made
a start, for instance deregulating in some areas and delegating
responsibilities in others. But there is much more we can do. The new,
dedicated GA Unit is a formal recognition that GA needs a different and
less onerous regulatory regime to commercial air transport. It will
ensure we understand better the impact of our regulation on the sector,
that we are as transparent and efficient as possible in how we go about
it, and that we identify opportunities to reduce burdens and costs

shall close with one thought. Flying has its own challenges. To
deregulate too much would certainly be a mistake. I am really thinking
in terms of pilots who have medicals. I am now at the age where I have
to have a medical every year. The regulation that I go through and the
tests that I am required to undergo, including an ECG every year, are
the kinds of things that should not be foregone in the stampede to

Goschen (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble
friend Lord Rotherwick on bringing forward this short debate today.
There cannot be anyone better qualified in Parliament to discuss the
concerns of general aviation. It may not be broadly known that not only
is my noble friend a pilot, a board member of the LAA and a
vice-president of the General Aviation Alliance but he also builds
aeroplanes with his bare hands and then flies them to the ends of the
earth. This is adventurous stuff, and we are very lucky to have his
wise counsel and guidance this afternoon.</hs_para>

short declaration. I have a UK private pilot’s licence and I
operate a vintage aircraft that comes under the Light Aircraft
Association permit to fly regime. About a hundred years ago, I had some
responsibility for aviation policy in the UK, and I am very pleased to
see that considerable progress has been made on the issues that we were
grappling with in the mid-1990s.</hs_para>

privilege to be able to fly in the UK and internationally. We talk of
the privileges of our licence, and I think that the general aviation
community is always aware of that fact. It is a very law-abiding
community. The initiative that we have been talking about this
afternoon is really about aligning regulation with the safety-critical
issues that the GA faces and making sure that there is a proper
match.</hs_para>

has been
criticised<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:49:59"></hs_TimeCode> in
the past by the GA community for taking perhaps a too heavy-handed and
too costly approach to issues such as airfield regulation. However, the
initiative that we are discussing today represents a profound change in
approach. While we recognise that the detail of general aviation is of
interest to some noble Lords, a real success story in terms of a
deregulation initiative—a partnership between the industry,
participants, the Department for Transport, the CAA and other areas of
government—is really to be highly
commended<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:50:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:50:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000027">All<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:51:05"></hs_TimeCode>
those who have participated and who take an interest in this sphere
will feel that real progress has been made, and this is a good news
story. We can always guarantee that it will get very little promotion
and broader discussion because it is a good news story rather than a
bad news story. But the Government say that they are committed to
deregulation—Governments have said that for a long
time—and will actually bring forward sensible, carefully and
clearly thought through proposals that demonstrate that, and they are
to be commended. Mr Haines at the CAA is to be commended, too, and the
LAA itself, which is a major player in this environment, also needs to
take some of the
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:51:18"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are lessons to be learnt more broadly, way outside of aviation, for

well. It must be sensible in a detailed technical environment such as
this to use regulation when it is really required but in other cases
pursue the guiding principles that have been established. Principle one
is to deregulate wherever

the final analysis, this is an ongoing process. It is not a one-off
deregulation report saying, “Let’s get on with

prompt it to continue and keep the pressure on, examining everything
that comes forward. There is a significant European aspect to this with

Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to noble
Lords for allowing me to speak briefly in the gap. I am not a pilot,
but I was interested to hear three pilots speaking about their
experiences. I remember when the noble Viscount was a Minister for air
and shipping. He reported to the House one day that he had flown over a
tanker that had hit a rock in  
<?notus-xml column=325?>Milford Haven and had saved the day by finding a Chinese takeaway cook
who could translate between English, which everyone was using, and
Chinese for the tug outside. I did not know that he was flying his own
plane. That is terribly impressive.</hs_para>

that I go to the Isles of Scilly quite often. In the winter, the only
transport is a small plane that usually goes from St Mary’s to a
grass runway at Land’s End, except when it is waterlogged, which
it has been for the past month. Costs are high—£70 to
£80 for a single fare—so it difficult for people who live
on the islands, and I am grateful to the Minister for agreeing to have
a meeting later this week with some representatives where I hope we can
discuss this. I have tabled a few Questions on this. I was very pleased
to hear that Bristows will do the medevac service—evacuation to
the mainland of people who need urgent medical treatment—after
the RAF hands over emergency rescue. That is really good news,
and I am grateful for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000037">Less
good is the problem of taking blood samples to the mainland. I asked a
Question more than a year ago about whether the Government would
facilitate granting a licence for Skybus to carry these samples to the
mainland for testing. The answer came back that they would when an
application was received, which was fair. A year later, it has still
not happened, so I tabled a Question asking whether an application had
been received and, if so, what was the answer. I am not looking for an
answer from the Minister today. My question is more fundamental: why do
you need a licence at all to carry blood samples between the Isles of
Scilly and the mainland, or anywhere else, for testing in a hospital?
Why does doing so need a licence? They are not going to blow up or
anything. You can put them in a sealed bag and they would be quite
happy, but there we
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000038">Finally,
I went to the Scillies just before the new year; I had a bit of a
difficult journey, so I did a blog on it which produced quite a few
responses, including one from the chairman of the Isles of Scilly
Steamship Company that runs the service inviting me to meet him, which
I did. We did not necessarily agree on customer service, but what he
told me about costs was very interesting. He said that a third of the
cost of the short, very frequent service, which does not make a big
profit, went towards regulation, a third fuel and a third airport
charges. That probably justifies the charges, but do they have to be so
high? A third of the cost being regulatory seems an awful lot. As for
airport charges, Newquay is renowned for having high charges because it
likes to call itself an international airport, so it has to cope with
the odd international flight with enormous numbers of staff, I believe,
for security.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012187000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000039">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T15:45:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that the Government and the CAA can look at the total charges
because if that is correct—and I have no reason to suppose that
it is not—an £80 single fare to get home to the Scillies
if you live there or to go to the hospital or visit friends seems a bit
high, and that is the only way you can get there in winter. If the
regulatory cost could come down a little, it would be a great
help.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_21_PT_1/6742A3DDBEA86397E75159D747591D44F79E7B00" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 January 2014">Tuesday,

noble Lords who have spoken in this debate and to the noble Lord, Lord
Rotherwick, for introducing it in his usual considered terms. He
indicated the scale of general aviation and the number of flights; it
is an important part of the sporting and recreational interests of the

noble Lord mentioned the Minister without Portfolio, Grant Shapps. I
feel that his ministerial position should be extended slightly and I
will describe the necessity for that in my remaining remarks. The noble
Lord told us how much the right honourable gentleman had backed the
changes to the legislation that were being effected and how, not
surprisingly as a Minister, he was very much in favour of them. He
does, however, fly from a private airfield near to where I live and
where he is in some dispute with the local authority about prospective
planning permission with regard to buildings on the airfield. That
issue is unresolved—it is due to be resolved in due
course—and I do not mind the Minister commenting on it as long
as he declares an interest. I wish he had declared an interest that he
is a flier from a private airfield. It matters even more when I can
attest to the fact that it is his aircraft that causes me to miss my
putt on the sixth hole of the local golf course on some weekend
mornings. So Grant Shapps and I have a little in common on these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:01:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000042">The
noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, made the case for the reduction of
regulations to the minimum, but the minimum consistent with safety. The
noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, mentioned medical tests. It is obviously a
great danger if people fly when they are not fit enough to do so. It is
dangerous enough if they drive cars on the highway when unfit to do so,
but when flying an aircraft it is infinitely more serious. I hope the
Minister can reassure us that all the necessary medical requirements
are met<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:01:58"></hs_TimeCode>,
particularly against the background where medicine changes in its
perspective. I remember being lobbied a few years by a group which was
seeking to bring to the Government’s attention the illness of
apnoea and the problem of people falling asleep while in control of a
motor vehicle—not through excessive activity or a shortage of
sleep the night before, but through the development of an illness. That
has to be taken seriously in regard to motoring and I hope it is taken
equally seriously in regard to
aircraft<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000043">There
has in recent weeks been great concern about people who, even though
they are qualified to drive and feel they are inherently safe drivers,
have what is vulgarly called “the jumps”, where they
suddenly realise they had lost a moment of concentration and then
recovered it. We do not know how many accidents are caused by such a
phenomenon, but certainly there are enough for us to be acutely aware
of it. We must make sure that we keep a close watch on the development
of illnesses of this kind and on the general level of fitness to
drive—and whatever applies to fitness to drive must surely apply
to fitness to

point I particularly wanted to pick up on was touched upon by the noble
Lord, Lord Bradshaw, but almost in passing. It concerns the
relationship 
<?notus-xml column=327?>between civil aviation and the Home Office and the control of our
borders and space. I am much more concerned than the noble Lord, Lord
Bradshaw, who seemed to indicate that the Home Office and border agency
were not too oppressive in their dealings with such flights. Far from
being oppressive, from this side of the House it looks as though the
border agency has no idea of what is going on with regard to flights.
As we all know, there is a large number of aircraft in this
sector—the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, referred to
this—and a plethora of airfields, at least 520, where aircraft
can be landed, but the border agency tells us that it has no idea what
is happening with regard to these airports. What is going on? If there
is concern about the security of our borders—and my goodness me,
the Government have drawn attention to this in recent months with
increased anxiety—to have a sector which the border agency says
is completely unchecked and in which there is no question of it knowing
the number of flights or passengers, who lands and who lands where, is
an extraordinary position as far as our overall security is concerned
when we are all conscious of the fact that we need to protect ourselves
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000045">It
may be said that these regulations have nothing to do with it. If it is
not these regulations, will the Minister explain which regulations are
being used to tighten up this position? There could certainly be
anxieties about the way in which general aviation flights contribute to
the problem. We expect the Government to know about the nature of these
flights, who is on them and who comes into the country. Otherwise all
the checks which are continually drummed up for our ports, at huge
inconvenience to passengers going through security who have to wait for
hours on occasion, can be completely disregarded by anybody who can get
in a private aircraft and arrive at a private airfield. This is
something that needs attention. Although the Minister may be sorely
tempted to say that regulations do not address the security issue, I do
not think we can have a debate about general aviation without her
addressing this
position.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_21_PT_1/F8CE2C59878757196A2358021CEAF72C6E0A39F6" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 January 2014">Tuesday,

today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000047">Noble
Lords may be surprised by the number of activities covered by the
general aviation industry, including maintenance and pilot training,
gliding and ballooning, as well as the operation of small aircraft for
leisure or business purposes. The sector covers a wide spectrum of
aircraft types and activities, ranging from paragliders and microlights
to business jets. There  
<?notus-xml column=328?>are around 20,000 civilian aircraft registered in the UK, of which 95%
are engaged in what can be described as general aviation
activities.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012187000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000048">The value of the GA
sector and its contribution to the UK economy should not be
underestimated. The 2006 strategic review of general aviation, carried
out by the CAA, estimated the UK’s GA industry to be worth
approximately £1.4 billion in 2005. This highlights the
important economic contribution which is made by the GA sector. The
sector currently supports around 50,000 jobs in the UK and has a strong
track record of providing high value-added employment opportunities
across a range of areas and supply chains.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012187000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000049">I am sure that noble
Lords are aware of the Government’s deregulatory red tape
challenge because it has been so well addressed in this debate. In
2012, all existing aviation regulations were scrutinised, but at the
start of 2013, the Minister without Portfolio, Grant Shapps, proposed
that a further red tape challenge should be undertaken, specific to GA
issues. I am sure that Grant Shapps and Andrew Haines will appreciate
the warm comments by the noble Lord, Lord Rotherwick, on what they have
achieved, which were echoed by the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, the
noble Viscount, Lord Goschen, and the noble Lord, Lord
Bradshaw.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012187000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000050">In
this context, I assure the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, and the noble
Viscount, Lord Goschen, who raised the issue, that the red tape
challenge is being handled in a most judicious way. The concern that
they raised about medicals is an area that will certainly be reviewed
by the GA panel to see whether there are more proportionate ways of
delivering the process of providing and maintaining licences. However,
it will be done only with an understanding of the importance of the
robustness and safety required. When the panel reports,
Ministers will consider very carefully any recommendations in this area
and will discuss them in great detail with the CAA.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012187000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000051">The GA red tape
challenge received nearly 500 responses —three times
as many as any other theme to date. The responses identified many areas
where improvements are needed and highlighted the need for a change in
the approach to regulating GA. In response to this, a substantial
programme of reform has recently been launched with the aim of helping
to support a vibrant UK GA
sector.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000052">The
Civil Aviation Authority, the independent regulator, has recognised the
need to create a culture change in its regulation of the GA sector. It
has incorporated the findings of the GA red tape challenge into its own
internal review to produce a comprehensive GA reform programme. This
will support a programme of deregulation and self-regulation for the GA
sector, remove complexity, look to deregulate and delegate where
possible and, where not, consider how to allow the GA sector to take on
more responsibility and accountability for its own safety where
possible and
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000053">As
part of that programme, the CAA announced the setting up of the
specialist unit—which, again, has been widely praised in this
debate—dedicated to GA issues. I can confirm that it will indeed
be operational from April this year. This recognises that the GA
requires different, less onerous regulation compared 
<?notus-xml column=329?>with that for commercial air transport and it demonstrates the
CAA’s commitment to addressing GA issues. It will provide
effective and proportionate regulation which supports and encourages
the growth of the GA sector. As others have mentioned, Andrew Haines,
the chief executive of the CAA, and his team are very committed to
making the unit a
success.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000054">I
assure noble Lords that the CAA will work closely with the GA community
as regulations are developed, providing opportunities for the sector to
challenge those regulations when it believes that they are unduly
burdensome. For example—to take up a point that has been
raised—there will be far greater scrutiny of the CAA’s
fees and charges in order to provide greater transparency. On the issue
of onerous fees, the CAA is committed to reducing the charges that it
places on the industry, and it has agreed to work to reduce fees and
charges by 3% in real terms by 2015-16. It must also report on issues
such as efficiency.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012187000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000055">The noble Lord raised a
number of specific issues, most of which have already been explored by
the CAA. They include informed consent, which would allow members of
the public to pay for flights which are not designed to meet the same
requirements and standards as a commercial carrier. However, it must be
stressed that the CAA will consider this alongside other initiatives
intended to bring proportionate oversight to address the safety risks
associated with aviation activities.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012187000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000056">The noble Lord, Lord
Rotherwick, is right: the CAA is looking at options for delegating
certain functions to industry associations, and he named a number of
them. They are well placed to deliver regulatory oversight in a manner
proportionate to the needs of the sector. However—and he may be
slightly disappointed when I say this—the CAA will seek to
introduce market access opportunities for suitable qualified entities
because it believes that in some areas where there are no existing
arrangements, this will help to provide those new and required
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000057">The
CAA welcomes the GA sector’s involvement in agreeing its
charging schemes, as I mentioned earlier, and it recognises some of the
concerns expressed about the fees and charges. As a result, it is
proposing to establish a GA sub-group of its Finance Advisory Committee
specifically to take on the issue of fees to ensure that they are
proportionate as well as transparent.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012187000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000058">Another specific area
of concern is the availability of airspace for GA operators. The
community often takes the view that this has been reduced as controlled
airspace has grown to favour commercial aircraft. Actually, the
opposite may often be the reality. For example, between 2010 and March
2012 the total volume of controlled airspace within the UK was reduced
by 214 cubic nautical miles. The CAA is aware of these concerns and
ensures that its airspace change process is public and that all
decisions made are fully explained. A principal benefit envisaged
within the future airspace strategy is the potential to capitalise on
the improved performance characteristics of modern commercial aircraft,
which will allow other airspace users, including GA, to benefit from
the airspace volumes released beneath them.</hs_para>

is an important element. It is independent and includes representatives
from the GA industry. The panel is providing a “critical
friend” function to the CAA and will work with the regulator to
challenge its GA reform programme, challenging the CAA to be
consistent, transparent and innovative in its approach to GA regulation
and supporting the CAA as it strives to deliver genuine change in its
approach to GA
regulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000060">The
panel is considering projects which have the potential to promote
growth within GA and opportunities for further reducing the regulatory
burdens on the sector. It is also considering options for simplifying
existing European safety requirements, an issue discussed in the
debate, and assessing the progress being made to bring about a culture
change within the CAA. The challenge panel will report directly to
Ministers Grant Shapps, Robert Goodwill and Mark Harper in the Home
Office in April, with an interim report due before then in late
January. The panel’s existence will be short term, but the role
it is performing and the report it will produce will provide a platform
for improving the regulation of the GA sector.</hs_para>

the regulations which impact on GA ultimately derive from the European
Aviation Safety Agency. The Government and the CAA have been proactive
in lobbying for reform and fully support the EASA road map for general
aviation, which came about as a result of the GA sector sharing its
concerns about the proportionality of its rules. The EASA has
recognised that much of its regulation has been overly burdensome and
the road map proposes a series of reforms and changes in
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000062">We
welcome the fact that the European Commission has accepted the UK's
recommendation that an evaluation of the application of commercial
aviation safety requirements to general aviation should be included in
the rolling regulatory fitness and performance programme. We will
continue to work with the European Commission to ensure that this
evaluation is both rigorous and evidence-based. Recent announcements
such as securing the EU’s agreement to allow the UK to continue
issuing the instrument meteorological conditions rating for pilots
until April 2019 are encouraging and demonstrate EASA’s
willingness to reconsider its regulatory policy in relation to GA. The
Government also welcome the CAA’s commitment to eliminating
gold-plating of EU regulations and Ministers are due to meet with the
EASA next

mentioned at the outside that the Silk commission, which has been on

chairmanship of Paul Silk, is considering Part 2. I do not propose to
say anything about that because it would be premature, but it is now 14
months since we presented the report on Part 1. Each of the four main
political parties in Wales—that is, the Welsh Conservatives,
Welsh Labour, the Welsh Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru—has
had representatives on the commission throughout its work and it also
has independent members. Agreement on the Part 1 report was unanimous,

turn to our recommendations. Consistent with the recommendations of
Part 1, the Government have come down in favour of devolving landfill
tax and stamp duty land tax to Wales. Admittedly, they are not massive
taxes in terms of revenue, but it was very much consistent with what we
recommended. Those taxes, particular the latter, could be used to make
it more attractive to business to be formed in Wales. The Wales-England
border, unlike the Scotland-England border, is very porous, and the
opportunity to attract business and jobs into Wales should be a
priority. Stamp duty land tax could be used to attract business as well
as business men and women into Wales, which would provide a much-needed
boost for the Welsh economy, which has been slipping in relative terms
against England. It is key to raising economic standards in Wales as
well as Welsh public services because the revenue that is generated
could help with those services as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-21T16:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
believe that there is a serious politician in Wales across all the
parties who does not believe that expanding the private sector should
be a priority; most would probably agree that it should be the number

Government have recognised the case for devolution of 25% of the income
tax system so that, even if there is no change in the rate from
Westminster, the tax rate would have to be set in Wales, consistent
with the tax rate from Westminster. Once again, that tax system could
and should be used to encourage business and create wealth and jobs in
Wales, and funding flowing from that would once again help our public
services.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012187000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000078">The
commission recommended that income tax rates should be capable of
variation independently, just as Gerry Holtham recommended in a report
to the Welsh Government. We thought that that was the right way forward
and would mean that it would be possible to create better economic
conditions in Wales because of the possibility of varying the rates
independently. That has not happened, and so far I have had no
satisfactory explanation of why it has been rejected. There is, of
course, a lock-step in Scotland and it may be that the other side of
the Scottish referendum—where I hope for a no vote, which I am
sure most, but perhaps not quite all, of us fervently hope for and
passionately want—that will be revised. Perhaps the Minister
will respond on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000079">In their
response to Silk Part 1, the Government acknowledged borrowing powers
for Wales. That is extremely important but, apart from the limited
power that has already been conceded in advance of any progress on
income tax and other taxation powers, some power has now been given for
the much-needed M4 relief road to improve the M4. I am sure that most
people here recognise that as a priority. I tuned into Radio Wales this
morning to find, as one does nearly every morning, that there was a
hold-up in the Brynglas tunnel, which is a priority. However, there are
other things that need doing, and they can be done only with the
extended borrowing powers consequent upon having income tax as well as
the other smaller taxes so that money can be invested in improvements
in infrastructure, whether rail or road, in north, mid and south Wales
and in things such as dualling the A40, which is certainly much
needed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012187000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000080">Some
of that borrowing can be consequent on the smaller
taxes—landfill tax, stamp duty land tax and air passenger duty,
if that does come, and so on—but the great bulk will be
dependent on income tax being devolved. We recognise that in the
report. It is what we called for, so it is no different from the plea
we made to the Government and is consistent with what happens in
Scotland. Borrowing is dependent on taxation powers, but it would be a
much-needed boost to the Welsh economy and Welsh
infrastructure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000081">I
shall take up one issue that we saw as important for Wales: the Barnett
formula. We recognised that change in the Barnett formula should go
hand-in-hand with progress on taxation and borrowing and that there
should be no hold-up on taxation and borrowing. It would be a big
mistake for Wales if we parked this until there was a done deal on
Barnett. There has clearly been some progress on Barnett. This problem
has been with us for a long while and, in all honestly, we have made
more progress in the past three years than we did in the previous 20
years on getting the  
<?notus-xml column=334?>Barnett formula looked at. Is the Minister in a position to tell us
where we are on that and what progress is being made on the Barnett
formula?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000082">Under
this Government and this Prime Minister and with Danny Alexander,
Cheryl Gillan and David Jones we have delivered important opportunities
for Wales that complete, or go some way to completing, the jigsaw for
what is in reality a Parliament. However, a Parliament without
taxpayers looks rather a strange sort of Parliament, and I do not think
there is anywhere else in the world where that is the case. This is a
necessary move, and I hope that we can all move forward together on it.
We did not get everything we wanted in Silk Part 1, but we largely did,
and now we must move forward.</hs_para>

now one of my local universities when I was a mere constituency MP. I
was musing that I have known Members of the Committee—the noble
Lords, Lord Wigley and Lord Elystan-Morgan—for almost 50 years.

an overgrown village, that perhaps brings with it difficulties and
temptations. If we have this capital-raising power around expenditure,
there is a danger within the village of not looking strategically but
of looking at penny packets in which everyone has a share. I am pleased
that at least we all agree that the big priority now should be Brynglas
in Newport and the M4, even though it is still some distance from
Swansea.</hs_para>

Gompers, the great trade union leader in the United States, was once
asked, “What does American labour want?”. He answered,
“More”. I suppose that if we were to ask the Welsh people
what they want, they would say, “More”. Of course, if
there is also greater responsibility and accountability, that is a
bonus, but what we in Wales really want is more as we are at the bottom
of most of the indices of poverty and deprivation, and there are wide
regional differences even within Wales. Scotland benefits most from the
Barnett formula—and it is unrealistic to expect any change
before the referendum—and we in Wales appear to benefit least. I
guess that we could lose out on capital expenditure depending on how
the block grant is adjusted.</hs_para>

that Wales has suffered losses in terms of major capital
expenditure projects. That would have happened even if the Silk
commission recommendations had been put fully into effect. To give
brief examples of that, there was expenditure of £9 billion on
the Olympic legacy, including a diversion of the National Lottery fund,
part of which would have come to Wales. However, in spite of the claims
of the noble Lord, Lord Coe, and the delivery committee that the
benefits would be spread throughout the UK, 83% of the value of the
contracts went to London, the south-east and the east of England, while
Wales was at the bottom of the table with 0.01% of the value of the
contracts. Has the Wales Office asked for compensation for what we did
not receive when it had been promised to us? There will be massive
expenditure on HS2. Of course, we welcome the electrification of the
rail line to Swansea by 2017, but can we plausibly claim that Wales is
benefiting from this vast public expenditure? Finally, I mention the
Severn Bridge toll, which now costs £6.40 for cars. As I was
driving over on Friday, it occurred to me that this is really a major
tax on Wales and a disincentive to investment, and it is far more
relevant to us than many of these proposals. Obviously the toll cannot
be abolished overnight but, in my judgment, it should be reduced in a
staged process.</hs_para>

serious effort to tackle the major deficiency in the devolution
settlement—that is, the lack of responsibility and
accountability at Cardiff Bay. That will of course have major
repercussions for the Welsh Government, and there should be a serious
effort to ensure that we have the expertise in finance at Cardiff which
is presumably now lacking.</hs_para>

mentioned the linkage between the borrowing and tax powers. The latter
depends on the referendum and, if the referendum is unsuccessful, we
are left with only the minimal changes—the small
beer—which has been mentioned by the noble Lord. Perhaps we need
a cross-party consensus and agreement to avoid the referendum,

taxation, clearly we have noted the evidence of Gerald Holtham to the
Welsh Affairs Committee last week. In his view, devolving part of
income tax, subject to the referendum trigger, is likely to remain a
dead letter. The only people likely to vote for higher taxes are those
who pay no taxes at all. That was in the ICM poll for Silk. Perhaps the
most important finding of the poll was
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14012187000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000170">“The

perhaps like Gerald Holtham I have been too pessimistic. If the

contributions of some of his colleagues on that Bill. We travelled down

week, the coroner for north-east Wales, John Gittins, held on inquest
into the death of Mr Fred Pring of Mynydd Isa, near Mold. Last March,
he was suffering from severe chest pains and feeling ill when his wife
telephoned 999 and requested help at one o’clock in the morning.
There was no response. She made four phone calls, the last at ten to
two to tell them that he had died. The reason, it appears, was that the
five ambulances on call were outside the Maelor general hospital in
Wrexham waiting to unload patients who were already on board. One had
been there for more than five hours and another for an hour and a half.
At the weekend, Mr Carwyn Jones, the First Minister, told the BBC that
Wales was far behind England in accident and emergency response times
because we were more honest about our statistics and that he wanted to
change the targets.</hs_para>

they get away with it. On the economy, we learned last month from the
latest figures on GVA, the measure of value of goods and services
produced in the nations and regions in the UK, that Wales is the bottom
of the pile. This month in my home area of Wrexham, Kellogg’s

noble Lords who are in this Room and I campaigned for devolution in
1979 under the leadership of the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, and
again in 1998, we expected that a Welsh Government would successfully
lead the way. In the major fields which were devolved to the Welsh
Assembly, Labour-led Governments for the past 14 years have failed. I
will never forget one Labour parliamentary candidate who once said to
me that I was too concerned as a Liberal about the voters:
“Don’t worry about them”, he said. “We
don’t worry about them. They’ll vote for us whatever we
do”.</hs_para>

therefore that the Labour Government are seeking to avoid
accountability. At the moment, they are refusing to hold a referendum
which would implement the proposed income tax changes under Silk.
“We must reform the Barnett formula first,” says Mr
Carwyn Jones. I have looked up a speech I made in this House in 2001,
in which I said that it is essential that a needs-based formula be
devised, taking into account factors such as deprivation, population
sparsity and the local environment. We campaigned as Liberals, and I
know that Plaid Cymru campaigned for changes to the Barnett formula
over the same period. While the Labour Government were in the heyday of
their power, the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, expressed his embarrassment
at having his name linked to the formula. The Labour Government did
absolutely nothing. In putting it forward as a precondition, Mr Carwyn
Jones can wait for ever before there will be
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000099">We
Liberal Democrats would have preferred to have had the flexibility of
income tax powers without the Scottish lock-step model. Wales is not
Scotland. The Silk report pointed out in Appendix F that the latest
transborder travel-to-work figures are at their highest in north-east
Wales, with 34,500 people travelling from Flintshire and Wrexham into
England to work and 16,000 travelling in the opposite direction each
day. I can appreciate the Government’s view that the temptation
to live in the country with the lowest tax rate might cause some
upheavals in Wales that it would not cause in Scotland. Nevertheless, I
regret that that flexibility has not
occurred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000100">However,
sharing the income tax base between Westminster and Cardiff Bay will
significantly enhance the accountability of the National Assembly and
the Welsh Government. Income tax contributes the greatest proportion of
tax revenue in Wales and will provide a relatively stable revenue
stream. Stamp duty, if properly used, could help to lower the cost of
developing and buying houses, and we would hope that control over
business rates would encourage business investment. In our submission
to the Silk commission we asked for borrowing powers equivalent to
those of the Scottish Parliament, specifically 10% of the capital
budget, and we hope that that is what we will ultimately
obtain.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012187000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000101">These additional funds
of capital and revenue must be wisely spent, and the record of
Labour Government in Wales is so poor that a further priority must be

for a few moments and speak not of Silk 1 but of Silk 2. In so doing, I
project my remarks to the noble Lord, Lord Bourne, who, I know, will
assiduously and religiously report on these matters to his colleagues
in Silk. First, what is in a name? The answer is: a great deal when you
are dealing with constitutional status. It may very well be that the
term “Assembly” was in no way inappropriate when that
body was set up in 1998, but nowadays I think that it is a misnomer.
Following the referendum of 2011, we are three-quarters of the way to
being a full home-rule Parliament. I accept the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that the residium may very well keep us
back from that full status in the field of fiscal responsibility, but
that is another matter. Certainly, by now it would be right and proper
for Wales, as a legislating body, to have a Parliament in exactly the
same way as Scotland has.</hs_para>

challenges facing that body are immense. I believe and am confident
that in Cardiff Bay there are people of spirit, ability, vision and
determination, but it will be a very difficult task for that body
within a few short years—that is all that it has—to build
up the expertise that this House has had in the review and survey of
legislation over many centuries. It will not be done overnight. It also
means building up a cadre of civil servants with the expertise and,
indeed, the distinguished qualifications for such a massive
task.</hs_para>

there is the question of Members. We have 60 Members. The Richard
report, which after all did not envisage a body as
authoritative as this, talked of something much more modest and
recommended 80. It seems that the minimum that we can do with is
something of the order of 100. Let us call it 120 as that makes it very
simple—it exactly doubles the representation in each
constituency. One can argue as to which should be first past the post
and how others should be elected, but that is not the issue for the
moment. Without that, there is no possibility at all of development for
the Welsh body in Cardiff Bay. If you want it to fail, all you have to
do is nothing.</hs_para>

that I and many of us here have raised at various times—that is,
the bulk transfer of authority to Wales, subject to specific
exceptions, in the same way as is the case with Northern Ireland and
Scotland. A Welsh lawyer, be he a solicitor or a barrister, has to
chase through a labyrinth of hundreds of small matters to find out
exactly what has or has not been transferred. In order to save Welsh
lawyers from constitutional neurosis, there is an overwhelming case for
such a transfer.</hs_para>

of income tax variation. I respectfully disagree, not for the first
time and no doubt in life, with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of
Gresford. If the Welsh people opt for these powers, 
<?notus-xml column=339?>with Barnett in its unreconstructed form we will be doing our nation a
very great disservice. Why is that? At the moment, we lose something of
the order of £350 million to £400 million each year on
the Barnett formula. That is accepted. Nobody will stand up and say
that it must be justified and kept. Mrs Gillan, our Secretary of State,
said its time was up and everybody agrees, yet Her Majesty’s
Government, twin-headed as they are, said, “We know that you are
being cheated out of these monies year in and year out, but we are
perfectly content to maintain that system”. That is entirely
wrong. Therefore, Barnett has to be put right before we can contemplate

Wigley (PC):</Member></B> My Lords, I join noble Lords in mourning the
loss of the late Wyn, Lord Roberts, of whom I had an earlier
opportunity to speak in the Chamber. I very much thank the noble Lord,
Lord Bourne, for facilitating this short debate and also pay tribute to
his work on the Silk commission and that of other commissioners,
including Plaid Cymru’s Dr Eurfyl ap Gwilym and, particularly,
Paul Silk
himself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000110">I am
sure that the noble Lord, Lord Bourne, would agree that among the most
remarkable aspects of the Silk commission was that, first, unlike
Scotland, it was drawn up with terms of reference to which all four
parties in Wales signed up and, secondly, its first report secured the
support of all commission members. I am sure that the noble Lord would
confirm that such agreement was achieved by some give and take and that
the report was presented as a balanced package, not one to be
cherry-picked. I regret very much that the Government, driven as they
are by the Scottish agenda, could not accept the package in its
entirety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000111">I
regret that for two substantive reasons. First, by insisting on a
lock-step on income tax, the Government denied the Assembly the
significant degree of policy flexibility it might have otherwise
enjoyed, and with it the possibility of creating a far-reaching
investment programme that could stimulate the Welsh economy. Goodness
knows that we need that. Business rate flexibility and stamp duty land
tax are certainly worth having but are not in themselves enough.
Secondly, by acting in this way, the UK Government have let the Welsh
Prime Minister off the hook. Carwyn Jones has waxed eloquent this week
on how the Tories and their Lib Dem backers squandered the opportunity
provided by Silk. It has been enough of an excuse for Mr Jones to step
away from a referendum, for what is the point of having a referendum on
income tax powers that are
unusable?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000112">Had
the Silk report been adopted in its entirety, with all the parties
represented on the commission on board, it would have been impossible
for Labour or any other party to wriggle out of having a referendum. A
yes vote could have been secured again, as happened in the 2011
referendum when all four parties were united. I pay tribute to the
noble Lord, Lord Bourne, in that context. That yes vote would have
started making Wales’ Government truly answerable to the people
of Wales in having to justify their expenditure and stewardship of
Welsh taxpayers’ money. I cannot understand the Government
taking this course of 
<?notus-xml column=340?>action which at one stroke negates everything they purport to advocate
in terms of democratic answerability in Wales. Has Alex
Salmond’s shadow really got them on the run to that

respectfully disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, and
do not join him in talking Wales down in terms of the National Health
Service. Goodness knows that there are people working hard enough and
with great commitment in the health service in Wales, and they deserve
our thanks. Of course, some bad decisions have been made by the Welsh
Government, as by the Westminster Government. The noble Lord quoted a
highly unfortunate situation in the NHS in Wales this week. One of the
worst blind alleys that the Assembly pursued with regard to the health
service was the creation of 22 local health boards, but I suspect that
the noble Lord’s party supported it in doing that. The truth is
that Barnett underfunding deprived the Assembly of some £5
billion since its establishment, and health and education in Wales have
been underfunded as a
result.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000114"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Thomas of Gresford" PimsId="4251" UID="14012187000212" xid="1837" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000212">Lord

questions I wish to put to the Minister are these. First, could an
income tax-sharing model be adopted before reform of the Barnett

include the old WDA borrowing powers, or is that a separate amount?
Thirdly, is the M4 relief road dependent on getting these borrowing
powers? Fourthly, how much of the £500 million borrowing limit
will be available before a referendum? Fifthly, does the revenue stream
from the minor taxes—the land tax and the aggregate
levy—constitute enough to support the £500
million borrowing capacity? Lastly, the draft measure says that a yes

borrowing limit, but raise it by how much?</hs_para>

for, and supported, the establishment of a commission to examine the
need for a different financial structure for Wales, one which would
bring more accountability and responsibility to the Welsh Government.
My Westminster colleagues also fought for the inclusion of the
commission as part of the coalition agreement. I am grateful for their
readiness to listen to Welsh concerns and their desire to move the
devolution process forward. We all, I am sure, await the opportunity to
debate further the devolution settlement in general when we receive the

Silk commission’s report provides us with an historic
opportunity to increase the accountability of the Welsh Government,
making them accountable for their policies and making them responsible
for raising some of the money they spend. I was pleased to see the UK
Government’s offer of devolving income tax on the same basis as
that legislated for in the Scotland Act 2012. While not the preferred
method of many for devolving income tax, I welcome this as a major step
forward in the devolution settlement for Wales. However, I have some
sympathy with the commission’s recommendation against the
lock-step system. One cannot help but wonder how many more
opportunities would have been open to Wales had it been given the
freedom to vary the basic, higher and additional rates of tax
independently.</hs_para>

duty, as other noble Lords have said, provides the National Assembly
with the opportunity to address the acute housing crisis in Wales by
helping to lower the cost of developing and buying houses in Wales.
Greater control over business rates will allow the Welsh Government to
deliver a more coherent reform of those rates and will, I hope, give
the National Assembly an additional tool to encourage business. I
certainly look forward to seeing, for instance, which measures the
Ministers in Cardiff Bay will employ to help those smaller businesses

must admit that when I read the announcement of the granting of
borrowing powers to the National Assembly, I uttered a silent
“Thank goodness”. This now addresses an historic and, in
some eyes, offensive inequality where other public institutions,
including community councils in Wales, are able to borrow yet the
Assembly is not. My own small town council, for example, with an annual
budget of less than £40,000 a year, has the right to borrow, yet
our national Government and the National Assembly have been unable to
secure capital funding for projects, including the much needed major
improvement of the M4 in South Wales. I am also pleased to see that the
Chief Secretary to the Treasury has announced that the UK Government
will provide early access to borrowing powers for the Welsh Government
to enable schemes such as the M4 improvement to take place. I look
forward to taking my place in the queue to make the case for further

powers do not apply just to roads. I certainly welcome them as a way to
provide the Welsh Government with more scope to stimulate the economy
with investment in other capital expenditure projects. The Silk
commission report and the draft Wales Bill which emanates from it must

matters. They are a unique opportunity to shape democracy in Wales. We

Democrats have long supported a federal system as part of our vision
for the UK’s constitutional future, and we believe that the
United Kingdom is slowly moving towards a federal state. However, in
the early stages of devolution, its constitutional and financial
systems had not been developed sufficiently to compensate for these
changes. The Silk commission and the draft Wales Bill present
politicians across the UK with a unique opportunity to strengthen the
framework as far as Wales is concerned. Our support for devolution and
federalism has been coupled with a belief that additional
responsibility must be accompanied by additional accountability and
additional capacity to deliver. That is why we have regularly supported
reforms to increase the responsibility that Welsh Ministers have over
the money they spend, but also to ensure that they have the right legal
and financial powers to deliver a wide range of
solutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000125">I

Labour’s record of investment in Wales under devolution and
while Labour was in power in Westminster. This growth came to a

any race to the bottom across the UK on income tax rates; that would be

Bourne, and others, in the tributes to Lord Roberts of Conwy. I had
known him over many years, and he provided me with an inspirational
example in the way that he fulfilled his role in the Wales Office. In
particular, his love of the Welsh language ensured that changes were
made at the time that have strengthened the language and its position
in society.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012187000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000137">I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Bourne, for securing the debate today on the
very important opportunities for Wales presented by the recommendations
made by the Silk commission in its Part 1 report. I also paid tribute
to the hard work of the Silk commission that went into the report, and
I note the important role that the noble Lord played in that process. I
have listened carefully to noble Lords in the Chamber and I am pleased
that the Government’s response to the Silk commission’s
recommendations has been broadly welcomed by several noble Lords, as
has the draft Wales Bill, which, we must remember, implements the vast
majority of its key recommendations, and which is currently undergoing
pre-legislative scrutiny in the other
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000138">The
Government believe that the devolution of tax and borrowing powers
should be used to help to generate jobs and growth in the Welsh
economy; to give Wales a competitive edge; and to make Wales a more
prosperous place. Our response to the Silk commission and the powers we
will transfer to Cardiff Bay, take forward these principles. The Welsh
economy has lagged behind other parts of the UK for far too
long—a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Anderson—and we
intend to give the Welsh Government and the National Assembly for Wales
the tools to change
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000139">Just as
importantly, implementing the Silk commission’s recommendations
will also make the devolved institutions in Wales more accountable to
the people who elect them. We fully agree with the commission’s
key recommendation: that the funding model of a block grant and some
devolved taxes best meets sound principles for funding the Welsh
Government, and that part of 
<?notus-xml column=345?>their budget should be funded from devolved taxation under their
control. Since devolution, the Assembly and the Welsh Government have
been accountable only for how they spend taxpayers’
money—a point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Humphreys. They
will now become more accountable for how they raise
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012187000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000140">The
Government demonstrated our commitment to these reforms by publishing
the draft Wales Bill before the Christmas recess, only one month after
we announced our response to the Silk 1 recommendations. We wanted
pre-legislative scrutiny of this important legislation to take place in
this Session of Parliament, and I am pleased to say that the Welsh
Affairs Select Committee already has that scrutiny well under way.
Subject to successful parliamentary passage of the legislation, I hope
the new tax and borrowing powers to be devolved well before the next
Assembly elections in May
2016.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000141">I want
an early referendum called as soon as possible after the legislation is
passed, and I will be campaigning for a yes vote. I hope that the First
Minister will be joining
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000142">In
response to the points made about the ability to vary income tax in
each band by the noble Lords, Lord Bourne and Lord Wigley, and the
noble Baroness, Lady Humphreys, among others, we believe that the
so-called lock-step system of income tax devolution that we have set
out in the draft Wales Bill is the right system for Wales. The system
applies in Scotland and was agreed with the Scottish Government, with a
single devolved rate for all bands. We believe that it would work
equally well in Wales. It delivers on two key principles that underpin
the Government’s approach to devolving income tax. It ensures
that the UK maintains a progressive tax system. As the noble Baroness,
Lady Morgan, said just now, it prevents a damaging race to
the bottom on higher-rate taxes, one where the tax rate increases as
the income of an individual
increases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000143">The
income tax structure is a key mechanism to redistribute wealth across
the whole of the UK, which is why we believe it is properly set at a UK
level. That point was made clearly and firmly by the Calman commission
in respect of its recommendations on Scotland. That point transcends
both Scotland and Wales and applies to both countries. The lock step
ensures that the gap between income tax rate is consistent across the
UK; that devolved government works comfortably within the parameters of
the UK; and that fiscal devolution does not benefit one part of the UK
at the expense of another. This could occur if the Welsh Government
were to set substantially lower rates for higher and additional
taxpayers without having to change the basic
rate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000144">Devolving
income tax would give the Welsh Government a crucial lever that they
could use to reduce taxes across the board in Wales to put money back
into the pockets of people in Wales who are working hard and deserve to
hold on to more of the money that they have earned. It will create new
incentives for growth and jobs and rekindle the spirit of
entrepreneurialism. If the people of Wales decide in a referendum in
favour of income tax devolution, the  
<?notus-xml column=346?>Welsh Government would become responsible for almost half of the income
tax generated in Wales, making it more accountable while giving them
flexibility over levels of tax and spending. An important issue is,
crucially, that devolution of income tax would give the Welsh
Government access to a significantly larger revenue stream to finance
borrowing. So it is far from being a power that cannot be
used.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012187000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140121-gc0001.htm#14012187000145">Even if
the Welsh Government decided not to vary income tax rates, it would
still provide a base for borrowing as well as a base for
accountability. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Anderson, pointed out,
you have to win the referendum first. I am surprised that the noble
Lord can envisage only a situation where the Welsh Government would
wish to increase tax if income tax were to be devolved. Under the
Government’s proposal it would be just as feasible for the Welsh
Government to reduce rates of income tax—for example, by half a
pence or one pence in the pound. The noble Lord and the noble Baroness,
Lady Morgan, both reflect the view, which is all too prevalent in the
Labour Party, that taxes could only be altered by increasing them and
not by decreasing
them.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_21_PT_1/53762D2EE5EA3CEA0D6980A37D27DD23CF23741C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 January 2014">Tuesday,

We have no plans to introduce a ban on keeping
primates as pets. However, primates are wild animals and have very
specific needs because they are socially-complex and long-living
animals. Anyone keeping a primate must, by law, provide for the welfare
needs of their animal. It is an offence, under The Animal Welfare Act
2006, not to do so. In 2010, Defra introduced the Code of Practice for
the Welfare of Privately Kept Non-human Primates. Whilst it is not a
specific offence to breach the Code, if proceedings are brought under
the Animal Welfare Act 2006, the Court can take into account the extent
to which someone has complied, or failed to comply, with the Code in
deciding whether they have committed an offence.</hs_para>
