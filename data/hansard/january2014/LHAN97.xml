all vessels to carry enough life rafts to meet the risk to those on

Seas and the Prevention of Pollution from Ships is based on UK
regulations for domestic passenger ships and is supported by the

Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Baroness for
that response. My understanding is that this exemption application
applies to passenger ships with up to 130 people on them, which, under
directive 2009/45, article 4, allows them to go 15 miles from the place
of refuge or five miles from the coast in the summer. The idea is to
reduce the number of life rafts to the maximum number of
passengers—not allowing, of course, for the fact that you cannot
always launch life rafts if a ship is heeling—and to replace the
rafts removed with life rings. Does the Minister really think that it
is a good idea for people who might be wrecked in an accident in the
North Sea or off the Hebrides to have to get into a life ring rather
than a life
raft?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Kramer" PimsId="5891" UID="14011578000369" xid="2104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000369">Baroness

is for up to five miles and therefore would not apply in most of the
circumstances that the noble Lord has just described. It is for small
craft of less than 24 metres which have to be travelling in daylight
and in summer only. They are required to have sufficient life rafts for
all passengers but additional safety can be provided by buoyancy
apparatus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Higgins" PimsId="962" UID="14011578000370" xid="1263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000370">Lord

preferable to life rings, particularly if the water is cold? Is the

Kramer:</Member></B> My Lords, there is clearly some confusion. The EU
directive was designed for the large, steel ferries that I think noble
Lords are referring to. These are small craft. Existing small craft
already have this exemption; it is simply as they are replaced that
newer craft can have the same exemption. The rationale is simply that
on a very small boat there is very little space for adding one
additional life raft, which is what would be required by the directive.
You would have to take off passengers. These are usually small, family
operations operating on a tight financial margin and, as I say, it is
within five miles of the coast so that if something untoward were to
happen, modern life rafts are very reliable and air-sea rescue is very
close at hand. Therefore, the marginal benefit is considered very
marginal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lea of Crondall" PimsId="1443" UID="14011578000372" xid="1309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000372">Lord
Lea of Crondall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am rather exercised by
the fact that Britain over the past 100 years has had the
reputation of giving leadership in the International Maritime
Organisation, which is across the road there, with the highest
standards in world shipping. I am trying to think of the read-across of
this to the Philippines archipelago, to Indonesia and so on. Two very
brilliant new books on seafaring that have just come out show that many
safety standards are now deteriorating. Will the Minister give an
assurance that, within the IMO and elsewhere, the British Government
will continue to listen to the problems of workers on seagoing ships
and that the Government’s contacts with the employers will be
equally matched by their contacts with the trade

think that there is some confusion here. The EU directive which would
require an additional life raft is not intended for this kind of
vessel; it is for steel vessels and for large-scale ferries, so it does
not apply to most of these craft because typically they are fibreglass,
and so on. We want to be sure that we are getting an appropriate
exemption for future replacement of existing craft. As I said, the EU

My Lords, whereas it is quite clear that the headline
unemployment figures are welcome, there is a problem about emerging
underemployment and intermittent hours. While we are waiting, with more
and more impatience, for the arrival of universal credit, which in due
course will help, will the Minister do all he can to
encourage people to take advantage of the existing in-work
benefits, which can help employees get into full-time, sustainable
jobs? While he is at it, will he do his best to try to tone down the

There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:20:44"></hs_TimeCode> are two
distinct factors. The higher the minimum wage, the more people will not
go into the market. Estimates show that if we were to go with the
recommended living wage, we would lose 300,000 jobs, particularly among

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord
Nash) (</B><B>Con</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, the relevant rules
that academies must abide by are quite clear and have been considerably
tightened under this Government. No individual or organisation with a
governing relationship to an academy can make a profit; any goods or
services delivered by these parties to these academies must be
delivered transparently and at no more than cost; and proportionate and
fair procurement processes must always be followed. As charities,
academies are required to adhere to accounting standards. These require
the full disclosure of related-party transactions, and
independent auditors check those disclosures every year. Unlike local
authority schools, academies produce and publish annual third-party
audited accounts.</hs_para>

thank the noble Lord for that reply and of course
I accept that the accounts of these firms are audited.
However, is the Minister concerned by reports of excessive sums of
taxpayers’ money being paid to academy chain directors for
travel, subsistence, consultancy and legal services? Is he also
concerned that many of these businesses are employing members of their
immediate family to provide services for the academies, and does he
accept that academy chains lack the involvement of parents and the
local community, which could provide a degree of independent scrutiny
and governance for the academies? What more is his department planning
to do to get a grip on the situation, which seems to be one of
prioritising the expansion of the academies over the protection of
public money?</hs_para>

Nash:</Member></B> I stand by my original Answer regarding the rigid
regime that academies operate under, and resent any allegation that we
do not have a grip of the situation. When we came into the Department
for Education in May 2010, we found a department with, frankly, a very
poor understanding of value for money. Since then, we have halved the
cost of building schools under the previous Government; by 2015 we will
have cut the cost of running the department by half in real terms; we
have slashed the amount of money spent on sponsored academies from an
average of more than £300,000 under the previous Government to
under £100,000; and we have substantially tightened the rather
loose arrangements that the previous Government had in force in
relation to these arrangements. I stand by the results of the
academies. Sponsored academies open for three years improve their
results by 12% versus 5% at secondary level, and primary converter
academies are far more likely than local authority schools to be rated
outstanding at their next Ofsted when they have previously been rated
good<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:30:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000048"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="14011578000414" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000414">Lord

on which we are hoping to have a positive response from the Government.
I have in my hands a petition which was started only last

more than 130 NGOs and 160,000 signatures from charities and

of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler, is about the distinction
between the general public and supporters. The commission put forward
an amendment to try to widen out the definition of a supporter because,
in a digital age, a supporter cannot simply be considered as somebody
who gives money to a charity. As that petition indicates, with its
160,000 signatures, the term “supporters” now has a much
wider character. Although the Government did not accept the amendment
which we tabled earlier because they thought it was too wide, I hope
that they will look sympathetically at that of the noble Lord, Lord

on Amendment 34, my amendment concerns legislation before Parliament

period. I was disappointed that the Electoral Commission, which has
been helpful at a number of points in supporting our amendments, does

Commission says that, if the amendment were allowed, it would allow
unlimited spending on what may promote or procure the
election of any particular candidate or party. Secondly, it suggests
that the range of topics is potentially wide, even if it is covered by
primary legislation indicated by the Government. Let us take an example
and test that out. In election year, the Government decide to start
legislation for, let us say, a new town of 500,000 people not far from
an area of outstanding natural beauty. This policy is strongly
supported by the Government of the day, but is opposed by the two other
parties; it is a highly political issue. Furthermore, the town will
actually cover three constituencies where there is a narrow
majority.</hs_para>

their most controversial legislation until the beginning of the

to it would be more muted than if it were outside the electoral period.

Minister said that there is “no legal obligation” to
translate election material from English to Welsh and vice versa, and
that is absolutely right. In reality, however, given the sea change in
the use of the Welsh language in Wales, in some parts in practice it
would not be possible to make any electoral headway without the use of
both languages. All parties in Wales recognise this and implement the
public expectation of the use of both languages. Indeed, in my time as

the cost of translation of electoral material falls within that

would argue that the Government have sought to meet our need. You
cannot translate anything unless you have an original document.

to the actual costs of, for example, paying the translator. Whereas in
England the NSPCC may issue material only in one language, the NSPCC in

both languages. If the whole costs could not be excluded from the

In preparing my notes, I had intended to say precisely what the noble
and learned Lord, Lord Morris, said just a few minutes ago. It is the
responsibility of this House to try to make sure that anything that
leaves us is as good as it can be and as perfect as we can achieve.
Today, therefore, we are all together in seeking modest amendments in
most cases, but important ones that make the Bill more workable, more
acceptable and more

two specific amendments on which my name leads, I should very much like
to support the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries,
in his Amendment 34. It is important for the sake of civic
society that we enable people to get fully involved in the dialogue
with Parliament about the legislation 
<?notus-xml column=240?>that goes through the two Houses. I hope that, in one way or another, my
noble friend will be able to make that absolutely clear. It must surely
be right that, when legislation is going through both Houses of
Parliament, our fellow citizens are in a position to
campaign without let or hindrance to improve that
legislation. I very much hope that we will have reassurance
on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:57:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000094">Amendment
40, which stands in my name and in the names of the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries, my noble friend Lord Cormack and the noble
Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, is quite simply about bringing the concept of
supporter up to date. I echo here a point made by my noble friend Lord
Cormack a few minutes ago. When I was first involved in
politics, those of us who wanted to engage in the political
process, in the main, joined a political party. I did so as a student
and I suspect that many others in your Lordships’ House did the
same. Some then drifted off into other occupations. I stayed with
politics, to my obvious detriment in terms of income compared with the
lawyers in your Lordships’ House. From that period to now there
have been dramatic changes in society. Many then did join parties;
others might have joined campaigning groups. Some of those groups are
still with us and still have a mass membership. In those days, it was
very much the culture of the age, particularly among young people, but
people today support campaigns à la carte. They do not get
involved in just one campaign and stick with it to the exclusion of all
others. They are involved for a time but their priorities change, just
as in the consumer world people expect now to pick and choose. You go
to one supermarket for one purpose and to another for another, to one
airline for an outward flight and another to come home again. You do
not necessarily feel that you have to join up to one hospital
even—you choose. It is part of the culture of our
age<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:59:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14011578000342" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000342">4

not sign up to any one view or any one provider of that view. They
certainly do not join one group for fear that doing so would
sub-contract their future views on future issues to that group
concerned. Yet it is still important in electoral law to make way for
groups that communicate with people who have regular, committed
supporters without that being counted as some sort of
electioneering<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:00:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:00:22"></hs_TimeCode> concept of a
committed supporter is now familiar to the Electoral Commission and it
incorporates that in its guidance. Amendment 40 seeks to
tighten that up and put it into legislative form. In short, we are
saying that someone who has given money to an organisation or has
directly communicated with it in the past 12 months should be accepted
and recognised as a committed supporter.</hs_para>

has given Data Protection Act consent to be contacted in
future—for ever and always—should be counted as a
supporter of that group full time. That surely cannot be
practical<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:00:40"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
sure that if Members of your Lordships’ House look at their
e-mail inboxes, they will find messages there from all sorts of groups
in relation to which at some time we have either ticked or not ticked a
box to say that we do not mind if they communicate
with us. However, that is not enough to say that we are committed
supporters 
<?notus-xml column=241?>of a particular group. Therefore, I think that our amendment is much
more practical. Surely that consent should not be allowed to imply
active, ongoing support for the group
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:01:08"></hs_TimeCode>.

months—not just receiving e-mails but acting on them—is
surely a signal of active
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:01:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I think
it should be recognised as such alongside, and on an equal basis with,
financial contributions. As I have said,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:01:33"></hs_TimeCode> existing
Electoral Commission guidance is not sufficient because it concentrates
too much on donations. Support for an organisation involves much more
than simply giving money and we should take this opportunity in this
Bill to say so firmly so that in future the guidance is absolutely
explicit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:01:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in my name makes one very simple suggestion, which I hope
will commend itself to my noble friends on the government
Front Bench. I do not need to tell your Lordships that the
Bill is controversial. It would be reassuring for all those
concerned to know that any future alterations to Part 1 of Schedule 3,
which is very controversial, cannot simply be made by ministerial fiat.
On many occasions in your Lordships’ House we have had the
familiar problem of what I think is usually referred to colloquially as
the Henry VIII power. It is not appropriate here and I hope
therefore that, on the basis of Amendment 45A, that power can in future
be subject to an affirmative resolution of both Houses. That would give
proper control over that exercise. I accept that that is not something
for today but I hope that my noble friends on the government Front
Bench will look at it in time for us to consider whether that might be
a useful very small addition but one that would give real reassurance
to those who are concerned about the future of this legislation. On
that basis, I hope that when the Minister responds he can do so
positively to these

Mallalieu (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, my name is added to Amendments
34 and 40 in this group, which I support. To my mind, Clause 26 goes to
the heart of the damage that the Bill as it stands has the ability to
do to free speech, to the right to campaign and to the right to
protest. It exposes what I believe was an unintended consequence of a
Bill which, as we have already heard, was placed before Parliament in
haste and without proper
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:03:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

capacity to prevent any campaigning organisation mounting a major
campaign against a Bill before Parliament in the regulatory period
proposed —in other words, from September this year to May 2015
and, as others have said, for one year in every five thereafter. If
Clause 26, together with the rest of the provisions in the Bill
currently proposed by the Government, including today’s
government amendments, had been in force in 2005, because of the 60%
spending limit reduction and the inclusion of staff costs in the
expenditure that has to be accounted for, it would simply not have been
possible, for example, to mount rallies and marches on the scale
organised by the Countryside Alliance—of which, I remind the
House, I am president—all of which took place in what would have
been the regulatory period for the 2005 election. I suspect that other
major protests, such as the Stop the War march, would also have been
troubled by the spending
limits<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:04:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

it is defective, PPERA was liveable with because the expenditure limits
were set at a level which did not capture the activity of most
campaigners and because staff costs did not have to be included in
returns. Campaigners were therefore able to live with the legislation.
However, this is not so with Clause 26 as it currently stands. As the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, said, it provides an
opportunity for a Government to reserve the introduction of
particularly contentious legislation to the year before an
election—the regulatory period—knowing full well that
opposition will be seriously restricted by the financial limits imposed
under the Bill. While I accept that opposition would not be wholly
silenced, it would, effectively, be seriously curtailed.</hs_para>

those who have not followed it as closely as others, political
campaigning under the Bill does not necessarily involve campaigning for
or against a particular candidate or party. I prefer to call that
“Political” campaigning with a capital “P”.
Under the Charity Commission’s guidance, no charity is permitted
to do that. The Bill goes further and restricts what I call political
campaigning with a small “p”: in other words, campaigning
on a policy, which is what many charities do. You do not have to make
any mention of a particular party or candidate to be caught by the
Bill, but you will be if your campaign can reasonably be regarded as
intended to promote or secure electoral success, even if it can be
regarded as intending to achieve some other purpose too. It does not
matter that your campaign is long-standing if it fulfils those
criteria. As the Minister has repeatedly said, the test is an objective
one. So it is also irrelevant if your intentions, as the campaigner,
were solely concerned with the issue and not with the
election<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:07:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000102">The
current guidance of the Electoral Commission suggests that where, for
example, one political party allies itself with the campaign of a
particular organisation, it does not necessarily mean that the campaign
and its material become regulated, but if there is a change in the
scale and nature of the campaigning it may well do so. However, what if
a party in government introduces a contentious Bill, during the
regulatory period, which directly impacts adversely on your existing
campaign? How can a campaigning organisation reasonably not draw
attention to the fact and campaign vigorously against it? Indeed, why
should it
not<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:07:51"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000103">Legislation
before Parliament will, of course, reach a conclusion one way or
another with Prorogation. The campaigning directed at legislation,
albeit during the regulated period, is aimed not at the election but at
something which will have concluded by election day—indeed six
weeks beforehand—with Prorogation. A way must be found to enable
the people of this country to express the strength of their feelings
about proposed legislation at any time in the course of a Parliament. I
hope that the Minister, who has repeatedly said that it is not the
Government’s intention to stifle protest, will agree to take the
amendment away for urgent discussion with the Electoral Commission and
return next week, if not with an amendment to meet this real objection
to Clause 26 then at least with an unequivocal indication of guidance
to be given to permit legitimate campaigning in these circumstances. As
the Minister will know, it is not enough for him to make
some form of Pepper 
<?notus-xml column=243?>v Hart statement in this House because
the courts, in due course, will not look at what is said in the debates
of this House unless the legislation is itself unclear or ambiguous.

question is to what extent they would be allowed to finance a campaign
about a new town by comparison with what the local political parties
could spend in that constituency. Under the Bill they are allowed to
spend, in round figures, more or less £10,000 on a campaign over
a new town in a constituency during the regulated period. That is
roughly the

any local party that can raise £10,000 to fight in a local
constituency is doing well. I do not think that I ever got as far as
that in my constituency of Orpington; it is a lot of money. Local
parties are not very affluent these days and do not have many people in
them. Many are collapsing from inside. They have few members and great
difficulty in raising money. Therefore, £10,000 is a lot of
money to inject into a constituency. If it was only that constituency

are not talking about any restriction on discussion of an issue that is
before Parliament in the regulated period; it will be discussed. We are
talking about the balance between what a campaign could spend on
promoting a particular interest—whether it is for or against the

The Bill is about a balance between what local parties can spend, in a
constituency and generally, and what lobbying interest groups of this
kind can spend—whether they are charities, trade unions or
whatever.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000115">I am
a member of the Electoral Commission, but I speak for myself on this
occasion. The commission is against the amendment in the name of the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries. It said clearly in its
briefing to the House before Committee that more proportionate
thresholds and spending limits would reduce the need for exemptions of
the kind for which he is calling. In effect, the thresholds for
regulation—which, I accept, as I said in previous debates on the
Bill, were too low—and the spending limits, have been raised by
the Government: for example, to £10,000 and to £20,000 
<?notus-xml column=245?>for the registration threshold. That gives room
for people to campaign on these issues, but not to swamp
local political parties, as they are swamped in America,
where you get super-PACs swamping the official Republican and
Democratic candidates. That is what this Bill is about—a balance
between what an interest group can do in a constituency, and what the
political parties that are fighting and standing in a general election
can do. The Government’s sensible lifting of these limits to
meet the fair and correct opposition to the lower limits —which
were too low—has done this. The Government’s balance is
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000116">There
is a further point. The amendments to which the noble Lord referred at
some length form a package; as he acknowledged several times during our
debates, these things are linked. If you make one concession, it has an
effect somewhere else. I hope that those who are concerned about the
effect of the Bill will realise that this is a complete package, and
that by raising the thresholds, the Government have dealt with the
points that noble Lords made and therefore that the exemptions they
seek are unnecessary. While acknowledging the understandable
opposition, in particular of Members on the Cross Benches and in the
Labour Party, I hope that they will see that this is a genuine attempt
to reach consensus on how elections are conducted in this
country. This is now a well balanced set of proposals. Therefore, any
further attempt to carry on and unpick them would be
disastrous for elections in this
country.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/6A0EF8C629501B1036F06093E561A5823293DB47" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 January 2014">Wednesday,

Hayter of Kentish Town (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join the noble
and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, in thanking the Government for
the sensible and welcome amendments that they have tabled. We have just
heard from the noble Lord, Lord Horam. I wonder if when he used the
word “harried” he meant someone who had been harried by
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, but I will leave that
to one
side.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000118">However,
we feel that more changes are needed to the Bill, which we have opposed
from the start, for the very cogent reason spelt out by the noble Lord,
Lord Cormack: it inhibits the expression of legitimate opinion.
Amendment 34 goes to the heart of that. The noble Lord, Lord Horam,
spoke about constituencies, which I think is a different issue, but we
might be talking about something like the bedroom tax, which the
National Housing Federation campaigned against, worried about the rents
coming to it. Anyone who followed the Welfare Bill will know all the
detail of that, so I will not go through it. Unless we can get rid of
staff costs—which I hope we will within the next hour—had
the bedroom tax been in the past 12 months, it is very unlikely that
the National Housing Federation, which is not a charity, would have
been able to campaign in the way that it is telling us its members
wanted. That was not in the past 12 months but something like that
could have been.</hs_para>

safeguard and clarity should be provided in the Bill along the lines

something about the important points made by the noble and

Elystan-Morgan. At present, controlled expenditure is incurred on the
production and publication of election materials, such as leaflets. The
Bill retains this, but costs associated with translating these
materials from English to Welsh or vice versa will be excluded. The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, said he hoped that this was an
oversight and that it was not there in the first place. If there was an
oversight, and I think there probably was, it was probably also an
oversight in the 2000 Act, because election materials are covered by
the provisions in that Act. I hope, albeit belatedly, that there is
considerable cross-party and non-party consensus that it is something

giving something it is easy to say that it is not as much as you
thought we were giving, but we believe that extending the exemption
further than the cost of translation would go too far. It would allow
campaigns to print different material for different addresses without
being regulated. For example, if a campaigner prints 100
leaflets in English, he can then print 100 leaflets in Welsh for an
entirely different purpose. Therefore, we thought it important that
this amendment should relate to the cost of translation, rather than

Wigley:</Member></B> Surely the Minister accepts that if an
organisation—say, the NSPCC—requires a leaflet
to be put out in England and in Wales, in England it might
be in other languages but it need be only in English to meet the law.
In Wales, it would be in Welsh bilingually with English. Sometimes that
can mean double the size of the leaflet. Sometimes it might be
constrained to six instead of eight pages in the way that bilingualism
can be laid out, but the cost of producing something in a bilingual
format for the customers is significant because of the print and the
paper, not just the time taken to translate a leaflet. That is relative
peanuts in the operation. If the Minister is excluding the other parts,
there is a very serious
implication.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000130"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Tankerness" PimsId="5278" UID="14011578000449" xid="1977" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000449">Lord

Amendment 38 amends the defence, currently in the Bill, for a person or
third party charged with an offence of incurring controlled expenditure
in excess of the spending limit—that is, above the limit in a
part of the UK or the constituency limit—to show that they
complied with the relevant code of practice so that it covers both
recognised and non-recognised third parties. The amendment is needed to
reflect the changes to the reporting requirements in a later
government amendment which provides for no spending return if the
threshold is not reached. We have since identified a couple of points
not properly dealt with in the amendment. The first is that the defence
does not adequately cover the case where an offence might be committed
by virtue of expenditure incurred on behalf of the third party.
Secondly, the defence should also cover the offence in relation to
targeted expenditure. We think that it is important in both these cases
that those subject to regulation should have the benefit of the defence
and we will therefore bring forward amendments at Third Reading to deal
with these outstanding
anomalies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000140">Government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:32:57"></hs_TimeCode>

encouraging constituents not to vote for MPs in the general election if

a limit of £300,000; in fact, it would not be controlled
expenditure, it would be unlimited expenditure in the run-up to an
election which could be directed against or for a particular party.
Given that there are restrictions on what the political parties can
spend during that period, it is not reasonable that there should be
such a wide gap in the provisions that an unlimited amount of
expenditure could be related to a particular

reiterate that the general position is that if a campaign group wishes
to lobby Parliament and parliamentarians over legislation, that is

also highlight that the Electoral Commission does not support this
amendment. It states that such an exemption would allow unlimited
spending on a potentially wide range of topics. It believes that it
could produce significant and unintended gaps in the coverage of the

the debate. Of course, a later amendment will mean that this is
actually only a seven-and-a-half-month period. Clearly, if, as a result
of experience, people feel that the guidance has not been sufficiently
helpful, as we have provided in later amendments, there will be a
review post the 2015 election. The amendment as it stands
opens up a considerable gap and would lead to an imbalance whereas, as

regular donors by direct debit, people with an annual subscription or

legislation that we shower on the British public. There is one way of
avoiding confusion in the issue of the regulation of NGOs: to avoid
shackling charities of all organisations with duplicatory regulation
and 
<?notus-xml column=255?>thus the responsibility for two sets of regulations
and indeed regulators. Of all the groups in our society that surely do
not need that, above all others by far are charities. Although of
course the Bill is vital and it is good that amendments have been
introduced—we thank the Government for being so
receptive—it is important that we retain our civic vitality,
which, let us be honest, is languishing somewhat. However, in the
process, we must not damage that which we seek to uphold.</hs_para>

surrounding charities in relation to the Bill is quite extraordinary. I
can illustrate that by referring the House to the letter written last
night by the Charity Commission to a number of us now in the Chamber.
It deals in particular with this amendment because the Charity
Commission considers it of such importance. I confess that many of us
have been trying for some considerable while to get the Charity
Commission to come out of its shell and be clear about what it thinks
of the arguments advanced on each side of this debate. At least now we
have a letter, written by the public affairs manager of the Charity
Commission at 6.30 pm last night. Pretty early this morning, as one
might guess, I was on the telephone to seek clarification.</hs_para>

perfectly understood, and that they, the trustees, will end up being
personally liable. As I am sure everybody hearing this debate knows,
they are personally liable. It does not matter if they are a
limited-liability charity.</hs_para>

Mackay of Clashfern (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely well
aware that the Charity Commission has given us a document to say that
it is against this amendment, but the charity commissioners do not
actually do legislation; that is our responsibility. They have set out
in this missive that we got about 6.30 pm yesterday some of the reasons
for their
opposition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000197">Charities
are, as I understand it, very fully regulated by law. Charities are
those bodies that are established for charitable purposes only, and
charitable purposes are defined as falling into certain classes, with
the general provision that a charitable purpose is one that must be for
public benefit. When I got this missive and had a chance to look at it,
I e-mailed back the writer of the document asking, “Are you
saying that a charity can lawfully, under existing charity
law, engage in activities regulated by this Bill?”. I got an
e-mail back to say that he was out of the office today and that, if it
was urgent, I should ring a number. So I rang the number, and no one
answered—although these things happen, even in the best
regulated
circles<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:10:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000198">This
is an extremely important point, as I see it. Charity law is
sufficiently robust to require charities to obey the rules, which state
that they can use their expenditure and efforts only in support of or
in pursuance of their charitable purposes. As the missive
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14011578000291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000291">“Charities

the moment, I cannot see why it is necessary that the Bill applies to
charities. However, the Charity Commission, in the missive we got last
night, goes on to explain that if the charities were exempted, its task
of making sure that the charities obeyed the law in this regard would
be too much for it, particularly in an election period. The Government
have cut its budget so much that it cannot support this or do it
properly. If that is the reason for passing the responsibility for
seeing to this from a government organisation, the Charity
Commissioners—which has a very long history of 150 years or
so—on to charities, which depend on voluntary contributions for
their financial support and to a great extent for their personnel
support, it is an extremely bad one. Why should the government
organisation pass on its responsibility to ensure that this is
happening to the charities themselves and have them registered for that
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:12:39"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14011578000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000200">This
is an extremely serious matter that the Charities Commission has raised

is because it cannot be relied upon to enforce the law. There is no
question of trust in charities being damaged by propaganda and that
kind of thing. If it were shown that charities were not obeying
charitable law, that would damage trust and confidence. If the
commission does not have enough resources to pursue that
properly—as paragraph 4, I think, says—that is a problem.
I can see that if that is justified, it is a problem, but it
is a very serious problem if organisations set up to ensure that the

saying, then why on earth impose another burdensome layer of regulation
on charities? Or is the commission saying that the regulation that it
provides is not effective? I honestly think that the letter that we

on Public Administration issued reports last year recommending changes,

addition, the National Audit Office recently issued a report calling

is almost certain, therefore, that there will be significant reforms to
charity law in the near future, so if charities are taken out of the

opportunity, if necessary, to amend charity law and to see changes of
this kind in a broader and wider context at a later date. The many
arguments on why charities should be taken out of this particular Bill
stand on their own, I think, and although we are giving great deference
to the quangos, I find the comments of the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Mackay of Clashfern, and others to be compelling. Possibly we should
not be debating all those details if legislation that is specifically
about the future of charities, charity law and the Charity Commission

opposing point of view to the noble Lords who have spoken so far. Their
proposal is superficially very attractive and would be possible if the
definition in Clause 26 were different. If the definition of
“controlled expenditure” in the Bill said that it was
expenditure whose prime purpose was the promotion, or
procuring the election, of a particular candidate or party,
it would be possible to take out charities. They should be taken out
because, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, rightly said,

speak quickly and shortly to say that, while we absolutely understand
the desire to stop the bureaucracy being placed on charities, we do not
want that for other bits of the third sector either. This is why we
want a much more fundamental change which takes them out too. They also
use volunteers and have all these problems. We do not think the rest of
the voluntary sector should be caught by something which other
campaigners will not be. We are, obviously, interested in the
Government’s response, but if the 
<?notus-xml column=264?>issue is simply about dual regulation then there may be a way for the
Electoral Commission to devolve its responsibilities in this area to
the Charity Commission. However, if it could not answer its phone to

would devolve much to it at the

there is an area of activity which is completely legitimate for
charities but which will not be covered by the Charity Commission,
which only polices charitable law. Even at the moment, under PPERA,
there are a whole lot of things which charities are covered by but
which are not policed by the Charity Commission, so extra
work would be going to them. As the noble Lord, Lord Horam, said, this
clause covers work which is completely within their charitable aims
and, therefore, eligible under charitable law. To take out one part of
the voluntary sector and leave the other in is something we cannot
understand. The charities themselves did not ask for this when they
gave evidence—oral and written—to the commission chaired

position, but it is a situation in which PPERA is not changing with

so the case remains that a narrow scope of activities could be covered.
The Electoral Commission is clear that charities should not be exempt
from the PPERA regime. It highlights that such an exemption would
undermine the effectiveness of the PPERA regime and create incentives
for campaigners to carry out as much campaigning activity as possible
via charitable channels. Potentially that could have implications for
the reputations of the
charities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000240">I

Government’s view, however, is that the nature of the PPERA
test, to which I have referred, and the constraints of charity law will
mean that the circumstances in which charities are brought within the
scope of PPERA rules will be very rare. First, they must meet the PPERA
test where their activities can reasonably be regarded as intended to
promote or procure the electoral success of a party or candidate.
Secondly, if they meet this test they must incur controlled expenditure
over the registration threshold. The amendments that we will debate
later and that are being brought forward by the Government to raise the
registration threshold in essence will ensure that smaller or even
medium-size charities will not have to register with the Electoral

the importance of trying to keep the administrative burden to a
minimum. I accept that there was force in the concerns expressed when I
first became engaged in this Bill and attended meetings with my noble
friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire, in which charities said that there was
a possibility that they could do something that took them into
PPERA-controlled expenditure, with the limit at
£5,000—£2,500 in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. That might happen, without their knowing that there could be a
freeze on their activity. But limits of £20,000 for registration

charities are undertaking that level of expenditure this is neither
unreasonable nor the sort of thing that will get lost in the loose
change. It is significant expenditure. Therefore many charities will be
removed from any concern by the thresholds that we are setting. Those
approaching that level of expenditure may wish to consider whether it
is appropriate. In terms of the general core principles of
accountability and transparency in the Bill, it is important that if a
body is undertaking the kind of activity that falls within this scope
it should be accountable and transparent. In some of my
discussions with the chief executive of OSCR, 
<?notus-xml column=267?>the Scottish charities regulator, he said
that he thought that the transparency argument was
important: if two organisations were doing exactly the same thing that
brought them within the scope of the Bill or PPERA, it was wrong that
one should have to be accountable and transparent, and the other,
because it was a registered charity, should not. In transparency and
accountability terms, this departed from an objective of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0001.htm#14011578000244">Charities
have raised concerns as to what happens if a party or a candidate
adopts one of their policies. The Electoral Commission guidance is
clear on this point. If a party or a candidate adopts a
charity’s policy this will not automatically result in the
charity incurring controlled expenditure. A charity will incur
controlled expenditure only if it subsequently highlights the fact that
party A or candidate B supports its policy, or ramps up its
campaign. As such, the Government are not persuaded that there is a
compelling case to take such a significant step as to exempt charities
from the regulatory regime. It is the activities of the third party and
not the type of organisation that should be subject to regulation. I
can assure my noble friend, who raised the matter, as did other
contributors to the debate, that the regulatory regime on charities
will be explored during the review of third-party campaigning that we
have indicated, as laid out in later amendments, will take place after
the 2015

conceivably, there is a very limited range of activities that could

shall now explain how government Amendment 39 would work in
relation to third parties that operate in coalitions. The Government
cannot take full credit for this amendment, as it is inspired by and
based on that put forward in Committee by the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth. I am grateful to him, to my noble
friend Lord Tyler and to the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon,
who also tabled amendments to the rules on coalition working in
Committee, which led to a very useful and fruitful discussion. Other
than some consequential changes, government Amendment 39 leaves
unchanged the current Section 94(6) rules on coalition
campaigning.</hs_para>

introduces an entirely new provision. It has the effect that a third
party can nominate another third party, one it is in a coalition with,
to act as a “lead campaigner”. The original third party
would then become a “minor campaigner” and provided that
certain conditions are met, the minor campaigner would not then in any
way be required to account for either its own expenditure or that of
the wider coalition. Reporting to the Electoral Commission would be
done only by the lead campaigner for its own expenditure and that
incurred by the minor campaigner. The conditions that must be met
before minor third 
<?notus-xml column=271?>parties can benefit in this way from the provision,
are, first, that the minor third party’s expenditure must have
been incurred as part of a common plan under Section 94(6); that the
lead campaigner must notify the Electoral Commission of this
arrangement and provide details of the minor campaigner before any
expenditure has been incurred; and that the minor campaigner may not
itself spend more than the limits that apply to the registration
thresholds, either as part of this or another common plan, or
independently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011578000258">It
is on this last point that this amendment differs from that put down in
Committee by the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of
Pentregarth. The government amendment allows minor campaigners also to
participate in one or more coalitions and campaign independently
alongside. They must just ensure that they do not, across the various
types of campaigns, incur total spend above the registration
thresholds. Lead and minor campaigners would, of course, have to agree
among themselves appropriate arrangements to ensure that the minor
campaigner provided the lead campaigner with the necessary information
for it to report, but I hope that this give some assurance to noble
Lords that the Government have seriously considered the impact on small
campaigners and taken steps to remove unnecessary
burdens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011578000259">The
Government believe that this amendment gives campaigners greater
flexibility and better reflects the way that campaigners in coalitions
operate in practice. I hope that noble Lords will accept that this
amendment goes quite some way to addressing the concerns of those
campaigners and that the smallest campaigners will not be unduly
burdened with administrative obligations. I should add that the
Government intend to bring forward several clarifying and consequential
amendments to this provision at Third Reading. As noble Lords will
know, it was a moving feast, and while we do not intend to alter the
policy, the drafting can spell out more clearly the Government’s
intention that there should be no restriction on there being more than
one lead campaigner in an arrangement, and that the lead campaigner
would report only for any minor campaigner it had identified in a
notice. We think that this provides the flexibility that campaigners
seek.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011578000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011578000260">We also
intend to make it clearer that a lead campaigner that has notified the
Electoral Commission of this arrangement can supplement that notice to

were encouraged to work together in what were then called coalitions.
Since then, the term “coalition” has gained a
different connotation, so perhaps we should talk just about
“working together”. The way in which this matter was
handled in 2000 has caused real concerns. I know from reading
<I>Hansard</I> that this confusion was caused at the last minute by a

is curious that, over the years since 2000, very few of us seem to have

revision. However, we now know, because a large number of organisations
have been in touch with many Members of your Lordships’ House
saying that this is a real practical problem—hence the
Government’s amendment, which is excellent so far as it goes.
However, as I shall seek to explain in a moment, there is one
additional problem which I hope my noble and learned friend will be
able to say he can look at again, since, as he just said, there will be
some additional clarification at Third
Reading<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:51:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000003">As
my noble and learned friend has said, the new provisions should be a
major help to smaller players in those joint campaigns, ensuring that
others can account for their spending, but the approach in Amendment 39
does not go quite far enough. The fundamental problem with the
so-called coalition arrangements in the 2000 Act is as follows. If, let
us say, Friends of Earth intends to spend £300,000 on a campaign
about climate change and does so in coalition with, for example, Oxfam,
which contributes £25,000, under PPERA both are deemed to have
spent, or to plan to spend, £325,000. Clearly, that is absurd,
because that would mean that Oxfam, which had contributed only
£25,000 to that campaign, might well then be precluded from
doing anything else on other issues, which it is clear was not intended
by the 2000 Act and which, I hope, is not something that we would
intend to do

prevent people working together and therefore having to multiply the
spending limits under the 2000 Act by a factor equal to the number of
organisations involved seems to be most peculiar. Removing the rules
altogether would create another new loophole. I keep saying to
colleagues in the third sector, “We’ve got to be very
careful that we don’t increase flexibility for what we think is
a good cause only to create a loophole for much less meritorious
campaigning activity”. However, what is unfair about the rules
is not that some spending on common campaigns is counted together to
prevent an overall breach of the limits but the fact that spending by
one organisation on one campaign can then restrict the campaigning of
another organisation on a totally different campaign. In my example,
Oxfam would be deemed to have spent £325,000 not just for the
purposes of that climate change campaign but for all purposes. It would
then be very close to the  
<?notus-xml column=273?>limit, which would then mean that it would have to
worry about whether any of its other spending on, let us say,
development targets could,</hs_para>

amendment for charities and campaigning groups generally because they
do a huge amount of campaigning not just with one coalition but with a

want to make a point that has not been made so far in any of these
debates. It concerns the fundamental purpose of this part of the
legislation and whether it 
<?notus-xml column=274?>will achieve what the Government hope. The purpose
of the legislation at this point is to stop front organisations drawing
on large sums of money to distort campaigning, but I suggest that the
legislation as we have it now will not have that effect. Let us take a
hypothetical example. Six, very strong anti-Europeans have dinner
together. They have access to large amounts of money from
various sources. They go away to different parts of the country and
they decide to start six different campaigning organisations under
different names. But, in fact, everybody knows that their purpose is to
get Britain out of Europe. Would they be caught by this legislation?
No. I have read carefully the briefing note presented by the Electoral
Commission, which says that you are not working together—that
is, you are not engaged in co-ordinated campaigning—if you have
informal discussions with other campaigners but do not discuss your
plans with them in any detail—all this party will have done is
have dinner together; if you speak at an event organised by another
campaigner but do not participate in other ways—they could even
speak at each other’s events; and if you do not consult other
campaigners about what you should say in your campaign or how you
should organise it. However, it goes on to say that you can sign a
joint letter together. I hope that the noble and learned Lord will take
seriously the fact that the legislation as it now stands will not have
the desired effect of stopping big money coming in and using front
organisations. We firmly support the intent but we do not think that

the charities and campaigning groups, as part of the commission, very
much support the aim both of transparency and accountability, and with
that aim in mind support the extension of activities that should be
regulated and are set out in new Schedule 8A. This amendment is about
removing the background staff costs from those
activities in sub-paragraphs (3) 
<?notus-xml column=279?>to (5) of that schedule. They refer to press
conferences and media events; transport costs, when those are directed
towards obtaining publicity—for instance, a campaign bus; and
public rallies and other meetings.</hs_para>

should of course be brought into regulation, but this amendment is
about excluding the background cost: that is, the cost of the member of
staff of the third party. That is not primarily on cost grounds, but
because of the additional bureaucracy that it would involve. How do you
delineate the amount of time that the staff member spends—let us
say, on mounting a public rally—from the amount of staff time
they spend on their campaigning work
anyway?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000032">It is
easy to assess the amount of money you are going to spend on hiring the
hall for a public rally; you get an invoice for that. You do not get an
invoice for a member of staff or the 10% of their time spent over four
weeks doing that. Therefore, we think that the best thing to do is
eliminate the background staff costs from the regulated costs in those
three areas. It should be noted that the Electoral Commission
recommends the removal of all staff costs, at least for the 2015
election. We are not going as far as that; we refer only to the
background staff costs in relation to these three activities that are
being brought into regulation. I beg to move.</hs_para>

the Electoral Commission actually thinks that counting staff costs for
political parties’ election expenses would be an appropriate way
to proceed. Of course, that is not in front of us today; it may be for
another day and another Bill. For the purposes of this Bill, the NGOs
have been dealing with a considerable problem: namely, that the Bill

“background

my noble friend will no doubt point out, staff costs for non-parties
are already regulated for the production and distribution of election
material. Our amendment suggests that this should continue but that
costs should also be accounted for if they are incurred in direct
relation to canvassing voters. In that context it seems that it would
not be very difficult to identify the particular costs; equally,
however, we do not want to increase the difficulties that could be
caused by burdensome regulation on background costs that are not in any
way so easy to account for. For example, the costs in relation to
organising meeting rooms, travelling to a venue or setting up a press
conference might be a matter of a few minutes of somebody’s
time—and therefore, for many small organisations, a considerable
absurdity.</hs_para>

I do not think that anyone cares if a policy officer, whose job for the
rest of the year is something completely different, spends a little
time booking a room for an election rally, or incurs costs travelling
to it. These matters cannot be said to be likely to greatly affect the
outcome of an election in that particular area, or
nationally. However, if the regulations go through without us thinking
about the implications, they could unnecessarily tie up campaigners in
accounting for their time—and, worse still, could deter some
from campaigning at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000038">As was

whether they were employed or volunteers? Many a charity and many a

the activities that the noble and right reverend Lord seeks by his
amendment to remove from staff costs. The Bill seeks to retain the need
for staff costs to be included. As I said, I recognise that there has
been concern, first, over the unfairness of third parties having to
account for these costs when political parties do not. I think that my
noble friend Lord Tyler mentioned that. Secondly, there has been
concern about the difficulty for third parties in calculating the staff

parties having to account for these costs while political parties do
not, your Lordships will be aware that when Parliament passed the 2000
Act it felt that it would be transparent and proportionate for a third
party to account for staff time. This was on the basis that a third
party undertakes campaigning activities other than simply political
campaigning, and where a third party enters into political campaigning
its spending for those purposes should be fully transparent. I am sure
that that was the underlying thinking behind the 2000 Act. I would at
least hope that someone who is employed by the Liberal Democrats during
an election is actually working for the Liberal Democrats. Indeed, I am
sure that the other parties would hope the same on behalf of their
staff. It is as transparent as it possibly can be.</hs_para>

that such costs can be accounted for without becoming overly

definitions than it merited, particularly if we had a de minimis

the calculation of staff costs by virtue of paragraph

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> I am disappointed with the noble
and learned Lord’s reply. This was a very simple step that the
Government could have taken to ease the regulatory burden on charities
and campaigning groups. It is disappointing. He stressed the fact that
staff costs were already in PPERA. With due respect, that is no good
reason for continuing them, if we have an opportunity to improve that
Act and make it not just workable but one which eases the burden on
charities and campaigning groups.</hs_para>

that the Electoral Commission had found it possible to regulate this,
but the fact is, as he knows, that charities and campaigning groups
find this whole area very burdensome. I really do not see how the
Electoral Commission can possibly police this area and work out what
percentage of the time has been allotted, let us say, to the mounting
of a public rally. What kind of receipts or statements is it going to
get from the charity concerned? I am afraid that I find it very
disappointing and I would like to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para>

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the aspects of the
Bill that has received considerable attention and debate during our
discussions, not only in your

registration thresholds, spending limits and constituency
limits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000056">On
registration thresholds, the point has been made repeatedly that small
campaigners who do not incur much expenditure would be brought into the

that the Government have been considering this issue for some time.
Indeed, my noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire gave a commitment on
the first day in Committee that the thresholds would be revised.
Extensive debate in Committee followed, at which representations were
made to either revert to the existing PPERA thresholds, or to raise
them further. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Hodgson and to the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, for leading
that highly useful
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000058">The
Government have considered this matter and the appropriate level for
registration thresholds further. Amendment 46 proposes to raise the
levels to £20,000 in England and £10,000 in Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie,
has tabled an amendment proposing those levels be set at £20,000
for each constituent part of our United Kingdom. I simply observe that
the Government’s amendment represents not only a substantial
increase from the levels currently in the Bill, but reflects the
original structure where the amounts were higher in England than in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, no doubt due to the fact that
there is a substantially greater number of constituencies and voters in
England than in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Nevertheless,
this is still a significant increase not only for England, but for
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and it doubles the current
registration thresholds in PPERA.</hs_para>

effectively exclude from the controls those campaigners who incur only
small amounts of money. They will be able to campaign as they currently

in mind what not only noble Lords but people outside
sometimes hear in general debates or see in e-mails, it is also
important to point out that these are thresholds for registration. It
has sometimes been represented that there are limits on what
organisations can spend, but the thresholds for registration are
consistent with our objective of promoting transparency and
accountability. We are maintaining the constituency limit of
£9,750 throughout the regulated period to prevent a third party
focusing a significant amount of its spending power on a small part of
the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000061">Amendment
46 also specifies that, where a third party spends £9,750 in a
constituency, it must register with the Electoral Commission. This is
to ensure that the offence of spending more than £9,750 in a
constituency is fully effective. I know my noble friend Lord Tyler is
particularly interested in that point. As constituency
limits apply only in relation to regulated periods
involving 
<?notus-xml column=288?>a parliamentary general election, so the constituency threshold will
have effect only in relation to such periods. We recognise
that the current draft does not accurately reflect this, and the
Government will accordingly bring forward an amendment at Third Reading
to correct
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000062">In
contrast, my noble friend Lord Tyler has proposed that rather than
require a constituency registration threshold of £9,750, the
registration threshold should be only £5,000. Reintroducing a
lower constituency threshold than £9,750, as proposed by my
noble friend, would only reinsert an extra layer of bureaucracy and
confusion, particularly as the Government have also tabled Amendment
53, which would remove a post-dissolution limit of
£5,850<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:49:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
The government amendment means that campaigners may spend the entire
£9,750 throughout the regulated period, or just in the last few
weeks before the election. Having just one constituency limit will be a
much more straightforward and easier regulation to
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:50:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

limits, campaigners and Members of your Lordships’ House have
sought to retain third parties’ spending limits at either the
existing PPERA amounts, or even beyond those. The noble and learned
Lord, Lord Hardie, and the noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries of Pentregarth, were clear on this point when we addressed
this issue in Committee. The spending limits in the Bill for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland have particularly concerned campaigners.
It has been argued that third-party campaigning in any part
of the UK generally has a fixed cost; leaflets, for example, cost the
same whether printed in Wales or England, and billboards cost the same,
whether they are placed in Scotland or Northern Ireland. As
a result, the spending limits for Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland were felt to be disproportionately low. It is with
that in mind that government Amendment 47 would uplift those limits by
an extra £20,000 each. This would mean that there would be a
spending limit of £55,400 in Scotland, £44,000 in Wales
and £30,800 in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000064">The
Bill proposes spending limits for each of the parts of the UK, which
add up to £450,000. It is important to remind your Lordships
that while these limits were initially to be over not quite a
year—from the day after the European elections—if your
Lordships approve our amendment which we will debate later, these will
apply over the length of the reduced seven-and-a-half-month regulated
period, which is also reflected in another government amendment. In
fact, therefore, there is a larger amount in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland over a shorter period. Indeed, the amount for England
is over a shorter period.</hs_para>

sought to explain that considerable amounts of campaigning can still be
undertaken for that amount. In Committee, I gave the example of
£390,000 buying a campaigner 40 million leaflets, a dozen
front-page adverts in a national newspaper or even 780,000 telephone
calls from a professional phone bank. I hope that noble Lords will
agree that these government amendments as a whole will lead to a
substantial increase in the registration thresholds and a significant
uplift to the limits in the Bill for campaigning by third parties in
Scotland, Wales and Northern

Hardie (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, before speaking to the amendment in
my name, I thank the Government and the noble and learned Lord the
Advocate-General for listening to the concerns from all sides of the
House about the original proposal in the Bill to reduce the existing
thresholds for registration as a recognised third party. The government
amendment addresses these concerns and, rather than reducing the
limits, they have accepted that the limits should be increased. It is

does not address the anomaly that I mentioned in Committee,
caused by having different registration thresholds for England and the
rest of the United Kingdom. My amendment would remedy that by having
the same registration thresholds throughout the United Kingdom. I noted
that the Minister suggested that the distinction between
England and the rest of the United Kingdom was
the larger number of constituencies and voters. It is
important to appreciate that there is a distinction that
should be drawn between total expenditure by third parties in each
constituent part of the United Kingdom, as against expenditure limits

distinction must be drawn between the various countries when one
considers the total expenditure by a recognised third party in each
country. That distinction reflects the number of parliamentary
constituencies in each country and the greater number of voters in
England than in any of the other three countries. That is the point
that has been addressed since the 2000 Act, and is preserved in that
Act, notwithstanding the amendments, in paragraph 3(2) of Schedule

for registration is different. There is no justification for
distinguishing between the different countries in this respect. The
distinction was introduced in the 2000 Act, which followed the fifth
report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life on the funding of
political parties in the United Kingdom, which was presented to
Parliament in October 1998. I referred to this in Committee
and will not repeat these references. However, in Committee I explained
that that report and the Government’s response to it never
suggested any distinction between the different countries. There was a
reference in a footnote which suggested that the reduced figure of
£10,000 across the United Kingdom might be more significant in
the three countries other than England, but it did not go as far as
suggesting that there should be a difference.</hs_para>

people from engaging in effective political debate about issues that

group of individuals in the constituency wish to make this an issue at
the general election but stop short of fielding their own candidate. If
some candidates in that election support the retention of the hospital

controlled expenditure. If this occurs in England, the pressure group
can spend £20,000 before the need for registration and the
administrative burden that entails, but if it occurs in Scotland, Wales
or Northern Ireland, it can spend only £10,000. The expenses of
running such a campaign in Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish
constituencies will be similar to those in many English
constituencies. Do the Government seriously suggest that the cost of
transport to meetings or venues of meetings in every English

final point is that my amendment is not academic. Apart from being fair
to all people across the United Kingdom who wish to campaign in the
course of a general election about a matter of local importance to
them, there is also a question of perhaps greater significance: that
the consequences of not registering but exceeding the registration
threshold are a criminal offence under Section 94 of the 2000 Act. Why
should electors face prosecution in Edinburgh, Cardiff or Belfast for
spending £6,000 on a campaign without registering as recognised

this last-minute change to the Government’s position, however,
there is one new outstanding problem. The interaction between the
national thresholds for registration and the constituency limits in the

I believe very strongly that the constituency limits are a very
important part of this Bill. Indeed, I am sure Members on all sides of
your Lordships’ House are aware that if we did send back to the
other place a Bill that did not deal with this point, many people there

limits to be effective, those who spend at a constituency level will
surely need to make an expenses return about what they are spending.
The rules in the 2000 Act and in the Bill rightly also
ask where the money is coming from. There is,
however, 
<?notus-xml column=291?>a problem. As the Bill will stand in the light of
these new government amendments, someone could be spending
£9,750 in a constituency, or indeed could spend £19,500
across two English constituencies, yet would not have to register. The
registration limit is now raised to £20,000, and therefore that
spending and its sources would be totally opaque. It would not be
transparent even though £9,750 could have a significant impact

my own amendments on thresholds in Committee, I suggested that this
problem could be dealt with by stipulating that the threshold should be
at a particular level which would take that into account. The
Government have chosen £20,000, and that is fine, except that
all the spending could be concentrated in one target marginal
constituency. A group could spend a significant sum—I am
suggesting £5,000 in my amendment—all in one place.
Surely in those circumstances it should have to

Government’s answer has been that somebody who spends more than
£9,750 in one constituency will be committing an offence under
their proposals. If that someone does not have to register, because he
is below the new registration threshold, how can anyone know that he is
committing that offence? I cannot think—and I know a little bit
about these things—of any other part of electoral law in which
someone who is subject to a spending limit is yet not required to

recent experience of these things. The normal figure is around
£12,000 during the election period. As I will come to in a
moment, that could be swamped under these proposals, and therefore this
is an absurd anomaly. I understand why the Government have arrived at
their position. Their formula sounds simple, but it may be so simple as
to be unequal to the task in hand. Equally, the move in Amendment 53 to
do away with different limits for constituency spending seven months
before an election, and constituency spending seven days before, seems
to me to lose what is an important and not particularly complex
distinction in the name of simplicity—and I am not sure the
Government have got this right.</hs_para>

than anything else to reassure the smaller charities; we give the
Government a very warm thank you. We also warmly welcome the raising of
the spending cap for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The spending
cap for England, unlike that for Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland,
has been reduced by 60%. That reduction has taken place with an

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, I will add just a few words to what I
said a few minutes ago. I fought 12 general elections, in 10
of which I was elected, to go to the other place. In every one of those
the expenditure that I was allowed was very clearly defined. The
returns 
<?notus-xml column=293?>that one had to make afterwards were minutely
examined, and there have been cases within our memory where candidates
have been challenged on their returns because they were a little
careless in submitting them. We have to be extremely careful. The last
election I fought was in 2005, and if I remember rightly I was
allowed to spend around £8,000 or
£9,000. My noble friend says that it is now about
£12,000, and I accept that—I am sure he is right. It was
all very carefully defined, and we have to be careful, much as we all
want to protect free speech and engagement in campaign and
all the rest of it, that the expenditure of candidates who stand for
particular political parties or as independents is not put into the
shade by the expenditure that is allowed to campaigning organisations
within individual constituencies. Although I do not suppose that my
noble friend Lord Tyler will push his amendment to the vote, I hope
that the Minister will reflect upon what he and I have

I have always felt that not enough attention is paid to the real danger
of our fragile system of controlling election expenditure beginning to
break down altogether. I am strongly in favour of charities having the
right to campaign and being free to speak out about what they
believe—that is absolutely right—and a huge contribution
is made to us as a society in that way. Frankly, however, I am
frightened that here, on the edge of the Third Reading of the Bill, we
have observed and commented upon two huge anomalies that are still with
us and still in the Bill, which open the door to the misuse of some
aspects of the Bill in a way that would make the holding of that line
against the misuse of public and private expenditure very difficult to
hold<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:12:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000090">Throughout
my whole political life I have been very conscious, like the noble
Lord, Lord Cormack, of the importance of the restrictions on the amount

genuinely a democracy of the right of every individual to vote. Some of
my colleagues in this House will know that I have been very much
affected by the recent history of the United States, having been for 10
years an elective politics professor at Harvard, between 1986 and 1996.

2010, the American Supreme Court decided to lift all restrictions on

of that—a decision that was made, let the House not forget, in
2010—was that in 2012 no less than $6 billion was
poured into federal elections in the United States in a one-year
electoral cycle. That was not enough. The sweeping away of all those
restrictions was based upon the constitutional right of free speech, in
my view distorted in a very troubling way. Today, the Supreme Court of
2014 has on its agenda yet another proposal, McCutcheon v Federal
Election Commission, which would enable any individual, without
restriction, to contribute any amount he or she wishes to the election
of an individual named federal candidate—in other words, it is

this debate trouble me very much. One is the example given by my noble
friend with regard to the possibility of piling together expenditure in
one or a small number of constituencies. The wording of the Bill
adequately defends against that real temptation, which could have a
major effect in the case of particular named persons that others would
like to see taken away from Parliament. The second danger was reflected
in the very wise remarks of the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord
Harries of Pentregarth, when he gave us the example of a number of
individuals who met for dinner together who decided each to set up
their own particular little group and that that little group would then
go for a particular objective. There would be nothing to link the two

do not wish to detain the House at this late hour, but those anomalies
are still only too patently with us. They open an opportunity for
serious misuse of the Bill and of the electoral expenditure system.
Given what we as a House and the other place have been through as
regards other expenses, it is vital that we make sure that those
anomalies are dealt with, that the Government consider what to do about
them, and that before this legislation passes into history, serious
thought is given to how the Electoral Commission in the non-charity
field can make moves to try to look into any questions of this

rather dramatic fact. In the United States a special element in the
American tax system enables non-party, non-governmental organisations
to contribute to electoral expenditure on the basis of being
exactly what we have been talking about—non-party,
non-governmental organisations. That has seen expenditure of that
source rise from $10 million in 1988 to $470 million last year, and
rising. It has become the most significant single source of expenditure

organisations. We should be

of the welcome that has been given to the very significant increase in
the registration thresholds that the Government have brought forward
and to the uplift in the spending limit in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland. To follow on from my noble friend Lady Williams, it is
certainly useful to remind ourselves, as she also did very eloquently
in Committee, of the core purpose of the Bill, which is 
<?notus-xml column=295?>to ensure that our electoral and democratic system is not hijacked by
people who can spend large amounts of money without proper
accountability, and that there is proper transparency. It is important

that is consistent with the point made by my noble friend Lord Tyler,
which I addressed in my opening remarks, on not wanting a particular
constituency to be overwhelmed. He proposed a threshold of
£5,000 and said that he did not wish to find a situation where
an organisation could come rattling into a constituency with one week
to go, spend £19,999, get away with it and not be accountable
for that. It is important that the Representation of the People Act
might have a certain impact on that kind of expenditure, if it offended
that Act; under the Bill that expenditure is increased from £500
to £700. I ask my noble friend to reflect on that, although I
know that he does not overlook it as he knows full well about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000098">But, more
importantly, there is not that kind of loophole. My noble friend seems
to have overlooked—and I did try to draw his attention to it in
my opening remarks —that it will be an offence under
the Bill to spend more that £9,750 in a constituency,
even where the RPA does not apply. One of the consequences of a
situation where we are amending another piece of legislation
is that it is not always self-evident. Amendment 46

for each constituency to make more effective the criminal sanction that
will follow if a party or third party spends in excess of

is a fair question as to why there is such a difference. I think one of
the reasons, which I gave at the outset, is that there is a difference
in the number of voters and number of constituencies. It is also the
case that spending of less than £20,000 could have a more
significant impact in, say, Northern Ireland, which is a very compact
area with a very focused media. Spending of less than £20,000
could have a much more significant impact there than in England, and I
suspect that the different political and media circumstances was one of
the considerations as to why the difference came about in the first

are one or two points made by the noble and learned Lord that I could
not quite follow. He said that if there was a hospital closure in a
particular constituency, a pressure group could spend up to
£20,000 in England but just under £10,000 in Scotland. Of
course, following on from the debate that we have just had about
constituency limits, they would be restricted to £9,750 in
Scotland, Wales, England and Northern Ireland regarding the kind of
example that 
<?notus-xml column=297?>he gave. He suggested—I apologise if I
misheard him—that someone could be prosecuted for spending
£6,000 in campaign expenditure in Edinburgh but not in, for
example, Birmingham. I think that he will accept that, with a
£10,000 threshold, that would not happen in either Birmingham or
Edinburgh. I do not think that I misheard him, but sometimes people get

for supporters of political parties to demonstrate their backing by
diverting their funding to an aligned third party and away from the
political parties themselves, which have their own limits. I do not

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment, which I am moving on
behalf of a number of noble Lords in different parts of the House,
deals with some small changes to a previous amendment that we looked at
in Committee on constituency limits, but they are changes that I know
will be very welcome to a number of organisations which have been in
touch with several Members of your Lordships’ House. It received
considerable support across the Chamber in Committee and has two
compelling advantages to recommend

Government’s intention to have a constituency limit. That is
surely central to the Bill. As I have said consistently, I strongly
support that and I know that a large number of other Members of your 
<?notus-xml column=299?>Lordships’ House also think it is important to retain that.
However, even if we were to take it out, as some have suggested, I
would certainly expect that Members of the other place would need no
whipping at all to put it back in, for the reasons that were advanced
so eloquently by my noble friend Lord Cormack a few minutes ago. Surely
even Labour MPs would want it to be put

second advantage to the amendment is that it very closely and carefully
defines what the constituency limits should apply to. As many charities
and NGOs, big and small, have pointed out to me and to other Members of
your Lordships’ House, they are not used to dealing with
constituency boundaries; they have quite a different sort of geography
from those of us who are involved in politics. Therefore, trying to
assess the relative effect of, say, a rally in different constituencies
would be quite problematic. It would be problematic for the political
parties too, and for that reason we, as politicians, are not asked to
account for it.</hs_para>

shall give a practical example. I once chaired a rally for the five
constituencies, as they then were, in Cornwall, and it took place in
one particular constituency. It just so happened that we won all five
seats but that did not have anything to do with my chairmanship at that
rally. However, how would the costs of that rally be allocated to each
constituency? You could allocate the costs to one constituency but what
about the other four? That clearly is not what this Bill is all about.
It really is not possible to measure the effect of a rally, or indeed a
billboard or a press conference, on the result in an individual

Davids—although they did not always see eye to eye. That caused
me a great deal of aggro. However, how I would ever have accounted for

leaflets sent or delivered to voters, or telephone calls directed
specifically to them—and which try to influence or ascertain
their voting intention. Other activity would still have to be accounted

the amendment. It is not the provision’s intention that we have
problems with but its workability. It will add an enormous bureaucratic
burden. When people campaign against the proposed path of HS2, flight
paths around Heathrow or fracking and so on, that is not divided up by
constituency. It is strange that a Government who are cutting red tape
elsewhere, and who on Monday said that they could not possibly ask
special advisers to list their meetings with lobbyists, seem to want
this for really small organisations. Amendment 52, which limits the
requirement to telephone calls and literature aimed at households, is
immensely sensible. I hope that the Government will do one of two

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, we have just had a
discussion on constituency limits, and it was also covered extensively
in Committee. The House has agreed to a government amendment to remove
the post-Dissolution limit to make the provision less complex, yet
there remains some concern about it. From what 
<?notus-xml column=301?>was said in a previous debate, I think that my noble friends Lord
Cormack and Lord Tyler believe that there should be some limit on
constituency spending. My noble friend Lord Tyler argued for a lower
limit but now wants lots of expenditure to be incurred without any
limit at all. That is a concern that we have.</hs_para>

this in context. Constituency spending limits do not replace the
existing controls under the Representation of the People Act 1983.
Those long-standing rules stipulate that third parties campaigning for
or against a particular candidate may spend only up to £500 in
doing so. Other than raising that amount to £700, and requiring
records to be kept of such expenditure, this Bill does not affect those
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000126">In
contrast to the RPA rules, Clause 28 introduces a new limit on how much
a third party that is promoting the electoral success of parties, or
candidates who support particular positions, can spend in individual
constituencies. As has already been explained, the limit is
£9,750. The reason for this amount—which might, on the
surface, appear somewhat odd—is that is equivalent to 0.05% of
the maximum campaign expenditure limit applied to political parties.
This limit will apply for the duration of the regulated period for a UK
parliamentary
election.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000127">As
has already been rehearsed, the need for constituency limits is
profound. It is not right that candidates and parties should
effectively be bowled out of the field purely because well funded
campaigners are able to outspend them. Elections are the principal
domain of political parties and candidates, and those who are not
campaigning for their own electoral success should still be able to
participate: that is the essence of our democracy. However, in these
circumstances, we believe that the voices of such campaigners do not
diminish the voices of the political parties and candidates and that
constituency limits will ensure
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000128">The Bill
makes clear that a third party’s expenditure would be wholly
attributed to a constituency only if that expenditure had
“no significant effect” in any other constituency. That
means expenditure in a local area could, of course, be attributed to
several constituencies if the effect was felt in them all. Expenditure
with a wider regional, or even national, reach would be attributed
proportionately to all the relevant constituencies.</hs_para>

Tyler has proposed an amendment to dampen the effect of these
constituency limits. The amendment proposes that only certain costs
—in other words, only expenditure related to certain
activities—should count towards constituency limits.
Specifically, the amendment says that only costs associated with
election materials should be counted. That would mean the costs related
to leaflets, mailshots and adverts, all of which must also have been
either specifically addressed to or delivered to households in a
constituency, and unsolicited telephone calls to such
households<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:41:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which my noble friend is trying to address, but I believe there are
drawbacks. For instance, significant activities such as rallies and
events would not be regulated at a constituency level if his amendment
passed. I gave some of my colleagues an example of Scottish Liberal
Democrat pre-election 
<?notus-xml column=302?>rallies in Edinburgh East. Anyone who knows Scotland will know that
Liberal Democrats would not be spending money in that constituency; no
doubt Edinburgh East Liberal Democrats will now write to me and say,
“Do not let us down”. That was a national campaign, but
an event in my own former constituency could not, by any stretch of the
imagination, relate to any other—not even Caithness, Sutherland

otherwise distributed or displayed would also not count towards the
constituency limit. A third party could therefore freely distribute
leaflets by hand in a town centre, or, indeed, in shopping areas in
different parts of a constituency, in the knowledge that, because they
are not being delivered to voters’ homes, the associated costs
need not be accounted for in that constituency’s
limit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011597000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#14011597000132">We are
concerned that these are key gaps which would allow a third party to
target an area by holding large partisan events, or flood an area by

my noble friend spoke so eloquently earlier. For that reason, I urge my

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 52A
concerns constituency spending limits. It proposes that the spending
limit for constituencies, instead of being 0.05%, is 0.1013%. I think
your Lordships are well aware that campaigning groups and charities
have found the regulation regarding constituencies exceedingly
burdensome and the Electoral Commission has found them unenforceable.
We take very seriously all that the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, has
said about ensuring that big money does not come in. Nevertheless, we
think that the constituency limits are too low. Raising them by this
percentage, which reflects the wider percentage of caps, would give
that greater degree of freedom which the charities and campaigning
groups would like. I beg to

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth, has tabled an amendment
which would raise the constituency limits from being the equivalent of
0.05% of the maximum campaign expenditure limit applied to political
parties to 0.1013%. This would amount to almost
£20,000—specifically, £19,753.50. As the noble
Baroness indicated, we have already debated the issues on constituency
limits. I have explained the necessity of constituency limits being in
place. Without these limits in place, a third party could otherwise be
able to focus the entirety of its spending power on a small part of the
United Kingdom, outspending even candidates and parties in that
location. That point was forcefully made by my noble friends Lord
Cormack and Lord Tyler. It is important that those limits are set at an
appropriate level and it is our view that the noble Lord’s
amendment would not be
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T20:18:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000007">I
will not repeat the earlier points. We wish to promote accountability
and transparency. Constituency limits relate to campaigning for or
against a particular party and instances where a campaign is intended,
or may reasonably be regarded as intended, to support groups of
candidates who might hold particular views or support particular
policies. Where such campaigning is subject to a national limit, it is
also right that it is subject to a proposed constituency limit but we
believe that that must be at a proportionate level. The comments we
heard in earlier debates suggest that the limit we have set is too
generous. Indeed, even my noble friend Lord Tyler might think it.
However, we think that the limit we have set is proportionate,
especially as we have removed the distinction between spending
throughout the regulated period and spending during
the period 
<?notus-xml column=304?>between the dissolution and election day. The limits are intended to
remove undue influence, particularly by those campaigners who can
afford to spend significant amounts of money. I do not believe that the
noble and right reverend Lord’s proposal would be proportionate.
It could allow substantial sums of money—sums, as we have heard,
such as £12,000, which is the candidate’s limit. To have
a third-party sum that is almost half as much again does not appear to
be proportionate. I therefore urge the noble Lord to withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T20:19:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Harries of Pentregarth" PimsId="5112" UID="140115103000474" xid="1957" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000474">Lord
Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> My Lords, I can well appreciate
the noble and learned Lord’s answer to that. The issue that is
continually raised by the commission I chair is the rationale for
always linking third-party spending and regulation to political-party
spending and regulation. That has never really been fully
set out. I take the point that the noble and learned Lord has made but
I hope that he will take on board the fact that there is continuing
concern among charities and campaigning groups about constituency
spending, and not just the spending of the regulation for campaigning
in constituencies. As the noble and learned Lord knows, there is also
great concern in the Electoral Commission. Even if he is not prepared
to consider this amendment again, will he look seriously at Amendment
52 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Tyler? That would help
significantly. If he is not sympathetic to my amendment, I hope that he
might be able to look again at Amendment 52 and bring
something back in relation to it. With that, I beg leave to withdraw

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, these amendments address
concerns raised by noble Lords in Committee and by campaigning groups
in the discussions we have had with them. It is important to guard
against the risk that significant donors might use third parties to aid
political parties and evade the party spending controls. That is why at
present third parties campaigning nationally during regulated elections
are subject to rules on donations similar to those of political
parties.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140115103000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000014">However, recognised
third parties need to report only donations related to controlled
spending, and currently are required to do this only once at the end of
every campaign, as part of a return to the Electoral Commission after
the relevant election, rather than at the regular intervals required of
the political parties. Therefore, Clause 32 introduces important
measures to improve transparency by ensuring that people know the
source of reportable donations received by third parties during the
regulated period via quarterly and weekly donation
reports.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000015">I
hope that noble Lords support the principle of providing information on
reportable donations during the election campaign. However, the
Government acknowledged in Committee that the right balance needed to
be struck between increased transparency and the avoidance of overly
burdensome reporting requirements. As set out in the Bill, only third
parties that are required to register with the Electoral Commission are
required to provide reports on the donations they receive. The
amendments that this House agreed earlier today to increase the
registration thresholds mean that only third parties which incur
controlled expenditure of more than £20,000 in England or more
than £10,000 in each of Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland will
have to produce donation reports.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140115103000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000016">Furthermore,
government Amendments 81 and 89 remove the need for recognised third
parties to provide nil reports. Instead, a recognised third party will
be required to provide a donations report to the Electoral Commission
only when they receive a reportable donation. Only donations over
£7,500 are reportable. If a third party does not receive a
reportable large donation, they will not have to provide a
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000017">The
Government have also brought forward amendments to take account of snap
general elections. The Government accept that these provisions, while
important in the regulated period for an election the date of which is
known in advance, may cause problems if they were to be applied to an
early parliamentary election. If a snap general election were to occur,
third parties would have to provide weekly reports to the Electoral
Commission only during the post-dissolution period, and then only if
they receive a reportable donation. They would not have to prepare
quarterly reports.</hs_para>

that these amendments meet the concerns of charities, particularly in
relation to the removal of nil reporting, which was a key area of
concern for both the NCVO and the Commission on Civil Society and
Democratic Engagement. They retain the vital transparency measures
introduced by the Bill, but ensure that unnecessary burdens are not
placed on
campaigners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000019">I
apologise to my noble friend Lord Hodgson, who asked me about nil
returns in the debate we had on coalitions. I assure him that if a
coalition spends less than the registration threshold, it will not have
to produce a spending return. If a coalition does not
receive a donation, it will not have to provide a nil
return.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000020">At
present, recognised third parties have to provide details of their
campaign income and expenditure to the Electoral Commission
after a UK general parliamentary election and after the poll for
certain other elections. Campaigners pointed out that many third
parties register with the Electoral Commission with the intention of
incurring controlled expenditure but at the end of the regulated period
find that they have not spent above the registration threshold. While
it is important to ensure transparency in spending any donations, we
have listened carefully to the concerns of campaigners and, as I have
said previously, we do not want to impose unnecessary administrative
burdens, particularly on small campaigners.</hs_para>

provisions are proportionate, government Amendment 98 provides that a
third party which registers with the Electoral Commission but does not
incur controlled expenditure in excess of the required registration
threshold does not have to submit a spending return or a statement of
accounts. The intention is that a recognised third party should also
have to prepare a report if its expenditure in a constituency, in the
case of a regulated period involving a parliamentary election, exceeds
the constituency threshold that will from now on apply to
non-recognised third parties. We recognise that the amendment does not
currently do that so we will bring forward a small amendment at Third
Reading to put that right.</hs_para>

transparency by providing a clearer understanding of the finance of
those involved in elections and to align the reporting requirements of
third parties more closely with those of political parties, the Bill
provides that a statement of accounts should also be submitted to the
Electoral Commission. To ensure that this additional obligation is
proportionate, individuals would be excluded from this requirement. The
Government believe that not to exclude individuals would result in an
unwarranted intrusion into their personal financial matters. However,
individuals who exceed the spending threshold would still be required
to provide details of their campaign income and expenditure, as is
currently the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000023">Under
the Bill as introduced, the Government also provided that those third
parties, such as companies, charities and trade unions, which provide
statements of accounts under another legislative framework that could
be reviewed by the Commission would also be exempt from any requirement
to provide a separate set of accounts.</hs_para>

108 to 111 make minor amendments to improve the working of this
arrangement. Government Amendment 112 provides that a statement of
accounts can be sent to the Electoral Commission in a longer timeframe:
within nine months of the end of the regulated period where they do not

amendments. I said at Second Reading that the Government and, indeed,
the House, have a very difficult task in getting exactly the right
balance between improving transparency and accountability on one hand
and the inevitable potential for more bureaucracy. These amendments are
a real improvement on where we were and I commend my noble and learned
friend for them. The irony is, however, that we have the complexity of
the number of amendments—I have not counted them—that
have been necessary to remove complexity. It is a bit alarming, but I
particularly welcome the amendment concerning the nil return, which is
Amendment 98 if I have got it
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000027">It is

that are caught by the Bill. This is a good balance and we are
achieving the right threshold for transparency and accountability, but
I just forewarn my noble and learned friend that it will take some time
for the organisations that we have all been in contact with to

amendments that have been put forward by the Government, as far as they
go, but as the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, said, there
is more work to be done and it would be excellent if the Government
would commit to come back at Third Reading with further amendments.
This might seem a bit curmudgeonly, because the Government have
received plaudits throughout our debate this afternoon for having moved
a long way and tabled many amendments. However, if it had not been for
the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, his commission, which
has also received praise this afternoon, and the excellent work that it
has done, the Bill would still be the exceedingly bad Bill that it was
when it arrived in our House, precisely because it was rushed, did not
have proper pre-legislative scrutiny and a great deal of it was not
necessary. So while I thank the Government for having
listened—and they have moved—I place on record that none
of that would have happened without the noble and right reverend Lord,
Lord Harries, and his fellow commissioners, who undertook the
consultation that the Government themselves should have undertaken in
the first place.</hs_para>

there is currently no such exemption at local government elections.
Given<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T20:38:52"></hs_TimeCode> the
generally low expenses limits that apply at those elections, recipients
of the fund are likely to find themselves in the unusual and punitive
position of having their entire expenses limit taken up by fund awards.
It is a distinct unfairness that disabled candidates should have to
account for costs associated with their disability when campaigning in
elections. The Government therefore brought forward secondary
legislation last year so that fund awards would be excluded from
candidates’ spending limits at all elections. That secondary
legislation will cease to have effect in June this year. The Government
therefore consider that the Bill presents a key opportunity to make
such an exclusion permanent, while also rationalising the position of
personal expenses across various elections.</hs_para>

exclude disability expenses financed by fund payments from
candidates’ limits, as the order does, this amendment instead
extends the personal expenses exemption to local elections, including
parish and community council elections, in England and
Wales. It will cover any disability-related expenses incurred by a
candidate personally, regardless of whether they are financed by the
fund. This is a sensible amendment. It seems unfair to require that
disability costs should count towards candidates’ spending
limits at local elections when they are already excluded from certain
other
elections.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0002.htm#140115103000042">Amendment

Minister must appoint a person to review the operation of Part 6 of

the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, and my noble friend
Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, who tabled amendments in Committee to
ensure that this important matter was discussed. As was explained
during Committee, it is right that an assessment should be made of the
entire system of rules governing third-party campaign expenditure. That
assessment should of course extend to the changes made by the Bill. The
entire range of existing and newly introduced rules should be carefully
reviewed after their first operation, which is expected to be at the
2015 UK parliamentary general election. A commitment was given by my
noble and learned friend that an amendment would therefore be brought
forward at Report to require a review of the operation of
Part 6 of PPERA as it is amended by Part 2 of this Bill.
That is indeed what the Government have now done. The next scheduled
general election presents the first opportunity at which all the
third-party campaigning rules will be in operation, and it is a timely
opportunity to review the effectiveness of those
rules.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000046">The

a reviewer should be appointed sufficiently ahead of the general
election to allow him or her to fully assess the operation of the
rules. The amendment requires that on completion, the person carrying
out the review must produce a written report. That report must then be
laid before Parliament by the Minister. I am sure that noble Lords will
agree that it is only right that Parliament should have the opportunity
to consider how to respond to the findings in the report. Noble Lords
will also have noted that in its most recent parliamentary briefing,
the Electoral Commission gave its support to the amendment.</hs_para>

on having brought this forward. It is really important, because so much
of what we have been discussing is supposition. We are peering into the
fog of the future concerning how things will work out. This will be a
chance to see what the reality is. I have just one question. The
amendment talks about the person—the lucky person—who
will presumably be imposed for about a year, if they start in March
2015. There will be the aftermath of the general election, and the
returns required after that will be six to nine months later, so they
will have to be in post for a year.</hs_para>

undertake such reviews is access to skilled manpower and a team who can
help them. No matter what he or she is paid, if they are trying to do
it on their own, they will undoubtedly be in a much weakened position.
I assume, but I want to have it confirmed, that the amendment implies
that adequate manpower resources will be available to the reviewer to
ensure that he or she can carry out their work and appropriate
investigations. I think it is an excellent

campaign. They are likely, at grass-roots level, to know more
than—with great respect—most leading lawyers or leading
statesmen are likely to know. I very hope that it will be indicated to
the person who conducts the review that he or she will be expected to
invite evidence from people who are standing for Parliament and to

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> It is a great relief to be able to
welcome an amendment without any qualification at all; but it might be
worth reminding ourselves why a review is so essential. First, with the
existing PPERA, most charities were not even aware that they were
regulated; it is only recently that they have come up against it.
Therefore, there are fundamental problems with PPERA that have only
just been revealed, and probably we have not yet had proper time to put
them right.</hs_para>

a very short time to think about and amend the Bill before us. As we
know, there was no pre-legislative scrutiny and no six-month period for
consultation—which we recommended. We have had only a very short
five-week period. The commission that I chair has always made it clear
that the recommendations we put forward were only for the
2015 
<?notus-xml column=317?>election, because we could not see the answer to a
number of issues. In particular, the issue of coalition working keeps
coming up and we have not yet found a satisfactory answer to that.
Therefore, it is extremely good that the review body is going to be set
up and that it will be in time to watch what happens with the election.
It is going to have to report within a year, which of course meets the
concern raised earlier by the noble Baroness about a sunset clause. It

forewarned of all the problems with the 2000 Act that have now come to

Perhaps<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T20:54:01"></hs_TimeCode> I should
clarify at the beginning of my contribution what my amendment would do.
It would incentivise a system of donations by individuals by allowing
taxpayers to reclaim the basic rate of tax on their donations to
political parties. 
<?notus-xml column=319?>It would limit the relief to the standard rate and operate in the same

issue has had much support over the years from all political parties
and all the organisations associated with political debate. The
Committee on Standards in Public Life, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord
Neill of Bladen, recommended essentially this amendment in 1998, some
15 years ago. The Electoral Commission’s report of 2004 on the
funding of political parties recommended a similar change in the law,
with a £200 cap. In 2006 the Constitutional Affairs Committee in
the House of Commons made a similar recommendation in line with my
amendment. The Conservative Party’s Tyrie report of 2006,
entitled <I>Clean Politics</I>, also made reference to an amendment of
this nature. In 2004 the Liberal Democrats called for a scheme of tax
relief of a similar nature, and indeed in 2009 moved a very similar
amendment to this during the proceedings on the Political Parties and
Elections Act. When the Labour Government established the Hayden
Phillips inquiry in 2007, they recommended a tax relief match funding
scheme that bore a close resemblance to the scheme that I am proposing,
but on that occasion with a £500 cap on contributions.</hs_para>

terminated earlier this year and anyone who suggests that they are

negotiations. They fizzled out and there are people in this Chamber

reopened until some time in the future, perhaps under a separate
Government. My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T20:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>
view is simple: negotiations on these matters will not work and the
only way in which we will get change is by introducing
incremental improvements—a little bit here, a small change
there—and over a period of time we will see a new regime
established for political donations in the UK.</hs_para>

that a party might gain out of the proposals that I am making and
indeed might abuse its position by unilaterally increasing the
contribution threshold in future. I took that problem on board. In the
amendment before the House today there is a change to ensure that the
only way in which the contribution threshold can be changed in future
is by way of primary legislation and not by regulation. A new Bill
would have to be introduced in primary legislative form to change the
thresholds in the Bill. In 
<?notus-xml column=320?>my view there is another argument in favour of the amendment. It is
right to allow a scheme to percolate throughout the system to see how
it beds in and whether it works. My view is that it will work and that
at some stage in the future there will be a need to review the
thresholds as set out in my amendment.</hs_para>

there is the cost of the scheme. When the Hayden Phillips report was
published in 2007, there was a reference to a £500 cap on
contributions. That cap is 25 times greater than the cap that I have
set for the first year in my amendment and five times greater than my
third-year figure of £96 per calendar year. My view is
simple—and it is the view of others—that my proposal
would cost but a few million pounds, perhaps £2 million or
£3 million per year. We need to balance the problems of
introducing that against all the malevolent publicity that surrounds
political institutions today. Is it worth £2 million or
£3 million to begin the process of avoiding all the adverse
publicity that surrounds
donations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000069">However,
the fourth objection to my amendment—the one I found most
ludicrous—is the view that it would be impossible to sell the
principle of support for political parties through tax relief at a time
of austerity. That objection surfaced during the course of discussions.
It is always a time of austerity. There is never a right time to spend
money, but we are talking only about a very small amount of money.
However, again in a spirit of generosity, I have amended my amendment
for proceedings in the House today to ensure that it would not trigger
until the financial year that follows the next general election so as
to avoid the very debate that people might be concerned about. I have
made two concessions on my amendment, almost neutering it, but it would
still stand on the statute book as a scheme to be introduced in the
first year, 2016-17, at £16; in 2017-18 at £32 and in
2018-19 at £96—the threshold under which tax relief could
be secured on a
donation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000070">Today
I can be even more flexible. If the Government, even after all these
concessions, feel that they cannot give way, I understand that it would
be possible for them to introduce an amendment to delay commencement of
my proposed scheme pending an order to be brought in by the Secretary
of State under the next Government. In other words, an amendment to
Clause 41 could be introduced at Third Reading to allow for an order to
be introduced to delay the date of commencement of the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000071">I
cannot understand, in the light of all the concessions that I have made
on my amendment and the way in which I have bent over backwards to make
it possible for the Government to deal with all the problems and
objections that have been raised, how the Front Benches of both parties
find it objectionable to introduce an amendment which I know is
supported in reality in free debate by an overwhelming majority of this
House as well. I say that having talked to colleagues across Parliament
who simply cannot understand why the Government refuse to go down this
route.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000072">At the
end of the day, the very credibility of this institution is at stake.
We have had far too many scandals over the years; political scandals
relating to money and politics. All I am doing in moving my 
<?notus-xml column=321?>amendment today is setting in train a course of
events towards bringing in the embryo of a provision of change that
might one day lead to a cleaner donation regime for British political
parties. I am confident that, if the measure is presented in that form,
as against all the scandals that we currently have in this area of
political activity, the general public will support me. I hope that

towards taxpayer funding of political parties. None of us should be
pleased, content or comfortable with the fact that political parties in
this country are financed by the trade unions and, to a very large
extent on all sides of the House, by extremely rich men who are seen to
exert influence. I am not saying that they do exert more influence than
anybody else who runs industries or anything, but they are seen to
exert influence over policy. This does us no good at all and we should

the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has arranged that these measures
would come into place after the general election. I would like to see a
lot more done after the general election. I would like to see matched
funding up to a certain limit, but now is not the time to talk about
that. The fact remains that we are already paying opposition parties
millions of pounds a year. We are paying the Opposition in your
Lordships’ House Cranborne money of hundreds of thousands of
pounds. I challenge anybody in this to House to say that anybody has
mentioned on a doorstep either Short money or Cranborne money. They do
not know that it is happening. In terms of public expenditure, they are
insignificant sums of money.</hs_para>

we go on as we are, we will have endless problems. We will always be
accused of having an unhealthy influence on the political system. This

parliamentary democracy is an honourable activity. I look around the
House, and I could say exactly the same thing about the other place,
and see a great majority of people who give of their time, talents and
careers, and sacrifice their family life, to public service. That is
something that we should recognise as being an extremely important part
of our civic

true, as noble Lords have already said, that it is somehow thought that
to be active in politics is less reputable than, for example,
supporting a charitable or voluntary organisation; many of us do that
as well. That is exaggerated, underlined and repeated every time one of
us contributes something to our 
<?notus-xml column=322?>local church or favourite charity and gets respect
from the tax system for so doing, in exactly the way that the noble
Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, has described. If politics is an
honourable activity, why are we not allowing our fellow citizens to
recognise that and, in their own way, be more active participants
through the gift aid

of the way in which politics has been supported in recent
years by bigger and bigger cheques from smaller and smaller numbers of
people, but also because millions of people feel disenchanted by and
disconnected from the business of politics, that we have reached such a
low reputation in the public mind. It is far more important to engage
and incentivise millions of people than to engage and incentivise
millions of pounds. In those circumstances, it is perhaps worth
reminding your Lordships’ House, in addition to the points
already made by my noble friend Lord Hamilton, that the taxpayer
already makes a huge contribution to the business of politics. For
example, the Royal Mail free delivery of election addresses for every
single party and contestant in the European parliamentary election in
May will cost the taxpayer something between £30 million and
£40 million. The sums that the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, is referring to are a drop in the ocean compared to
that. Yet it is far more likely to engage the individual citizen in the
business of politics than the necessity for every single elector to
receive a separate delivery from each of the
parties<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that there are already a number of proposals for a wider reform of the
funding of political parties. Indeed, last year, I, along with
colleagues from two of the other parties, produced a draft Bill that
would have incorporated the latest proposals of the Committee on
Standards in Public Life on this wider issue. We will not move in that
direction between now and the general election but, in this modest way,
we could put down a marker that we believe that the actual, practical
financial support of our fellow citizens for the business of politics
is just as honourable as their support for a charity or a church. It
would be a very welcome development.</hs_para>

utterly sincere in the support that I give to the amendment in the name
of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. When he very respectably
sought to accost me some days ago to support this matter, I had
misconceived the situation. I thought he was seeking to place political
parties on a charitable basis, which of course would have been utterly
improper. The definition of charity, however impractical it may be in
the modern period, is well laid down in the statute of Elizabeth I and

is not at all what the amendment is about. It is a question of what
fuel there should be available in a democracy to any political
movement. That fuel, I suggest, is the united will of millions of
people, of government, opposition or a third force, or a fourth, 
<?notus-xml column=323?>for that matter. That fuel is the desire and hopes of millions of
individual people, possibly for tens of thousands of different reasons,

that there were tactical and highly materialistic reasons why he chose

impetus and significance. That is exactly what this amendment proposes.
It may very well be that the amounts that are mentioned could be
debated high and low. That does not matter at all. The significance is
that we wish to see politics as an amalgam of millions of people with

is a vocation. I greatly regret the decline in membership of political
parties over the nearly 44 years that I have been in the
Palace of Westminster; I touched upon that in an earlier amendment
today. We do not know the precise figures, but our three major
political parties in this country together have probably less than a
quarter of the membership of the National Trust. That is a dismal
statistic, which we should all take to heart. However, we have to
recognise the realities. One of those is that if the proposals of the

I support them—they would not have an immediate and enormous

Front Bench in opposition after 1997. Of course, that is

advancing the old, old argument of unripe time, which we hear in this
House so often. If you wait for the ripe time, it is usually when it
has gone bad again, when it has gone beyond ripeness. I think that the
noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours, by saying that the actual
introduction would not take place until beyond the next general
election, is simply insisting that we should put down a marker of the
direction in which we wish to go. If we are not permitted to do that,

Campbell-Savours, which I believe 
<?notus-xml column=325?>not to be hyperbole but to be accurate, that there
are many, many members of your Lordships’ House who are
sympathetic to this point of view, will stand on the record. What will
stand on the record if we have a vote is that because of a very, very

Corston (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise very briefly to support
the amendment in the name of my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours. It
takes me back 40 years to the Houghton committee on state
aid for political parties. Both political parties ran away from the
idea at the time—and there were only two major parties at that
time, it has to be said. The campaign itself for the Houghton committee
was under the slogan of “A penny from the workers to support our
politics”. 
<?notus-xml column=326?>It was said that we had our politics on
the cheap. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:25:10"></hs_TimeCode>
amount of money that is now required to mount a political campaign or
to support a political party in a constituency is eye-watering compared
with what was considered to be normal in 1974. Now, we are all more and
more dependent on very large donations from a very small pool of
people. Whether or not those people seek personal advantage from it,
the public think that that is what will happen.</hs_para>

and certainly a decline in turnout in local and general elections. It
is never the right time to introduce a measure such as this. I have
been active as an organiser and a parliamentarian for well over 40

noble Lords are absolutely right to say that the current situation is
untenable. None of us—nobody who is active in
politics—is comfortable in any way with the current situation.
We absolutely have to get big money out of politics, and we have to
find a solution to the problem of party funding, which is undoubtedly a
running sore that diminishes trust in politics. That trust must be
restored if our democratic system is to thrive.</hs_para>

has been said—and I completely agree—politics is a noble
part of our civic life and we have to find a way forward. The proposal
from my noble friend could well be part of that solution. Of course, it
is correct to say that there is never a good time to put forward such
proposals, but I take issue with my noble friend when he says that it
is always a time of austerity. I do not think that that is true and I
do not think that now is a particularly good time to put forward this
proposal. However, I understand why my noble friend is doing it and I
recognise that, should he wish to test the opinion of the House, he
will undoubtedly have the support of some of my colleagues. However, my
party’s position is that, while, as I said, this may well be
part of a solution, it should not be dealt with in isolation. We have
to find a comprehensive solution to the problem of party funding and it
is incumbent on all of us to try to do that. Until we do, as has been

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps
I may reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, that she is not the
sole spectre at the feast. Indeed, as I think the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, indicated when he moved the amendment, he does not
expect the Front Benches to fall into line with him. We had this debate
four weeks ago. Admittedly, there are differences in this
amendment—but, frankly, in the intervening four weeks the
Government’s position has not
changed.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:33:28"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

that raising these issues is not without merit. As my noble friend Lord
Cormack said, it may serve to stir up the leaderships of all
three parties. I endorse what was said by my noble friends Lord Tyler,
Lord Cormack and Lord Hodgson, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Royall,
about politics being a noble calling. We in your Lordships’
House like to think that we make a contribution. We may disagree with
each other—sometimes quite strongly—but we recognise,
across the House, that we have good motives for coming into politics.
Although we operate, vote and make speeches by different lights, we
nevertheless have the common good of the nation at

the proposal we are dealing with this evening is not necessarily the
one and only way to restore the nobility of the political calling. The
rules on party financing have been the cause of much discussion. The
noble Baroness, Lady Corston, gave us a very good historic perspective
when she mentioned the Houghton committee. This has gone on for some
time. Most notably, this Government led talks on the subject between
the three main political parties during 2012 and 2013. In 2010, each of
the three parties had a manifesto commitment of one kind or another to
some reform of party
financing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:31:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I noted the four points that the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours,
said had been given as excuses. I checked the speech I made
in Committee, and we advanced none of the four then. In particular, I
made it very clear that talks were no longer continuing, and I quoted
from the Written Ministerial Statement issued by the Deputy Prime
Minister on 4 July 2013 when he announced that the talks had not
produced results—I think they met seven times—and that it
was clear that the reforms would not now go forward in this
Parliament.</hs_para>

noble Lord’s point was that some people were arguing that talks
were still going on. I did not seek to do that, but it is a legitimate
expectation that all parties will seek to find a way forward on this
complex issue in the next Parliament. I was not party to these talks
but I am told that they were close. The Government want party funding
reform but, as the noble Baroness, 
<?notus-xml column=328?>Lady Royall, said, it should come as part of a
package and by consensus. Some have asked for donations to be treated
in the same way as charitable giving, and I can understand the
relevance of that comparison from a tax point of view. However, I am
not sure that the public necessarily see donations to
charities—many of which we have been discussing in the course of
our debates on the Bill—in the same light as giving support to
political parties through the tax
system<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:33:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000116">I
suspect that many noble Lords support state funding of
political parties. As has already been mentioned, we have Short money,
Cranborne money and the money that goes to the Royal Mail. However,
this would be a significant step. Short funding is probably not
mentioned on doorsteps. However, although I was probably still a
student when it first came in, I remember that it was a major step
which attracted quite a lot of discussion. It would be naive to think
that a step as significant as the Exchequer funding political parties
in this way through the tax system would not be devoid of any comment,
which is why I think all parties have sought to go forward together by
way of
consensus<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:33:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000117">As
my noble friend Lord Cormack said, I do not believe that this is the
appropriate Bill for dealing with this issue, but it is the
Government’s hope that further discussions will take place in
the next Parliament. My noble friend Lord Hamilton said that he wanted
more done after the next election. I would echo that. Anyone from all
party leaderships who reads our debates and follows this will realise
that there is an appetite among Members of all parties that this matter
should not be allowed just to gather dust in the next Parliament. But I
do not believe that it is appropriate to act in the context of this
Bill or at this time and without a bigger package that commands a
consensus among all the parties. I therefore invite the noble Lord to
withdraw his amendment. If he seeks to push it to a vote, as he has
indicated, the Government will not support his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:34:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the issues that we have raised in this debate. In the 1997 to 2001

next Parliament and it was not. In that Parliament we were told that it
would be dealt with in the next Parliament. Hayden Phillips came in the
next Parliament and it was not resolved. We were told that it would be
resolved in this Parliament. Again, there have been talks but it has
not been resolved. We will go through Parliament after Parliament after
Parliament ducking this issue. That is why it is important that we take

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, after the fireworks,
we return to the meat and potatoes. This amendment returns us to an
issue we discussed in Committee: how to ensure that the work of the two
relevant regulators—the Electoral Commission and the Charity
Commission—is truly joined
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000122">As
I explained in Committee, both commissions have produced guidance. Both
sets are clearly written and well signposted but they are not yet
joined up. As I also explained, CC9—the Charity Commission
guidance—is 35 pages long. There is a section titled
“Campaigning: getting it right”, in which the Electoral
Commission’s role and purpose are not mentioned at all, although
the Advertising Standards Authority is. Meanwhile, in the Electoral
Commission’s guidance, no reference is made to charity law; it
confines itself to the two tests of the purpose test and the publicity
test.</hs_para>

commissions have pointed out to me—and, indeed, in guidance to
Members of your Lordships’ House—both have their
individual, separate procedures for updating their guidance from time
to time as the months go by. Therefore, any and all joining up has to
be done by the individual charity and this is quite a challenge for a
charity, especially smaller ones with limited financial and operational
resources. Indeed, there must be, as some noble Lords have said, a real
danger that many smaller charities will merely throw up their hands in
horror and give
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000124">I
explained to my noble and learned friend that without some ministerial
pressure I was convinced that the two organisations would likely
continue to plough their own individual furrows. My noble and learned

have no doubt that today’s debate, and the amendments tabled by
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hardie, and by my noble friend will
have reinforced that message … I hope that the fact that the
Electoral Commission and the Charity Commission have indicated an
awareness of the need for clear and comprehensive guidance is of some
reassurance to the Committee. However, the Government are also keen to
reassure campaigners and charities that the provisions of the Bill and
the PPERA rules will, and should, be clearly communicated to them. It
is our view that the Electoral Commission should produce guidance in
consultation with the Charity Commission, and provide specific
consideration of charities”.—[<I>Official Report</I>,

he could not quite bring himself to commit specifically to joining up
the two sets of guidance. I have retabled this amendment tonight

regulatory silos will remain intact.</hs_parafo>

were very kind and courteous and they agreed to meet to discuss how to
address this issue. Following that meeting, I have retabled my
Committee stage amendments, but I have made two significant wording
changes. I have replaced the phrase that I originally used,
“joint guidance”, with the phrase, “co-ordinated
guidance” and replaced “Commission” with
“Commissions”. It was explained to me, of course, that
the Charity Commission does not regulate charities in Scotland and
Northern Ireland. OSCR, the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator,
and a new body recently set up in Northern Ireland will do that. By
contrast, of course, the Electoral Commission regulates the whole of
the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000127">So
the vision I have and the vision I shared with them of co-ordinated
guidance, which we discussed and they felt was a possibility, was for a
homepage, prepared and signed up by the commissions, with links to
policy issues or subjects that might be of more specific and important
concern. This will offer two great advantages. The first is simplicity.
Any charity of any size has just one place to go to look for guidance
on this quite complex topic. We know it is complex because of the
discussions we have been having over these past few hours. The second
advantage is consistency. No regulator can introduce new policies or
approaches without the other regulatory bodies knowing about it and
being able to have their own specialist input. This avoids charities
being caught in the crossfire of the regulators acting independently
and quickly—maybe too hastily—in the heat of an election
campaign.</hs_para>

conclude, this amendment has, at least in principle, the support of the
Electoral Commission and the Charity Commission. It certainly has the
support of the NCVO and the commission of the noble and right reverend
Lord, Lord Harries. I believe that it will be warmly welcomed by the
sector as it grapples with the undoubted challenges of the Bill, so I
hope that on this occasion my noble and learned friend can go further
than honeyed words and accept this amendment. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115103000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000129"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Horam" PimsId="1019" UID="140115103000527" xid="2184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000527">Lord
Horam:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord,
Lord Hodgson, certainly raises a very important point, which
I am glad we are discussing, even though it is rather a late hour to do
so. We should have some reassurance from the horse’s mouth: he
mentioned that the Government have made various points, he has made
various points and he has talked to the Charity
Commission—presumably the Charity Commission for England and
Wales—and the Electoral Commission. However, I remind the House
and read into the record that our briefing from the Electoral

introductory guide for

goes on to make various sensible points about testing its guidance,
about taking campaigners’ views into account and about
supporting and advising campaigners. That is all part of a process of
being available in a sensible and practical way to charities and to
campaigners who are not charities—which is equally
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:55:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="140115103000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#140115103000131">Given
that the Electoral Commission and the Charity Commission are, I
believe, working along the same lines and intend to produce joint
guidance for charities and non-charity campaigners, and given the clear
commitments being made, I think that it would be unnecessary to put
this provision in the Bill. Neither the Charity Commission nor the
Electoral Commission has the slightest doubt that it has to produce
something sensible in this area. As a result of the amendments that
have now been made by my noble and learned friend, there is time to do
that before September, before the new arrangements kick

Harries of Pentregarth:</Member></B> I am happy to have added my name
to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, for the
reasons that he articulated so clearly. Reading through the guidance
provided by the Charity Commission, both its general guidance and its
specific guidance for election periods, it is clear that it covers the
same kind of ground as the guidance of the Electoral
Commission—it has to give the same kind of detailed
guidance—and it must make total sense for the two bodies to
produce some co-ordinated guidance. I do not think that we need 
<?notus-xml column=333?>any reminding that guidance for future elections
will be crucial. There are so many complex areas here, and this whole
subject has been so raised, that charities and campaigning groups will
need to be crystal clear as to what part of their activity is covered

through the whole length of this Bill, as I hope the night shift will
appreciate. I want to make just one point: I am not sure whether the
solution suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, is right; I am
absolutely convinced that there is a problem. I instance that by saying
that, as somebody who has been involved in this area for years, I have
never had advice or guidance on the problems that we have heard about
so often in recent weeks from anybody in the Charity Commission. The
first time that I ever heard from the Charity Commission was at 6.30
last night. There is a clear need for comprehensive, careful and
co-ordinated advice from the two organisations. It has not been there
in the past. They have not fulfilled their responsibilities to
Parliament, to which they are responsible, over many years, and it is
about time that they did. Throughout today’s discussion, it has
been apparent that this lack of co-ordinated information from the two
organisations has been one of the major problems that many
organisations have had to face, as well as
parliamentarians<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:58:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T21:58:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/40B66C17E14C61F9699BA8087AC660FAA16973A9" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 January 2014">Wednesday,

restrictions under the Bill that they have not dealt with before, that

to having the provision in the Bill, so I hope that the Minister has
one “yes” in his bag that he can pull out at this stage.

Hodgson tabled a similar amendment in Committee and brings forward this
amendment to require the Electoral Commission to produce guidance for
third parties and for that guidance to be co-ordinated with the Charity

said, the issue was discussed at length in Committee, and it is clear
to the

understanding among third parties and charities as to
exactly what are their responsibilities under existing PPERA
provisions—the point made by my noble friend Lord Tyler. That
the Bill amends those provisions reinforces the need for clarity. The
Government made clear in Committee that the issue of guidance and
whether a duty should be imposed on the Electoral Commission would be
revisited at

are not just honeyed words, because since our debates in Committee, the
Government have discussed with the Electoral Commission the importance
of its producing clear guidance. It is essential that such
guidance take into account the impact on charities in particular.
Although charities do not campaign in support of political parties at
elections and only two have ever registered as third parties to date,
there is still an obvious need to ensure that they fully understand the
workings of the new regime—that has been made very apparent
during our many debates today—and whether they might be held to
account by the new provisions as a result of their
activities.</hs_para>

regulator, it is of course for the commission to provide this guidance,
but the Government agree that the views of the charities regulator, the
Charity Commission, must also be taken into account. Indeed, this
involves not just the Charity Commission but its equivalent in

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, this is
the final group of amendments. There has been much
discussion about the regulated period for third parties and whether it
is indeed of an appropriate length. 
<?notus-xml column=336?>Many have argued that 365 days is simply too long. The noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Harries of Pentregarth,
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T22:06:27"></hs_TimeCode> in
Committee that the regulated period should be shortened to six months.
As noble Lords know, there are different regulated periods for
different elections. For the general election it is 365
days. For elections to the devolved Administrations and the European
Parliament it is four months.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1401168000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#1401168000005">What is the purpose of a
regulated period? It is the time before an election within which
financial limits on expenditure apply and campaigning rules must be
adhered to. It is the time during which expenditure incurred for
campaigning purposes must be reported. Noble Lords will know that the
Bill already reduces the regulated period for the next general election
in 2015, so that it will commence on 23 May 2014, which is
the day after the European elections. The reason for this is that the
original regulated period would have been a combined period for the
2014 European parliamentary election and the 2015 general election and
would have started on 23 January 2014.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1401168000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#1401168000006">However, as the Bill
makes changes that would have affected third party
campaigning in European parliamentary elections, it would not have been
sensible to have those changes take effect in the midst of the
regulated period. The two regulated periods are therefore separated by
the Bill, so its changes will take effect for the first time only for
the 2015 general election.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1401168000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#1401168000007">The Government have now
tabled Amendment 128, and Amendments 131 to 134, to shorten further the
regulated period for third parties. These amendments will shorten the
regulated period so that it commences on 19 September 2014. That is the
day after the Scottish independence referendum. Although this Bill does
not affect campaigners in the referendum—it is important that we
make that clear—for the avoidance of any doubt and to ensure
that there is no confusion, the day after the referendum has been
chosen as an appropriate start date for the regulated
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401168000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#1401168000008">This
step has been taken in response to calls from third party campaigners
that they will need further time to fully understand the implications
of the Bill and to ensure that they know how to comply with its
provisions in the run-up to the 2015 UK parliamentary general election.
I should stress that we are not reducing the spending limits to take
account of the shorter regulated period. Campaigners will still be able
to spend up to £319,800 in England, up to £55,400 in
Scotland, up to £44,000 in Wales and up to £30,800 in
Northern Ireland on promoting the electoral success of parties or
candidates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1401168000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-0003.htm#1401168000009">However—and
this is crucial, not least as a follow-on to the previous
amendment—delaying the start of the regulated period will give
campaigners crucial time. The move has been supported by the Electoral
Commission, to give it and the Charity Commission sufficient time to
produce clear and easy to follow guidance. As has already been said, we
believe that it is essential that campaigners have the clarity they
have been asking for, and shortening the regulated period will allow
the Electoral Commission enough time to test the appropriateness and
clarity of its guidance with the campaigners themselves.</hs_para>

should make clear here that only the regulated period for third parties
is being amended. The regulated period for political parties will still
begin on 23 May 2014, as under the existing transitional
provision in Clause 42. It is also the case that for future
general elections the period of one year will apply—although,
given that there is to be a review, no doubt people will wish to raise
this then. I just make it clear that the reduced period is for the 2015
general election.</hs_para>

the noble and learned Lord stated: it will enable the Electoral
Commission to prepare the guidance to educate the people who will have
to conform to it. However, I express the hope that in the review, the
review body will look seriously at the recommendation of the commission
which I chaired, that for third-party campaigners there should be a
six-month period. This seven and a half-month period is absolutely
right for this election but a six-month period should be reconsidered

not have any government amendments in Committee. The Government
listened, and I am glad that they did, but this means that this Report
stage has been a kind of compression of Committee and Report all in
one. The implication of this is that I very much hope that the Minister
will take seriously those amendments that we did not press to a vote,

again. Because of this very compressed period, that would be a great

assessed income period removes the requirement for certain people to
notify the department of changes to their retirement provision for a
defined period. The assumption when the assessed income periods were
introduced in 2003 was that pensioners were more likely to have
relatively stable incomes and capital, so a lighter touch to reviews
was therefore considered appropriate as a way to minimise intrusion and
ease the administrative
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000006">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:49:49"></hs_TimeCode>
logic behind the policy is clear, but operating the system over the
past 10 years has shown the reality to be somewhat different. The
operation of assessed income periods has proved to be more complex and
intrusive for both staff and the individual than anticipated. For
example, people can report a change during an AIP and, as a result,
their award can be increased. However, because we have to look again at
all of their retirement provision, not just the reported change itself,
it does not always lead to a change in the award. This is nugatory work
for the Pension Service and is confusing for
recipients.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000007">More<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:47:16"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, our assumptions about the stability of pensioners’
incomes and capital have not stood the test of time. Our analysis shows
that circumstances change and fixing retirement provision for such a
long period leads to inaccuracies in benefit awards, which then remain
in the system for some time. Based on a sample of around 100,000 cases
that have been reviewed, the pension credit award required updating in
54% of them, and in 36% of cases the award was
reduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000008">In
the current economic climate, we believe it is right that benefit
awards reflect the individual’s current financial circumstances.
We therefore propose to abolish assessed income periods by removing
them for new 
<?notus-xml column=116?>claimants and phasing out existing fixed-term ones from April 2016. It
is estimated that this measure will result in steady-state savings in
AME of around £80 million per year in the long term. We
recognise that removing assessed income periods will require pension
credit recipients to report relevant changes when they
occur—however, this will not necessarily result in increased
levels of contact for all
recipients.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000009">We
will be working with stakeholders and partners on communications
products to ensure that people are clear about what this change means
and what they will need to report and when. For example, there will be
no need to report changes in capital provided it remains below
£10,000. Currently, only 12% of recipients—around
290,000—have capital above that level. Above £10,000,
changes are only relevant where they cross £500 bands. Annual
increases in pensions will be taken into account automatically, as now,
so only new income streams will need to be reported. It is also worth
remembering that the impact of reporting changes will depend on
individual circumstances and that not all will lose out. Some may see
an increase in their award, while some may not experience any change at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000010">Pension

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister
for his explanation of this clause. I would like to explain why I and
my noble friend Lord McKenzie have raised this on the stand part debate
so we can discuss the issues. As the Minister said, this clause
proposes to abolish the current assessed income periods for pensioners
claiming pension credit. At the moment, pensioners are means-tested for
pension credit at their retirement at 65; then at 70; then again at
75 and not thereafter. I am genuinely surprised and,
actually, disappointed that the Government want to make a quick saving
of £82 million gross—as the Minister said—or some
£60 million-odd or £65 million or so net by introducing
annual means testing, although excepting current pensioners over
75<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:50:34"></hs_TimeCode> who may be in
receipt. It will affect 1 million pensioners a year up to
2020<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:50:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000012">Why
do we have the current rules? My noble friend Lord McKenzie was
instrumental in further enlarging and developing them in 2008. Very
wise he was, and very good they were—of course. I hope
<I>Hansard</I><I> </I>records the “Hear, hears” to that.
In particular, he introduced the indefinite assessed income period for
no means-testing for those reaching 75. In my mind, that was a most
important consideration, the one I am most concerned about.
Essentially, we know that pensioners loathe means-testing so much
that—either through ignorance or stigma—a third do not
now claim that to which they are entitled. Those eligible
non-recipients are missing out on something like a mean average of
£34 a week. That is an average loss of £34 a week, an
income that would transform their
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:51:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which is what the Government are proposing, will not, given this
strategy, bring more pensioners in, but will deter even more pensioners
from claiming what they should. That is why I am so pleased that we are
extracting means- testing out of the new state pension, as the former
Pensions Commission recommended when considering the old pension. I was
pleased that we were removing it from the new state pension, only to
find that the Government are foolishly importing it back in again and
extending it through annual means tests, rather than five-yearly ones,
in pension credit to make a quick buck. Therefore, those who get the
more generous pension in future will escape the means test; the older,
poorer pensioners—mainly women—will be subject to even
more of it. I think that is
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000014">Why
was means-testing for pensioners under my noble friend Lord McKenzie
carried out with a light touch? It was essentially because
pensioners’ income is pretty well stable in their retirement
years. The three major events which are likely to affect their
entitlement are, first, the death of their spouse. When he
dies—and it is, alas, usually “him” ahead of
“her”—his modest pension, if it is a single-life
pension which two-thirds of them are, dies with him. That is why it is
elderly widows who most need pension
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:53:03"></hs_TimeCode>. The
second major event is that they may, rarely, get a small
legacy—say, from the death of an unmarried sibling. The third is
that they may have to move into residential care.</hs_para>

big events should be reported, and I have no objection to reinforcing
that and making it clear that capital from, say, a generous legacy of
more than £10,000 or £15,000, acquired before 75, should
be reported. I do not have a problem with that. Apart from that, a
five-year check will discover not just whether pensioners are getting
too much, which is rare, but sometimes whether they are getting too
little. I do not think we have recently had much in the way of a
take-up
campaign—funny<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:53:44"></hs_TimeCode>,

Government are going to produce annual means tests, and the Bill
team—I thank it for this—very helpfully sent me the best
statistics we currently have, which show that twice as many people will
lose under annual means-testing as will gain. The Government will not
make their savings primarily because people are receiving too much,
although some money may come from that and will be clawed back, and so
on. No, if the Minister will actually make a saving, it will come from
pensioners who should get it not claiming, and certainly not annually.
The department has a lot of literature, which is entirely decent, about
the problems of the means-testing, which informed the new state
pension. It was absolutely right to do so, and yet it seems to be
ignoring it in their efforts to make a quick £65 million or so
saving from the poorest
pensioners<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:54:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000017">The
Minister and his team will so increase the stigma of means-tested
pension credit—with people annually reminded that they are
suspected of error, if not downright fraud—that more of the
poorest pensioners will slip down the snake of further poverty.
Pensioners do not cheat on pension credit, but this proposal suggests
that they do. Let us not have any spin about increased take-up as a
result. This is about savings and nothing more, and I do not think it
is decent.</hs_para>

their reduction in means-testing for the new state pension, while
quietly importing a massive extension of means-testing for those not
joining the sunny uplands of the full new state pension. They are
deliberately widening the gap between those who will get the new

be worse off simply because they are a day older or a year older than
other pensioners who are eligible for the new state

people who are on pension credit because they are on the wrong side of
that cliff edge will have £30 of pension credit added to their
BSP of £111, giving them a total income of some £140.
However, if they acquire any capital savings over £10,000, they
will find them means-tested. In some cases they will then lose every
penny of pension credit. Meanwhile, other pensioners, who are a day or
a year younger, will get their more generous pension of £144,
and will also keep every penny of savings they may have or acquire

older and poorer start to lose if they have any savings over
£10,000, so there is not an incentive to save. Yet pensioners a
day younger not only have a higher pension, but their savings are not
taken into account at all. This problem will of course be made worse by
the loss of savings credit. Is this fair? Far from increasing
means-testing for the poorest group, in my view the Government should
do exactly the opposite. They should reduce means-testing to achieve
greater fairness for pensioners who are being penalised for nothing but
their age. That would give less of a cliff edge, and more equity
between the two groups of pensioners who are divided by one day. It
really is shameful to import an unnecessary cliff edge for trivial
government savings, and it is also
perverse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000021">Since
my noble friend Lord McKenzie wisely reviewed AIPs, there have been
huge cuts in domiciliary support for the elderly from social services.
Mr Pickles has cut local government budgets by 35%, and inevitably this
is passed on in depleted services. Nearly half a million people, mostly
pensioners, have lost homecare since 2008—half a million. Only
those with substantial or even critical care needs can now expect to
have carers who are funded by the local
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000022">Pensioners
with only “functional” disability may have quite
significant mobility or sight problems, and five years ago they could
have received perhaps three or five hours per week of help from social

substantial and they are frail, and they need help getting up in the

disagree with that, but where is the money for that co-payment to come
from? If you are a pensioner on pension credit, you have minimal or low

worth perhaps £100,000 or double that. Some 80% of pensioners
below 60% of median income are owner-occupiers. Half of
those on

up to 75, have only one way to do that, which is to release some of the

spent several days with equity release staff visiting potential
customers in their homes. Some customers were comfortably well off, had
no children, and had decided to enjoy the money locked up in their
home. That was their issue and it was nothing to do with me. But for
others, older pensioners, the very first and key question they asked
was this: “How will it affect my benefits?”. Let us
remind ourselves of the facts. A widow who has lost her spouse would
get £111 a week of basic state pension topped up to around
£140—by a further £30—from full pension
credit if she has no other income. With a home outside London worth
around £150,000, at the age of 75, when means-testing currently
ends, she could release some £50,000 of capital. On her death
her home would revert to the equity release company with no
negative equity. That money could be taken as structured income or as
tranches of
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:00:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14011596000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000026">Capital
in pension credit after the first £10,000 is treated much more
onerously than income. Pension credit assumes a tariff rate of
£1 of income for every £500 of capital over
£10,000. In other words, it assumes a notional income of 10%
interest. Every £1,000 of capital over £10,000 costs
£2 in lost benefit. If the widow puts £50,000 of equity
release capital into a building society and takes off the
£10,000, today that would bring in £20 a week. She will
have lost £30 a week from pension credit, only for it to be
replaced with £20 a week from equity release, and with no
inheritance possible for her children. She is £10 a week worse
off as a result of releasing the equity in her home, thus saving us as
taxpayers some of her funding costs for social care. No pensioner is
going to release equity from her home at the expense of her
family’s inheritance if not only does she then lose benefit
pound for pound, she is also £10 a week worse off. She
absolutely will not do it, and why should
she<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:01:49"></hs_TimeCode>? Currently,
knowing that she will no longer be means- tested when she reaches 75,
she can work out with her family what is best for her.</hs_para>

know that some people have released £20,000 or £30,000,
particularly from homes of modest value, often in the form of regular
drawdown as structured additional income. Others need capital as they
have no other savings. Younger and better off pensioners do as they
wish, but they are not my concern. Older pensioners aged over 75,
however, are most likely to be on pension credit with no savings and
nothing but their home, which is why they are getting maximum pension
credit. They use equity release primarily, as I have seen with 
<?notus-xml column=120?>my own eyes, to adjust their home for increasing disability: walk-in
showers, a downstairs loo, a stair-climber, a new boiler or a more
reliable washing machine for increased laundry; while in some cases
where the pensioner has arthritis, the money is used to pay for
cleaning help.</hs_para>

the future, along with personalised budgets, equity release could help
fund local longer-term social care and allow people to remain in their
own home and thus out of residential care. That is freeing pensioners
from means-testing, even if only at 75 where the savings made by
insisting to continue to means-test them will be trivial. I have not
got a figure and the Bill team cannot give me one because the
information is not collected in that way. My hunch is that it will be
barely £20 million a year, if that. We have already means-tested
these people twice, so any savings apart from their homes have probably
been means-tested out of existence. Freeing these pensioners from
means-testing, if only at 75, means that they are nudged into equity
release, thus drawing down the value of their home only as they become
more frail. This was, and in my view is, wise
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:03:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

choice. They can increase means-testing, especially of those aged over
75, and ensure that those they means test do not draw down equity to
help themselves but rely on us, the taxpayers, or they go without. That
is crazy. Instead, the Government are choosing to abolish means-testing
for those on the new state pension while importing it back in again for
the elderly and more frail in more intrusive ways, knowing that many
pensioners, especially owner-occupiers, will not claim what they are
entitled to. That is
shameful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Or the
Government could think again. I repeat: it is only an accident and a
complete lottery of timing that, after April 2016, some pensioners will
be on the old legacy system with lower pensions and increased
means-testing, while the younger neighbour next door will have a higher
pension and no means-testing.</hs_para>

able to afford to release any equity in their home to meet care needs.
The other group, comprising people who are perhaps one day younger,
will get their full new pension, avoid any means-testing and can enjoy
any savings or choose to make any equity release as they see fit. Who

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I join my noble friend
Lady Hollis in reviewing why this clause should stand part of the Bill.
This debate gives us an opportunity to review its rationale, as my
noble friend has done, and particularly to scrutinise what alternative
support mechanisms are to be put in place for those newly required to
notify the DWP of changes to retirement provision. As we know, the
assessed income period removes the requirement to notify changes to
capital and retirement pension for the purposes of pension credit. It
will run for five years but is set indefinitely for somebody who has
reached the age of
75<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:06:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

has said, the concept was based on the assumption that the capital and
retirement income of pensioners would not vary significantly, that
administratively it was appropriate to have a light touch for claims
maintenance, and that it was also less intrusive for a claimant whose
reporting of changes of circumstances obligations was significantly
reduced. It is now asserted that the administrative burdens will not be
forthcoming, in part because a huge volume of cases come up for review
at the same time, and there is not the stability in levels of capital
and retirement income originally envisaged. So far as the
administration issues are concerned, it would presumably be possible to
spread the load by modest extensions of the end dates of existing AIPs
to even out their reconsideration. Perhaps the Minister can tell us why
such an option was not
considered<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:06:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000033">We
learn from the impact assessment that just under 2 million of 2.5
million people on pension credit have an AIP split roughly half and
half between those with a specified end date and those of an indefinite
period. Given that those with an indefinite period AIP are not to be
preserved, it looks as though these provisions will potentially affect
some 1 million pensioners. Do we have figures for those within this
cohort who are in receipt of savings credit only, guarantee credit only
or both? Obviously, savings credit would have no application for those
who reach state pension age after 5 April 2016, and to a certain extent
these provisions wither on the vine because those who reach state
pension age post-April 2016 will get STP generally which will be above
the guarantee credit level, so they get floated off and savings credit
does not apply to them in any
event<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:08:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000034">As
for changes to income and capital, as my noble friend has made clear,
the numbers have been predicated on scaling up and are now, I think,
upwards of 99,400 cases. We know that of those cases, 36,000 will see a
reduction in their award—13,000 will lose all pension
credit—18,000 will see an increase and nearly half will see no
change. However, over a five-year period, the impact assessment
suggests that 540,000 people will be affected by the change in policy,
with one-third gaining and two-thirds
losing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:08:35"></hs_TimeCode>. It would
seem that the reasons for a reduction in award are attributable to
increases in non-pension income as well as increases in
capital—the former cases, I think, being more
numerous<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:08:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000035">We
know that in a steady state the Government will benefit to the tune of
£82 million a year and will gain further savings from housing
benefit and rent support. I do not know whether we have an updated
assessment for that figure. Incidentally, will the Minister remind us
what is happening because we went through a period when an application
for pension credit, council tax benefit or housing benefit was going to
involve one process of application, and that was then going to be
shared? I do not know what has happened to that process. Clearly, the
council tax part of it has had to go because of the localisation of
that but it would be helpful to have an update on that
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000036">Ensuring
that pension credit assessments of means-tested benefit are accurate is
not an unreasonable ambition, but an equally important ambition should
be to improve the take-up of pension credit, as my 
<?notus-xml column=122?>noble friend made clear. We know that about one in three of those
eligible for pension credit are currently not claiming it, although
take-up of the guaranteed credit is higher. The greater the required
engagement with the system, the greater the risk will be that

asked, what are the Government’s plans to improve take-up of
pension credit? This issue must not be underestimated, especially in an
environment in which people are living longer, and living at least
semi-independently, with support from formal and informal carers. I
have seen this in my family: whereas bank statements and pension slips
were once neatly filed in date order, they are now tucked away down the
side of a chair, scattered randomly in a drawer or thrown out with the
rubbish. When you cannot always remember whether you have had
breakfast, it is not always easy to remember to pass on a piece of

penalties for failure to report changes of circumstances, and we know
that this Government are hot on sanctions. So can the Minister please
say, given the changes to the AIP policy, what additional cost is to be
incurred in supporting pensioners, both at the point of the change and
routinely thereafter? What special protections will be in the system if
someone is at risk of being

raised by my noble friend Lady Hollis concerning the effect of this
change on equity release and capital more widely, it is with a degree
of trepidation that I am bound to say that I cannot fully support the
position of my noble friend. I know that that is dangerous
territory. I agree that AIPs facilitate the accumulation of substantial
sums from equity release without impact on pension credit, but that, of
itself, is not a reason why it should be retained. It is common ground
that AIPs were designed as an administrative easement, not as a route
to allow certain types of capital to be outside the pension credit
rules. I see great merit in equity release but I am not sure why
capital raised just in that way should have more favourable treatment
under the benefit system than capital raised in any other way. There is
already a series of provisions under which capital is disregarded for
the purposes of pension credit and, indeed, other benefits. They
include amounts held to buy a home or to carry out essential repairs.
There may well be an argument—and my noble friend has advanced
these—to extend these capital disregards in effect to cover
costs of caring. However, this should be done explicitly, not under the
guise of hanging on to something via an administrative
easement.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14011596000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000040">The
Government are going down a dangerous path. Thousands of pensioners
could be disadvantaged by this provision administratively, and we
certainly want to know, if the Government are going to press ahead with
it, what support is going to be given. I do not see anything in the

analysis that states that the Government are going to support
pensioners, particularly older pensioners, effectively to make sure

Meacher (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friends. I have
just worked out that it was about 40 years ago when I undertook and
produced the first research report of the Child Poverty Action Group.
The subject of that study was the non-take-up of means-tested benefits.
At that time, when I was a young person, I assumed that the important
issue was stigma. Of course stigma is a major feature, but what took me
by complete surprise was the level of ignorance and complete
unawareness on the part of, most particularly, the poorest potential
claimants—ignorance that they might even conceivably be entitled
to any benefit at all. It just had not crossed their mind. If you do
not ask any questions, you do not get the answers to those questions.
If he really wants to extend means-tested benefits, I urge the Minister
to undertake some research into the levels of knowledge and
understanding of potential pension credit recipients, because if the
level of ignorance remains today as it was then, the social
consequences of these reforms will be very alarming
indeed.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/DD2C8A1DFE906997420071F403B299486027D0A1" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 January 2014">Wednesday,

pension credit because various assets and income were not being taken
into account if they happened after an AIP was set. Does he mean
incorrect? Presumably, he does not mean incorrect if they were in line

the Minister explain the use of the word

the question of level, the briefing said that despite the fact that
many customers may be better off, most people will not be better off as
the Minister and my noble friend Lord McKenzie have pointed out. It is
obvious that they could not be if £80 million a year is to be
saved. Also, my understanding is that not only will there be twice as
many losers as gainers, if I have read this correctly the average
gainer will gain £6.70 a week but the average loser will lose
£13.10 a week, which is twice as much. Will the Minister clarify
whether that is right and if so what average means in this context? Is
it a mean or median

the impact by age band of abolishing AIPs, the briefing from the
department says that it is not possible to break down savings by age
band, but that the younger cohort of recipients who are more likely to
be affected by the change in policy are less likely to have capital
above £10,000 or other pension income. Will the Minister help me
understand that distinction? Assuming that they are spared, these
younger pensioners will go on to be over-75s, who would have been
entitled to an indefinite AIP. Is the assumption that that cohort, when
they reach 75, will still be less likely to have savings over
£10,000 or other pension income and thus less likely to face a
change in pension credit entitlement? In other words, is the
distinction one of age or

have no intention of standing between my two noble friends on the

however, because it suggests that the sample size was too small to be

back to the argument, people should draw on the income and capital
available to them before seeking help from the state. If people
liquidise assets to release money or generate an income, that should be
taken into account, no matter what the source—if they sell some
shares, release equity or downsize. It has been suggested that
abolishing the assessed income period will deter people from using
equity release to pay for care under the new care funding regime
proposed by the Government. The planned care charging reforms will
provide greater clarity about what people will be expected to
contribute. There will be financial advice 
<?notus-xml column=126?>to help people better meet these costs, and the Department of Health has
been working with the financial services industry to help create the
right conditions for a new market of financial products to develop that
will be suited to this purpose. Equity release may be a product some
may consider, but at this stage it is difficult to say how future care
charging reforms will influence behaviour in this

Government do not want people to be penalised for making proper
provision to fund their care. That is why the Department of Health will
consider how the charging system can recognise the provision people
have made and why we are working with them to understand the impacts
and the potential interactions with means-tested benefits. However, we
cannot retain a complex feature of pension credit as a way of
protecting the position for what may be a minority of pension credit
customers in specific circumstances. This would not be a targeted
response; indeed, it could be argued that it moves away from and
undermines the rationale of a safety net

may be alternative solutions that both departments will need to

recommendations of the Pensions Commission, to get rid of pension
credit in the new single pension and therefore to reduce means-testing
very significantly? Pension credit served its purpose in taking
existing pensioners out of poverty. It possibly deterred other, future
pensioners from saving, but it did tackle the problem of poverty. Quite
rightly, in my view, the current Government have proceeded to take that
chunk—a huge chunk of means-testing—out of the system.

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, we move on to a different
section of the Bill on bereavement benefits. In moving Amendment 59, I

66<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:39:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000082">I
am unhappy about some aspects of these proposals. I know that they have
been out to consultation, as, obviously, I have read the consultation
documents, but I wonder whether it was wise to go for a
one-size-fits-all approach in the name of alleged simplicity. The
background notes go back to our policies in 1925, presumably in the
belief that this shows we need to overhaul the system, but, actually,
we did review and restructure it in 2000. Why did we structure it in
the way we did? I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I talk about
widows rather than deceased spouses or
partners<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:39:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000083">Currently,
widows receive a £2,000 lump sum. We recognised, as have the
current Government, that you need money immediately to pay for funeral
costs and to tide you over the couple of months while the deceased
spouse’s income or, alternatively, childcare are not available
and before alternative benefit income, if appropriate, is established.
As UC, for example, can be paid in monthly arrears, it could be two
months before any money is flowing to the bereaved spouse or partner,
so we produced a lump sum. We then sought to support widowed parents
with children while the youngest was on child benefit: that is,
normally up to age 16. At the time that was consistent with the income
support rule for single parents with a taxable benefit. The widowed
parent’s allowance is now worth £108 a week—a
little less than BSP but more than income support, as it is NI-based.
It is not means-tested and no work conditionality is
attached<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:40:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
number of new widowed parents claiming the allowance varies between
50,000 and 100,000 a year. As far as I can see, there is no particular
pattern to it. Currently, widowed parents claim their allowance on
average for five to six years. Not surprisingly, those with younger
children claim it for longer—around nine to 10 years. Only
3.6%—less than 4%—claim it for a year or
less<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000084">The
Government, to my dismay, while increasing the lump sum to
£5,000, are proposing that widowed parents should receive this
financial support not until the youngest child is 16 or even 12, but
for one year only irrespective of the age of the child, at £400
a month. I believe that this is quite unacceptable. For most, the
financial loss will be substantial. Some 88% of widows in
work with children will be worse off; 50% of those not in work will be
worse off. To put it another way, any widow with children who would
have claimed for two years or more, usually because of the age of their
children, will in future be worse off. That loss could be
£50,000 if eligibility were retained while the child carried
child benefit. Instead, within a year, she will probably have to work
longer hours if she is in work just to make good her financial loss at
the selfsame time that her children need her. Children do not adjust in
a year. In my experience they are stressed and distressed for many
years longer and need more, not less, care from the surviving parent.
My children were grown up when bereavement hit and even then it was
very hard, but friends who lost a spouse when the children were young
found that their children had 
<?notus-xml column=131?>nightmares and returned to bedwetting. Those parents experienced broken
nights and witnessed their children’s clinging fear of losing
their other parent, school phobia, challenging behaviour,
miscellaneous, unexplained small illnesses and symptoms of depression.
They found that their children needed much extra support, stability and
attention as well as
affection<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:43:05"></hs_TimeCode>. The
widowed parent—a sole carer and earner—may have to extend
her working hours to make good the loss of income at just the time when
she needs to be more available to them, perhaps to change childcare,
move house and, consequently, change their
school<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000085">The
more generous working parent’s allowance not only helped to
replace his income but could also allow a working mother the financial
flexibility to adjust her hours to care for her children to enable them
to settle into the new patterns of life that they now experience. Given
that few widows claim the full credit that they could, they are making
a wise decision for themselves and are in no sense seeking to milk the
system. Are we really so desperate for money that we need to take it
away from grieving widows with deeply distressed
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:43:52"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

conditionality, if widowed parents are on UC, it is proposed that they
are brought within work conditionality after six months. Again, that is
quite unacceptable. I am baffled by this lack of empathy or
understanding. Of course, if she wants to go back to work—as
many of us do, and did—that is fine and we should support her
but to impose work conditionality whether she feels ready for work or
not seems unbelievably harsh. We talk about advice and guidance and a
friendly interview with Jobcentre Plus staff, but the power lies with
the staff. The Minister is giving huge discretion to a young single
member of staff, however well intentioned—I am sure that they
are—but with probably no personal experience of
bereavement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14011596000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#14011596000087">I
would not want that. The more, I am afraid, we hear of the culture of

we should all
worry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:45:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I
appreciate and welcome the fact that the Minister has recently offered
further consultation to discuss work conditionality and the training of

that work conditionality pressures, at least, will be properly
relaxed.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/E191DD30D66BE6AC534A81F8E96DCF4506C6FD4F" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 January 2014">Wednesday,

the third element is that we provided in 2000 a one-year bereavement
allowance for those aged over 45. The current Government, according to
their notes, seem to think that 45 was an arbitrary figure and that it
could well have been 50. It was not<I>. </I>I was one of those involved
in those discussions—we did it to help older widows without
dependent children, and the age of 45 was about the time when the
youngest child no longer brought in child benefit. At 45, for a year, a
widow would get some £33 a week, rising currently, in 7% steps,
to £101 a week at 54. She would have a year to give her time to
deal with her grief.</hs_para>

point—this is why we did it—such widows are older, as the
Government’s own tables show, and their numbers are growing by
around 
<?notus-xml column=132?>10% a year. Therefore, 16,000 people without children become widowed
each year at 45, and 108,000 a year at 54. What is key is that younger
widows and widowers, with or without children, are more likely to have
been in work at the point of their spouse’s
death—three-fifths of them. The death, although often due to a
heart attack, or lung or breast cancer, was far more likely to be a
sudden, unexpected death, such as an accident at work or in the car. An
older widow without dependent children was less likely to be in
work—barely half of such widows were. That is because
she—it is twice as likely to be she than he—was more
likely to have been her spouse’s carer, because he was more
likely to have died following a terminal illness such as cancer or
heart disease that often required full-time care.</hs_para>

anyone who has nursed a spouse through a terminal illness knows, it may
mean two or three years of heavy end-caring. Apart from the grief, it
is physically exhausting even for those who are fairly fit. It wipes
you out. It is hard work by day and broken sleep at night—you
are never off duty. Your own physical health often breaks down as well.
You keep going until his death and then you cannot. You need your own
stress-free convalescence. You need physical as well as emotional
recovery, which is what that year-long bereavement allowance provided.
Its cash value was age-related—more for the older widow, where
it approached BSP rates—and was tapered down to a useful
supplement to the younger widow of 45, who was more likely to be either
in the labour market or able to re-enter it.</hs_para>

reasonable that we should review the benefits, given changes in the
rates in the rest of the social security system over the past 15 years.
I do not object to that, but the nature of bereavement and the problems
and challenges that it throws up to the bereaved spouse have not
changed. It is merely our assumptions that have apparently changed
regarding what we can expect from the surviving spouse. Older widows
are not more healthy and able to cope than they were in 2000. Younger
widows’ children are not less distressed than they were in 2000
or regressing in behaviour. Work conditionality after just six months
is not a favour to them, as the government papers seem to suggest; it
just adds more unwanted, inappropriate and harsh pressure. We should
treat widows and widowed parents at least as well as kinship carers,
who, wisely, have a full year free from work conditionality while the
children settle in—hence these amendments.</hs_para>

widowed parent a longer period of financial support, either for three
years or until the youngest child is seven. We estimate that this
should not add more than 10% to the financial package for bereavement,
and voluntary groups are happy to work with the Minister to make it
cost-neutral. We are told that widows can move on to and be eligible

Meacher:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I will speak to Amendment
62ZA, but before doing so I must apologise to your Lordships—I
have already apologised to the Minister—because I am running
against a very tight deadline. I tabled this amendment assuming it
would come up on Monday. Before addressing the amendment, I give my
very strong support to Amendment 59, moved brilliantly by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hollis. I have no doubt at all that the replacement of
the widowed parent’s allowance by the bereavement support
payment has positive features, but the limitation of that benefit to
one year is absolutely cruel. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, really
got across the point that bereavement is not just a short-term problem.
It brings several years of very considerable distress and discomfort
for the children, as well as for the parent left
behind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000009">The
aim of Amendment 62ZA is to remove the widowed parent’s
allowance and its predecessor, WMA, from the list of benefits treated
as income other than earnings for the purposes of universal credit
entitlement. I realise that that would be a very big step for the
Government, but the result would be that claimants with no other income
or earnings would keep the value of the WPA in full. Those with
earnings in excess of the personal allowance would of course pay tax on
it, but they would at least receive the majority of the
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000010">This
is a probing amendment. The Children’s Society has calculated
that, without the amendment, those entitled to widowed parent’s
allowance could find themselves worse off by about £400 per year
compared to those with no entitlement and no national insurance
contributions. An important point is that WPA is a contributory
benefit. It is only payable when the deceased parent has paid
sufficient national insurance contributions. The clear assumption
behind the benefit is that a surviving parent with all those
contributions should surely benefit over and above surviving parents
with no contributions. We regard it as an anomaly that under the
universal credit rules this advantage from having national insurance
contributions would be stripped away. Do the Government really intend
that outcome? I do not think so. The proposed bereavement support
payment, which will of course replace a number of benefits including
the WPA, clearly identifies bereaved parents with national insurance
contributions as being entitled to benefits which are not available to
others. There is therefore a real discrepancy between the two basic
assumptions behind the two
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000011">Although
the bereavement support payment will be limited in
time—hopefully it will be provided for at least three years,
which seems to be an absolutely basic requirement—nevertheless
it will be of greater value to most of those entitled to it than the
widowed parent’s benefit. The contributory principle is well and
truly recognised by this new benefit. At the same time, 
<?notus-xml column=134?>as I understand it, those receiving the widowed parent’s
allowance will continue to do so when bereavement support payment takes
over for new claimants. The WPA will continue to be treated as income
other than earnings, which again is a different principle. This means
that the benefit will continue to be deducted pound for pound from the
claimant’s universal credit entitlement. The result is that a
widowed parent with no other income will experience zero benefit from
his or her national insurance contributions, thereby entitling them to
the
WPA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000012">The
situation is, of course, even worse for widowed parents who continue to
work. The gross sum of the widowed parent’s benefit will be
subject to income tax. I find that absolutely extraordinary. Working
claimants may have their WPA deducted in full from their universal
credit entitlement, but will also pay tax on the gross income that they
have not received. Those are the parents who could end up £400
per year worse off. I would be grateful if the Minister could confirm
that that is a correct reading of the
situation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000013">Can
the Minister confirm whether the Government really intend that those
bereaved parents with a national insurance contribution record should
be no better off than those with no such record and that those in work
should really find themselves even worse off? Will the Minister confirm
that many current recipients of the widowed parent’s allowance
will continue to be disadvantaged in this way even after the
introduction of the bereavement support payment? Finally, does the
Minister accept that only relatively well-off bereaved parents, whose
earnings take them above the ceiling for universal credit, will
actually benefit from having a national insurance contribution record?
Can that be right?</hs_para>

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I support these
amendments very strongly. The points about bereavement have been made
most eloquently. However, I would like to add the scenario where one
parent dies suddenly rather than as a result of a protracted illness,
where the shock of the death may be absolutely overwhelming. That could
be suicide, murder or a sudden death. There is another scenario, too,
which is where the surviving parent was involved in a road accident and
does not even start to grieve until much later. The children who are
bereaved know that one parent is already dead and, for many months,
they may not know whether the other parent will survive or not. The
shortening of time is quite cruel, and I use that word advisedly. A
year is a very short time in the life of anyone bereaved, and the
anniversary of the death often marks a major step change in the way
that they live their lives. That applies to children as well as the
bereaved parent.</hs_para>

proposal to increase the lump sum is most welcome because the current
lump sum gets nowhere near the immediate expenses incurred. However, it
is essential that the Government consider this proposed three-year
period, or until the child is seven, if that would be longer than three
years, because pre-school children certainly need that security and
will become very clingy when they realise that one parent has gone. A
scenario might arise with an accident where not only has the parent
died but another sibling. It is not 
<?notus-xml column=135?>uncommon, sadly, for a family of five or six to be suddenly left as a
family of two—multiple losses all in one go in a horrendous road
accident.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000016">We
know that the outcomes for children who are not well supported in
bereavement are much worse. When we think about the cost of bereavement
support, it must be put in context of the cost to society of young
people who have been bereaved who have not had adequate support and
have experienced excessive strain and mental health problems. That
increases their risk of suffering from depression, attempting suicide
and experiencing drug addiction, alcoholism, underage sex, unplanned
pregnancies and so on. That cost must be offset against what appears,
at face value, to be a demand for an increase in the amount that the
Government will put there for bereaved parents. The long-term
continuity becomes really
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000017">The
only other point I will make, which was made to me by a young lady
doing work experience with me, is that these days not that many parents
are married. The issues highlighted in Amendment 62ZB are therefore
really pertinent to the way that youngsters live today. I can see that
administratively, if the parents are not married, it can become more
complicated for government, but I do not believe that that is beyond
the scope of being worked out. It is important to realise that the
person who the child has lost and needs support to grieve over may not
be their biological
parent.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/7700782B089DC63C43B4EC36DB42F276905D8FD2" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 January 2014">Wednesday,

German (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I raised this issue at Second

the issues that have been spoken of already, particularly those in
Amendment 66, which the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, has
tabled this
afternoon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000019">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:00:13"></hs_TimeCode>
hope and I am sure that noble Lords will judge the issue of changes to
bereavement benefits as changes which would improve rather than worsen
the current set of arrangements. We are told that these measures are
based on what people were told the Government would provide them with,
and that they would provide them with the best support. The Government
in turn have told us that they are not about reducing entitlement or
making savings. Therefore, the test surely must be whether the changes
provide a genuine improvement and are not a worsening of the
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:00:32"></hs_TimeCode>. That
is why I have this concern about the one implication of the changes,
that bereaved parents will be required to go back to work six months
after the death of the mother or father. I am afraid I am unable to see
the logic or the compassion that I would expect in this change. In
fact, I used the word “cruel” at Second
Reading.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000020">For<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>
the benefit of the bereaved child or children, I would wish for those
bereaved parents with children to have full conditionality relaxed for
the whole year. This does not rule out preparation for return to work;
in fact, there could still be some limited conditionality after six
months—for example, attending work-focused interviews only. It
is worth making the comparison with kinship carers. I regard this as an
anomaly in the proposed regulations. If a child after bereavement goes
to live with an uncle, aunt or cousin, that uncle,  
<?notus-xml column=136?>aunt or cousin, who may have to forgo work to look after the bereaved
child, is exempt from full conditionality for 12 months. Yet the
bereaved parent, the mother or father, is given only a six-month
relaxation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:01:59"></hs_TimeCode>. As
we know, a 12-month relaxation will not be necessary for everyone. The
noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said this. Some bereaved parents may
determine that their circumstances are different and may want to return
to work earlier. One would hope that that is always in the best
interests of them and their bereaved children, but that is their choice
and not a requirement of the state. There is compelling evidence to
suggest that we need to alter the proposed
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:02:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:02:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000021">There
are six facts from studies, which I want to draw out. The first is that
bereaved children and young people are more likely to have a serious
illness or accident than their non-bereaved peers during the first year
following the death of a parent. The second fact drawn from the studies
conducted in this area is that they have higher rates of substance and
alcohol abuse than their non-bereaved peers. Thirdly, one-third will
show clinical levels of mental health difficulty at some point during
the first two years after the death of their parent, and those bereaved
suddenly of a parent are three times more likely to develop depression
than their non-bereaved peers. Fourthly, there is an increased risk of
suicide attempt and hospitalisation for psychiatric disorder. The fifth
element is that parentally bereaved children score lower at GCSE than
their non-bereaved peers. In other words, it affects their life chances
through the examination system. The death of a parent by the age of 16
is associated with girls failing to gain any sort of qualification, and
with men and women being unemployed by the age of 30. Sixthly, bereaved
children and young people are overrepresented in the criminal justice
system<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:04:12"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:04:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:04:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000022">Of
course, the increased risks outlined above do not mean that every
bereaved child will go on to develop such difficulties, but they show
that, as a group, they are more vulnerable than those who have not been
bereaved. The most reliable longitudinal study that we have, which
looks at the impact on bereaved children over a period of two years,
conducted by JW Worden, <I>Children and Grief: When a Parent Dies</I>,
found that the capacity of the surviving parent to care for their child
was—and I am sure that no noble Lord will be surprised by
this—the most important factor in securing better
outcomes, emotionally and behaviourally, for the
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>. This
included the surviving parent’s availability to the
child—obviously emotionally but, more than that, in terms of
being able to spend time with them and continuing routines where
possible. Successful interventions with families generally involve
supporting parents to communicate with and be available to their
children, all of which point to allowing the surviving parent as much
time as possible to be with their child in the year following the
death.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000023">Clearly,
the conditions for claiming universal credit are intended to be as
close to having a job as possible. It is important to think through the
parallels between those who are bereaved and claiming UC, and those who
are bereaved while in employment. While most employers clearly would
not be able to offer a full year off work to a newly bereaved parent,
many parents  
<?notus-xml column=137?>choose to change jobs, or even stop working, if their employer cannot be
flexible, so that they can meet the needs of their children

is the most important of issues and the most difficult time for

Second Reading, this part of the Bill figured large. The mood of your
Lordships’ House then was that these provisions merited further
debate and possible revision. We were all particularly indebted to the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby for his powerful
contribution that day. A lifetime of providing pastoral care to those
suffering bereavement amounts to a wealth of experience and knowledge

it are supported by the best research, as the contribution of the noble

expect that a strong thread of the Minister’s response will be
an argument that the principal aim of these reforms is to make
bereavement payments more effective in the 21st-century context. The
Government have concluded that doing so requires only short-term
intervention to allow a bereaved spouse or civil partner the time to
deal with the immediate costs of the death of a partner and to come to
terms with the consequential emotional and financial implications. In
the longer term, they argue, if support is needed to cope with the
consequences of bereavement, the universal credit system will provide
that long-term
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000028">Broadly,
those whom the Government consulted supported that approach, but
significant reservations were expressed about the impact of the
proposed changes on bereaved families. I believe, like many noble Lords
and, perhaps surprisingly, the Pensions Minister himself, that there is
a debate to be had about how long support should last, particularly in
relation to bereaved families with children. On 29 October, on Report

Bill—certainly this part of it—is cost-neutral, or at
least broadly cost-neutral. It achieves its objective of paying out to
all bereaved partners, regardless of age, mainly by reducing the level
of support for bereaved families and by redistributing that money to
those without children. The biggest beneficiaries are bereaved partners
under 45—who are also the group most likely to be in
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000030">Secondly,
the Government’s own figures on the number of families affected
and what their numbers mean tell us some things, but not everything.
The total number of deaths of people aged 25 to 64 in 2012, according
to the ONS statistics, was about 73,000: 43,799 men and 29,413 women.
The number of deaths increases with age, as one might expect. The
number of people in receipt of each of the current three benefits
includes 10,000-12,000 receiving bereavement support payments per
annum. In November 2012, there were 21,000 people in receipt of
one-year bereavement payments and 44,000 in receipt of the widowed
parent’s allowance.</hs_para>

I understand these statistics—and I might not—it appears
that only half of bereaved partners in any one year are receiving
bereavement benefits. This indicates that either bereaved partners are
not claiming, they are not married or in civil partnerships, or they
are unable to meet the national insurance contributions criteria. It
would be interesting to know whether the Minister has any more detailed
statistics than this. The estimated total expenditure of these benefits
in 2013-14 is £575 million, falling to £531 million in
2016-17. The total is falling as the number of people dying below state
pension age is falling and it is expected to continue to fall as people
live longer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:10:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
Importantly, however, as my noble friend Lady Hollis and the noble
Baroness, Lady Finlay, reminded us very forcefully, behind these
statistics each death is a great family
tragedy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:11:07"></hs_TimeCode>. It is

includes a simplification of the conditions of entitlement and a
relaxation of the qualifying national insurance contributions
conditions. At this stage, I want to make two points. First, the
contribution record of the deceased partner is still the principle
qualification for these benefits, and that is important. This is not a
case of something for nothing: it is a payment out for people who have
paid in. Secondly, it is argued—although this is not reflected
in any amendment before the Committee this afternoon—that in
these reforms, the proposed contribution condition is more restrictive
than at present. In particular, the proposed contribution condition
requires Class 1 or Class 2 contributions, while the existing
contribution condition allows payment of Class 3 contributions.
Furthermore, unlike the current arrangements, it is argued, where the
contributor dies before the end of the relevant year for the necessary
contributions, there is no provision for earlier years to be aggregated
and treated as if made in the relevant
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:12:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Will the
Minister tell us whether this was intentional and, if so, why? Would

that it is not a replacement for income, but a grant to meet the extra
costs of bereavement. Therefore, he told us, it was easier to argue
that it should be exempt from tax. Accepting that this is, of course, a

59, in the name of my noble friend Lady Hollis engages directly with
the Pensions Minister’s call for a debate about how long support
should last. As explained by my noble friend, it seeks to extend the
time of payment of BSP to a bereaved parent with children for at least
three years or until the second year of schooling is complete for all
dependent children, whichever is the longer period. The Childhood
Bereavement Network states its confidence that this could be done
cost-neutrally by adjusting down the monthly rate of BSP for parents
and by reducing the lump sum for non-parents. Is the Minister willing
to use his resources to test whether that brief is well founded? If it
is, surely it significantly supports my noble friend’s
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:14:21"></hs_TimeCode>. She
has shared not only her own experience of the effect of the loss of a

60 also engages with the issue occupying the mind of the Pensions
Minister. It seeks to relax the work conditionality requirement for all
those in receipt of bereavement payments, which is especially important
for widowed parents. We know that some will not be fit and able to seek
work after experiencing the death of a spouse or civil partner, and my
noble friend Lady Hollis makes a powerful argument that we need to
protect people by building flexibility and protection into the
regulations, to take account of their personal circumstances. No two of
us are exactly alike.</hs_para>

pointed out in this argument when it comes to carers of children, in
the UC regulations kinship carers are exempt from work conditionality
for a year after they assume care of a child, in recognition of the
need to support children in care through a time of change. Why, it is
argued with some power, does the same principle not apply to
bereavement? The Pensions Minister, Steve Webb, said in the Public Bill
Committee in the House of Commons on 4 July 2013 that in practice local
Jobcentre Plus offices have the flexibility to do this without the need
for regulations. However, noble Lords know that where civil servants
have targets, it is much easier to be flexible if there is clear
permission for that, and geographical consistency in the interpretation
of the rules is more likely if there are regulations.</hs_para>

curiously, that families may be able to delay the start of their UC
claim, thus delaying the impact of the requirement to search for work
by eking out the lump sum and the monthly instalments. Is it fair that
families should face a choice between claiming UC and being with their
children? Once again, whether the flexibility that my noble
friend’s amendment calls for is appropriate will be influenced
by whether it can be done cost neutrally or at very minimal cost. Is
the Minister able to tell your Lordships’ Committee his
department’s estimate of the cost of implementation of the
amendment? If he is unable so to do, will he agree to instruct such a
calculation and write to my noble friend before Report?</hs_para>

Amendment 61, as it follows on logically from the powerful case my
noble friend has made about the impact of bereavement on spouses by
including in the group who would be entitled to payment of BSP for
longer those who have been in caring relationships. In all probability,
she argues convincingly, spouses who have been eligible for
carer’s benefit have been caring for a sick or disabled partner
or close family member until their death. The amendment seeks to
protect bereaved partners who have had carer’s allowances from
work conditionality where this is necessary to enable them to get back
on their feet. We know that many bereaved widows go back to work and
believe this is the best way to start to rebuild a life for themselves.
However, this simple amendment allows a little flexibility for those
who need longer to face their future alone or without their
partner.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140115104000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000041">My

that I received yesterday from the Childhood Bereavement Network has an
illustrative calculation which shows that treating WPA as income other
than earnings means that working widowed parents in receipt of both UC
and WPA could end up £7.50 per week worse off, simply on

Amendment 62ZB, tabled in my name and that of my noble friend Lady
Sherlock. It calls for a review of the impact of the proposed changes
on bereaved families through a report to Parliament within six months.
When debating the amendments in the names of my noble friends we
identified many but not all of the causes of unease about the impact of
these proposed changes on bereaved families, all of which support
further reflection. I pray in aid the evidence of Cruse Bereavement
Care and the Childhood Bereavement Network to the Commons committee,
and the Pensions Minister’s own concession on Report that how
long support should last is still an open question. The Minister may
have been persuaded that some of my noble friend’s amendments
would improve the Bill and better reflect the 21st-century context. If
so, he will accept them, but if not, there are still many questions
that require answers. A review such as that called for in our amendment
is the obvious answer to this challenge. We all recognise the need for
the Bill to be cost-neutral, but in this part we are dealing with
rather small numbers, particularly in DWP terms. Some of the proposals
put forward may have modest financial implications and all are
evidence-based. We on these Benches believe that this debate should
continue, if possible to a conclusion, before final decisions are made.
Furthermore, as many of these changes will be enacted largely through
regulations, the review need not delay the Bill.</hs_para>

Minister is not minded to accept any of the specific amendments or our
generic amendment, perhaps he could engage with these outstanding
issues in another way. The policy manager at the Children’s
Society, Dr Sam Royston, has advised us that within cost neutrality the
BSP could be extended to three years by reducing the ongoing payment
and by reducing the lump sum payment, both by comparatively small
amounts. I would be happy to share this proposal in detail with the
Minister and his team and am sure that his own support networks could
easily explore what adjustments to the payments might facilitate an
extension in the ways we have been discussing. First, I would ask the
Minister to consider in particular whether delaying the implementation
of the BSP to those aged under 45, until at least the time when savings
are to be made, would allow greater generosity and flexibility to
bereaved families. Secondly, does he agree—I put this
crudely—that, if we spread the jam slightly more thinly, it
would be possible for BSP to be paid to parents with the care of
children for at least three years?</hs_para>

tended to have been in response to particular pressures, and until now
no one has really considered how this benefit fits in with wider

simpler benefit and to provide specific financial support at a time
when it is needed most without affecting access to further support

that the financial impact of spousal bereavement is particularly acute
in the first months. Bereavement support payment is designed to provide
a significant cash boost for people in these early months, with a lump
sum followed by 12 monthly instalments.

61 is intended to allow us to pay a higher amount to those who have
been caring for their spouse or civil partner prior to bereavement.
Caring responsibilities at the end of life can be particularly
difficult and distressing and we recognise this by continuing the
payment of carer’s allowance for up to eight weeks after the
death of the person being cared for. Under the new system, this will be
paid in addition to bereavement support payment as opposed to being
taken into account in widow’s parent’s allowance and
bereavement
allowance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000055">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:27:34"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill does not preclude us from specifying a higher rate in regulations

eligibility for carer’s allowance or carer’s credit a
condition is neither targeted nor fair. It would be particularly
difficult to prove that someone would have been eligible for
carer’s allowance, or would have met any other such conditions,
after their spouse had died. Moreover, while we are spending more money
on bereavement benefits over the first few years of reform, clearly we
are in no position to significantly increase benefit expenditure. Money
for increased payments to certain groups would have to be taken from
elsewhere in the bereavement benefit budget, either resulting in lower
payments for those without dependants or lower payments for

away from a payment focused on immediate financial need would result in
more but less generous instalments, as noble Lords have pointed out.
Bereavement support payment would begin to resemble a long-term income
replacement benefit. It would then become an overlapping benefit and
could not be disregarded from universal credit and benefit cap
calculations. Probably more important in terms of the tax implications,
no 
<?notus-xml column=144?>decisions have been taken on the taxable status of bereavement support
payment. Any decisions will be taken as part of the annual fiscal
process in the context of the wider public finances. However, the
Treasury has indicated that because the lump-sum payment is intended to
meet the costs arising from bereavement and is not intended to be a
replacement for other income, it would not expect to levy income tax on
this payment. It is unlikely that a payment with a longer duration
could be exempt from tax. It is also likely that under EU co-ordination
rules, payments with a longer duration could be classified as a
survivor’s pension. This would mean that we could also be liable
to pay sickness and family benefits to a survivor abroad. If the
bereaved person or family does need ongoing financial support, then
other benefits would be available to provide this support, primarily
universal credit.</hs_para>

issue of conditionality. Bereavement support payment alone has no
work-related requirements attached to it, which is very similar to the
current bereavement benefits. Currently claimants on legacy benefits
who are bereaved will only be exempt from the work search requirements
for a maximum of eight weeks. However, under universal credit claimants
who are bereaved will be exempted from work search requirements for six
months, which is a generous improvement on the current system. When
discussing conditionality, we should keep in mind that we purposefully
designed a system where the requirements we place on individuals are
flexible and personalised to their circumstances. For bereaved
claimants of universal credit, including those in receipt of
bereavement support payment, or those who have lost a child, we do not
impose any work search requirements at all for six months. Following
this, we may begin to re-engage with the claimant, taking into account
their individual
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000060"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hollis of Heigham" PimsId="996" UID="140115104000320" xid="1545" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000320">Baroness

income that has been provided is adequate for someone to live on. As I
understand it, work conditionality therefore does not apply. If I have
misunderstood, I am very happy for the Minister to correct me, but I
think that he is making the comparison that we did not make, and he is
therefore answering a different

parents are unemployed and, if they claimed universal credit, would be
required to undertake work-related activity six months after
bereavement. Given that the policy of not imposing conditionality
requirements on bereaved claimants claiming universal credit for six
months is already more generous than that for bereaved individuals in
other circumstances, and that our flexible

distinction of kinship carers; I enjoy boasting about the one-year
concession on conditionality for kinship carers. I did that for very
particular reasons. The death of a parent at any time is clearly a huge
loss to a family and children need support during the grieving period,
which can be a long period of time, as my noble friend pointed out. In
fact, the evidence tends to show that grief comes out well beyond the
one-year period. The support will be not only for the surviving parent
who has knowledge of their child and how best to support them, but in
most cases there is an existing support network of extended family,
friends, schools and clubs. Unlike bereaved children who still have a
parent to support them, other children do not have that support as they
move into a kinship situation. They may have moved away from their home
and school, meaning that their social support network has also been
removed, and they need time to make new friends, settle into school and
learn completely new routines. The difference with kinship carers is
that this marks a huge change for both the child and the adult. On top
of that, the adult concerned may have little or no experience of
looking after a child, and will need time to make adjustments to their
own life in order to accommodate the child.</hs_para>

Finlay of Llandaff:</Member></B> I apologise if I am interrupting the
Minister when he is about to clarify something further, but I have a
question about those situations where things are even more complicated.
For example, one parent may have been driving the car, the other parent
killed and one of the other siblings killed, so that the bereaved child
feels anger towards the surviving parent as the person who was in
control of the vehicle when the accident happened, as well as being
bereaved of another sibling. Are those the sort of situations that the
guidance will address, and will it allow a more flexible interpretation
and 
<?notus-xml column=147?>some flexibility, particularly, over the six-month type of requirement?

some terribly tragic and difficult situations involved here. However,
the risk is that one looks at the very worst cases and draws up a
policy that suits them, even though the majority of people are not in
those extreme circumstances. What we are trying to develop here is a
reasonable norm and then a capacity to adjust for the kind of extreme
circumstances that do happen. We need to make absolutely sure that we
are able to adjust for those—that is the structure we are
looking at here. The risk is, as noble Lords know, that we do something
for everyone when literally only 2%, 3% or 4% are affected. Noble Lords

generous norms against other examples we are looking at. There are
people in employment, who would very rarely see a norm of six months,
and people who are cohabiting—a huge proportion of the people
who suffer this are in that situation and, as I will go on to say, it
is very difficult to help them any more. We set up a good norm and then
have a robust system to make sure that we can make the appropriate
adjustments for people for whom that norm is not appropriate. As I
said, I have asked my officials to meet with the Childhood Bereavement
Network in the coming months to discuss the policy approach in
universal credit and to look at the guidance. I hope that I will be

how widowed mother’s allowance and widowed parent’s

of any income-related benefit, it is necessary to consider the income
the house or individual has access to, including income from other
social security benefits. As both the two benefits—the WMA and
the WPA—are income-replacement benefits, it is right that they
are taken into account under universal credit. Disregarding them would
increase government spend on universal credit by a commensurate amount

Freud:</Member></B> The noble Baroness is now going back to the
conditionality debate, but I am now going on to the actual level of
payments, which is a somewhat different point. I understand that there
is a concern that there could still be a potential impact on a small
subset of those universal credit claimants who also receive widowed
parent’s allowance. This is the point about them being worse off
by £7.56 a week. This is not an unintended consequence, because
we have been clear about treatment of unearned income and that widowed
parent’s allowance would be deducted pound for pound in
assessing universal credit. As noble Lords know, universal credit is a
fundamental reform of the current benefits system and leads clearly to
both increases and reductions in the level of entitlements. However, no
one already on benefit whose circumstances remain the same will lose
out in cash terms as a direct result of the move because of the
transitional
protection.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000081">The
point is that widowed parent’s allowance is a taxable benefit.
Working claimants might not only have their allowance deducted from the
universal credit entitlement, but also pay tax on it through the tax
code in their earnings. The reduction in net earnings as a result of
the additional tax will be only partly offset by an increase in
universal credit because of the 65% taper. Noble Lords will appreciate
that there are good reasons why universal credit works on the basis of
net earnings and tapered withdrawal, because that is the mechanism that
is designed to incentivise work. Nevertheless, I will look carefully at
the points that have been made on this issue in this debate and by
stakeholders. I need to emphasise, however, that it would be a
disproportionate and expensive response to move to a full disregard for
all claimants of either of these two awards.</hs_para>

question of allowing bereavement support payment for unmarried couples
and the request for a review within six months following Royal Assent.
Our law and tax systems recognise inheritance rights and needs of
bereaved people only if they have a recognised marriage or civil
partnership. This stems from the founding principle of the national
insurance system, which is that all rights to benefits derived from
another person’s contributions are based on the concept of legal
marriage and civil partnership. Allowing cohabiting couples to have
access to bereavement benefits 
<?notus-xml column=149?>would significantly increase complexity; and proving cohabitation can be
incredibly challenging, not to say an intrusion into claimants’
private
lives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000083">On the
request for a review, there clearly needs to be a period following
introduction of the new payment to allow changes to bed down before we
can review its effectiveness and impact on the different groups of
claimants. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Browne, that we have
already committed to review the change in our impact assessment at a

another point made by the noble Lord on the take-up of bereavement
benefits. The take-up is high at around 90%, which has been helped by
the rollout of the Tell Us Once information service. The majority may
not qualify for the full amount due to the complex contribution
conditions. Indeed, this is why we have simplified them into a position
where someone is entitled to the new payment on the basis of payments
of 25 times the lower earnings limit in any one tax year. I believe
that the bereavement support payment will be simpler and fairer than
the current system, providing support when and where it is needed most
by supporting people to regain control of their lives as soon as they
can. These amendments would be a backward step resulting in more
complexity in a system that would provide less help to those who need

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very appreciative of
everyone’s contributions. A lot of issues have been explored,
and although the Minister has been as fastidious and careful as he
always is in trying 
<?notus-xml column=150?>to respond to the points, I have to say that, on what is now our fifth
day in Committee, I thought that his responses here have been less
persuasive than they have been to almost all of our other debates. They
will certainly require us to look very carefully indeed at the small
print of his responses because I am not persuaded by almost any of his
points.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140115104000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000090">Let
me first thank the noble Baronesses, Lady Finlay and Lady Meacher, and
the noble Lord, Lord German, who I think actually used the word
“cruel”. If the noble Lord wishes to resile from that, I
apologise. I think that they all spoke very well and movingly about the
situations in which families find themselves—not just singly
bereaved but doubly bereaved. Sometimes the surviving partner or spouse
may be seriously injured, which means that they cannot support a child
in the family in the way they would wish. We know that such tragedies
exist and the consequences multiply in what is a ripple effect for
families for many years. That is especially the case when there are
multiple losses. All sorts of feelings of guilt continue to plague
unreasonably and irrationally but completely understandably, those who
survive such a
situation.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140115104000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000305">6

Baroness, Lady Meacher, talked about the financial interlocking with
the tax system. I gather that the Minister, although unable to give us
a convincing answer on that yet, hopes to be able to help us further.
The noble Lord, Lord German, was seeking a genuine improvement in a
cost-neutral package, but 88% of people would be worse off as a result.
Taking it all into consideration, perhaps half per cohort benefit and
half lose out, but I do not think that other people possibly being
better off makes the situation satisfactory for those who lose. Every
family’s circumstances are
different.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000092">The
Minister particularly emphasised the work conditionality issue, by
which I am now completely baffled. I understand, although I do not
support, his emphasis on the need for a cost-neutral package. I was
very surprised by the Minister’s response on work conditionality
to the absolutely apposite statistics quoted by the noble Lord, Lord
German. An investment in support for children at that most vulnerable
period may actually go on to support those children against the other
risks they may face, particularly with mental health and depression. If
we withdraw that support by imposing work conditionality, we do so not
only at our risk but that of a significant cohort of those children who
have been exposed to
bereavement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000093">From
my own personal knowledge, I can say that
children—rightly—are stressed and numbed during that
first year, and particularly as each anniversary comes round. The
birthdays, the Christmases and the anniversary of the death are
particularly difficult moments. That grief often reoccurs almost like
flashbacks, a year, 18 months, two years or five years down the road.
If there is not flexibility—something which is not understood in
Jobcentre Pluses—around the implications of work conditionality
for the parents, then those children will continue to suffer
unnecessarily, beyond what we already know. The noble Lord, Lord
German, rightly entrusted
that—</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/1DE5B89C3254390F7938B41F26E84D76538AB0FD" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 January 2014">Wednesday,

Freud:</Member></hs_speaker> I want to make sure that the noble
Baroness adjusts the figure of 88% on the record, because that is not
the figure. I was trying to supply the figures. Across all groups, 50%
are better off compared to 48%. The figure of 88% is for a narrow group
of those in work who are receiving the widowed parent’s
allowance. A lot of misleading figures have been going around on the
structure of this. There are effects of the combination of these
payments with other benefits in the system, particularly universal
credit. You cannot ignore those interactions and our figures show that
poorer people in particular do well out of this new
system.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></hs_speaker> I emphasise again that without
seeing the Minister’s detailed working I will sustain the
figures I have, unless, until or if the Minister can show me the points
at which they are inaccurate. Is it 88% of widows with children in work
who will be worse off, and 57% of those not in work who will be worse
off? To put it another way, any widow with children who would have
claimed for two years or more will in future be worse off. It may be
that the Minister has not fully taken into account the cohort effect
with regard to the point people at which join the labour market.
Obviously, we should continue this in
correspondence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000097">My
noble friend Lord Browne pressed the Minister hard and showed again
that targets interlocking with financial need are going to leave very
many widowed parents in a far worse position. He encouraged the
Minister to consult further with the Childhood Bereavement Network
group of voluntary organisations to see whether a rearrangement of
these benefits can meet some of our concerns. I am pleased that the
Minister is willing to do this. He also argued not just for a
reconsideration but, if necessary, a review, especially as regards
cohabiting parents. If the Minister is serious about trying to bring
benefits up to date, he should recognise that 50% of all children are
now born outside marriage, even though the relationship may be an
entirely stable one with two committed parents. The Minister deploys
the argument of bringing structures up to date to suit his case, but
apparently refuses to recognise other people’s positions. He is
obviously right to want to continue to keep all benefits under review
as an act of stewardship. However, if he is going to take account of
this changed world, he is selecting what factors he chooses to take
account of and ignoring others that are equally significant—and
possibly in many ways more so—in their effects on families and
their
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:05:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000098">The
Minister made several points. First, as regards structure, I accept
that we need to review it but I think that he is going about it the
wrong way. Secondly, as regards money, he paraded the gainers against
the losers and implied that somehow that is all right because there is
some mythical average. It is not all right and I am sure we will come
back to that point. The point on which he was least persuasive was that
of conditionality. He seems to think that when you have lost a spouse
and your children are very insecure, fearful and frightened, and need
the surviving parent’s full-time attention, six months’
relief from conditionality is generous. I would tell him that he needs
to live in the 
<?notus-xml column=152?>world that such parents inhabit. It really is not generous. He is making
the comparison with, say, a single parent under UC. I accept that a
widowed parent in that situation would be more generously placed in
terms of work conditionality than a single parent unaffected by
widowhood would be under UC, but that is not the point we are
making<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:09:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000099">I
cannot believe that the noble Lord is deliberately bypassing this
point. Our knowledge of what those widowed parents and their children
experience was built into the previous structure that is now being
abandoned. There is an apparent reliance on the fact that the relevant
provision is somewhat better than UC, and therefore what have we got to
complain about? The Minister needs to ponder some of the literature
which the noble Lord, Lord German, identified; perhaps he has. It may
shape his perception of this issue of work conditionality. He is so
completely wrong on this that I am puzzled because I know that he tries
to enter into the situation of recipients of
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:07:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000100">Finally,
the Minister referred to kinship carers and charmingly boasted that he
had been responsible for making their situation better. I am very glad
indeed that he did, but the lesson I draw from that is that widowed
parents should now turn themselves into kinship carers. Is it his
intention to make the regime harsher for the parent and their children
who are suffering grief than is likely to be the case for kinship
carers, given that the latter are nearly always grandparents? I know
they are nearly always grandparents as I have done some work on this.
Is it the Minister’s intention that the regime should be harsher
for the widowed parent with children than for a grandparent caring for
the children, particularly if the maternal grandparent is involved who
has suffered not the direct loss of a son but, say, that of a
son-in-law? Is that what he is really arguing? I wonder how much
experience he or his team have had of engaging with families in that
situation. I would hope that at the very least he will take away from
this the argument that whatever he may or may not be able to do in
terms of budgets and cost
neutrality<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>—and
that may follow discussions with the voluntary groups, which we
welcome—he will at least extend his empathy for kinship carers,
which we respond to and recognise, to the similar group of widowed
parents, and at the very least not deploy work conditionality until a
year has passed. That would at least go some way to meeting our
concerns. Unless the Minister wants to respond to me further now, I beg
leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="140115104000374" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000374">Amendment

group of amendments looks lengthy, but its aim is remarkably precise.
Amendment 62ZC to Clause 32 is actually very simple; it
retains the power of the Secretary of State to put in place the
consolidation of small pension pots but removes the part of the
sentence that limits this to the pot follows member form of
consolidation. I will focus my contribution on Amendment
62ZC, as the other amendments in the group address the consequences
arising from that specific change. The Government believe that action
is needed to address the large number of dormant small pension pots
which will arise under auto-enrolment when employees move to new jobs,
as they do on  
<?notus-xml column=158?>average 11 times in their careers. We from these Benches agree that
action is needed, but not the form of action
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:11:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000103">The
impact assessment confirms that the Government considered two default
transfer options. The first option would be pot follows member, where
small pension pots follow the member to the new employer’s
pension scheme. The second is an aggregated scheme in which the small
pension pots are transferred to an aggregator such as NEST. The
Government had two choices, and I believe strongly that they made the
wrong
one<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:11:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000104">As
it stands, the clause allows only for pot follows member. Our
amendments would allow the possibility of using a default aggregator
model without the need for new primary legislation. I propose to
comment on the problem in order to demonstrate why I believe that the
Government’s proposed solution is flawed, to put forward an
alternative, and then pose some questions to the Minister. I promise to
do it as quickly as is
practical<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000105">I
turn first to the context. The core issues of trust and confidence
which we have discussed previously are still centre stage in getting
people to start and to continue saving for their retirement. We were
reminded afresh by my noble friend Lord Hutton that we do not have a
savings culture in this country in Committee last week. This Bill and
auto-enrolment need to give people the confidence that they need to
save for their old age. but how can we demand that people save if they
do not trust the saving vehicles and they do not trust the pensions
market as offering value for
money<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:12:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000106">The
pensions market is not a typical retail market where the consumer
chooses the product. Under auto-enrolment, the consumer does not choose
the product at all—the employer does. The employee choice is
either to stay in or opt out and lose the employer contribution
completely. There are also many intermediaries in the pension supply
chain. Pensions are a complex product; they lack transparency, and
while large employers may have the resources to pay for good advice and
assessment of fund performance, SMEs may not. The demand side is
weak<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:13:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000107">The
pensions market also has some very big players who offer pension fund
products, asset management, and annuities. The OFT says that the four
largest players have between them 68% of the assets, 76% of the schemes
and 61% of the members. The results are predictable; the combination of
a concentrated supply side and a weak demand side is bad for savers and
allows conflicts between the two to go unresolved, which is not in
savers’ interests. Those characteristics of the pension market
combine, as the OFT report puts it, to make the market
“dysfunctional”. The OFT concluded
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="140115104000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000292">“competition

clauses and amendments deal with the criticisms raised by the OFT in
its report, but this clause and our associated amendments deal
specifically with the challenges of small pension pots created by
auto-enrolment. The Government estimate that 50 million pension pots
will be created by auto-enrolment by 2050, 12 million of them under
£2,000. Already, one in six people have lost track of their
pension pots, and 
<?notus-xml column=159?>there are 1 million unclaimed pension pots out there. The evidence is
clear that the Secretary of State needs power to make regulations

the state of the market, so well captured in the OFT report, pot
follows member raises some significant risks. I may come back to those
at a later stage. There are also major challenges associated with the
setting up and administration of pot follows member. Some significant
criticisms have been made of the pot follows member model of
consolidating pension funds, most notably by my noble friend Lady Drake

harm members’ savings and would be disproportionately complex

need to find a solution that helps savers but does not expose them to
unnecessary risks. When he replies, will the Minister respond in detail
to these criticisms of pot follows member? Will he also tell the
Committee which organisations in the field of pensions are backing the
Government’s choice of pot follows member? I think that the
Association of British Insurers still is, but is anyone else? Why have
the Government not given more weight to consumer opinions? The
DWP’s own survey said that 61% of people chose an
aggregator<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:16:29"></hs_TimeCode>. By
contrast, the National Association of Pension Funds, the CASS Pensions
Institute, Which?, the CBI, the EEF, Age UK, the TUC and the Centre for
Policy Studies all backed an aggregator approach for consolidating
pension funds. That is a broad church of employers, staff
representatives and consumer interest groups as well as academics and
independent experts, and they all believe that aggregators would meet
the needs of savers better. I suggest that they would meet the needs of
employers better

are different ways to pursue aggregators: the NEST model we all know is
working well. CASS has another model and the National Association of
Pension Funds has developed a third and has done detailed work on a
model that would incorporate elements of PFM with an aggregator model.
I am not going to try to prescribe an aggregator in detail today, but
it seems to be a pre-requisite that we have an opportunity to hardwire
into aggregators features that will inspire trust and confidence and
reassure savers who are sceptical of the pension industry. This could
include certification of aggregators and a public service obligation
that would require them to accept automatic transfers in from pension
schemes. It is interesting that the NAPF takes the view that with a
robust regulatory framework for aggregators and quality standards at an
appropriately high level, it is likely that only a small 
<?notus-xml column=160?>number would be accredited. That makes a significant difference to the
likely burden on the employers who are

case is strong, but before I conclude, I would like to ask the Minister
a few questions. First, how is information to be handled within the
sector? The Pensions Minister in another place expressed an interest in
a national computerised pension database, preferably funded by the
industry. Can the Minister tell us whether he has made any progress on
this matter? Secondly, the Bill has not yet set a date for the start of
automatic transfer of schemes. Can the Minister tell the Committee
whether that will apply only to pensions accrued after the date of
enactment in April 2016? Would it apply to pension pots that are
currently active? Why are the Government not considering a solution
that could provide for future dormant small pots and address a wider
range of problems related to legacy dormant

Turner of Ecchinswell (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to
speak in support of this amendment. When the Pensions Commission
addressed the issue of private pensions eight years ago, we had two
absolute priorities. The first was the use of inertia through
auto-enrolment to increase the number of people involved in savings
schemes. I think we all agree that the degree of support for that
principle across society, industry and the political parties has been
most heartening, and indeed we are now seeing auto-enrolment coming
through with a considerable degree of success. Our other absolute
priority followed from the first one because once you auto-enrol
someone into a pension, you have to make sure that there is good value.
It was to bring down the extremely high costs of pension provision for
people on modest or low incomes in small and medium-sized enterprises.
We observed that if people went through the private competitive system,
by the time they retired, 25% or even more of their entire pension pot
had disappeared in cumulative charges over the years. We believed that
it ought to be possible to get that figure down to something like 5% or
10%, which makes an extraordinary difference to someone’s income
throughout their retirement. We are talking about people living with
incomes in retirement that are 20% or so higher than they would
otherwise <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:21:00"></hs_TimeCode>have
been.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140115104000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000115">Those
extremely high costs derived from the fundamental inefficiency of the
market for private pension provision. It is a system absolutely shot
through with market failure where the process of trying to provide in a
competitive fashion simply does not work well. We have heard already
from the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, the quote from the Office of
Fair Trading on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:21:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140115104000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000116">To get the costs down, it is important
to ensure that there are low costs for active members in the scheme to
which they are contributing, and it is also 
<?notus-xml column=161?>important that low charges are levied on those who have already
accumulated pots, and on those pots derived from past employment. That
requires two things. First, it requires measures to facilitate or
require the consolidation of pots, thus removing the costs of multiple
proliferation, which are of no benefit either to the industry or to the
individual. Secondly, it requires measures to ensure low costs in the
scheme into which we consolidate. Again, it is good that a consensus
has emerged over the years on the importance of those
objectives<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:22:12"></hs_TimeCode>. I
recognise that the pot following the member is proposed as being one
way to that end, but I am concerned that while it achieves the first of
the two crucial objectives of consolidation, it does not necessarily
achieve the second. It does not necessarily achieve low cost in the
scheme into which the person is being consolidated because there are
dangers that PFM could involve people being consolidated into a scheme
where they are paying higher charges than they were paying into the
scheme they had been contributing to, and higher charges than
necessary. I believe, therefore, that the aggregator option may be the
better one and that it needs to be looked at carefully and
fairly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:22:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

some trade-offs here, but I am not convinced that the impact assessment
which has been put before us is a good and fair assessment of that
trade-off. The key argument in the impact assessment is that if we go
down the aggregated route, we would need to apply it only to
“the smallest unprofitable pots” to ensure that the
aggregator scheme did not monopolise the market. It states then that
the department has interpreted that for the purposes of assessment by
assuming that you would aggregate pots only up to a maximum of
£2,000, because that was the figure which was suggested in
discussions with providers. That compares with the £10,000
assumed when it looks at the pot follows members. Indeed, it is quite
noticeable that when it looks at the PFM option, it gives us a set of
impact assessments for a variety of options—£2,000,
£5,000, £10,000 and £20,000—but when it
turns to the aggregator model, it considers only the £2,000
maximum
pot<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:24:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140115104000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000118">I accept that if it
was really necessary and unavoidable that if we go down the aggregator
route we apply it only to pots of up to £2,000, that might be a
good argument for taking the PFM route. But I believe that there is no
such necessity and that the logic in favour of it is invalid and needs
to be challenged. The argument is that a higher level would interfere
with the effectiveness of competition in the market and lead to
dominant aggregators. However, the whole of the edifice of
auto-enrolment, of NEST and of the regulations relating to value for
money is based on the recognition that we are dealing with massive
market failure and that we cannot rely on fair competition. We cannot
therefore consider the argument that some dominant aggregators might
emerge to be a valid argument against aggregation. Indeed, dominant
aggregators will only emerge if they are lower cost, and that—to
go back to my earlier point—is the absolutely central thing and
the criteria above all on which we should
focus<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:25:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Will we
get the costs down? Will we reduce the total reduction in
yield<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:25:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=162?><hs_para UID="140115104000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000119">I do not believe,
therefore, that the danger that the aggregators may become relatively
dominant in the market—which is really the only argument put
forward against it in the impact assessment—is a valid argument
against aggregation. I would urge that, to have a useful impact
assessment, we should be considering a range of options with a higher
maximum of £2,000 transfer. I see no inherent reason why we
should consider having no limit; I certainly believe that if we are to
have a fair comparison, we should be thinking about the same limit that
applies to the PFM option. I believe, therefore, that this choice
between PFM and aggregation should not be concluded at this point. It
requires more flexibility and thought to enable further consideration.
I am personally, in my gut, in favour of the aggregator limit option,
and I think it will be favoured over time, but all that this amendment
does is keep that flexibility open for future consideration without the
need for later primary legislation. I certainly think that that is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:26:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:26:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Drake:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may reiterate for continuity

barriers to be overcome before the Government can be confident about
the superiority of the PFM model? The consequences of getting this
wrong are huge. Yet the transfer model is in the Bill when there are so
many conditionalities still to work through, and confidence in securing
lower charges, which is the main benefit claimed for the PFM model, are
by no means
assured.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000126">PFM
requires effective pan-industry collaboration, but what if that is not
forthcoming? Are the Government confident that they can overcome
industry inefficiencies and conflicts of interest, so well articulated
by the noble Lord, Lord Turner? The DWP is working with the industry to
find an IT solution to match pots to members. There are significant
technical challenges to overcome, standardisation to be achieved and
the industry as a whole has to reach a consensus that prioritises the
savers’ interests. If and when that is achievable are unknowns,
but the Bill locks us into pot follows
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000127">Some
providers will have an interest in getting rid of small, less
profitable pots but will also have an interest in setting a pot size
cap to defend their more profitable pots. They will have a natural
antipathy to an aggregator with a pot cap that increases to a certain
level. However, the pot limit chosen for automatic transfer will affect
the number of separate pots that a saver builds up over their working
life. It is one of the issues that goes to the heart of the efficiency
of the aggregator model or the consolidation model chosen. Depending on
the assumptions about the aggregator or how many active member and
dormant-member pots that it has, the administrative savings can be
greater than those that have been estimated in the impact
assessment.</hs_para>

comments in its impact assessment that, overall, the results of its
modelling suggest the aggregator scheme will achieve slightly less
consolidation than PFM, but that needs to be set against the greater
control that an aggregator scheme could provide in mitigating other
risks that come with an automatic transfer mechanism. It would also be
interesting to see the results of modelling that includes
today’s dormant pots. I would like to come back to this.
Equally, pot follows member cannot be implemented without raising
quality standards, or the Government risk transferring the savings of
millions of ordinary people into myriad schemes over which they
currently have little quality
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000129">Even
if the Government succeed in getting all schemes to a minimum quality
standard, there will be a wide range between minimum standard and best
practice. 
<?notus-xml column=164?>For example, consider a modestly paid worker who leaves a good scheme
provided by a major retailer and goes to work for a two-person employer
running a small shop, whose workplace scheme has higher charges, poor
governance and a less suitable investment strategy. Would it really be
wise to default several thousands of pounds of the worker’s
savings into the new employer’s scheme? Regulation could set
standards for aggregated schemes above the qualifying standards for
automatic enrolment schemes, raising those standards in order to
mitigate the risks that can occur on
transfer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000130">Against
that, PFM increases the regulatory burden to oversee a myriad schemes
into which automatic transfers would be made, rather than focusing on
leveraging very high standards in a few aggregated schemes. There is
the potential for significant burdens on employers involved in
transferring small pots to any number of schemes. Under PFM, every
scheme would potentially need to be capable of communicating with every
other scheme. Aggregators could pose a lower burden, as there would
be—or could be—a much smaller number of such
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000131">Automatic
enrolment was intended to carry a lighter regulatory burden for
employers, especially SMEs, but this seems to be rowing in the opposite
direction. The National Employment Savings Trust, which embraces the
most transient low to moderate market, could consequently face higher
administrative costs as a result of PFM. What is the consumer detriment
to NEST members whose pots are transferred into the schemes of new,
small employers, and out of the protection of the high governance
standards in
NEST?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0001.htm#140115104000132">With

is not the firmest of springboards from which to lock into a solution
on the front of a Bill. On the differing views of what benefits the
saver, PFM does not currently accommodate people who leave the labour
force or become self-employed, as they have no employer scheme into
which to transfer their pot. Their ex-employer may nevertheless default
them into a poorer personal pension because they do not allow
ex-employees in their existing scheme, which I must say is a growing
trend. What of women who leave to become carers, move to a new
employer, or who work part-time but because of the level of the
earnings trigger are not auto-enrolled into the new employer’s

NAPF and others, pot follows member increases the risk of charges and
transaction costs being incurred on the whole pension pot, rather than
on the incremental amount saved with the previous employer. If the
saver works in an industry characterised by frequent job changes they
will be more vulnerable to these risks, which an aggregator could
reduce.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000137">Even
where individuals choose to transfer to their new employer’s
scheme, they face supply-side barriers. Transfers can take weeks if not
months, and complexity and lack of standardisation combine to cause
delay and increase costs. At decumulation the buying power of a larger
pot can be harnessed by the individual, but the buying power is even
better if open-market options can be exercised in bulk. Aggregators
could facilitate and do
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000138">I turn
to the third element, which is the need to protect dormant pots that
have already been accrued. A key weakness in pot follows member is that
it excludes existing dormant pots. An aggregator could pool an
individual’s dormant and live pots because aggregation would not
depend on an active scheme member moving to a new employer. Pot follows
member at the point of introduction only consolidates live pots with
future live pots. Today’s dormant pots are completely ignored.
No start date has been set for pot follows member, as my noble friend
Lady Sherlock has indicated, but by 2016 some five years’ worth
of dormant pots will have been built up under automatic enrolment, and
they will be excluded from the PFM proposition. The summary of the
impact assessment points out that those with dormant pots before the
start date will,</hs_para>

is a key weakness in this solution. Equally, it cannot be right that
they should stay with their existing scheme in every instance because
some employers will simply default these pots into alternative
arrangements anyway if the former employee does not voluntarily
transfer. If they are not allowed the option of access to PFM or the
aggregator, the employer may well default them anyway into a personal
pension.</hs_parafo>

pension pots is not only a future one, it is also one of legacy. Quite
a lot of work is being done on standards and reviewing legacy pots by
the DWP and the OFT, and there is work to come out of the FCA. I would
ask this question: is there to be no synergy on the solution to
transferring small pots post-2016 under auto-enrolment, and the
solution to the problems that may be revealed in the audit of legacy
schemes arising from the OFT investigation? Is it really going to be a
set of parallel lines in looking for the solutions to cover the legacy
problem, which could also be in auto-enrolment savings pots because of
the 2016 dateline and what evolves in the future?</hs_para>

maintains the power of the Secretary of State to make arrangements for
the transfer of pension pots, because everyone sees the compelling need
to have some way of aggregating or consolidating these small pots. This
amendment provides an opportunity to rethink the model to be chosen,
but it does not of itself substitute an alternative model. The
Government can eventually decide on the alternative 
<?notus-xml column=166?>model, and new primary legislation would not be needed—but it
would not lock us in. The effect of the amendment would not be to lock
us in to the PFM model at this stage. The reason for that is, I would
say, because the case is not proved, members’ interests are not
truly being defended, and there is no synergy with any dormant savings
that may exist prior to the implementation of PFM before 2016. I
believe that all these issues need much more
consideration.</hs_para>

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I have not spoken on
this item hitherto except briefly at Second Reading. In my opinion, it
is one of the most important issues before the Committee. That is
because it is quite obvious that the Government want people to save.
Everything they have been telling us about pensions indicates that they
want people to save. What happens if people do save, but then they
transfer jobs? Nowadays, of course, people do not stay in the same job
for their lifetime. They may have several or even many changes of job
in the course of a career. What happens to the pension pots that they
accumulate? If there is no safety in those pension pots, the whole
thing will be a disaster. I support strongly what my noble friends have

have more powers to deal with this? It is obvious that you cannot have
a situation in which pension pots are put at risk because there is no
way of handling the market or for dealing with people who will be
forced to make choices for which they do not have the necessary skills
or experience. They cannot make the right kind of choices and they may
end up with a bit of a disaster instead of a reasonable pension, or
even a reasonable lump sum to place with another pension provider.
Again, I hope that the Government will take seriously what has been
said in this debate. It is a very important
issue.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/EC999A6BC0A3D4C6A0A6E43212D0401885701EBE" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 January 2014">Wednesday,

Bates (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I can certainly assure the noble
Baroness, Lady Turner, that we will take very seriously what has been
said this afternoon because it comes from such authoritative sources.
We have had a high-quality discussion, as is typical of this entire
Committee. In fact, at one point I think that we had a Turner
commission quorum. This is a very important discussion. We are agreed
about the urgent need to tackle small pots and to keep people engaged
as regards the value of their savings with a view to their increasing
them and being able to purchase a bigger pension when they retire. The
savings culture to which the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, has just
referred is at the heart of this amendment and the proposals we have
put
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:56:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000144">First,
I wish to put some general remarks on the record and, in so doing,
speak to government Amendments 62A and 62B, standing in the name of my
noble friend Lord Freud. I will then turn to the issues and questions
raised and, I hope, give noble Lords some comfort on
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:56:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000145">I
think it is worth starting on a note of consensus. Clearly, there is a
strong sense that the issue of the proliferation of small pots is one
that needs to be addressed. There is some disagreement about how we 
<?notus-xml column=167?>get there—an issue on which we have consulted extensively since
2011. We announced our preference for the pot-follows-member- model in
2012 and reiterated it in the Command Paper published last year. A full
and proper policy-making process has been followed in coming to this
conclusion. These amendments seek fundamentally to change our proposals
to a type of aggregator model, where pension pots will be moved to a
separate nominated transfer scheme. We consulted on the option of an
aggregator and there was no clear consensus for a particular type of
aggregator. We received views on single, multiple and virtual
aggregator models and only 19% of respondents preferred a multiple
aggregator which these amendments seek to introduce. Therefore, these
provisions, while providing a broad framework, legislate specifically
for the pot-follows-member model, providing a clear direction to drive
development of the detailed transfer process and to enable the industry
to plan for the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000146">I
will take some time to set out why this Government believe it is right
to take this approach. The rationale behind automatic transfers has
always been to ensure that individuals have better retirement outcomes
and we believe that pot follows member will help to achieve this
because it brings greater pension pot consolidation. The proportion of
people reaching retirement with five or more dormant pots could fall
from one in four without reform to nearly one in 30. We estimate that
pot follows member will halve the number of dormant pots and make net
administrative savings of £6.4 billion by 2050. That
is a key point because the administrative costs of pensions are at the
heart of what we are talking about in terms of charges, so therefore
reductions in costs mean a bonus for the
savers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000147">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:59:16"></hs_TimeCode>
contrast, by their very nature, aggregator models mean less
consolidation than pot follows member. Individuals will have at least
two pots in a single aggregator model and they could have many more in
a multiple aggregator model. Our research
shows<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> that a
single aggregator scheme would achieve only around half the net present
value of a pot-follows-member system to the new employer’s
scheme. Given that people are more likely to engage with pension saving
as they see their pot grow, coupled with the fact that most annuity
providers require a minimum of at least £5,000 or £10,000
in a pension pot to achieve the market option to which the noble
Baroness, Lady Drake, referred, consolidation is a key objective to
achieve greater results and economies from the purchase of
annuities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:00:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:01:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140115104000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000309">7

is being successfully harnessed to build pension-saving, and this
principle is being employed in automatic transfers. We hope, however,
that over time member engagement will increase as individuals see their
pension pots grow, even when they change jobs. The key to building
increased engagement is to maintain the relationship between employer
and employee in the workplace and keep a track of where their savings
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000149">Pot<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:00:52"></hs_TimeCode>
follows member aligns with automatic enrolment in this respect; when an
individual joins a new employer, they will be automatically enrolled
and in many cases their small pension pot will also be transferred.
That is in many ways the synergy that was being looked for 
<?notus-xml column=168?>and is delivered by this model. By contrast, if a pension pot gets sent,
by default, to some organisation that the person has no relationship
with and may never have heard of, the chances and opportunities for
them to engage are more remote—not impossible, but more remote.
Choosing or being allocated to an aggregator scheme also brings
complexity for both the individual and the employer. We know from all
aspects of business that where there is complexity there is also cost,
and one of the objectives is to reduce the level of charges.
Support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:01:25"></hs_TimeCode> for our
simpler, employer-focused solution is demonstrated by recent NOW
Pensions research showing that more than one-third of workers, 39%,
would like their pension pot to follow them automatically when they

would like to stress that a system of automatic transfers is not a
device for bringing further radical changes to the pensions market. We
are already making significant changes to the private pensions

requirements around minimum quality standards, which I shall return to
later and which were raised, rightly, by several noble Lords. We
believe that the industry will be able to deliver a system of automatic
transfers only if it is focused on improving consolidation in workplace

I conclude I want to address some of the points raised in the debate,
and a point on scheme quality, which we will come on to more in Clause
41. One consistent argument for the aggregator is that it helps to
prevent member detriment by ensuring pots are transferred to good
aggregator schemes. I think that we need to be slightly careful here,
in having this debate and in talking about good and bad schemes. There
should be no such thing as a bad scheme. This is a regulated industry;
if there were a bad scheme, it should have been closed down and it
should have been drawn to our attention. So we are simply talking about
differences in terms of the charges—and I shall come on to that

auto-enrolment, when perhaps it should have been the case that scheme
quality was dealt with at that time. That would have made an awful lot

because there might be some merit in what the noble Lord said. One of
the core issues is that a default pension scheme was not chosen but I
do not want to drift there. However, it does not matter who should have
dealt with the minimum standards for qualifying schemes and when. If
the Government are going to take to themselves the power to say, on
behalf of millions of people in this country, “We will
automatically transfer”, then the governance standards required
in the scheme receiving the pots transferred under those terms have to
be pretty high, do they not?</hs_para>

genuine question, and I am trying to give an honest and genuine
response, which is to say that we are not necessarily comparing like
with like here. Although people understand how the pot-follows-member
scheme might work—in other words, they will have just one pot,
and everything will be transferred into it—they do not
necessarily understand what the noble Baroness is proposing in terms of
alternatives, whether they are single, multiple or virtual aggregators.

Another reason why we have 
<?notus-xml column=170?>come to this conclusion is because there is a great deal of uncertainty
about what is happening out there. Auto-enrolment in pension schemes
has been a huge success and the previous Government deserve credit for
introducing it in the 2007 and 2008 Acts, based on the recommendations
of the Turner commission. The price of the success of auto-enrolment is
that it is creating a larger number of smaller pension pots as people
move on. Figures have been quoted of there already being 370,000, and
the noble Baroness, Lady Drake, has talked about a future figure of
600,000. That means that the need to make a decision is more urgent
than ever. The noble Baroness was asking, “What does the
industry think? What are people actually thinking?”. <I>Pensions

was about policy, then this year it is going to be all about making
things work. Government have now clearly set the direction of travel.
The success of auto-enrolment—in terms of low opt-out
rates—means even more small pots are going to be created than
were expected. Previous estimates that auto-enrolment would create
around 370,000 new pots of less than £2,000 each year now look
woefully
low”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="140115104000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000163">They

have one pension pot; under the other scheme they may have several;
they will be able to keep track of that and follow it through. Anyway,
we can discuss and debate that, but in all of the consultation that was
undertaken, it was clear that there was a strong view in
favour—not only from the respondents of the consultation, but
also in the opinion polls that followed from the industry.</hs_para>

standards across a broader range of schemes. Therefore, in doing so, it
would benefit not just those affected by these pension pot transfers,
but also the existing members of those schemes.</hs_para>

consulted on £20,000, £10,000, £5,000, all the way
down to £2,000 and even £1,000, which is similar to the

Bates:</Member></B> It is a shame that the noble Lord, Lord Turner, is
not here to respond to that himself or to clarify the point, but I take
the clarification from the noble Baroness about where he was going. On
the issue of how to drive down costs, the noble Lord referred to the
potential and mentioned some horrendous numbers—25% or 30% of
accrued pension disappearing in charges and how low it was possible to
get that. There are some very interesting findings, which we are
consulting on at present, about how technology would be a key ally in
this. The noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, asked about this too,
wondering whether we preferred a paper-based system or an electronic
system. Our preference, based on the current evidence, is invariably
towards electronic, because there are associated costs every time you
push a bit of paper around. I was interested to read in various
articles that you might be able to get the figure for the entire
transaction of a transfer down to £105 for both transmitting and
receiving the amount if you do it electronically. There needs to be an
electronic element to this and that probably points in the direction of
a database. We are still consulting on that. We are open to advice, but
that is probably something on which the industry will have to offer
views.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140115104000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000310">7.15

That is an excellent point. No decision has been taken on that. As I

the pots created under automatic enrolment. That seems broadly
correct.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000175">I
think that I have dealt with the points made by the noble Baroness,
Lady Drake, on whether individuals will face greater transaction costs
and what will happen to legacy pots. We have talked about flexibility
and whether self-employed people will be included. That was another
good point. Initially, automatic transfer will apply in respect of any
person who is a worker and an active member of a workplace pension
scheme. Automatic transfer builds on automatic enrolment, which in turn
relates to an employer duty, so it places the focus on workers first.
There is scope to refine and broaden these provisions to include the
self-employed if we consider that appropriate at a later date, but no
provision has yet been set for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000176">Before
I wrap up, I will mention the two minor amendments in this group. One
removes the definition of a member from Schedule 16, ensuring that
anyone still in the accumulation phase has the same chance to
consolidate their small pots as other savers. The other allows us to
amend the levy provision to meet HMRC expenditure if its existing
infrastructure could help in implementing automatic transfers. We
appreciate the importance of getting this new system right. We are at
an early stage of development but so far the engagement with industry
representatives and other stakeholders has been positive. Our
pot-follows-member approach will drive better outcomes for individuals

am sorry. I have a great deal of respect for the Minister but I am
afraid that he was unable to answer the major questions that came up
today. I do not blame him for that. He did not invent the policy: it
was invented in another place and he is doing a good job of defending
it. But the fundamental questions are out there unanswered. The noble
Lord, Lord Turner, pushed home the consequences of that market failure
on high costs and charges and what that does to savers’ incomes,
and the fact that, despite the Government's best intentions, pot
follows member simply does not contain within it the means for
addressing
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000180">The
noble Lord also pointed out the consequence of what happens to
savers’ incomes in retirement of not getting that right now.
Those effects will run for a long time. I was very grateful for the
intervention of the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham. Given the origins of
this Bill, I thought it was a brave and helpful intervention. But the
questions that he posed about how pot follows member can deal with old
pots and multiple moves are still sitting on the table. It will be
interesting to hear whether there is some small movement on auto
enrolment pots, but we will still have the issue of significant numbers
of dormant small pots.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140115104000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000181">We still do not have
an answer, as my noble friend Lady Drake pointed out, to the problem of
people who are leaving the labour market altogether either to become
self-employed or simply to leave the labour market. What happens to
those
pots?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000182">We did
not really get an answer as to why, when so much of the Bill is
remarkably loose, the Government suddenly get very prescriptive in this
area and solely specify PFM on the face of the Bill. As my noble friend
Lady Drake pointed out very powerfully, there are some major
difficulties of implementation. The Minister is calling for speed and
action now. He must know that the barriers to implementation described
by my noble friend Lady Drake are such that he is not in a position to
press that button now. If he is, he might want to respond to the
questions that she posed about the IT challenges, the standardisation
challenges, the huge issues of implementation and the need to build
consensus across the industry to prioritise savers’ interests.
If he feels that the Government have all those cracked, I encourage him
to stand up and intervene and tell me now. Otherwise, there is a lot
more work to be done. All this amendment is trying to do is to make
sure that that work does not abandon the alternative
option—which may in the end be the saving of our shared
objective—when there is no need to do so at this
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000183">I am
also concerned about some of the points that the Minister raised in
response to there being no single model. I would be very happy to work
with the Government to see if we can build consensus around a single
model of an aggregator. If that is what the Minister offers, let us
work together to try to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000184">The
Minister said that there would be more consolidation in pot follows
member. Leaving aside for one moment the serious concerns about the
judgment made in the impact assessment raised by my noble 
<?notus-xml column=174?>friend Lady Drake and the noble Lord, Lord Turner, if pot follows member
does not tackle the full range of risks that have been described, then
that simply does not answer the question. The Minister again gave an
argument that most annuity providers would require a minimum level of
pot and the point of decumulation, but again he did not take on the
point made by my noble friend Lady Drake, which is that being able to
buy in bulk in the market, which an aggregator could do at the point of
decumulation, actually opens up whole opportunities in that
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000185">He made
the point about good and bad schemes and that there should not be any
bad schemes. I completely agree with him, but there are 200,000 pension
schemes in this country. The chances of getting all those up to an
optimum level before this is introduced are frankly unrealistic. Given
that, the point made by my noble friend Lady Drake stands even more
strongly. Even if the Government could guarantee to get all those
schemes up to what they would regard as an acceptable minimum standard
in the context of the criticism of market failure made by the noble
Lord, Lord Turner, and even if they could do that fast, there will
still be a significant difference between the best and worst returns.
For reasons I will explain in a moment, that seems to be very difficult
in the context of auto
enrolment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000186">I
was pleased that the Minister managed to find some backing for his
scheme from a survey. Did he say that the survey was conducted by the
ABI?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000187"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Bates" PimsId="5331" UID="140115104000363" xid="1992" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000363">Lord

Sherlock:</Member></B> That is marvellous. So the ABI backs a scheme
and the survey conducted by the ABI backs the scheme. That is
excellent. I think it still leaves out some possibility that there may
be other people out there who do not back the scheme. Perhaps it was
the other way round. Either way, I think it is the same point made
differently. None the less, I take the point and thank him for sharing
that with
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000189">The
Minister also made the point that there will be real
attractions—and he quoted someone from Legal &amp; General
saying that it was clear that the direction of travel from the
Government was for pot follows member. There are—but, of course,
this is a Bill, not an Act. It is open to Parliament to make a decision
if it does not agree with what the Government are proposing, and so far
this Committee clearly does not agree with what the Government are
proposing. Not one person who has spoken backed the Government’s
plan; all backed the alternative. So we still have an opportunity. He
also went on to say that many advantages have been mentioned of people
having one big, fat pension pot. Of course, there is no reason why that
big, fat pension pot could not be sitting in a well performing, well
regulated, successful
aggregator.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000190">That
takes us to the fact that we have two significant public policy
dilemmas or issues. The challenge that we have here is made all the
more significant by the fact that it comes on the back of
auto-enrolment. This is not an individual employee making a choice to
go to a pension fund, place their money in it and take their risks in
the market. This is somebody who is not 
<?notus-xml column=175?>choosing, but is simply choosing a job, and by doing so will be forced
by default, if they make no other choice, automatically, without their
express consent, their pension pot will be moved from their previous
employers to their new employers. That is in the context whereby
already the state has auto-enrolled them. So step one, without any
active consent, we have auto-enrolled them in a pension scheme. Step
two, when they move jobs, without any active consent we default moving
it with them to the new employer. Doing that in a context where the
level of return that they might have expected to gain with the old
employer could, potentially, be significantly higher than that which
might be enjoyed with the new employer, creates the possibility that
the state is creating consumer detriment on a significant scale. That
is a very serious challenge, and in that context I suggest that the
Government’s proposal of pot follows member has a very high bar
to
pass.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000191">Finally,
the other public policy point is that, if one of the consequences of
this is that significant numbers of savers end up with lower retirement
incomes than they might otherwise do, that is bad for them, but it is
also bad for us as a country. I think that my noble friend Lady Drake
quoted from the impact assessment, which suggested that the gains and
losses would balance out across the piece. Even if that is true, and I
do not know the impact assessment well enough to be sure—I do
not have enough confidence in it yet to be confident of
that—that does not help us individually. On average, the life
expectancy may be X, but if mine is significantly below and yours is
significantly higher, the difference matters quite a lot to me, because
although on average we may both die at 84, if I die at 60 and you die
at 100, that does not make me happy. So the consequences for
individuals are really quite
significant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140115104000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000192">Given
all that, there is also the fact that the distribution will mean that,
if savers do not go into retirement with the kind of incomes that the
Government expect them to have, the whole strategy for retirement on
which this is predicated begins to be called into question. So this
whole Bill is predicated on an assumption that 
<?notus-xml column=176?>future generations of savers will have higher retirement incomes because
of all these actions taken. It is, therefore, absolutely incumbent on
all of us to make sure that the Government get this right. All this
amendment does is to put the aggregator option into the Bill. I urge
the Minister to accept it and to work with us in doing that. We will
definitely return to this matter at a later stage but, since this is
the Moses Room, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="140115104000386" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140115-gc0002.htm#140115104000386">Amendment
