safety, including cycle safety, very seriously and have committed
£278 million of funding directly for cycling. Furthermore, the
department has made it considerably easier for local authorities to
implement a 20 miles per hour speed limit, Trixi mirrors, new designs
of advanced stop lines and other highway measures to support cycle
safety. We also continue to work with the haulage industry to drive up
vehicle standards and awareness of vulnerable road

of us wish to encourage safe cycling. In that context, is the Minister
in a position to seek to secure a review of all the measures relating

question of cycling helmets—and involve in that review cycling

number of safety measures. On cycle helmets, this week I had a brief
discussion with the Secretary of State in the presence of our Minister
for cycling, my honourable friend Robert Goodwill. Our approach is
non-legislative—we do not want to make cycle helmets compulsory.
We would rather encourage and support people to wear helmets for
safety. It is not good to burden cyclists. We would rather see more
cyclists on our roads and cycling
safely<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:09:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:09:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that needs to be addressed. He said that he was encouraging local
authorities to spend more money on cycling. Will he confirm that there
will be some ring-fenced money for cycling, as local
authorities’ resources are very stretched? Will he further
confirm that much of that money will be put towards better use of road
space for separate cycle lanes so that cyclists can feel safe in

area depends on the local authority, but we have allocated £278
million of funding and are spending double the amount in this
Parliament compared to the last one. Local authorities make their own
assessment of dangerous cycling spots in their areas and can apply for
cycle safety funds. With regard to cycle lanes, new roads are designed

confrontation with cyclists. Where cyclists cause problems, it is a
matter for the police to take the necessary action. We want to see safe
cycling, not dangerous cycling. The noble Baroness raises a very
important point about pedestrians, who do sometimes have problems with
cyclists, and the Government are taking the necessary action through

London and the Government on heavy goods vehicles cropped up this
morning in the papers. I do not have a briefing on that subject but
would be very happy to write to the noble Lord. We work continuously
with a number of stakeholders, including the haulage industry, to make
heavy goods vehicles safer. We have introduced Trixi mirrors and
passenger left-hand side mirrors, and we will introduce sidebars for
lorries. A number of other measures have also been taken, including
written and oral tests for haulage drivers. However, we have to wait
for what we call the cycle delivery plan, which will take a number of
factors into account and is due out in autumn this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000034"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:14:34"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Geddes" PimsId="3402" UID="14013072000736" xid="1235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000736">Lord

trade delegations that the Prime Minister and other senior Ministers
have undertaken in recent times, promoting services has been uppermost
in their minds. One of the great strengths of the UK in terms of
professional services is that the standards we set here through bodies

worldwide reputation, which underpins the credibility of British
companies seeking to sell their services internationally.</hs_para>

north-east is the region where unemployment has not gone

finance—putting more money into the least deprived areas and
taking it from the most deprived areas—means that the most
deprived are seeing cuts of 25% in the services that are critical for
those who are suffering from the poor economic position. We do not moan

the United Kingdom of the Scottish independence referendum. I feel
strongly that the question of independence for Scotland raises issues
that should involve the whole United Kingdom. I welcome the number and
range of interests across the House, and from across the nation, that
the debate has attracted, in particular the participation, with her

friends among the other partners. With Northern Ireland and Wales,
there is a kind of fellow feeling against the might of England, yet
over 800,000 expatriate Scots live in England and 400,000 English
people live in Scotland. It is a source of great regret that so many
expatriate Scots are disenfranchised in this referendum. They may think
of themselves as British and take pride in that and in their Scottish
antecedents, yet north and south of the border, within two generations,

countries are woven into the fabric of the United Kingdom. Must they
now, both Scotland and England, disavow that shared history? Would that
not dishonour the sacrifices, made in common cause, of those who died
for the United Kingdom, a nation now to be cut in two if the present
generation of Scottish nationalists have their way? I earnestly hope

positive about an independence campaign that would destroy so much.
However deep-rooted the fellow feeling and the sometimes grudging
respect with which Scotland has jogged along within the UK, I believe
that it would evaporate rapidly after a yes vote. Notwithstanding the
rose-tinted spectacles of its present Government, Scotland would become
a competitor of England, not a compatriot. The Governments of the
remaining UK and its devolved Administrations would be obliged,
regardless of sentiment or blood ties, to fight their own corners,
fiercely if necessary, in the ensuing relationship. It would risk
becoming like an increasingly hostile divorce, in which the parties
continued to live next door to each other afterwards.</hs_para>

Wales and Northern Ireland? No wonder we hear that they feel worried
and unsettled. If Scotland leaves, the population of the non-English
part of the United Kingdom would be reduced by over half. The
Principality and the Province would begin to look like mere add-ons to
an overweening England. Surely no one would want to send vibrations
from Scotland that might reopen old wounds elsewhere, but the trauma of
a broken union would shake all its parts. The once-united kingdom would
shrink, not just physically, but in the eyes of the world. Others would
see it as diminished: diminished in size, diminished in population,
diminished in strength and diminished in authority. The mother of
parliaments would be viewed as unable to hold itself together. An
historic partnership of peoples would seem to be crumbling and
Britain’s international prestige and influence would crumble
with it. Our standing in the Commonwealth would change, our standing in
Europe, in NATO, the UN, the World Bank and the World Trade
Organisation—one could go on. These are just some of the

bad for the

specific issues have emerged in Scotland thus far, during many months
of debate. I wish that I had time now to address them all in detail,
but I am confident that other noble Lords will do so during the debate.
Much detailed work has been done, both by the United Kingdom government
departments and by many respected independent bodies. However, almost
none has been offered by the nationalist Administration in Scotland. A
much-heralded White Paper was published by them. We had been told that
it would answer all our questions. However, at some 650 pages, it has
used its very length to obscure its emptiness. It is a wish list. In
reality, the governing party that wants to take Scotland out of the UK
has no answers to any of the challenges that a separate Scotland would
face. On almost all of them a separate Scotland would be a supplicant,
based on blind optimism and reliant on concessions from others for its
viability<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:44:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the currency, on which the Governor of the Bank of England was so lucid
in his warnings yesterday. The SNP White Paper asserts that the pound
belongs to Scotland as much as it does to England, but that is not so.
It belongs not to Scotland or to England but to the United Kingdom,
which the SNP wants to leave. If a separate Scotland were to use the
pound as its currency, with or without the United Kingdom’s
consent, it would find that its fiscal and monetary policy would
ultimately reside with the nation that it had abandoned. Scotland would
not have a viable central bank. It would not be able to print money in
a crisis and it could not be a lender of last resort. In effect its
status would have changed from that of partner to that of

takes pride on the one hand in Scotland’s wealth, while on the
other it claims that, liberated from the United Kingdom, Scotland would
become one of the world’s wealthiest nations. Yet that is what
Scotland is already and that wealth has been achieved as part of the
United Kingdom, not just overnight but built up over three
centuries<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:46:03"></hs_TimeCode>. Only
last month, the Centre for Economics and Business Research forecast
that the United Kingdom, currently

five years and possibly even Germany later. Who would a separate
Scotland overtake and how? We should be told that. The SNP’s

western world only America is growing faster than the United
Kingdom, and by only a
fraction<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:46:40"></hs_TimeCode>. Oil
is, of course, the great panacea, but as we all know it is a
commodity of volatile value, which is decided by world markets, not by

present the Scottish economy has strengths, but it also has
vulnerabilities. For a start, it has too high a preponderance of public
sector jobs and too low a proportion of wealth creators. Scotland does
not have many large companies and more than 80% of those companies that
employ over 250 people are owned outside Scotland. Of the large
Scottish companies such as Standard Life, the Royal Bank of Scotland
and Scottish and Southern Energy, most of their business is conducted
outside Scotland. For such companies the inescapable introduction of
another tax regime, separate regulators and administrative structures
and the need to redesign their pension schemes would almost certainly
drive some of them
south.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000112">Consider
the banks in particular. We are told by the Treasury that the assets of
Scotland’s banking sector are equal to over 12 times
Scotland’s GDP—an astonishing figure. That would not
attract the confidence of the outside world or indeed of the
bank’s own directors. They need an established lender of last
resort, stability and long-term security, but there would be no
stability and no safety net in a Scotland in which any new financial
crisis emerged. As fast as the new country established a separate
financial jurisdiction, its banks would be scuttling across the border
to find a lender of last resort. Already the UK Treasury has had to
step in to underwrite, for a nervous world, some of the potential debt
liabilities of a separate Scotland.</hs_para>

present strengths of the Scottish economy—and that of
England—is the extent of economic integration that exists
between the two countries. Around 30,000 people travel in and out of
Scotland every day to work. The postal, telephone and e-mail services
hum with transactions every day between the two countries and the roads
and rail services are kept busy. Those are the arteries of a united
economy. Cut them and both countries would
bleed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000114">A paper
published by the Department for Business shows that in 2011
Scotland’s trade with the rest of the UK represented almost 30%
of Scottish GDP. Indeed, in 2011 Scotland sold twice as much in goods
and services to the rest of the United Kingdom as it did to the whole
of the rest of the world. Perhaps more surprisingly, Scotland is the
second biggest market in the world for goods and services from the rest
of the United Kingdom; only the United States takes more.
So<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:49:45"></hs_TimeCode> it seems
clear that, at present, the United Kingdom forms a highly efficient
single market, an ever closer union of peoples that has actually
worked. The OECD has recognised it as the most market-oriented,
economic and regulatory environment among its membership.

of the European Union offers no escape. It seems clear that the
Scottish Administration’s plans to gain quick re-entry via
Article 48 have already been rejected and that no special treatment can
be gained under Article 49. It might take years, if it happened at all.
What is more, the new Scotland would not take with it any entitlement
to a budget rebate on entry but would have to start contributing to the
remaining United Kingdom’s budget rebate. It seems probable that
it would have to join the euro eventually and to join the Schengen
group, which would therefore mean that Scotland could not belong to the
United Kingdom’s and Ireland’s common travel area. That
in turn would lead inexorably to the rest of the UK having to set up
barriers and customs posts across the 95-mile border between Scotland
and England, with all the hold-up and disincentive to trade that that
would
entail<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:51:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000116">All
this would add up to a new country with big problems, but England would
surely prefer to see its neighbour as rich and successful, rather than
have its second biggest customer in decline. For the first time in 300
years, England would have an undefended northern land border; it would
have a country to its north that wanted to join NATO but refused to pay
the nuclear entry fee. The implications for the UK’s defence are
immense. I have no doubt that other noble Lords may wish to expand on
that important matter and on many
others<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:51:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000117">I
would like to spend a few moments in addressing what I believe could
happen after the referendum if, as I passionately hope, the outcome is
that the Scottish electorate vote no. The very fact of the referendum
shines a light on our now complicated constitutional arrangements. I
welcome the Prime Minister’s firm commitment not to discuss any
further constitutional change ahead of the referendum, because that
would only cloud the issue of separation—just what the
separatists want. It is absolutely right that we should address the
referendum question head-on, with no
distraction<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:52:20"></hs_TimeCode>. The
question of whether or not to walk away from the rest of the United
Kingdom will be one for the people who live and vote in Scotland, but
what happens afterwards will not be. More devolution, or less, is a
quite different matter. It is a matter for the whole United Kingdom,
and that includes Wales and Northern Ireland as well as England. As
others have pointed out, to resign from a club is for the individual
member; to change the rules of the club is for all the

seems to be an extraordinary mood among many in the Scottish political
parties who oppose separation, who believe that they can simply agree
on a shopping list of further powers for their Parliament and that such
powers will be granted as of right. Scotland is going to have to
abandon this mood and, I say gently, get real. Devolution is not just
about Scotland; it affects everyone. A power devolved to one part of
the United Kingdom creates imbalances elsewhere. Devolving a power is
not about favours, still less about demands. It is the quality of
government that matters, rather than the quantity. It is about
responsibility and 
<?notus-xml column=1365?>accountability, not just power. The present arrangements give the
Scottish Government power to spend 60% of all government expenditure in
Scotland—that is comparable with the German Länder and
more than the Australian states and the Canadian provinces—but
the responsibility is to raise only 20%. Such is the lack of
accountability that has
developed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:52:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:53:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000119">Scotland
had for years devolved to it a 3p in the pound discretionary power to
raise or lower income tax. It was not used. The SNP Administration even
allowed it to lapse. Now there is a new Scotland Act, the 2012 Act, on
the statute book for two years. It contains the biggest fiscal transfer
in British history, which will soon give the Scottish Parliament the
responsibility to raise 10p in the pound of its revenue locally with a
corresponding cut in its block grant, and to raise more than that or
less than that if it so
chooses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:54:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:53:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:54:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Except on borrowing for capital expenditure, there is no upper limit to
the use of that power. The Act even grants the power to invent and
impose new taxes with the consent of the United Kingdom’s
Parliament, but why did it give that power if it did not intend to
allow it to be used? Therefore, Scotland now has the power to raise and
spend what it needs to implement the policies that it judges necessary.
It does not need to wrench the country out of the United Kingdom to
achieve that. I find it very strange that that Scotland Act, and the
authority that it brings to Edinburgh, has gone entirely unmentioned in
the referendum debate so
far<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:55:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000120">However,
all these changes bring anomalies elsewhere. In particular, I believe
that the position of England needs to be considered. Already one can
see the beginnings of a kind of identity crisis developing there. Two
of the serious flaws of the Scotland Act 1998 can surely no longer be
allowed to fester—namely, the West Lothian question and the
Scottish spending block, in particular the Barnett surplus. You cannot
solve the West Lothian question just by ignoring it. One option to
solve it that I have suggested in the past is by setting up not a
separate English Parliament but an English Grand Committee within the
Westminster Parliament. It is not a perfect answer, I know, but it was
made to work for Scotland for 100 years before devolution and, with a
little imagination and possible adaptation, it could be made to work
for England. There is also the work of the McKay commission, which
offers a means of diminishing the democratically offensive aberrations
of the present position. It is almost a year since the
commission’s report appeared and I hope that my noble and
learned friend will indicate when the Government intend to respond to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:56:16"></hs_TimeCode>. On the
Barnett surplus, everyone knows that the basis of the present
distribution of funds is out of date. We know that that, too, created
an imbalance that can be put right. A fair-minded Scotland would agree.
We need an up-to-date measurement of relative need in Scotland and
elsewhere in the United Kingdom.</hs_para>

unionism—a unionism that unites us, binds us and brings us
together again and brings constitutional stability to the whole United
Kingdom. We need to demonstrate its virtues and its fairness, not
through ad hoc disbursements here or there but through a thorough and
open reappraisal of our nation’s central strengths and how
devolution fits into that. Above all, it is time to put the politics of
grievance behind us. Others have suggested that a Joint Committee of
both Houses should be set up after the referendum with broad terms of
reference. I support that as one option, but we need the commitment of
all the major political parties to work together in the national
interest. W<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T11:58:04"></hs_TimeCode>e can

disappointment that I felt as an 18 year-old in casting my first vote
and not succeeding in achieving devolution for Scotland at that time. I
have consistently believed all my adult life that a strong, devolved
Parliament within the United Kingdom for Scotland—a Parliament
that was autonomous in its decision-making, had real legislative powers
and provided a voice for Scotland—not only dealt with the
anomalies in our British system of government but provided the best way
forward for Scotland and the United Kingdom in government and in
action<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:00:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000126">In
September, Scotland will vote on a different proposition. Much as I
disagree with the timing and many of the rules under which the vote is
taking place, 
<?notus-xml column=1367?>I hope that it is decisive and binding for this generation, and that we
can move on. As I said yesterday at Questions, I really welcome
yesterday’s intervention from Mark Carney, the Governor of the
Bank of England. I hope that the way in which he laid out the facts and
the analysis that he wished to present will be repeated by others over
the coming months. We need to move from the divisive, rather negative
debate that has taken place in Scotland over recent months and years to
a really well informed, high-level debate over these six months that
allows people to make the right choice, and then to make a choice that
we can all believe in

could probably speak for seven hours about this topic, but today I have
seven minutes and I will stick to two points in particular. First, the
choice in September is not between an independent Scotland and an
unreformed, old United Kingdom. It is a choice between an independent
Scotland and a reformed United Kingdom, a United Kingdom that has not
just devolution in Wales and Northern Ireland and not just major
reforms to many of the cities of England, but a strong, devolved and
autonomous Parliament in Scotland. Despite the disagreements and
reservations that I have about the policy direction of the Parliament
over the past six years or so—the way in which certain decisions
have been made for reasons of political posturing, such as the
disgraceful decision to return Megrahi to Libya—I still
absolutely believe that devolution is not only right for Scotland but
has been good for Scotland, and that devolution throughout the UK has
been good for the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:02:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000128">As
I always expected, devolution has allowed Scotland at times to go its
own road in relation to policy and legislation. Where that has
happened, yes, there have been differences between Scotland and the
rest of the UK, but by and large those choices have resulted in
improvements for the people of Scotland, in health, education and,
particularly, the economy. When I took over as First Minister back in
2001, Scotland’s economic performance was lagging well behind
the rest of the United Kingdom, and our employment position was much
worse than the rest of the United Kingdom. Over a period of years, with
the right policies in place, we made a difference to turn that
situation
around<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:03:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000129">Secondly,
the Parliament has been an opportunity for national leadership. On
issues of sectarianism, for example, or on the important issue this
year for Scotland of the Commonwealth Games, we have seen the country
come together. The Parliament has provided a focus for people to come
together in the national interest to change circumstances or to provide
new
opportunities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000130">Thirdly—this
is particularly important—the Parliament in Scotland has
provided an opportunity to be more creative, to try out new ideas to
tackle long-term Scottish problems. I will give two examples. The first
is the population decline that we experienced decade after decade. With
the support of the Home Office and the Government back in the early
part of the past decade, we took a different approach to end migration.
With that and other measures, we have actually seen a reversal of that
long-term decline and, for many years now, year after year, an increase
in Scotland’s population. The second example is in relation to
the ban on 
<?notus-xml column=1368?>smoking in public places. I know that many noble Lords were involved in
that debate. The UK Government were all over the place on this issue
but in Scotland we took a decision to go ahead. We have been proven to
be right and that policy was then translated elsewhere in the UK.
Without a Parliament in Scotland that decision would not have worked.
Experiments in Scotland in the past, such as the poll tax, had not
worked. That experiment did. It worked because the Parliament had the
support of the people and an opportunity to show national
leadership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000131">I
think that it is very important that when we have this debate this
year, we do not only address the long-term issues identified by the
noble Lord, Lord Lang, today. There is also a need for the whole system
of government in the UK—this Parliament in London and the other
Parliaments and Assemblies of the UK—to debate what this new
United Kingdom looks like, not just in relation to powers that move
between different levels of government at different times, but in
relation to how government is conducted here in London. What is the
relationship between government at the centre and government in the
devolved Assemblies and Parliaments? We must have a debate this year
that ensures that people in Scotland are choosing between independence
on the one side and that reformed, devolved United Kingdom, on the
other, which provides real hope and the best of both worlds for
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:05:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_30_PT_1/432A150301E1140A6FBB587BD03E2C6EF426FFCC" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 January 2014">Thursday,

noble friend Lord Lang for introducing this important debate. I too

we have been discussing this matter, the debate has tended to focus on
whether Scotland would be better or worse off as an independent
country. I would argue that that is not the right question. If to
separate off from the United Kingdom and become independent is the
right thing to do, surely the cost of doing it is immaterial. The
question is whether it is the right thing to do. I would argue that it
certainly is not.</hs_para>

borrow it from their local library. It claims that <I>Scotland’s
Future</I>—the title of paper—“sets out the
facts” on independence. Of course it does nothing of the kind.
It sets out, as my noble friend said, a series of wish lists. There is
a big difference between a wish list and the actuality. We had an
example of this a few weeks ago when the First Minister of Scotland
indicated a wish to attend the funeral of Nelson Mandela. He even had
his officials call the office of Prince Charles to see if he could get
a lift on the plane. That was turned down, possibly on the grounds that
he had not been invited—I do not know.</hs_para>

co-ordinating research across the UK—that is, including
Scotland? Would it be possible—and, if so, how—to

the Act of Union was that a partnership was formed and we started to
work together, rather than against each other. And, hey ho, after about
20 years of misery—because the Scottish economy was
protectionist and we had to adjust to free trade—suddenly
prosperity bloomed. We had the Age of Enlightenment. Scottish

partnerships—between us and international organisations such as
NATO and the EU; between us and our allies, the US, Germany and France;

while our relationships across the board with the US may often be
misdescribed as “special”, we do have a unique defence

to intelligence material without which we would be much hampered in
containing the 21st century threats that we face. Although obviously
secret and perhaps arguably requiring greater parliamentary scrutiny,
it is essential to our security. It is improbable that an independent
Scotland, particularly one intent on unilateral nuclear disarmament,
would enjoy the same relationship. That also has implications, as the

so-called “Five Eyes” partners—Australia, Canada

must also recognise, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, the very
human dimension to this debate. Traditionally, Scotland has provided
disproportionate numbers of soldiers and operatives to our defence and

that no UK unit is without a Scottish presence—nor for that
matter an English, Welsh, Irish or Commonwealth comrade. Thousands of
Scots serve in our wider intelligence and security forces. Serving with
distinction, they form an unbroken line back through Iraq, Afghanistan,
countless peacekeeping missions and other crises, and two world wars,
and deep into our history. This shared heritage and tradition is
stronger than its individual components. The loss of them will not

forces of most European states of similar size to Scotland are
restricted by their scale to home defence and exercises and to limited
international involvement. Those few countries that are the exceptions
established their military capability over years when defence spending
was considerably higher, and that opportunity is gone for decades. Why
would serving Scottish men and women choose to leave that tradition and

Maclennan of Rogart (LD):</Member></B> I, too, thank my noble friend
Lord Lang for initiating this important debate. In following the noble
Lord, Lord Browne, it occurred to me that Scotland has played a very
significant role in the United Kingdom. He spoke entirely about
defence. I shall not confine myself to a single subject but I do recall
that, at the end of the First World War, Field Marshal Haig delivered
his war memoirs to the home of Richard Haldane with a note on the front
page saying, “To the man who made victory possible”.
Haldane was a Scot, educated in Germany and Scotland, who had
restructured the British Army when he was in Asquith’s
Government. That seems to me to be symptomatic of the role that has
been played by so many Scots in constructing the civic society which
has blossomed since the Act of Union. The list of Scottish names
mentioned by my noble friend Lord Forsyth was highly indicative of that
contribution. I think he mentioned Logie Baird, but there are others in
television, such as John Reith, the first director-general of the BBC.
We have had—and have—in this House Scottish Members who
have played a significant role in representing Britain. I think of the
noble Lord, Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, who was a Permanent
Under-Secretary at the Foreign Office and secretary-general of the
Convention on the Future of
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000170">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:34:47"></hs_TimeCode>
Scots have become integral to the United Kingdom and have helped to
make it Great Britain. However, it seems to me that we need to
recognise that the constitutional arrangements for the United Kingdom
are not ideal. It was certainly sensible to devolve power to the
Scottish Parliament, and I remember very well the discussions that I
held with Robin Cook on the way to take that forward. However, we now 
<?notus-xml column=1376?>need an overview of the structures of the United Kingdom. We need to
recognise that Wales, Northern Ireland and England must have more
responsive and less centralised government. An important decision that
should be taken, before the outcome of the referendum, is to establish
a convention on the future of the constitutional arrangements of the
United Kingdom. It has to be accepted that independence is an illusion.
No country in the global society in which we participate is totally
independent, and the more we contract our relations with external
powers, the more we shall find that we lose influence. Decentralisation
to levels at which decisions can be effectively taken should certainly
be part of the remit of this convention that I am
advocating.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000171">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:37:29"></hs_TimeCode>

carve it up into economic regions, because the history and identity of
the different parts of the country of England seem not to be reflected
in the rather artificial regions which were created some years ago.
None the less, I hope that that step will be taken before the

remember it very well. As a consequence, Labour lost the election
heavily<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:41:10"></hs_TimeCode>. I say
that by way of comment on the Scottish Government’s paper,

the economy, we are a still a long way from getting the issues properly
assessed by the public at large. There is the big issue of the loss of
access to the single market, which we went into in great detail. The
Barnett formula will no longer apply, which I welcome because I have
long thought that it is well out of date—it was meant to be
temporary anyway and should have gone a long time ago. However, it will
be compensated for as far as Scotland is concerned by the revenue from
North Sea oil—that was one of the analyses that we made. On the
other hand, the revenue from North Sea oil is highly volatile and is
not permanent, so it cannot be depended on in the same way as Scotland
originally depended on the Barnett formula. The costs of financial
regulation, regulators and many other separate institutions will have
to be taken into account. The sharing of the UK’s public debt,
including PFI, public sector pensions and many other liabilities is
crucial. I was struck by one figure that we came across which showed
that the total support extended to RBS during the financial and
economic crisis was the equivalent of 211% of Scotland’s GDP.
Scotland simply could not sustain that sort of support and one

would be no technical problems with being a member of the EU and now it

particular, as I understand it, one of the commitments required of new

much for the economic implications; I want to say a word about the
political implications. Ironically, for the Conservative Party in the
rest of the UK—if I have to put it that way—we benefit
from a vote for yes, because we have only one single Scottish MP in the
House of Commons. None the less, a vote for yes is an outcome that I
profoundly hope will not happen. Of the political implications I want
to mention just one. I have seen the Answer given to the
yesterday’s Oral Question relating to the position of Scottish
MPs in Westminster if there is a yes vote and whether they would still
be eligible to sit in this Parliament after date of Scottish
independence in 2016. Obviously, that could happen, because the general
election will be in 2015, the Scottish vote will precede that and then,
in 2016, if it is a yes vote, there will be an independent Scotland. It
is no good to say, “Just wait and see what happens”. The
Advocate-General for Scotland replied yesterday that it would be a
matter for negotiation. I do not think that it is; it is absolutely
clear that we cannot have Scottish MPs with no constituencies, no
constituency interests and no wider interests in the Westminster
Parliament if Scotland votes yes and becomes independent. That should
be established and worked out now and not left to a
negotiation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T12:46:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000182">Finally,
on the wider issues, I am a Scot, born, brought up and educated in
Scotland; I have many Scottish ties still. I have of course been an MP

two reasons why I was selected for adoption there were, first, that I
had a lovely wife and, secondly, that there were many Scots in Norfolk,
many of farming backgrounds. Due to this, I profoundly
believe that, although I do not have a vote, all parts of the United
Kingdom will continue to gain as a result of being part of the wider
kingdom. One key implication of Scotland leaving the UK is that all
parts of the United Kingdom, not just Scotland, would be the poorer,

a few words about our legal systems and what the Treaty of Union, to
which the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, referred, had to say about them. In
1606, King James I and VI said of the English system, perhaps rather to
the surprise of the Scots, of which he was one, that it was the best
law in all the world. His vision was for the English law system to be
the system throughout Great Britain. One hundred years later, that was
not how the commissioners saw matters when the Treaty of Union was
formulated. What was provided there, with great care, was that Scotland
would be able to keep its own legal system, which by then had
developed, in all time coming. In Article XIX, it was provided that no
causes in Scotland were to be heard in any of the English courts
sitting in Westminster Hall. At first sight, the idea was that the two
systems would be kept entirely separate, standing on their own two
feet. The two would never meet: one country, two
systems.</hs_para>

that is not how the union worked in practice, and it is typical of what
happened in so many aspects of the way in which the union has worked.
It did not take very long for canny Scots lawyers to spot that the
House of Lords did not sit in Westminster Hall, and that led them to
bringing appeals before this House. In 1709, the House held that it had
jurisdiction to hear appeals from Scotland. That gave rise to an
increasingly close association between the English and Scottish legal
systems which has lasted for more than 300 years—woven into the
fabric, as the noble Lord, Lord Lang, put it. That is reflected today
by the fact that the United Kingdom Supreme Court hears appeals from
all parts of the United Kingdom, as this House did in this very Chamber
for so many years before the Supreme Court was created, and by the fact
that the court now has justices from Scotland and Northern Ireland
among its
membership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000186">There
is a very important question as to what is to happen in
Scotland if the referendum were to result in a vote for separation.
Typically, the White Paper does not say a word about that, but I am not
going to say a word about it either, because our concentration today is
on the United Kingdom, not what is to happen in Scotland alone. For
that purpose, I want to say just a little more about how that has

a little time before the Scots judges began to sit in this
House—the first was in 1867, as it happened—but a few
years later, the Appellate Jurisdiction Act was passed, which provided
for permanent Lords of Appeal in Ordinary and, more or less, since then
there have always been two Scots Law Lords, and now two Scots Justices
of the Supreme Court. The total has reached 21 over that period, but
merely to mention the figure is only part of the story. It has always
been understood that the Scots Law Lords could sit on appeals from
other parts of the United Kingdom—as, indeed, those from England

could perhaps be said that the Scots have pulled somewhat above their
weight in contributing to the development of law elsewhere in United

Law Lord in this House for 26 years, from

point. It is not only his long service that marks him out as one of the
outstanding lawyers of his generation: the quality of his judgments,
the perception of the issues that they raised and their clarity were
all outstanding, and are cited every day in the courts up and down this
country. There is no time to go over the contribution that others have
made. My part is perhaps enshrined in the fact that I am shown in a
portrait in Committee Room 1 delivering the House of Lords’ last
judgment in an English appeal. Earlier this month, I was referred to in
a case which came from Northern Ireland and, just yesterday evening, a
decision by Lord Reid in an English case was referred to in the Supreme
Court. The fact is that our contributions have been built into the

brings me to the consequences for the United Kingdom if that tradition
is broken. The process of cross-fertilisation of ideas across the
border will cease. The tendency to prefer principle to precedent, which
is one of the characteristics of the Scottish approach, is also at risk
of being lost. So, too, will be the breadth of experience which has
always marked Scots judges out in comparison with the specialists from
England. Of course, the loss of the two Scots justices, if and when
this has to happen, can be made good, but the breadth of vision which
comes from having what is at present a court for the entire United
Kingdom and draws its ideas from a broad canvas, cannot.</hs_para>

it was not anticipated at the outset of the union that these two legal
systems should grow together as they have, but that is what has
happened, as it has been appreciated on both sides of the border that
their systems draw strength from working together with each other while
respecting their differences, rather than working separately. Both
sides have a lot to lose if that relationship is
broken—jettisoned, as the noble Lord, Lord Steel, said
earlier—as it is bound to be if the right of appeal is to be

Johnson has referred to a cat’s cradle of legal and political

of that will have to be unscrambled. I am sure that the issue of
citizenship will throw up many problems. Let us take one. At present,
British citizens living outside the UK cannot pass on citizenship for
more than one generation, so children of UK citizens living in
Scotland, if there is an independent Scotland, will be UK citizens, but
not the children of their children. For many people, that could pose
family problems. Let us take another question: civil servants. In many
countries, the state reserves certain posts in the Civil Service to its
own nationals. Will that apply in Scotland, with no UK citizens being
able to work in the Scottish Civil Service; indeed, will it apply in

there is the issue which the Governor of the Bank of England touched on

exchange for assuming part of the debt of the United Kingdom, 
<?notus-xml column=1382?>he can have part ownership of the Bank of England. If Scotland is going
to have its own fiscal system able to decide the balance between
spending, borrowing and taxation within its own boundaries and
determines its own deficit, that will have an effect on the rest of the
UK—on the Bank of England, on monetary policy. If Scotland runs
an excessive deficit—let us say, 10% of its GDP—that will
have an effect on interest rates for the rest of the United Kingdom. So
there would have to be some agreed fiscal limit on borrowing by an
independent Scotland. There would have to be some
arrangement—like that, dare I say it, between Germany and Greece
and the peripheral countries of the eurozone. I am not saying that

words sovereign, the King, sovereign, the coinage and sovereignty, the

wants to have a Prudential Regulation Authority that would apply

ask why the Bank of England should stand behind Scottish banks. It was
expensive enough bailing out RBS when it was a British bank. Are we

issue of UK debt. The Treasury was forced to say that it would
guarantee all existing debt, right up to the point of Scottish
independence. Mr Salmond saw that as an own goal. It may have helped
him a little in the argument, but the Treasury was forced to make that
announcement because of the markets. The markets were nervous about an
independent Scotland. There can be no doubt that an independent
Scotland would have to pay a higher rate for borrowing simply because
it has no track record and there would be uncertainty about what sort

where I come from. Shetland was not part of Scotland at the time of the
Battle of Bannockburn. Shetland could claim part of the oil; Shetland
could go independent. I am not saying it will, but how would Scottish
nationalists regard that? They would regard it as destructive and
selfish. Are we Scots really so different from the English? Well, of
course we are—but not so different and not so much better that
we need to have a Government of our own. We have been together for so

Lang, has already been under attack for having the audacity to mention
the First World 
<?notus-xml column=1383?>War. He has been under attack from a Mr Keith Brown, a member of the
Scottish National Party and a Member of the Scottish Parliament.
Frankly, that kind of attitude shames me as a Scot. Like many members
of your Lordships’ House, I lost someone in the First World War.
I lost my great uncle. I come from a tradition that has always gone out
to help others. That is what the Scots are famous for. It is a sign of
the contempt with which those of us who believe in the United Kingdom

of the themes of the noble Lord, Lord Lamont. Like him, I thought the
remarks of the Governor of the Bank of England yesterday were
excellent. It is quite amusing—this came on the day after Mr
Alex Salmond made a remark that England and Scotland will be great
pals. The first thing that frightened me about that was the echo of the
negotiations in the run-up to setting the level of the euro. I was
there. A lot of male bonding went on. The night before the big debate,
there was a football match on television. All the Finance Ministers
disappeared off to watch the football match, so the sort of thing I was
hearing was, “So-and-so was a good chap so he’ll stick to
his word on the euro”, and “That guy over there, he was a
very nice chap, very convivial in the bar—he will stick to his
word on the euro”. I am sorry but that is not good enough. If
you are going to enter into a currency union, we now know it is not
enough to trust the word of others. You need a firm agreement. We were
helped at that time by the five economic tests with which Britain
judged whether we should enter the euro. We have to have a similar set
of tests, set by the Treasury and the Bank, on what will be
right for the rest of the United Kingdom. Do not let us
forget—if Scotland votes yes, Scotland becomes a foreign
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:04:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that if you are a best pal or you have a best pal, best pals know that
family comes first. The family of the rest of the United Kingdom will
be the moral and legal obligation of the Government of the rest of the
United Kingdom. We are bandying about that phrase—United
Kingdom. It will be pointless if there is a yes vote, because one part
of the kingdom will have gone. We will have to find other terminology
for the rest of the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:04:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

be absolutely essential in a currency union. You have to be absolutely
confident that those in charge of that Government are fiscally correct.
The noble Lord, Lord Steel, referred to the First Minister’s
visit regarding the Ryder Cup. I applaud the activities to get the
Ryder Cup. As noble Lords know, I have a great interest in tourism. It
is a major Scottish industry and one of Britain’s major
industries. Working together we have made it a major export earner. How
on earth anyone other than Paris Hilton could have spent either
£51,000 or £54,000 on accommodation for one person at the
Ryder Cup, I fail to understand. What angers me also—as a Scot,
because we always look after the bawbees—is Mr
Salmond’s response that he was not interested in the fripperies;
that our concern about whether it is £51,000 or £54,000
is “frippery”. That is twice the average wage. That is
the kind of sweeping gesture—dismissing coherent
argument—that has so debased the nature of this
debate.</hs_para>

rectitude will also mean keeping within public spending constraints,
and because of those constraints and the commitment to a 3p reduction
in corporation tax, revenues for expenditure elsewhere will necessarily
be reduced. One area that significantly worries me, and my noble friend
Lord Browne referred to it in relation to defence and the security of
this country, is that our counterterrorism activity in Scotland will of
necessity be reduced. We will not have access to the same degree of
intelligence as at the moment, and we will have porous borders unless a
huge chunk of public expenditure from the new Scottish Government is
going to go to making our borders secure. That is a huge task. The
borderland between Scotland and England is not Waziristan. You can
cross it on a Sunday afternoon walk. It will be extremely difficult to
secure those borders. There is an implication for the security of the
rest of the United Kingdom if you have loose borders and a big land
mass. We are a third of the land mass of the United Kingdom. It really

conscious of the fact that the financial services sector is a crucial

a significant part of the economy. They are all mobile—they can

Scottish history was an important part of our studies, but there was
also a wider arena of which I was aware and could not be unaware. I
grew up in the very recent aftermath of the Second World War. My father
was a Glasgow Highlander in the First World War. I knew from an early
age that there was a United Kingdom, that Scotland was a part of it,
that these were natural concomitants and that there was nothing
incompatible with that partnership and also being proudly Scottish.
That perception was reinforced when I went to an excellent secondary
school, Greenock Academy. There I was to learn in detail about the
history of the United Kingdom: how the Act of Union came
about—and, importantly, as my noble friend Lord Forsyth said,
why it came about—and what had been possible down the ages
within that unique partnership. Going to school in Greenock was also to
see at first hand the significance of the Firth of Clyde as a port and
maritime route, an eye to the rest of the world.</hs_para>

Greenock was also to understand the strategic importance of that area
for the Royal Navy in time of war. Of course, in modern times the
nuclear submarine base at Faslane on the Clyde has been a British
defence facility of major strategic significance. After school, I was
to study law and practise as a solicitor in Glasgow for many years
before entering the Scottish Parliament in 1999, where I currently
serve as an MSP. This autobiographical meander is merely to illustrate
that from childhood through my formative years to adulthood,
Scottishness and Britishness have been in my very fibre as innate and
inalienable conditions.</hs_para>

through being a permanent member of the United Nations Security

non-Scot, and the first non-Scot to speak in this debate, it is hard to
know how to declare one’s interests in a debate of this kind. In
my case, they come in three varieties. First, I had one Scottish
grandmother and, since last year, have close family living in Scotland,
in the Northern Isles. Secondly, to adapt the opening line of General
de Gaulle’s memoirs, I have always had “a certain
idea” of Scotland. More than that, I have had a love of Scotland
since my first visit, aged 10, in 1957 when we went from London by car
to the Isle of Skye via Edinburgh and Inverness on the way up and the
Clyde and Kilmarnock, where the family lived, on the way back. The
third interest is difficult to declare because, as many of your
Lordships will understand, male Brits of my age were brought up not to
speak of emotions in public—quite the reverse. However, I cannot
conceive of my country, the United Kingdom, without Scotland as part of
it. My fear is that without the Scottish connection England will become
a shrivelled nation, psychologically as well as geographically, and
more inward looking after the equivalent of a family
break-up.</hs_para>

benefits that, over the past three centuries, have poured over the
border from the family in the north to the family in the south,
enhancing the lives of both family branches. We all have our own
list—we have had several today—but here is mine in
headline form. There are the continuing fruits of the Scottish
Enlightenment, which we feel every day in the prowess of
Scotland’s universities. I should declare an interest in that
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, gave me an honorary doctorate at
the University of Strathclyde a few years ago, which I wear with pride.
There is Scotland’s industry and flair for invention; 
<?notus-xml column=1387?>its gifts for public, judicial and military service; its writers and
actors; and the variety, spice and bite that Scotland has brought to
our Parliament and our political philosophies. That is quite enough
emotion from me— probably too much—save to say that if
Scotland separates, whatever the position in international law, I shall
always regard it in my mind as part of my country until the day I
depart for what will still, I hope, be a UK enclave in the

I may concentrate today on one aspect of what I regard as the
regrettable decision taken by the Cabinet at the turn of 2012-13 that
Whitehall shall not engage in any contingency planning for Scottish
separation. The future of the Royal Navy’s Clyde submarine base
in such an eventuality is of particular concern to me, as I am a firm
believer in the need for the United Kingdom—or heaven forbid,
the “remainder of the UK”, as Whitehall calls
it—to sustain a nuclear weapons capacity through to the
mid-21st-century as the ultimate protection against a highly unlikely
but potentially utterly catastrophic contingency we might face in an
unpredictable world. Sir Kevin Tebbit, a former Permanent Secretary at
the Ministry of Defence, has accurately depicted the UK as the
world’s most reluctant nuclear power. It is to our credit,
however, that we go through a great and often anguished debate each
time we face an equipment or an upgrade decision. But were we ever to
give up our nuclear weapons, it should be after we have had the fullest
and best informed national conversation possible, not on a side wind
swirling out of the Scottish question.</hs_para>

recreate them in England or Wales in both logistical and financial
terms. My research colleague, Dr James Jinks, has furnished me with the
original February 1963 study, now declassified in the National Archives
at Kew, of possible bases for the Polaris force. This was the list:
Devonport, Falmouth, Milford Haven, Loch Ryan, Gare Loch, Loch Alsh,
Fort William, Invergordon, Rosyth and Portland. The Gare Loch was
chosen for good reasons: it has deep water in which to dive quickly
down the Firth of Clyde off Arran, and three possible exits en route to
the patrol area—through the North Channel straight into the
Atlantic, up the north-west coast of Scotland and out through the
Minches, or south down the Irish Sea and through the Western
Approaches.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000226">Should
an independent Scotland strive to remove the SSBN and SSN forces from
the Clyde, which the SNP is pledged to do, there are now only two
possible sites for relocation: Falmouth and Milford Haven. Can you
imagine the planning process and the construction efforts required, let
alone the cost? We may be able to take a stab at imagining these
things, but the Ministry of Defence cannot under Cabinet orders. The
solution, in my judgment, would be a sovereign base arrangement for
Faslane and Coulport on the Cyprus model, but that idea is, I fear,
regarded with horror in both Downing Street and the First
Minister’s residence. I profoundly hope that the question does
not arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000227">I
shall finish with a thought about the union post a referendum decision
in Scotland not to separate. Although the union will be intact for now,
there will remain the 
<?notus-xml column=1388?>danger of a creeping estrangement between Scotland and England,
especially if the SNP forms the next post-referendum Government. There
could well be a continuing, perpetual drizzle of complaint about
Westminster and Whitehall which would induce still more resentment
south of the border and poison any conversations about further
devolution. If the post-referendum relationship is one of surliness and
sourness, we shall all be the poorer. I was very struck by the words of
the noble Lord, Lord Lang, about learning to do things once more as a
union. Post-September, if we are still together, it will be necessary
to sing a song of the benefits of union. The union quite simply is a
300 year-old international success story. It has done great things for
our people and for the world in peace and war. It can still do more,

area and the one in Scotland on which the issue is likely finally to be

it really does not have to follow that a Scottish nationalist is one
who is looking for separation and independence. Surely the first
feature of a nationalist is that they treasure the assets their country
derives from the past and look to the best outcomes for the future. If
the rationale proposed is only looking for a major break with what has
gone before, then that is the role of an insurgent or a revolutionary
rather than a nationalist. Perhaps those who adopt that label should
consider which category they wish to belong to. In Scotland, there is a
lot of rhetoric about the first concept, but much of the effort is to
achieve the

Secretary, who said how much Scottish agriculture benefits from
participation in the common agricultural policy as part of the United
Kingdom. What nobody seems to have told him was that at that moment the
Scottish farming industry was seething. The fact was that EU moneys had
been received under a scheme whose aim is to bring about what is termed
“convergence”, because Scotland is lagging well behind
the EU target for support compared to the aim of the policy. The UK
Government then decided that they would apply their own idea of
convergence and use the money as a way of offsetting the reductions
that other parts of the United Kingdom would have experienced from the
cuts that they had proposed in the

today at the wider effects of Scottish independence, there are many
ways, as my noble friend Lord Lang of Monkton described, that the UK
will be diminished. The issue that stands out for me is that if
independence takes place, the remainder of the UK will become almost
entirely dependent on external countries for its oil and gas. My noble
friends Lord Lang and Lord Steel mentioned that Scotland will lose out
on the EU rebate, but another element which will arise from a
diminished UK and Scottish independence and which the rest of the UK
might like to consider is that in terms of land area, Scotland, at
78,000 square kilometres, represents nearly one-third of the British
Isles, but at the same time, at 89,000 square kilometres, it will take
over responsibility for 59% of British territorial waters. When it
comes to the UK economic zone and fishing, it will take over about
three-quarters. This will have considerable implications for the Scots
in terms of regulation and defence, but it is also a very considerable
reduction in what the present UK

Scotland is not an oppressed colony. Scots are not discriminated

success story. Those who live in Scotland will have a vote in the

those who were born in Scotland and who live and work elsewhere have
every right to be indignant at their treatment. They may be deprived of
a vote, but I hope that many of them will add their voices to the
campaign in favour of the union and will try to influence their friends

Scottish relations, must make it equally clear how much we would
deplore what would be a tragic family divorce. Like others, I think

the Bank of England, under a formal currency union agreement. The

fiscal and political union if you are to avoid sovereign debt crises,
financial fragmentation and large divergences in economic performance.
It is

will address a slightly different proposition. Supposing that one got
the wrong answer and the Scots decide to go for secession, what would
be the responsibility of the United Kingdom? The angle I will touch
on—I am sorry, but it will not enhance my reputation in the
House—is the task of ensuring that the Scots get into the
European Union. That is a very difficult task, which would be the
responsibility of all of us, including the United Kingdom

that was suggested by the First Minister in his White Paper and all his

Article 49 again; the verdict is clear, so I do not have to. The
President of the European Council, the President of the Commission and
all heads of government and Foreign Ministers who have addressed this
question so far are clear that the route in would be via an application
for membership once the country became
independent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:41:07"></hs_TimeCode>.
That poses a problem, for three reasons. First, the European Commission
cannot negotiate with the applicant until an application is received,
and only a sovereign state can be an applicant. Secondly, all member
states have to agree the terms which have been negotiated. Thirdly, all
member states have to get them ratified in their countries. If you
cannot sign the treaty because you are not yet a sovereign state, you
cannot pre-negotiate the terms of that treaty, at least
formally<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:41:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000252">What
is the way around that? One needs to find a way around it because, as
the noble Lord, Lord Lang, said, we all have an interest in a
prosperous Scotland, and we all have a moral responsibility toward the
Scottish farmers, fishermen and exporters, the enterprises and the
individuals whose legitimate expectations would be dashed and whose
rights would go if there was a hiatus between Scotland’s
secession from this union and its accession to the European Union. On
the face of it, there is quite a high probability that that might
arise. My solution is that it would be the United Kingdom
Government’s job to attempt to negotiate informally the terms of
Scotland’s entry into the European Union and the transitional
arrangements for the period before all three stages of that process
were complete and the treaty was
ratified<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:42:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000253">Three
conditions would have to be met. First, a great many of the Scottish
Government’s negotiating positions would have to be abandoned
straightaway. One could not negotiate the impossible. An example is the
question of the rebate. It is impossible as an applicant to secure the
agreement of all member states, many of whom are much poorer
than you, that you should not have to pay the full subscription.
Therefore, an applicant Scotland would not secure a rebate. The UK
rebate would go down, because UK GNP and the VAT base would go down; UK
receipts would go down; and the rebate, which rebates two-thirds of the
difference between the two, would also go down. Therefore, there would
be a reduction in the rebate here. It is absurd for Mr Salmond to tell
us that in addition to having a reduction in the UK, Thatcher rebate,
we must write a cheque and send some money to Edinburgh so that it gets
a rebate too. That does not work; we could not possibly pay twice, so
that position would have to go. There is no point in an applicant
country going to Brussels and saying, “I would need a
rebate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000254">The
second condition is that the divorce terms would have to be absolutely
clear. I am sure that the Council would be unwilling to allow the
Commission to negotiate with a country that has not yet defined what
its independence is. What independence means in terms of frontiers and
currency would have to be clear. The Scottish and United Kingdom
Governments would 
<?notus-xml column=1394?>have to agree a precise scenario before any negotiations could start.
Even then, the lawyers might object to the start of the negotiation,
saying, “They aren’t sovereign”, so the
negotiations would have to be conducted by a UK team flying the union
jack. You cannot stop members of the Council negotiating with the
Commission. They would have to operate on agreed instructions from the
London Government and the Edinburgh
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:45:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Even
so, they might have a very hard task, because some member states could
wish, if the occasion arises, to make the Scottish path to membership
of the European Union as difficult as possible in order to dissuade
secession movements in their own countries. That is the best I can come
up with, and it is not certain that the road I am describing would be
open. However, it would be the UK’s responsibility to
try<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:45:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000255">Edinburgh
needs to become much more realistic, and we could not wash our hands of
the problem. If the Scots say that they want to be independent, we have
an interest and a responsibility to try to get them into the European
Union as quickly as can be arranged. It will be extremely difficult. We
all now have a responsibility to make clear to the Scots, before they
vote, that there is a real risk of a hiatus—of falling into a

Neville-Jones (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I add my thanks to those of
other noble Lords to my noble friend Lord Lang for securing and leading
this debate and for the wisdom of what he said. The noble Baroness,
Lady Goldie, is no longer in her place, but it is a great pleasure to
have her in this House. I agree that we have a great new weapon
here—her call to arms was certainly very forceful and also quite
right<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:47:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000257">Much
of the comment on the implications of the referendum in Scotland has
focused on the economic aspects, but in the course of the debate so far
we have also begun to see a wider picture. In a moment I will focus on
the security side, which has already been mentioned by some other noble
Lords. First, however, following what the noble Lord, Lord Kerr, said,
I should just like to say that it is a very unattractive prospect to be
caught like a pig in the middle between the Scottish Government and the
Council when trying to do something. I see the point that he
made—that it would be extraordinarily difficult. It is not clear
to me whether the other members of the Council would play ball. That is
only one of the many great difficulties that this potential scenario
throws
up<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:48:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000258">Before
I go on to talk a bit about the issues that conventionally come under
the heading of security—and the list starts with
terrorism—I should like to comment on the question of an
independent Scotland’s potential membership of NATO. This throws
up equally great difficulties when we come to the propositions that
might confront us as regards the economic European Union. Why? Frankly,
it is pretty extraordinary that a Government who dispute the central
tenets of the defence policies of the alliance and seek to remove from
their soil the facilities which are so important to nuclear deterrence
should simultaneously imagine that they would be wanted or valued
inside the alliance which their actions were weakening. It is very
difficult 
<?notus-xml column=1395?>to see how the alliance would countenance that. It does not work that
way. That is another area where the Scottish people are being sold a
false bill, and it is very important that they hear other
voices<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000259">I
turn to issues that the noble Lord, Lord Browne of Ladyton,
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:49:43"></hs_TimeCode>—and
I agree entirely with what he said. I want to focus on the threats that
this country has been tackling in a major way, from before 2010 but,
most particularly, since the national security strategy of 2010. We
identified terrorism, cyberattack and organised crime as major threats
to the stability of the security and stability of this country.
Terrorism and cyberattack were classed as tier 1 risks and organised
crime as a tier 2 risk. Despite our great efforts and the investment
that has been made since then in combating organised crime, it has
enormously grown, and I would not be at all surprised to see in a
further security strategy that it came out as a tier 1 risk. My point
is, in relation certainly to the other two risks, that those risks are
not going away; they are remaining. Daily extensive, intensive and
expensive efforts manage to keep them under
control<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:50:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

efforts? The annual bill in this country for maintaining capabilities
and for the operations of the agencies, and for the cyber intelligence
alone, runs at over £2 billion per annum. That does not take
into account the contributions also made by the police or other
government agencies and the military to our overall strategy. As a
result of that overall strategy, we have a well honed machine, which
goes under the label of Contest, on which our counterterrorist effort
is based and which is being used as a model to combat organised crime.
It is because of Contest that we have seen so few outrages since the
London bombing, but we should not imagine that it is because they are
not being attempted—they are, and there are plenty of them, and
the operations of the police and agencies frustrate
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:51:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000261" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000261">The

umbrella that runs from the centre, but this would change, and it would
change radically, in the event of Scottish independence. The authority
of the agencies, the legal framework under which they operate and their
ability to provide security would stop at the border. The noble
Baroness, Lady
Liddell<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:52:33"></hs_TimeCode>, was
quite right to say this. The Scottish Government have
recognised this, and they know that they would have to set
up what has been described as a security and intelligence agency, which
would engage in what they have described as intelligence sharing. That
is all very well, but the putative budget for defence as well as for
security in an independent Scotland is only £2 billion per
annum; that includes defence as well as other agencies. For a share of
this sum it seems highly improbable that, with set-up costs and
operations, an intelligence service could be created that was adequate
to act as an effective and trusted partner to UK and other allied
intelligence services. To share intelligence, agencies have to be
capable of generating their own. I have no doubt that the UK, in its
own security interests, would want to do what it could to increase the
security of its geographical neighbour and long-time partner, but we
have to recognise that the control principle governing intelligence
derived from third parties would undoubtedly quite severely limit what
it could share. 
<?notus-xml column=1396?>Scotland would lose the benefit of what the UK has at the moment in its
membership of the “Five Eyes”

would have important implications for UK security. The UK could not
allow a less secure Scotland, if that turned out to be the case, to be
used as a back door to penetrate the UK, and we may be sure that that
would be tried. Unavoidably, we would have to fall back on securing the
English-Scottish border to become a control point, with all the cost
and inconvenience that would be involved. That would be true
irrespective of whether Scotland were a member of Schengen or managed
to persuade all parties involved to be allowed to continue to be in the
common travel area of the British
Isles<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:54:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:53:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000263">I
have one last point. The border between Northern Ireland and the
Republic of Ireland is often pointed to as an example of the way in
which it is possible to keep an open border in the face of a terrorist
threat, but this is not an apt analogy. The control border is across
the Irish Sea, and it most certainly is monitored and can be closed in
emergencies. I would hate to think, but it cannot be excluded, that
this could happen within Great Britain. The more we diverge in policy
and practice, the greater the danger. We would surely be better off by
maintaining the open and peaceful border that we have had for 300
years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:55:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14013072000679" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000679">1.55

Brennan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Motion so well introduced by
the noble Lord, Lord
Lang<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>, wisely
invites the House to note the implications of the forthcoming Scottish
referendum. Secession by Scotland from the rest of the United Kingdom
is of the greatest constitutional importance to the whole nation. What
are those implications constitutionally? First, for the
Parliament—or should I say Parliaments of the United
Kingdom—if there is a yes vote, it is only the first step, or
the beginning of the end. There is much to be done, and to be done by
this Parliament. The agendas of defence, economics, banking, transport
and education that we have gone through today, illustrate the scope of
the Act of Parliament and consequential debates that we would have to
undergo before we voted to implement actual independence. The Scottish
certainly would require the same process, and I have not looked at the
technicalities but the Welsh and Northern Irish might also be involved
in their Assembly
duties<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:57:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:55:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000265">What
is the reality of that? In September 2014, if there is a yes vote,
there will be about six months of parliamentary time before the run-up
to the 2015 general election for our country. Nothing will be achieved
in those six months except, perhaps, a lot of political noise from
north of the border if there has been a yes vote. The United Kingdom
Parliament, elected in 2015, will have on the present count 59 MPs from
Scotland. Let us forget for a moment the party-political demographics
of that 59—it is a substantial part of the manpower of the House
of Commons. There will come a time after a yes vote, if Parliament
decides on an Act of independence to agree to secession, in which those
59 MPs will cease to act. On when and how, I am afraid that I am, as a
lawyer, not convinced that this would be a matter for negotiation. I do
not see how 
<?notus-xml column=1397?>constitutionally a Member of Parliament can continue to sit in the
Commons and act for a constituency that no longer exists as part of
this country. In that event, within that Parliament, the structure of
politics will suffer a major change. So the implication for our
Parliament is much greater than the interests just of
Scotland—it is the interests of the whole
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000266">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:59:17"></hs_TimeCode>
there is a yes vote, this Parliament will face a state of affairs in
which huge amounts of parliamentary time will be needed to make a
decision that the whole country will be looking at, particularly the
citizens of England. If there is a no vote, the devolution argument
will
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:59:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:59:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:59:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:57:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
If, as one suspects, the Scottish National Party wants a 47% yes vote
and a 53% no vote, it will then tell the rest of the country,
“We are on the way to more devolution. Let’s continue the
fight. It will not go
away<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T13:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000267">I
turn now to the nature of the debate. It will require at the very least
long parliamentary debates but also, perhaps, a Joint Committee or a
parliamentary commission such as the banking standards commission that
we have just had or, as the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, said, a
constitutional convention, probably irrespective of whether there is a
yes vote or a no vote. These are major issues which will take up
parliamentary time, and the debate has to involve the whole
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T14:00:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000268">As
for the international implications, the international community at the
beginning of the 21st century does not do independence-lite. The 70
years since the Second World War have produced a range of international
institutions with extremely careful entry and membership requirements
which will not be softened or changed for individual circumstances.
Apart from the case of colonialism and freedom for various countries
which survived that, and other than the fall of communism, I can find
only two instances in the past 70 years in which the United Nations has
accepted new members—namely East Timor after a civil war
involving Indonesia, and South Sudan after a civil war with what is
now Sudan. Somaliland has been a non-accepted
“independent” country since 1991. It is simply wholly
unreal to expect Scotland to enter any of the 10 or 15
international institutions which we can immediately think of that it

Scotland coming into Europe because of their own interests, and neither
will the United Nations. We therefore face an independent
Scotland being in international limbo for years to come. To whom will
the world look to safeguard international interests in which Scotland
should play a part but cannot? It will look to the United Kingdom and

MacGregor of Pulham Market and Lord Forsyth of Drumlean, I was a member
of the Economic Affairs Committee, which reported last year on the
economic impact on the UK of Scottish independence. When we debated the
report in this House in June, we said that it was important that voters
understood the implications of their vote before they cast it. We said
that voters should reasonably expect to know whether membership of the
EU would be secure, how long the process of applying might take, what
the implications for taxation—both personal and
corporate—would be, what the implications for public spending
might be, which currency would be used, which fiscal policies would be
put in place and what regulatory policies might be different in
Scotland from the rest of the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0001.htm#14013072000273">Some of
these issues, particularly around banking and fiscal union, have been
clearly explained this week by the Governor of the Bank of England.

students from England, Wales and Northern

key issue is the Barnett formula because, if Scotland became
independent, the extra 15% of public spending per head would cease. Oil
revenues might make up the difference, but such oil tax revenues would
inevitably be uncertain because they would fluctuate according to the
market price. It is true that, on the basis that 90% of oil reserves
would be in Scottish waters, the tax gain from that could make up for
the loss of the Barnett formula, but it seems very clear that there
would not be any more money available overall for public spending if

further key issue is UK debt, which now stands at £1.38 trillion

rates but Scotland on its own could well have to borrow at two

I acknowledge that this is a decision for the people of Scotland to
take. However, I make a plea to the media based in England. England
needs to understand better what Scotland is thinking, on both sides of
the independence debate. Too often what I read and hear in English
newspapers is an English commentary by an English commentator. UK
newspapers, for example, may have Scottish editions with specific pages
on Scottish news, but those newspapers do not get sold in England. Over
the next few months it would be helpful if newspapers printed in
England carried much more Scottish news and articles on the
independence debate so that we develop a better understanding of what
people are thinking. I should acknowledge at this point that the BBC
has started to do this and I welcome
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000280">A

anticipate that. Either way, we shall have the opportunity to undertake
a new constitutional settlement across the UK, spear-headed by the

Empey (UUP):</Member></B> My Lords, I join others in congratulating the
noble Lord, Lord Lang, on securing the debate. His comments and vision
at the end of his speech on what a new unionism might look like is the
missing ingredient in the current debate, in my opinion. The debate is
about whether Scotland leaves the UK, whether it would be better off on
its own—that sort of argument. Instead of making the debate
about leaving the union as it is, we need to look at how the union
could evolve and improve—how we could make things better. If the
noble Lord is looking for a response, I can tell him that my party in
Northern Ireland—the Ulster Unionist Party—is attracted
to the ideas that he espouses and would love to participate in a debate
on how we can help the United Kingdom to evolve.</hs_para>

I am a supporter of devolution, I am concerned at the way in which
devolution is being treated in Whitehall. The issues of the regions are
being pushed to one side. That is the mistake that was made on Northern
Ireland from the 1920s; it was pushed to a desk at the back of the Home
Office and ignored. We are all part of a union, and we should all have
a say. The idea of pushing devolution to get the issues off the
Whitehall desk is a fundamental error. Large amounts of money are being
pumped into the regions, and the regional parliaments should not simply
be ATMs that can distribute largesse locally, without any
acknowledgement of where it comes from. In what is happening in
Scotland, we see before us the downstream consequences of that
fundamental
mistake<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T14:13:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000285" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000285">Of
course it is perfectly possible for Scotland to be independent. The
people of Scotland have the skills and ability to survive on their own.
However, they will do so at a different level of economic and political

noble Lord, Lord Brennan, a few moments ago was very sobering indeed.
Of course, Scotland is not a single unit on this issue. The approach is
totally different in the islands—Orkney, for instance. They are
saying, “It’s not your oil, Mr Salmond, it’s our
oil. It’s got to come through our front door before it gets to
you. We don’t need you, Mr Salmond; we can be on our
own”. What does that mean? I have never seen such a significant
constitutional issue come before us so ill thought-through. Not a

the heart of the negotiations after a yes vote in the referendum would
be the future of the United Kingdom’s Trident nuclear deterrent,

to banish those submarines from Scotland’s shores while at the

Organisation, which is a nuclear-based alliance. In contrast, the
Defence Committee reported that Scottish independence on those terms
poses a serious threat to the future operational viability of the
UK’s nuclear deterrent. The UK Government have made it clear
that the horrendous cost of repositioning the nuclear armed submarines
would impact financially on the whole of the United Kingdom. Giving
evidence to the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee, Professor
William Walker of St Andrews University said that the
creation of a new deep-water facility outside Scotland could take at
least 20 years. In what I sincerely hope will be the unlikely event of
a yes vote, there is clearly substantial scope for this subject rapidly

relate to Scotland’s place in the world. One of the first
television programmes I made was a series called “Scots
Abroad”, because I was mesmerised by the achievement of the
Scots in building the British Empire. Scotland benefited
disproportionately more than the rest of the UK from the industrial
wealth of the British Empire as a captive market, brought particularly
to Glasgow and the west of Scotland. We also suffered more than the
rest of the UK when our manufacturing industry ran down. However, the
UK now exercises its power through soft power. I felt genuinely proud
of London during the Olympics. London showed a warm side that most
people had hitherto not noticed, including Londoners themselves. I hope
that Londoners will feel just as proud of Glasgow when we hold the
Commonwealth Games in the summer of this year.</hs_para>

served on the Scottish Parliament’s Finance Committee, I wrote a
paper arguing that while the establishment of a Scottish legislature
was unquestionably a good thing, we did not establish a Scottish
Government or have the recourse to reforms to Whitehall and Westminster
that allowed a more federal type of United Kingdom to be developed.
That is why there is an opportunity ahead of us to seize that issue and
offer the people of Scotland an opportunity to reject independence but
put their faith in a reformed and improved union. I concur
wholeheartedly with the noble Lord, Lord McConnell, in his
illustrations of the benefits of the Scottish Parliament. To his
examples, I could add: land reform, which languished on the shelves of
officials who did not secure parliamentary time in Westminster;
criminal and civil law reform; the first legislation on freedom of
information in the UK, which included its own Parliament in that
legislation—something that this place learnt, to its cost, that
it should have done; reform of local government; and electoral reform.
Many of those instances were put forward through the leadership of my
noble and learned friend Lord Wallace and the noble Lord, Lord
McConnell, working together in coalition. They saw coalition work in
the United Kingdom, after a long break, which was also a contribution
that reform can
bring<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T14:36:40"></hs_TimeCode>. Those are

‘If you feel Scottish and want to run your own affairs, you must

Scottish people want that. The other group, the Unionists, say
‘If you feel British, if you value British traditions and
respect British parliamentary democracy, and if you think that the big
industries have to cover the whole of Britain, you cannot have a degree
of self-government which reflects your needs in your own areas.’
I reject both propositions. Institutions have to be the servants of
political demands. We have people in Scotland who want a degree of
government for themselves at the Scottish level. It is not beyond the

appropriate balance of power and accountability would lie for the most
efficient and stable delivery of public services in Scotland, and
across the rest of the United Kingdom. We have an opportunity to put
the Scottish Parliament on a more permanent constitutional footing,
allow it fiscal power commensurate with its legislative power, and
ensure that there is proper accountability and elections in the
Scottish Parliament, so that when I was an MSP people would not have
asked me where the money was raised from for the services on which it
was spent, but would have asked simply how it should be spent. There
should be more robust legislative underpinning of the financial
relationship with the Scottish Parliament. That is unsustainable in the
future because the devolved Scottish budget is treated effectively as a
departmental budget line in the Treasury documents. It is also no
longer sustainable that the funding formula for Wales, Northern Ireland
and Scotland can be arbitrarily changed by the Treasury or that, if we
consider the Scottish Parliament to be permanent, it can be abolished

not characterise the encounter. It has always been my instinct that the
English-speaking world developed a set of values that are quite
different from virtually anywhere else in the world. I do not say that
they are better values; I merely say that they are different. These
somewhat vague instincts were confirmed for me by reading Daniel
Hannan’s book, <I>How We Invented Freedom &amp; Why It Matters.

his passing was not mourned then, and neither do I do so now. But the
most important aspect of this Anglosphere legacy, and where it is so

as I can recall, two members of a great institution—the
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland—were in your
Lordships’ House. Both now, alas, are no longer with us. The
Institute of Chartered Accountants of Scotland has been the greatest
influence on my life virtually anywhere, including your
Lordships’ House. I hope that the Minister will take that in
hand<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:09:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000356" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000356">I
want to concentrate today briefly and in a humble way on not just

about something called “growth points”. Your Lordships

have spent the past 40 years in your Lordships’ House. I
irritated and bored one of my late noble colleagues in that I always
said, “I am an Angus man”. She would go on at me, asking,
“What are they saying in the Angus glens?”. I will not
hammer it home today all the time but, certainly for me, it is crucial
that we discuss great developments in Scotland. I am trained 
<?notus-xml column=1416?>as an accountant and a money man and am particularly keen on the economy
of Scotland. Since 1970, during my time in your Lordships’
House, we have seen the rise of the Scottish National
Party—charming people; they can be very nice. Your Lordships
might want to glance at the English newspaper the <I>Daily
Telegraph</I> today, where they will find a fascinating article by one
Mr Alan Cochrane, who gives one particular view of the tide within one
party in Scotland. It is not exactly favourable and pushes on very much
in the direction that the noble Lord, Lord Purvis of Tweed, was
speaking about after what one hopes will be a no vote in September this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:11:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000358">I
want to concentrate on the aspect of jobs and the economy in Scotland.
I look particularly at the need for inward investment—above all,
in my own neck of the woods, Angus in Dundee. It was an enormous
tribute when the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cullen, mentioned some
aspects of research. I am given to understand that, in Dundee, there
are world leaders in two or three aspects of life sciences and
medicine. We should never forget that there is similar expertise in
Edinburgh and Glasgow. We have a huge, world-famous and worldwide
talent in Scotland in that particular discipline. I also look at my
noble friend the Duke of Montrose, who I think referred to my noble
friend Lord Forsyth as being a bit grey—I think I got that right
but nobody is less grey than my noble friend Lord Forsyth, who is
another Angus man. In the lovely town of Montrose, 25 new jobs have
been created with a world-famous pharmaceutical company. Why do such
companies come to Montrose? First, roots have already been put down
there; secondly, at the moment, the economic climate is very favourable
and they are being encouraged into Montrose and
Angus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000359" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000359">However,<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:13:06"></hs_TimeCode>
nothing is static. Your Lordships may be startled that most Sundays,
being scared witless that the flames of hell may or may not lick me, I
attend church in Kirriemuir, which we call Kirrie. I meet many
youngsters there, one of whom was head boy at Webster’s. People
talk about self-starters, but that young man did things that I could
never have thought of and thought of them off his own bat. He studied
medicine and worked in an area known to my noble friend Lord
Glenarthur, RAF Leuchars. He has taken other holiday jobs, is now
thrusting on heavily and will be very successful in Glasgow, where he
has just qualified as a doctor. I wonder what 70 year-olds like me
discussing politics and economics in Scotland can offer to these
youngsters. I am concerned that everything we do and say should improve
and help inward investment to Scotland, but particularly to Angus and
Dundee. What Mr Carney said in Edinburgh yesterday should be taken on

Lord, Lord Lang of Monkton, for the very thoughtful way in which he has
introduced this important debate. In so doing, I declare my own
interest as professor of surgery at University College London and a
member of the General Medical Council because I wish to confine my
comments to two very important and practical areas which I think will
be profoundly affected if Scotland were to be separated from the United
Kingdom. Those are the regulation of the medical profession and the
conduct of biomedical research. I do that building on the comments made
by the noble Lord, Lord

I reflect on something that the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth of Drumlean,
said earlier, when he recounted a long list of those of Scottish
descent who have made a profound impact on the life of the United
Kingdom. I would add to that some names of people who have made a
profound impact on the way that we practise medicine—for
instance, Sir John Hunter, a famous Scottish surgeon who came to
England and who is considered the father of modern surgery. He
described a methodical and scientific approach to the practice of
surgery that still defines how surgery is practised globally and has
resulted in the profession of surgery in the United Kingdom having made
so many contributions to global surgery as well as being so highly
regarded.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14013072000363" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000363">We
have Sir Alexander Fleming, who discovered penicillin—a
discovery that profoundly changed our ability to impact on human
health, for which he received the Nobel Prize. Another Nobel laureate,
Sir James Black, developed through new pharmaceutical entities beta
blockers, which have profoundly changed the way in which we treat heart
disease and high blood pressure, and H2 antagonists, which helped us to
improve the management of ulcers, avoiding the need for major surgery
and treating most ulcers of the stomach and duodenum with drug therapy.
From among your Lordships, we have my noble friend Lord Patel, who was
formerly a famous and distinguished professor of obstetrics and
gynaecology in the University of Dundee and, more broadly in the United
Kingdom, a highly regarded chairman of the Academy of Medical Royal
Colleges and president of the Royal College of Obstetricians and
Gynaecologists. Therefore, the links across medicine in the United
Kingdom are profound and have existed for many
centuries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000364" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000364">In
the White Paper that attended the more formal announcement of the
Scottish Government’s proposals for the referendum and for
independence, there is in the question-and-answer section a statement
about the wish of the Scottish Government that medical regulation

I do not think that that is going to be necessarily and easily
possible.</hs_para>

the moment, the Medical Act 1983 governs the way in which the General
Medical Council operates. That Act is influenced by the professional
qualifications directive of the European Union—which I shall
come to in a moment. The situation for medical regulation is that three
categories of doctor appear on the medical register. The first is
graduates of UK medical schools, 
<?notus-xml column=1418?>including the four schools in Scotland that are recognised as part of
that Act as being able to award primary medical qualifications in the
United Kingdom. Graduates of those universities, including Edinburgh,
Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen, will immediately upon successful
achievement of their examination and their first year of practice
become full members of the register. A second category is those who
hold a recognised European primary qualification in medicine. They have
registered elsewhere in the European Union and will automatically have
registration on the general medical register. The third category is for
those who come not from UK medical schools or appear on European
registers but are graduates from elsewhere in the world; for example,
the United States, Canada and Australia. They are considered
international medical graduates and have to take a separate examination
to demonstrate their skills before they can apply for registration.
Indeed, if they come with specialist skills from elsewhere in the
world, they may well have to undertake further specialist training in
the United Kingdom before they are able to appear on the
register<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

situation for those graduating from Scottish medical schools if
Scotland were to separate from the United Kingdom—some 850
students due to graduate in 2016 and some 800 in 2017. Of course, the
situation might be solved if Scotland were to become part of the
European Union, but, as we have heard in today’s informative
debate, that may take many years. In the intervening period, it may not
be as simple as to say that we could have some form of legislation in
the Westminster Parliament to allow those graduating from Scottish
medical schools or those undertaking Scottish training programmes for
specialist practice to be uniquely recognised in the remaining United
Kingdom, because that will be affected by the professional
qualifications directive of the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:20:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000367" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000367">It
is a very serious problem. Forty per cent of those who have qualified
with a primary medical qualification from a Scottish university reside
in England. This means that a large number of potential practitioners
in the intervening years could be affected by our inability to offer
registration and recognition of their degrees. Indeed, if they are not
part of the European Union, it is not clear where they will be able to
practise apart from in
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:21:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000368">The
second area to be affected if Scotland were to be separated from the
United Kingdom is medical research. We have heard already in this
debate that some 13% of research council funding from the
United Kingdom research councils is spent in Scotland with
only 8% or thereabouts of the GDP for our country coming from Scotland,
so Scotland does disproportionately well. When we look at spending by
the Medical Research Council in Scotland, we see that it is close to
17% of its budget, including the many important medical research
facilities and units that exist there. It would be unprecedented for a
research council to be able to spend its taxpayer-funded opportunities
in a foreign country. The infrastructure across the United Kingdom that
has put us at the forefront of biomedical research—some 12% of
all citations in biomedicine come from the United Kingdom; it is a
remarkable intensity of research effort that we 
<?notus-xml column=1419?>are able to contribute globally—would be undermined if the
important links between Scottish biomedical research institutions and
the rest of the United Kingdom, designed in such a strategic fashion to
exploit the most important research opportunities for our country, were

the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, who, not for the first time, has brought
his tremendous and forensic skill in his subject to the debate in this

very much in the debt of my noble friend Lord Lang for introducing it
with such quiet passion and so comprehensively. I very much hope that
this debate will be read in Scotland. I would draw attention to one or
two speeches without in any way casting aspersions on others, but I
hope that what the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, has just said about
medicine will be taken in, as I hope will be what the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Cullen, said about research. I hope that what the noble
Lord, Lord Kerr, said about the possible membership of the European
Union of an independent Scotland will be taken into account, because he
did for that subject, with his forensic skill, what the Governor of the
Bank of England, Mark Carney, did yesterday when he talked about the
implications of a common currency between an independent Scotland and
the rest of the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000370">Like

1945, where my father was stationed throughout the war, when victory

that I was part of a very great country that had done the world a very
great service. Two of my sons have been educated in Scotland. One of
them fought side by side with my noble friend Lady Goldie, whom we are
delighted to see today, in the election in 1999 for the Scottish

than 300 years, reached the stage where we should have a divorce? I
would argue most passionately that it has not. As I have said before in
this House, this nation is much greater than the sum of its individual
parts. Scotland coming into the United Kingdom transformed North
Britain into Great Britain. My noble friend Lord Forsyth, in a truly
remarkable, 
<?notus-xml column=1420?>passionate and eloquent speech, talked about all the contributions that
Scotland had made to philosophy, the arts, architecture, science,
commerce and medicine. How right he was to do so. We have heard of all

much reduced country, a country with far less influence in the councils

constantly reiterated theme in this debate. Should we have divorce? No.
Why not? For the same reason that many individuals should not have
divorce: for the sake of the children. I think of my grandchildren
growing up in Scotland. I want them to grow up as proud citizens of the

Parekh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we have had an absolutely
fascinating and rich debate, led brilliantly by the noble Lord, Lord
Lang. While listening to this debate I asked myself a simple question
and conducted a simple experiment. The debate is intended not merely
for our edification; it is intended to influence people on the other
side of the border in the hope that they might act in a way that we
would like them to act. So I asked myself: imagine a Scotsman, whether
or not he is sympathetic to independence, sitting in our midst,
listening to the debate—would he have been swayed by our
arguments? What would he feel? If I for a moment am being a
devil—devil is not the right word—or if I try to share
with you some of the thoughts that I had, I hope you will forgive
me<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013072000378" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000378">I think that a Scotsman
sitting here would have made two complaints. First, he might say that
we are trying to engage in the politics and economics of fear:
“If you break away, your kids will not be able to come to our
medical schools. You will not be able to share the Bank of England and
all its facilities. You will not 
<?notus-xml column=1421?>be able to do all this”. In other words, we are trying to play on
his fear. If he is strong-minded or bloody-minded enough, he might say,
“Well, this is how our relations have existed for the past 300
years”. Scots have resented, rightly or wrongly, this English
sense of superiority—even a certain degree of
arrogance—and always felt that we were telling them what they
should do. They would say, “This is precisely the language of
arrogance that we have resented for 300
years”. I am not saying that that is right. I am trying to
imagine the worst and asking myself how I could address an interlocutor
who might view our debate in this way. So his first
complaint would be that we were looking at the problem
almost entirely from the standpoint of what it will do to Scotland, and
what harm it will do to Scotland, rather than from a shared standpoint
where, as the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, pointed out, we might say,
“Look, we have been in it together. If you break away, not only
do you suffer, but we who have been part of you, suffer as well. As old
comrades, you would certainly not want to do that to us, no
more than we would want to do that to
you<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:32:04"></hs_TimeCode>”. So
I think that the first thing we would need to ask is how we can conduct
the argument not simply in terms of what harm it could do to Scotland
but in terms that always emphasise the shared
“we”—how we would feel pain and how we would both
suffer if that were to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:32:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013072000379" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000379">The second complaint
that the imaginary Scotsman sitting here might have is that in the
debate we have concentrated on self-interest, defined in narrow
materialistic terms: economic, educational, political, military,
defence and so on. As we know from the history of nationalist movements
the world over, people are not guided by economic interests alone. If
that were the case, Bangladesh would not have separated, Pakistan would
not have broken away. People are guided by deeper emotions as well.
What we need to be asking ourselves is: have we been able to appeal to
the Scotsman’s emotions? Have we got him to feel that
there is a deeper engagement required on his part? We need
an appeal to emotions, to shared historical memories, to a common
imagination and to a certain shared vision of the future. In other
words, telling the Scot that, “This is what we have
done together, and if we stay together, this is what we are
capable of doing in the future, not only for ourselves but also
for the rest of the world. Why do we not continue

I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:34:11"></hs_TimeCode> would
therefore suggest that in addressing this question, and in
participating in the debate that will take place on the referendum in
September, we need to redress this balance in two ways. We should be
thinking of the shared “we” rather than merely what harm
this will do to Scotland, and we should be appealing to collective
memories, shared memories and a shared vision—making sure that
we are talking in idioms which they fully share, and which historically
resonate with their own memories. People are, after all, guided by a
profound sense of what they were and what they wish to be.</hs_para>

would an argument of this kind be framed if I were trying to convince
my imaginary, hypothetical Scottish interlocutor? I have been asking
myself that, and I think that I would do it in the following two ways.
First, it is striking that Britain has an ambiguous record of dealing
with multiethnic and multinational societies. When we ruled over
multiethnic societies in the Empire we were not terribly successful and
ended up imposing more partitions than almost any other imperial
country, including in Cyprus, India, Rhodesia, Ireland and elsewhere.
At home, however, our record has been one of the best in the world. We
have been able to sustain a successful multinational and multiethnic
society in a way that no other country has. Only empires have done
that, but we have beaten that record by creating a democratic framework
within which a multinational society could be maintained. That has been
made possible with Scottish co-operation and encouragement. We could
emphasise that what we have achieved is unique in history, precisely
because of this. It is not necessary for the Scots to embark along the
path of independence when a much more sensible, realistic
and imaginative alternative is available to them, as was suggested by
the noble Lord, Lord Lang.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013072000382" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000382">The second way in which
we might formulate the argument would be to appeal to the liberal
democratic social order that we have created. The kind of liberal
democracy which we have created in Britain is a beautiful synthesis of
English liberalism and the Scottish sense of community and solidarity,
each regulating the other. Neither of us alone could have
created the kind of liberal democracy that we have. It is not shared by
France or Germany; it is unique to us. We can show that this great
historical legacy that we have, and which we pass on to the rest of the
world, could not have been possible without this kind of joint
enterprise. I suggest that appealing to that shared history, and to a
shared vision of what we can do together, might be a better way of
appealing to the Scots and taking them with us, rather than merely
telling them how independence would cost them
dear.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_30_PT_1/CEDE5A2748DB521D6FC8ECB021D6100FE3185A2E" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 January 2014">Thursday,

Moynihan (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, not surprisingly, I intend to
concentrate my remarks on British sport. Going back as far as 1969, I
had the privilege of steering the Welsh senior men’s four at the
home countries international in Monmouth. England, our opposition, took
an early lead and moved three lengths clear of us. Unbeknown to them,
the reeds hidden just under the surface extended well into the centre
of the stream following the final bend on that stretch of the River
Wye. Taking a wide berth, we passed them with 200 metres to go and, as
they were well and truly caught up in the reeds, we fortunately won. I
was intensely proud of that crew and treasure my Welsh vest to this
day.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14013072000385" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000385">The
example serves to show that I have no intention whatever of diminishing
the pride which is engendered in home countries competing in their own
right. Our history has brought with it great benefits to the home
nations, but they did not need independence to secure their
contribution. Had we in the United Kingdom not given football the laws
of the game in 1882, 
<?notus-xml column=1423?>England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would not have
disproportionate influence over world football, as those four votes
continue to be matched by only four other FIFA-appointed members of the

Motion today in the context of the pinnacle of world sport: the Olympic
movement, in which I had the privilege of serving for seven years as
chairman of the British Olympic Association. The Olympic Movement has a
global impact and brand, making the rings one of the most powerful
symbols in the world and lifting the spirit and passion of
people across the United Kingdom and the world, not least through the
London Games in 2012. Here, as in so much of sport, it was our recent
history in the United Kingdom that shaped the modern Olympic
movement.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14013072000387" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000387">On
14 September 2012, as chairman of the British Olympic Association, I

a Team GB London 2012 athlete. Of course, they knew that had they
represented an independent home nation, they would have received a

great Scottish Olympians to British success. Many of Scotland’s
finest athletes, of whom we are all proud, have served the United

competitor, and Scotland’s and Great Britain’s first
Olympic gold medallist, was the Scot, Launceston Elliot, the
single-handed weightlifter—sadly, it is no longer an Olympic
sport. Wyndham Halswelle was the first Scot to win an individual
Olympic athletics title 
<?notus-xml column=1424?>and is still the only British athlete to win a complete set of gold,
silver and bronze medals, excluding relays. A veteran of four Boer War
battles, he served Britain with distinction, ultimately becoming
Captain Halswelle and being killed in action by a sniper bullet to the
head in a trench on 31 March 1915. More recently, the great boxer Dick
McTaggart, who won lightweight gold at the 1960 Rome Olympics, spent
six years in the RAF. They were great Scottish Olympians and Great
Britons. We owe Scotland a huge debt of gratitude. All of us should be

particularly for the focus he placed on the United Kingdom. This is the
unexplored area of the national debate that we must pursue. I also
thank him for his analysis of what the future might hold and should

starting point for this debate is the old saying, “If it
ain’t bust, don’t fix it”. It ain’t bust.
The United Kingdom is doing great things. It is in comparatively good
order, as we look around the world. It has a record of achievement that
arises from it being the United Kingdom. I will focus on
this in relation to my own patch of the world:
universities and research. It is easy to see the advantage
to Scotland of the United Kingdom focus on research funding. In 1992,
when legislation went through to set up separate Scottish funding
councils for the universities, a number of us put great effort into
retaining the UK base for research councils. Happily, our
arguments—arguments from my fellow vice-chancellors in Scotland,
England, Ireland and Wales—won the day. It was not automatic
that they would. We combined to say that this was the right direction
for research funding in
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:45:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

British research effort is extolled throughout the world. America is
the great champion; China is beginning to bite very hard and there are
other countries, notably Australia, which are pushing on this. However,
the British contribution to the building of international knowledge and
understanding of our world and of ourselves is massive, and is
recognised as such. I have no doubt that one factor in this is that
there has been a national United Kingdom focus on research strategy and
funding. Long may that
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
a reality as well as a matter of reputation, which I will illustrate in
a

numbers before but, in good House of Lords practice, I will repeat
them—but only once, not twice. Scottish universities earn 13% of
the total UK research council funds, based on 8.4% of the population.
That is a significant gain for Scotland. UK charities spend more than
£1 billion a year on research in these islands and, again,
Scotland achieves 13%—well above whatever measure you would
normally
take<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:47:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the research councils and the charities base their research funding on
merit and peer review, not on sectional, national interest. That is
why, again, the UK punches above its weight, as does Scotland. Both the
UK and Scotland would be diminished if they were to be separated. Siren
voices argue, “Don’t worry, it will be all right. All
will be well. We will separate and then, perhaps, we will continue with
the current arrangements and the amount of money flowing to Scotland
will be proportionately high”. Did the current Scottish
Government, who are pushing this policy, ask, for example, the Wellcome
Trust what it thought about this? The Wellcome Trust is one of the two
major drivers of research excellence in this country, particularly in
the biological and medical sciences. It
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14013072000627" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000627">“Our

Wellcome Trust points out that it gives money to overseas bodies,
largely to those in countries which are not wealthy enough to have
their own research budgets. It has two reasons for doing so, and two
reasons for worrying if it had to consider Scotland as an overseas
territory. What about additional and diverse regulations applying in
Scotland to the use of research funds, as distinct from England? It
would complicate its procedures and be an inhibition to it; it has made
that plain. It worries, too, about possible changes to the governance
of universities. It understands very well that good research practice
relates to good governance. If you do not have leadership in
universities that cam make strategic decisions—and that is not
the direction of the current Scottish Government—your research
and other performance will fall back.</hs_para>

Scotland clearly think that they can do a deal with Research Councils
UK in any future separate status. They are whistling in the dark. The
noble Baroness, Lady Liddell, made the point that talking about pals in
this area will not do. I had lots of pals who were vice-chancellors in
England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, but I can tell 
<?notus-xml column=1426?>you, when they see the numbers spelt out that show what the research
councils currently give to Scottish research, there will be no
“paliness” about it—it will be a straight deal. I
calculate that if they were contributing pro rata, they would put in,
roughly, £150 million to £160 million, and they currently
get £257 million. That is a huge gap. When that is seen,
transparently, I cannot believe that English vice-chancellors will line
up to say, “Well, that’s all right then”.

benefits to the UK have been immense. I have already mentioned the

excellent work in Aberdeen and St Andrews, gives Scotland

people to Australia than anybody else. Live meat went out, and then,
with Scottish help, we developed a chilling machine that allowed us to
bring dead meat back, meaning sheep and lambs. Over that period, we
shipped thousands of people. Of course, we became Lord Mayor of

approach this today with a sense of humour because there are now some
great opportunities for us to consult Scots around the world. Noble
Lords will find a brief in the Printed Paper Office which the Library
helped me to prepare, which says that effectively 5.5 million people
were born in Scotland, of Scottish birth, of whom 79% are in Scotland,
15% in “Other 
<?notus-xml column=1427?>UK”, 3.8% in Australia, Canada and New Zealand, and a few in the
United States. However, the relationship is
not<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> necessarily
by birth. Everyone has a domicile of origin at birth, normally from
their father. In Scotland, that domicile of origin is of the earliest
recorded ancestor, and it passes through the male line from one
generation to another unless and until a descendant specifically
acquires a new domicile of choice. If the parents were not married at
the time of birth, the domicile of origin passes through the female
line, and it is estimated that that and related issues may have led to
up to 40 million people fairly claiming Scottish ancestry. I feel that
we might have a duty to consult these people before the referendum. How
that should be done is surely fairly
simple.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000405">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:55:28"></hs_TimeCode>
my case, with the different family names that I have, I am not ashamed
of being a Selsdon of Croydon but I would rather be, as I am, Malcolm
McEacharn. Over time, if we look at how the movements went, we can see
that the Scythians were the first to come across, of course. They
arrived, and when they got to Ireland, or Scottish Ireland, they were
welcomed there, as were all guests; then they were told that there was
no room so they should go over to the kingdom of Albanectus, which was
in fact Scotland—or, maybe, in those days,
Albania.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000406">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T15:56:10"></hs_TimeCode>
we look back at our history, it is one of migration; within the
Scottish blood there is a desire to travel and to move and to make the
best of what you can wherever you may be upon the face of this earth.
So the challenge to government is how it could possibly arrange some
form of consultation with all those 20 million to 40 million
Scots who live abroad, in the empire or wherever it may be. I leave
noble Lords with that thought. This is not a major speech, but I think

increasingly define ourselves as exclusively English rather than
British. There is the even more alarming thought of becoming a
foreigner in part of what we think of as our common heritage and
country. Many of us are genuinely British. It has been referred to
today how many of us have mixed ancestry. I certainly have some
Scottish ancestry, although I doubt that I could qualify under the

many of us are party-political animals and very much value our

many important and emotional ties between Tynesiders, Clydesiders,
people in the south Wales valleys and the various industrial parts of
England. The people in those areas have worked closely together since
the beginning of the Industrial Revolution to try to improve living and
working conditions and mounted many campaigns with common motivations,
principles and ideas. In fact, the National Health Service encapsulates
perfectly what I am trying to say. After all, it was created by a Welsh
Secretary of State, Aneurin Bevan, in a Government headed by an
Englishman, Clement Attlee, under a party founded by a Scot, Keir

the referendum in Scotland will affect not only Scotland itself but
every other part of the United Kingdom, especially Wales. If Scotland
leaves the UK, 59 Scottish Members of Parliament will be removed from
the House of Commons, 58 of whom are not Conservatives—only one
is a Conservative. That would not occur under proportional
representation, but 58 of those will be opposition Members. If that
happens, it will be much easier to obtain a Conservative majority in
England, Wales and Northern Ireland than it is at present. I know that
fair-minded Conservative Members will be as horrified as I am that this

found that in that year there were 29 Liberals in Wales and four
Tories. In 1906, 1997 and 2001, not a single Conservative was elected
in Wales. Therefore, a party which in 140 years has never returned the
largest number of MPs in Wales would be ruling in a country which has
rejected it time and time again. Usually in Wales the Conservatives
will have, say, 20% of the vote, so 80% of the people of Wales will be
subject to an alien party, as well, of course, as being subject to
England. This would be colonial rule returned. The immediate cry would
be for Welsh independence. People such as me who are in favour of a
federal solution for the whole UK—we have not really spoken
about that—might join the independence bandwagon, because Wales
would be ruled by a party that had never been in the majority there,

Nickson (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am honoured to be sandwiched
between two Welshmen. To the best of my knowledge, the Nicksons were
border reivers and,  
<?notus-xml column=1430?>before the union of the Crown, stole cattle equally from the Scots and
the English. I am delighted that my old colleague and friend the noble
Lord, Lord Lang, has had such a wonderful debate and made such a
memorable speech to launch it. He has instigated 40 other
wonderful speeches around this House, and I hope that he is proud of
that because he most certainly deserves to be. He was my boss when
Scottish Enterprise came into being; I was its first chairman. Economic
conditions were a bit difficult and we had a pretty difficult birth,
but we can both be relatively happy that the organisation put up then
is broadly still trying to deliver enterprise in Scotland a quarter of
a century later. We were also colleagues on another board, that of
General Accident.</hs_para>

is a great sadness to me that most of the companies for which I ever
worked in Scotland now do not have their names. General Accident is now
Aviva in Norwich, Collins has gone, and Scottish &amp; Newcastle
succumbed to the Danes. Scottish &amp; Newcastle had equally good
provenances north of the border in Edinburgh and south of it in
Newcastle. God help us that it happens but it occurs to me that, were
the yes vote to come to fruition and had I still been at Scottish &amp;
Newcastle, if it were in our shareholders’ interests we would
have moved everything we could to Newcastle pretty quickly. That is
what I fear might well happen for business if there were a yes vote.
Business wants certainty. It wants to know that it can make long-term
investments with the confidence that they will be worth while. It does
not want all the changes that will inevitably happen. If there were a
yes vote, do not let us think that what happens at that moment will
stay; there will be further divergence and further difficulties for
business in terms of regulation. Things will become more
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:08:59"></hs_TimeCode>. Do
not let us assume either that this is not being looked at by global
businesses, from wherever their headquarters are, whether it is
Calgary, Houston or Hong Kong. Do not let us think for a moment that
what is going on now in Scotland is not going into their corporate
planning for the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000422">When I
thought about what to say in this debate, I thought that I would talk a
little about business, which I have done, and secondly about currency.
It would be quite impertinent for me, following what was said by the
governor and the speeches made here today, to launch into the issue of
currency. However, there is one issue that has not been mentioned. The
noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, mentioned Scottish banknotes. The noble
Lord, Lord Cavendish of Furness, produced a £50 note out of his
pocket. I have here a £10 note. On it is the face of Robert
Burns.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14013072000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000423">I have
not seen that it is on one of Alex Salmond’s wish lists to
retain Scottish banknotes. However, I would go back slightly further
than the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, to 1694 and the Bank of England Act,
and to 1695 and the Bank of Scotland Act. We then come to 1727, after
the Darien adventure, and the RBS challenging the Bank of Scotland
monopoly. Ever since then, through the centuries, the ability to
produce Scottish banknotes has been defended. If we go forward another
100 years, Sir Walter Scott is credited with leading a campaign to
defend the ability of Scottish banks to print Scottish notes. He did it
under the most wonderful pseudonym of Malachi 
<?notus-xml column=1431?>Malagrowther, but he got the credit for it anyway. Over another 200
years we have been through various banking Acts, culminating in the
Banking Act 2009. All of them have given the right for Scottish banks
to produce Scottish banknotes.</hs_para>

know, they are not strictly legal tender. They are promissory notes,
unlike the Bank of England notes. The governor said yesterday that in
negotiations various things would have to be given up in terms of
sovereignty. I wonder, if the Government were wishing to be tough, if
they might say to Alex Salmond that he cannot have Scottish banknotes
any more. In any case, they are only issued by three Scottish banks,
two of them largely owned by the British taxpayer, the other owned by
the Australians, so how will he have the right to produce Scottish
banknotes? However, as I believe that he is a man of great ambition,
perhaps he has in mind that having come from the Royal Bank of
Scotland, in some 50 years’ time he might see his own head on a
Scottish banknote. I hope that that does not

Scottish Parliament while I led the Welsh Conservatives in the National

policies, horror stories and war wounds—metaphorically, of

quite separate issues. The first relates to the desire of the Scottish
National Party, in the event of a yes vote for separation, to keep the
pound sterling. The proposals of that cheeky chappy Alex Salmond are,
of course, incredibly dangerous. It would be open to Scotland, on a
strictly legal basis, to use the pound sterling as its currency without
any negotiations with the rest of the United Kingdom, in much the same
way as Panama uses the United States dollar or Montenegro uses the
euro. This would not be a currency union but a decision to have no
independent Scottish monetary policy. That would be a disaster for
Scotland and it would not be good news for the rest of the United
Kingdom either.</hs_para>

lies the problem for a single currency, because it clearly needs a
single monetary policy with a single banking regulation and an
integrated fiscal policy. These issues are very much central to what
the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, was setting out in
his warning yesterday. It is 
<?notus-xml column=1432?>inconceivable that the remaining United Kingdom—England, Wales
and Northern Ireland—would not seek to exercise considerable
influence over Scottish fiscal policy, to say the very least, before
agreeing to a currency union. Indeed, in all honesty, what we have seen

Scottish nationalists tell us that they want to be members of the
European Union. It is very clear that they will have to formally apply
to join and to satisfy the other 28 members of their credentials, which
is unlikely. They will also have to negotiate an opt-out from an
obligation to join the euro, which is virtually impossible. It can only
be imagined what all this uncertainty will do to business and jobs
north of the border: two sets of negotiations—one to join a
currency and one not to join a currency—would be destined to
fail. It is the Alex Salmond constitutional hokey-cokey, which would be

want to touch on has been mentioned by many noble Lords: the
constitutional settlement in the light of a no vote, or even in the
event of a yes vote. I passionately hope and trust that there is a vote

speakers, including my noble friend Lord Lang in his excellent
introduction, spoke of the need for a new settlement—unionism
that recognises the importance of the devolved arrangements in the
United Kingdom. In the wake of the vote there will need to be a
constitutional convention to look at the powers, not least the fiscal
powers, of the constituent powers of the United Kingdom, and at the
English dimension which, so far, is the dog that has barely barked on
devolution issues. In the case of Wales, a draft Wales Bill is already
being looked at, following the response of the Government to part 1 of
the Silk report on fiscal powers. I declare an interest as a member of
the Silk commission. Part 2 of the Silk report is due to be presented

constitutional
settlement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:17:20"></hs_TimeCode>. In

people for protecting the union. We heard that from many Scottish
Members but I would also like to hear it much more widely. I feel that
I am incredibly lucky to have been born and brought up in a group of
nations that live together in peace and freedom and under the rule of
law and which recognise the cultural differences throughout the United
Kingdom. That is one of the most important things that we have and need
to protect. One of the messages that I would like to come from
today’s debate, loudly and strongly, is that it is time for
people outside Scotland to take part in this debate and to say very
clearly to the people of Scotland: “We want you to stay. We need
you as part of the United Kingdom. You strengthen, not weaken, us, and
the reverse is also true”.</hs_para>

the SNP separatist approach is that it has within it—not
throughout all SNP voters and not even throughout the SNP
membership—a core of narrow-minded nationalism. That also has a
reflection in English nationalism. When I hear an English person say,
“Well, if they want to go, I don’t care. Get rid of
them”, I argue with them, and we should all do so. Why do we
want Scotland to stay? We want it to stay because, apart from anything
else, the SNP has a dreadful poverty of historical understanding.

history—that of the civil war. It was not an English civil war
but a war throughout the United Kingdom, although it was not called
that then. It got rid of the divine right of kings—in other
words, authoritarian government. What did we get in 1707? We got an Act
of Union that put an end to the fratricidal killing that took place on
both sides of the border, with looting, murder, robbery, rape and
everything else. The Act of Union put an end to that over a relatively
short historical period.</hs_para>

I hear Alex Salmond and others talk about separation, I am reminded
that nations that break up do not always do so neatly into two parts.
The former Czechoslovakia broke up peacefully but with many problems.
The former Yugoslavia broke up in violence. The people there also
remembered an old battle from 700 years ago and it led to ethnic
cleansing. No one pretends that that would happen now with this
separatist agenda, but why on earth would one talk of a separatist
agenda when we have made a success of a political and economic union
that the world envies because it has brought us peace, stability and
prosperity? That civil war, followed by the Act of Union, gave us the
freedom and prosperity that enabled us to deliver the world-changing
Industrial Revolution, which has had no comparison in history apart
from the agricultural revolution of 10,000 years ago. We were able to
deliver it because we had the freedom to develop it, and it came about
not because of Culloden or Bannockburn but because of the much wider
recognition of the rule of law underpinning peace, stability and
prosperity<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:22:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to all British people everywhere is: start saying loudly and clearly to

serious debate. That is why I took the liberty—and I apologise
to those who did not get it—of sending round a pamphlet by the
Constitution Society. There are four articles in it but if noble Lords
want a good summary of what the problems of separatism would be for
Scotland, I suggest that they look at the one by Phillip Blond. It
spells out the reality that several speakers have touched on here
today—that Scotland can have real independence only within the
union. That is also what came out of yesterday’s lecture by the
Governor of the Bank of England. Separatism would weaken Scotland and
make it more dependent.</hs_para>

Therefore, when Alex Salmond says, “We’ll negotiate this
and negotiate that”, he has to remember that it is up to the
other side to decide whether it wants to be part of that. One thing
that Phillip Blond brings out in his article is that you cannot

<I>Acts of Union and Disunion</I>, the historian, Linda Colley, points
out that nationalist sentiment in the UK has always increased during
periods of peace. Thus, during the long Victorian peace, we had the
Irish issue and home rule; in the inter-war period, Plaid Cymru and the
SNP were founded; and now we have an SNP Government in Scotland and a
referendum on Scottish independence in the
autumn<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:26:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000441" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000441">Every
state in the world has fault-lines of this kind. We are quite normal in
that respect and should not excessively beat ourselves up just because
we have this problem at this time. Indeed, as migration and 
<?notus-xml column=1435?>globalisation increase—and they will—and memories of our
distant wartime past diminish with time, these fault-lines may
increase. This problem will not go away. It is also a problem that is a
challenge to the whole British polity; it is not just a problem for our
Scottish friends. I believe profoundly that the answer to the problem
lies in imaginative leadership. As my noble friend Lord Lang so
eloquently put it in his introductory remarks, leadership is crucial in
this area. We need to look at not only good leadership and good
governance but the framework for
governance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:27:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000442" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000442">In
her book, Professor Colley argues that the next thing we should do is
establish an English Parliament to match the Scottish Parliament and
the Welsh and Northern Ireland Assemblies. Indeed, an English
Parliament would be the only way to deal with the West Lothian
question. You can ameliorate it by other means but you cannot resolve
it. The noble Lord, Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, made the point about
the English dog which is not yet barking. This would deal with some of
the underlying English resentment, which I felt as a Member of
Parliament both in the far north of England and in London. In those two
situations, I felt that bubbling away even though it is incoherent and
not yet particularly
evident<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Given
that an English Parliament may be sited outside London, I even think
that it could deal with some of the north-south tensions which are
growing at the moment. The pull of London is still extremely strong and
is likely to continue to strengthen. Therefore, the establishment of an
English Parliament and proper devolution around the whole country would
ease a number of the problems we are faced with at the

have finally disposed but we have to disagree on this. I note that he
lives outside London and perhaps has some interest in the north-south
dimension. None the less, the noble Lord, Lord Lang, made the pertinent
point that it would be wrong to discuss the possibility of an English
Parliament and wider devolution before the choice is made in the
autumn. I respect his judgment on that
and<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:29:28"></hs_TimeCode> perhaps that
is where the political wisdom lies. However, in the context of the
remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, looking at this from afar, as
an Englishman trying to see the scene in Scotland as it unfolds, it has
occurred to me that adding the idea of an English form of devolution
would add something to the Better Together campaign and give it a
positive role, which it sometimes lacks at the moment. The noble Lord,
Lord Parekh, talked about playing on fear. I do not go that far, but

not before the referendum, I am absolutely at one with the noble Lord,
Bourne, in saying that something has to be said about this after the

has to be renewed and we can do that. Again, as the noble Lord, Lord
Steel of Aikwood, said, echoing his hero and mine, Jo Grimond, we have

As my noble friend Lord Bourne has already said, the devolution process
in Wales will continue, as the second part of the Silk
commission’s report is likely to recommend the devolution of
further powers. I look forward to reading the commission’s 
<?notus-xml column=1437?>recommendations. It will give us a genuine opportunity to cast our eyes
again over our complex devolution settlement and help define which new
powers will allow the Welsh Government best to serve Wales within the
United Kingdom. However, in truth, we need a settlement or
constitutional framework that recognises the need for more autonomy
across the United Kingdom—for Wales, Northern Ireland and
Scotland but also for London, England and the English regions. The
Welsh Secretary of State at the time of the Welsh devolution
settlement, Ron Davies,
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14013072000628" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000628">“Devolution

the time has come to do what Ron Davies never actually did and begin an

shared future where each of the four nations is an equal partner. If we
accept the premise that devolution can lead to an “event”
then, arguably, that event is the creation of a quasi-federal union
between the nations of the United Kingdom. Building a shared future of
this kind may take many years and it may be one which the majority of
us will never see. However, one thing is certain: the genie is out of
the bottle. Powers and responsibilities gained and exercised by
Governments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland cannot be contained

this House on the Irish home rule Bills. Reading all four of them would

had my mind first turned towards this issue some 25 years ago. My noble
friend Lord Kilclooney, who is unfortunately not with

shortly after he had been elected to the European Parliament in 1979,
invited me to spend a few days with him—I had been his election
agent. When we were there, we bumped into the redoubtable Winnie Ewing.
I discovered that John was on quite good terms with her, because the
two of them got into quite a friendly conversation. She had with her
two other chaps who I spoke to, and they turned out also to be members
of the SNP, who were there on an information visit—they were
obviously would-be candidates at some point. I said to them,
“You know, if you chaps get your way and get an independent
Scotland, it will pose a problem for us in Northern Ireland. What would
we do? Do we go with Scotland or stay with England?”. One of
them said, “Oh, good, it’ll be just like Dál Riata
back again” and the other said, “Oh,
no!”—so I was glad to see the SNP was clearly united on
this issue.</hs_para>

particular implications for us in Northern Ireland, and it may result
in certain issues that are now sleeping coming awake again. Some noble
colleagues often ask me what I think about recent developments in
Northern Ireland and I say, “No, don’t worry about them;
the only thing that I see on the horizon that might destabilise things
in Northern Ireland is the Scottish referendum”. I hope, of
course, that there will be a clear no

number of Members have spoken about family. I intended to say just a
few words about family, too, because I think that it is relevant. I
cannot emulate the noble Lord who took us through all the branches of
all the elements that have contributed to him—I am afraid that
we Trimbles have no history. Genealogical research in Northern Ireland
is extremely limited, so very little can be said about that—we
have some oral traditions, but whether there is any truth in them I
have no idea. On the other hand, my mother-in-law is Scots. She grew up
on a farm just outside Banchory in the north-east. My wife has more
Scottish relatives than Northern Ireland relatives, and two of her
sisters have moved to Scotland, one after marrying a Scotsman and the
other one after marrying a chap from Manchester—but that is
another story that is not relevant to this. Through them, I have two
Scottish nephews and a niece, but of the three of them, one is at
university in Cambridge, the other is a solicitor in London and the
third is looking for work in Stirling. I 
<?notus-xml column=1439?>think that we could all find that within our families, which just

would be tempted to go through the various evolutions of the policy of
the SNP. One of the amusing things about this debate is the way in
which the SNP keeps changing its policy and what it wants to do. I was
particularly delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, referred us
to Alex Salmond’s espousal of the great arc of prosperity. Well,
two of those countries effectively went bust; the third, Norway, did
quite well. You could say that odds of one out of three might be
attractive to a gambler, but they are not, I think, to a prospective
Government.</hs_para>

will not look not at the very obvious difficulties and improbabilities
of the SNP position but will sum up what I think it hopes to do if it
wins the referendum. It talks about independence, but it is
independence where Scotland will retain the crown, and hopes to be in
NATO and the European Union. It wants a currency union; it says that
30% of all cross-border entities will continue; and, of course, it
wants to keep the Scottish regiments as well. What does all that add up
to if you were to look at it? I know that it is highly improbable that
this can be done, and there are huge difficulties about almost all the
things that Mr Salmond mentions, but if it could happen, what would it
be like? It would not really be “independence” as the
word is normally understood. My noble friend Lord Empey said that it
would be a client state. I had not thought of that phrase, but it
looked to me like a sort of dual monarchy. Where have I heard of that
before? Oh, yes: Austria-Hungary after 1860 and the dual monarchy
there—which is not a terribly good augury for the future, you
might think.</hs_para>

this is devo-max: what Salmond would get is powers of taxation and more
control over expenditure, but leaving all the external things pretty
well in place. People say that if there is a no vote, there might be
devo-max. If they go down that road, they will be giving Alex what he
is asking for at the moment even, after he has lost the referendum.
That is without going into the question of whether devo-max is a good
idea—the answer to which is, no, it is not. Again, to get the
argument for that, go back to look at the Irish home rule Bills and see
how each Bill, one after the other, cut down on the extent of economic
devolution to the proposed Irish home rule parliament. It started off
with what Salmond would now call devo-max but ended up with a very
minimalist position. It all reflects on the highly integrated nature of
the British state, which we unravel at our
peril<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:45:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000463" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000463">The
reasons for devolution were quite different. I support devolution and
would have touched on some other points as well, but I think we need to
be very careful about this. If the worst comes to the worst, yes, there
are some implications for us, but a number of suggestions have been
made in this Chamber today which we should approach with very great

his many salient points, the noble Lord, Lord Lang, mentioned the issue

place in the union is not just good for Scotland. As many noble Lords
have said today, it benefits England, Wales and Northern Ireland. The
union is a collective endeavour in which the four home nations are
united in the pursuit of the common good. There is a desire by some to
break up that relationship while claiming that none of the
relationships that proceed from it will be affected. That is simply
untrue. Indeed, what is proposed is a leap into the dark,
leading to a complex process of negotiation and redefinition. It is
simply fallacious to claim that Scotland can leave the union and that
all that is positive that proceeds from it can be not simply preserved
but somehow improved. Rather, the outcome of a yes vote in September
will be the transformation of a relationship of partners into one of
competitors—a transformation which will be bad for Scotland and
bad for the remainder of the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:49:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000469" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000469">The
SNP’s vision of an independent Scotland is a fantasy based on
the claim that somehow everything will change while, simultaneously,
nothing will change and consequently everything will be
better. The relationship it envisages with what remains of the United
Kingdom typifies that fantasy and how the reality would be damaging for
both countries. By retaining sterling, Scotland’s monetary
policy would still be determined by the Bank of England. That would
effectively mean that Scotland’s borrowing and interest rates
would be controlled by a foreign country. The statement by
Mr Mark Carney, the Governor of the Bank of England, has
surely finally scotched that fantasy of Alex
Salmond<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T16:49:42"></hs_TimeCode>’s.</hs_para>

Select Committee on Economic Affairs seriously doubted the possibility
that members of the Bank of England’s Monetary Policy Committee
could represent the interests of a separate country. Such a sterling
union would mean a fundamental change for the worse. Monetary policy
would in no way be determined in the interests of the Scottish people.
This also exposes another central falsehood of the SNP’s
position: their unique understanding of negotiation—that simply
by declaring what you want, you will be given 
<?notus-xml column=1441?>it. This was certainly exposed by, for instance, the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Cullen of Whitekirk, describing the damage to the research
facilities available to Scotland. I will come back to Alex Salmond in a

political union with the UK, the benefits of four nations working
together will undoubtedly be lost, and Scotland’s relationship
with the outside world completely redefined. The benefits brought by
shared regulation and institutions—namely, a unified labour
market, integrated infrastructure and a UK-wide business
framework—would either be lost altogether or severely
diminished. In the area of defence procurement, which was mentioned
specifically by a number of noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord
Browne of Ladyton, the damage done to Scotland and to the UK would be
long term. I doubt we would be able to recover from it. An independent
Scottish state would have lower domestic demand for defence goods, and
would no longer be eligible for UK defence contracts. The Clyde would
never again be able to build complex warships or aircraft carriers for
the Royal Navy.</hs_para>

the world, the United Kingdom is working to pursue the best interests
of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. There are currently
267 embassies, high commissions and consulates in 154 countries. The
idea of Scotland setting up a similar structure is laughable. My noble
friend Lady Liddell mentioned Alex Salmond’s comment that we
would remain best pals with England. Yet at the same time, he still
propagates the idea that despite, in theory, being a member of the
European Union, Scotland would bar English students from free tuition
fees. Best pals? There is a touch of nastiness there, which we should

Scotland would be damaging all the other partnerships that spring from
it. The legal opinion is increasingly clear that the remainder of the
UK would be regarded as the continuity state, inheriting all the
international rights and obligations that currently befall the UK,
while Scotland would be regarded as a new successor state. As many
noble Lords have indicated, Scotland would have to reapply to join the
European Union and NATO. Here, again, many in the yes campaign display
a shaky understanding of the meaning of negotiation. The Scottish
Government’s White Paper declares that an independent Scotland
would join the EU, but not the eurozone or the Schengen area. However,
this is at odds with the EU’s rules on membership. Any exemption
would likely require unanimity among all the member states. At the
moment, that seems extremely unlikely. The terms of membership are
simply not within the Scottish Government’s gift. Similarly, the
desire to become a member of NATO is at odds with SNP commitments
regarding Trident. Trident is part of a NATO security umbrella. Any
attempt to remove it from the Clyde would undoubtedly impact on
Scotland’s relationship with other NATO countries and negatively
affect its application for
membership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000474" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000474">The

it would take us into a world of uncertainty. If Scotland were to vote
yes to the ending

the same negative consequences. My noble friend Lady Quin indicated the
dilemma of the feeling of closeness and camaraderie across the
border with Scotland, and the potential damage to
Northumberland and the border counties from having a separate Scotland
with fiscal taxation and all the rest of it. Her powerful speech
indicated the dangers of that.</hs_para>

between the remainder of the United Kingdom and Scotland would be
damaging to both. While the UK would be regarded as the continuity
state in international law, its standing would be
diminished—hence the apposite title of this debate in the name
of the noble Lord, Lord Lang. Serious questions would doubtless be
asked as to why the UK continued to retain a place on the UN Security
Council. The UK’s role and influence within the European Union
would also be weakened. Furthermore, Scotland’s exit from the
union would be a heavy blow against the concept of multinational
states. It would prompt serious questions as to the involvement of
Wales and Northern Ireland within the union, potentially reawakening
terrible wounds within the latter, as was mentioned by the noble Lord,
Lord Trimble. It would also have a profoundly negative impact on
England’s identity and
politics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000476" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000476">The
implications for the UK of a Scottish yes vote in September 2014 are
unappetising. It would represent a turning inwards, a diminished
outlook and a turning away from a relationship of co-operation and
partnership into a relationship of competitors. Outside the union,
Scotland would find itself having to try to renegotiate its
relationship with the UK and international bodies. If an independent
Scotland managed to enter into a sterling union, it would represent a
highly regressive development. Scots would find that their monetary
policy was being entirely determined by a Bank of England no longer
capable of adequately representing the Scots.</hs_para>

of the debate have been the sense of heritage and the sense of family.
My noble friend Lord Forsyth gave us a very good perspective on
heritage. He said we are one nation forged over the
centuries. Other noble Lords who talked about history included my noble
friend Lord Cavendish of Furness and the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria,
but noble Lords also talked about the idea of family and, sadly, noble
Lords also talked in terms of a family that faces possible divorce, all
the trauma that goes along with that and how we want to try to avoid
it. That emphasised that the people who belong on this island not only
have a shared heritage but have so much in terms of shared family. When
my noble friend Lord Caithness was describing his bloodline, I thought
that he was the absolute embodiment of Britishness, with all the
various parts of the United Kingdom from which he can claim
ancestry.</hs_para>

passion that the noble Lord, Lord Soley, mentioned. Noble Lords said
how important it is to them that we remain part of a United Kingdom.
Some 800,000 people born in Scotland now live in other parts of the
United Kingdom and about 500,000 people born in England, Wales and
Northern Ireland now live in Scotland. One speech mentioned the 30,000
people who travel in and out of Scotland each day to work. My noble
friend Lord Moynihan talked about the Olympic family and how proud we
all felt at the success of the British Olympic team in 2012. When he
was speaking, I was reminded of the point made by my noble friend Lord
Cavendish: when you split a £50 note, each part is not worth
£25. Equally, one could say that if you had split the boat of
Katherine Grainger and Anna Watkins, who won the double sculls, neither
of them would have been in a gold-medal position. That emphasises how
much we achieve when working together. We are truly greater than the
sum of our
parts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000487" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000487">I
recognise that what we are debating today has implications for other
parts of the United Kingdom and for our parliamentary arrangements. My
noble friend Lord Trimble talked about its impact in Northern Ireland.
I will perhaps say later that if you try to disintegrate public bodies
and institutions that have been brought together and evolved over a
long period, it has costs, even for the part of the United Kingdom that
would not have opted to lose Scotland. I also take the point of the
noble Lord, Lord Gordon, that whatever the outcome on 18 September,
even if it is a no vote, there may well be relationships that have to
be worked at to bring about some harmony again, so that we can continue
to go forward as a truly United

the legal position is that, without Scotland, the United Kingdom would
continue, albeit, I fear, as has been said by a number of your
Lordships—my noble friends Lord Lang, Lord MacGregor and Lord
Lamont of Lerwick, and the noble Lord, Lord Parekh—as a
diminished United Kingdom. It would be a United Kingdom from which we
had lost something very 
<?notus-xml column=1445?>valuable. We have had very clear legal opinion, referred to by my noble
friend Lord Crickhowell, from Professors Crawford and Boyle, that
England, Wales and Northern Ireland would be a continuing state.
Internationally, the continuing United Kingdom would retain its
membership of organisations and bilateral treaties. Domestically, each
one of the United Kingdom’s public bodies and institutions would
continue to
function.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000489" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000489">That
cannot<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T17:05:43"></hs_TimeCode> be said
of an independent Scotland. An independent Scotland would be an
entirely new state. As the noble Lord, Lord Robertson, said, it would
be a separate state. I sometimes wonder why a party that wants
independence objects to the idea that it might be a new state; I
thought that was the whole point of what they were trying to do.
Scotland’s future would be based on a series of protracted
negotiations with different states and organisations, as well as other
parts of the United Kingdom. Which currency would Scotland use? How
would Scotland join the European Union, as referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Kerr? Would it have to join the euro or Schengen? These are
questions that the Scottish Government have singularly failed to
answer. They would require detailed negotiations to pull out of a union
of which Scotland has been an integral part for more than 300 years and
to establish a new set of international relationships.</hs_para>

important to stress the positive. As the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria,
said, we have at the moment the best of both worlds. We have a system
of devolution that delivers for Scotland. Where it makes sense, key
decisions of state are reserved to the United Kingdom and its
Parliament to take on behalf of all citizens across the United Kingdom.
Equally important decisions are made by the Scottish Parliament in
Scotland on issues including education, healthcare and policing. The
noble Lords, Lord Robertson and Lord McConnell, and my noble friend
Lord Purvis, have indicated that devolution is working. I take the
point made by my noble friend Lord Lang in his introductory speech,
that somewhere we seem to have lost sight of the Scotland Act 2012. The
point is that the position is not static. There is no such thing as the
status quo because, in 2015, there will be taxation powers on landfill
tax and land-based stamp duty; and in 2016 there will be an important
development on the 10p rate of income tax. It is not standing still;
since day one it has evolved and developed. That 2012 legislation
substantially increases the Scottish Parliament’s power and was
proceeded upon on the basis of evidence, consensus and
consideration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000491" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0002.htm#14013072000491">At
the start of 2013, the United Kingdom Government said that we would set
out the facts about Scotland’s place in the United Kingdom: its
contributions and the benefits we receive as a result. We have done so.
The Scotland analysis papers, details of which I circulated to noble
Lords last week, have set out in great detail important issues such as
currency, research, defence and, most recently, borders and
citizenship. They make a positive case for Scotland being part of the
United Kingdom. I do not believe that the Scottish Government have in
any way challenged this analysis. Their White Paper last November was
their opportunity to make their case. It is widely recognised that they
distinctly failed to do so. None of the key issues such as currency, 
<?notus-xml column=1446?>EU membership and, crucially, the terms of EU membership and economic
stability, will go away—but none of them was adequately
addressed. It was an exercise in assertion and wishful thinking. My
noble friend Lord Lang said that it used its length to hide its
emptiness. I noted that, in the passage he quoted, my noble friend Lord
Steel talked about the principle of continuing efficiency. I have
looked that up on Google, and cannot find that principle enunciated

Lordships made particular reference to the speech the Governor of the
Bank of England made yesterday in Edinburgh. He highlighted the
principal difficulties of entering a currency union: the loss of
national sovereignty, the practical risks of financial instability and
having to provide fiscal support to bail out another country. As the
Chancellor has previously said, the current arrangement of a full,
monetary, fiscal and political union brings economic benefits to all
parts of the United Kingdom. That is why we have seen the Chancellor,
my right honourable friend the Chief Secretary, former Chancellors of
the Exchequer, the shadow Chancellor and the First Minister of
Wales—and in this debate the noble Lord, Lord Empey, from
Northern Ireland, and my noble friend Lord Bourne of Aberystwyth, from
Wales—say that in the event of independence, a currency union is
highly unlikely to be agreed, and that in those circumstances the
Scottish Government need a plan

unions do not work without close political and fiscal integration;

financial markets. As my noble friend Lord Shipley indicated, an

make any commitments or comments on it except that it takes a while to
get one’s mind around the thought that my right honourable

Scotland thinks about that. However, the point the noble Lord, Lord
Kerr, made was about the complexity of that situation and of the terms
of membership. The noble Lord explained why the rebate could not just
be split up and a bit allocated to Scotland. There is also the issue of
Schengen and the currency. When the Scottish Government talk about the
common travel areas as their preferred position on Schengen, that would
clearly be a matter for negotiation. They also have to make up their
mind. They cannot claim on the one hand that they want a radically
different immigration policy from the rest of the United Kingdom, and
on the other still maintain that they can have a common travel area.

difficult problems. The noble Lord, Lord Kakkar, mentioned the General
Medical Council and all the issues that would flow from that. I think
that many of the regulatory bodies in the health service have appeals
that go to the Privy Council. The Scottish Government may say,
“We can keep it”, but I am not sure that they have

Scottish National Party defies the relevance, or even the existence, of
this House—it ignores it—but, happily, the British public
do not. I very much hope that what has been said today will reach out
to a wider public. For me this has been an amazing debate. We have had
six former Secretaries of State taking part, five from Scotland and one
from Wales; one Scottish former Chancellor of the Exchequer; one
Scottish former Chief Secretary to the Treasury; two very distinguished
Scottish judges; a chancellor and a vice-chancellor of two great
Scottish universities; a clutch of former First Ministers, a Presiding
Officer and current and former Members of all the devolved
Administrations of the United Kingdom, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland; one Scottish former ambassador to the European Union and head
of the Foreign Office; one former Secretary-General of NATO; and one
former head of the British Olympic Association. We have had more than
40 Lords a-leaping, and I dare say that if we had a pear tree in the

importantly, we have had a lot of brilliant and highly articulate

Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to
introduce this short debate on improving access to finance for small
and medium-sized enterprises. There has been much concern among the SME
fraternity about their business health, but I detect little evidence of
success in the government policies in that direction so far. I think
they feel hard done by by this Government. However, as the National
Audit Office said in a recent
report:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14013072000631" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000631">“SMEs

trawl of the Government’s website, and of the BIS page in
particular, will show the enormous range of support that the Government
offer. The Enterprise Minister, Matthew Hancock, set out the
Government’s offer to SMEs in December. Many people find the
list a bit confusing. Behind all that, the message that the SMEs give
is that the biggest problem is a lack of finance. It may not be there
and it may be very expensive. Equally importantly, they may need even
more finance than they would otherwise because government departments,
large companies and others are taking so long to pay their bills that
more working capital is required just to keep the business going. I
shall speak a bit more about that
later<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T17:28:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000519" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000519">It
is good for the Government to say that they are doing so much, but the
experience in the field is rather different. I have a couple of
examples. Five or 10 years ago a good friend of mine developed a
restaurant in London that is doing extremely well, and has extended it
to three or four branches. I saw him yesterday and he said, “I
want to expand further, not just in London but to some of the
regions—Manchester, and Bristol eventually”. He has a
very good track record and is comparatively risk-free, but he found
that he could not get the kind of finance that he might have been able
to five years ago, and has had to beg round to get enough just to take
things further. This can be seen as just a London issue, but it is
not—he wants to go to Manchester and other places where jobs are
surely important.</hs_para>

trying to do up a house into luxury apartments and, towards the end,
when he needed £2.5 million to sort out the

building, but there we are—the Royal Bank of Scotland pulled out
at the last minute, causing his cheques to bounce. I will not repeat
the long story, but effectively they put him into liquidation, took the
building into their property arm and used it. The inference is that
they would then develop and sell it and make a lot of money and that
the poor man would be left with nothing. He now seeks to sue RBS over

a late payment policy, and even then it does not comply with it. Some

have always supported the cause of SMEs. I echo the words of the Prime
Minister earlier this week when he said that SMEs are key to
Britain’s economic recovery and make a great contribution with
their innovation, hard work and determination. They make up around 99%
of all private sector businesses and provide nearly 60% of private
sector employment. During this Parliament, a number of measures have
been brought forward to help SMEs grow. Among them are the cutting of
£l billion-worth of red tape and the extension of small business
rate relief. The Government have also worked to make Britain’s
tax system more competitive, with corporation tax being the lowest in
the G7 and a £2,000 tax cut on national insurance contributions
coming in from April
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000533" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000533">The
problem that SMEs have in accessing finance has dominated debate in
recent years, but some important steps have been taken. The £1
billion British Business Bank aims to increase the supply of capital to
SMEs and introduce more competition to the banking sector. In addition,
businesses that would otherwise lack adequate security for a loan are
being helped through the enterprise finance
guarantee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000534" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000534">It
is also important to remember that banks are encouraged to lend to
SMEs. The Government hope to do this by allowing banks to borrow from
the Bank of England at cheaper than market rates through the Funding
for Lending scheme. More also needs to be done to allow more people to
start their own businesses. The Start Up Loans initiative was created
to help people to get their businesses off the ground. As someone who
promotes Islamic finance, I was very pleased with the recent
announcement by the Prime Minister that start-up loans will also be
available on Islamic principles. However, we are in a competitive world
and there is always more that can be done.</hs_para>

multiple support schemes for small firms, research has suggested that
unfortunately there has been limited success. The Federation of Small
Businesses has said that current business support is congested and
confusing. Many SMEs still struggle to access the finance they need,

also believe that more should be done to make these schemes act as a
coherent programme rather than a collection of separate initiatives. I
ask my noble friend the Minister what, if anything, is being done to
this effect. We also need to get more of the UK’s large
businesses to play a supporting role for SMEs. Often big businesses do
not pay small suppliers promptly. Small firms suffer cash-flow problems

Stoneham of Droxford (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in the brief time
available to me, I should like to indulge the House with a parable
based on a true story. When I studied the Industrial Revolution at
university, I always associated a man called Henry Cort, the inventor
of Cort’s puddling process in iron-making, with Abraham Darby,
Ironbridge and the northern industrial areas. When I came to live near
Portsmouth, I discovered that he was a supplier to the Navy, and,
having patented his process, he built a new iron mill at Fontley, four
miles from where I live. He needed funds for his new foundry and he
borrowed £30,000—worth over £2 million
now. He got the funds from Adam Jellicoe, chief clerk of the pay board
of the Royal Navy, who secured the money on the patents registered by
Cort<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T17:43:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the chief clerk of the pay board of the Royal Navy could afford such a
vast deal. He had, of course, a ready source of funds and—you
guessed it—he was the Robert Maxwell embezzler of his time. The
money had come from the Navy payroll. Poor Mr Cort. The Navy took his
patents, and although 8,200 puddling furnaces were built by 1820, Mr
Cort saw no financial benefit from his innovation. When the Navy
purchases fell back, his foundry bankrupted him. He died in dire
straits and is buried in

potential<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T17:44:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Thirdly, funds for SMEs have to be sourced locally by those familiar
with local businesses who lend and by small businesses which do not
have the time or resources to go further afield. Fourthly, the public
sector has a role. The public sector rarely wins prizes for business
innovation but it can be a valuable partner to small businesses. It is
a purchaser of goods. It should be committed and forced to pay its
bills on time but it also can provide seed-corn funding to reduce risk

is beginning to return to business and businesses want to grow and
invest but there is difficulty in raising money. I do not want to
banker bash but a number of issues need to be raised, including poor
banking lending practices, punitive charges, interest rates, difficult

changing relationship with banks. In the early days when I started in
business, senior bank managers had experience. Now there is a lack of

are horrible stories about banks which continue to bully SMEs through

call in loans, to take security or to break covenants. This is
terrifying for a business. Often you can see them extracting extra
interest charges, invoking covenants in the original facility letters
or instructing new valuations with costs to be met by the borrower.
When it comes out lower, the bank may increase the margin, call in the
loan or ask for capital repayments. This is distressing for businesses
which quite often are just abiding by making payments. I know
of<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-30T17:49:29"></hs_TimeCode> personal

April 2014 the industry will be regulated by the FCA. It is still
currently a tiny industry, but I wish to express concern at its huge
rate of growth. There needs to be much more examination of how the
money is lent and the experience of management in making loans and
spreading risks for lenders. Peer-to-peer lending should provide a
further excellent opportunity for access to finance for SMEs. However,
we need to be prepared for failures ahead, as history shows that the

Hanworth (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, small and medium-sized
enterprises, SMEs, depend mainly on commercial banks to provide finance
via loans, overdrafts 
<?notus-xml column=1459?>and credit cards. According to the evidence from a National Audit Office
report, lending to SMEs was negative in almost every month from June
2011 to August 2013, which is to say that, during the period, adequate
finance was not forthcoming from the banks. We are told that 37% of
SMEs use no external finance. More of them use credit cards or
overdrafts than loans. Loan rejection rates in the UK are around twice
those of France and Germany and, of those SMEs whose loan applications
are rejected, 70% can find no alternative sources of
finance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000558" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000558">The
present dearth of financial support is undoubtedly a consequence of the
need of our large banks to reduce their leverage—they have been
endeavouring to improve their reserve ratios by limiting their lending.
The manner in which they are doing this has caused acute distress among
many small enterprises. A recent edition of the BBC’s
“File on Four” radio programme, “Default by
Design?”, bore witness to this. The programme focused its
attention on the practices of RBS, the Royal Bank of Scotland, 80% of
which has been in public ownership since it was rescued from
insolvency. The Tomlinson inquiry, which was briefed by Vince Cable to
investigate the practices of the bank, has alleged that it has been
sinking good businesses so that it can profit from their demise. The
BBC programme provided evidence to substantiate this allegation, and
some startling malfeasance was revealed. A subsidiary agency of the
bank was able to acquire the assets of businesses that had been driven
into financial difficulties by the effect of the interest rate swaps
that the bank itself had foisted on the
businesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000559" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000559">Modern
bankers deal with small businesses in a manner that differs markedly
from traditional practices. Banks have become increasingly remote from
local industry and commerce. In the past, a bank manager would be
expected to have an intimate knowledge of his business clients and of
their enterprises. Within our lifetimes, the number of private clients
of banks has increased dramatically, but nowadays they are dealt with,
not on a personal basis, but on a statistical or algorithmic basis, and
the same methods are applied to small businesses. The algorithms of
banking have two aspects. On the one hand, there is the matter of
global resource allocation, which determines the size of the funds that
are available for lending, as well as the threshold of
creditworthiness. The second aspect is the assessment of the
creditworthiness of the potential borrowers, which is also described as
their default
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000560" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000560">A callow
young manager can nowadays handle the essential decision in respect of
a loan application by a small business in a seemingly objective manner
that requires no expert knowledge on his part. The decision depends on
a credit score that is formed from an additive combination of measured
attributes, both numerical and categorical, that are recorded in a
computerised database. The aggregate score is compared to a threshold
value, and the request for a loan is granted only if the threshold is
surpassed. The typical basis for such decisions is a statistical
analysis that covers a large sample of cases. This is a decidedly
obtuse way of going about the
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000561" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000561">It
is an undoubted statistical fact that a large proportion of start-up
businesses are bound to fail. On the other hand, it is among such
businesses that the most dynamic 
<?notus-xml column=1460?>elements of a developing economy will be found. It used to be the task
of a bank manager to exercise his judgment in discriminating between
the businesses that would be viable and those that were bound to fail.
The effect of the algorithmic approach is to deny funding to the
majority of start-up enterprises on the grounds of the high rate of

dire consequence of the modern approach can arise when, on account of a

Storey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, for facilitating this debate. It has never been truer that,
in a recovering economy, the importance of SMEs is paramount. I suppose
that the direct answer to the question of what steps Her
Majesty’s Government are taking to improve access to finance for
SMEs is the fact that, at long last, the Government have established a
business bank—a business bank that has set itself an impressive
target of supporting £10 billion of new and additional lending;
a business bank that will help small companies struggling to secure
finance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000565" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000565">I was
fortunate to sit on the Select Committee which looked at how SMEs could

Select Committee looked at the barriers to exporting: why should a

export more? As you can imagine, the reasons and solutions were complex

course, was access to

interesting to note that the <I>SME Finance Monitor</I> report by BDRC
Continental showed that businesses with the confidence that they had a
chance of getting finance were more likely to expand. However, there is
a real deficit of confidence when it comes to SMEs looking to get
finance. Only 37% of SMEs planning to apply for finance believed that
their application would be successful, whereas the actual rates are a
lot higher, at almost 67%. The research identified a staggering 270,000
businesses that wanted to apply for finance 
<?notus-xml column=1461?>but never ended up doing so. The report identifies this lack of

reason.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013072000568" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013072000568">These
figures show that SMEs often will not apply because they do not think
that they will be successful, when actually the opposite is true. That
may be why there is a feeling out there that banks are not being
supportive. We need to give confidence to them to go for it. The
British Bankers’ Association, with its Better Business Finance
initiative, is attempting to increase this confidence by
awareness-raising campaigns to change that mindset. The message is:
approach lenders and you are likely to get the finance that you need to
grow and, hopefully, export.</hs_para>

I constantly hear that banks are doing all they can to prevent finance
and lending, my observational experience is that the situation is not
nearly as grim as is often painted. I recently met representatives from
Santander to talk about how they are helping families in difficult
times. The conversation turned to SMEs, and they told me of their
ambition to be the SME bank of choice across the country, and how, in
the first nine months of 2013, the bank had increased its net lending
to SMEs by 11%, opened 15 new business centres, increased the number of
relationship managers and established a capital growth fund of

the main problem always seem to be, and comes back to, receiving
finance. In this context, we have heard today about some rather
difficult issues being alleged against the Royal Bank of Scotland,

new bank term lending to SMEs fell by 23% between 2009 and 2012, that
70% of SMEs have loan applications rejected and get no alternative
finance, and that the funding gap—the difference between the

currently between £10 billion and £11 billion but may
reach about £22 billion by 2017. There is clearly a

BIS team to back up a number of initiatives. The first was to support
the UK’s first ever Small Business Saturday, which took place on
7 December. It resulted in an additional half a billion pounds of trade
going to small businesses. Initiatives like this can help, but we also
think that the Government needs to do more to ensure that firms get
access to the financing capital they so desperately need. That is why
we believe that there should be greater
competition within the banking sector. We need something that every
other G8 country has—a proper state-backed lending institution
and, alongside it, a network of regional banks that really understand
local business needs. Will the Minister confirm that the current work
on a British investment bank in his department will help resolve that

further. My noble friend Lord Adonis recently published a report on a
recommendation to establish a UK small business administration, which
we intend to set up if elected in 2015. This would create a step change
in the opportunities for small businesses from government procurement,
improve the quality of support available, and operate alongside the

me start with Funding for Lending. In April last year, we extended the
Funding for Lending scheme to bring non-bank credit providers into
scope. We also increased the Funding for Lending allowance that banks
earned by lending to SMEs. In November, additional changes and
incentives were announced to focus the scheme still further on
encouraging lending to SMEs, the sector of the economy where it is now
most needed. The evidence to date is that Funding for Lending has kept
the overall cost of credit to SMEs down, which has helped in a tough
trading environment. However, with the recent changes there is scope
for it to do even more to encourage SME lending.</hs_para>

Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, mentioned the British
Business Bank. Substantial progress has been made in setting up the
bank, which will be fully operational in the autumn of this year
pending state aid approval. We will need European approval to get the
state aid approval through. The chair, the senior independent director
and the chief executive officer are in place. Collectively, they have
strong financial sector backgrounds and small business lending
experience—from the private and public sectors, but most
importantly from the banking and regulatory sector—so we will
have a good team to run our new British Business Bank. The British
Business Bank will support economic growth by bringing together public
and private sector funds to create more effective and efficient finance
markets for our small and medium-sized businesses. It will do this by
bringing together the management of existing government loan guarantee
and investment schemes, and it will have the flexibility to develop new
initiatives to form a comprehensive package of support for UK
businesses. I will outline this in more detail.</hs_para>

Business Bank schemes are already delivering. They supported total
lending and investment of £650 million in 2013, an increase of
70% compared with 2012. As of the end of 2013, over 25,000 smaller
businesses were benefiting from British Business Bank support. The
Government are determined to build on this level of support. We have
developed a new wholesale loan guarantee programme that will make small
business lending more capital-efficient for banks, thus incentivising
them to increase lending to businesses. Through the British Business
Bank, a £300 million investment programme is designed to
increase the supply and diversity of finance available to SMEs through
non-bank lending channels. It operates on a commercial basis, with the
Government investing on equal terms to the 
<?notus-xml column=1465?>private sector. This includes challenger banks and peer-to-peer lenders.
Overall, as my noble friend Lord Storey mentioned, the British Business
Bank’s resources will help to unlock up to £10 billion of
additional financing for smaller businesses over the next five
years.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14013087000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013087000020">The
third point is on competition, which was mentioned by the noble Lords,
Lord Berkeley and Lord Stevenson. Alongside the British Business Bank,
the Government are also taking steps to increase competition and choice
in traditional banking and raise awareness of the support available.
There has been an acknowledged overreliance on our four biggest banks,
which between them account for 85% of business current accounts.
However, action on a number of fronts is being taken to change this.
First, two new banks, Williams &amp; Glyn Bank and the Trustee Savings
Bank, are being spun out from the Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds
Bank and will establish a significant presence in the banking market.
Other challenger banks such as Metro Bank, Shawbrook, Aldermore and
Cambridge &amp; Counties are also growing in scale and
significance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013087000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013087000021">Secondly,
significant changes have been made by the financial regulators to
reduce the entry barriers for new banks. New entrants now face lower
capital liquidity requirements and approval processes have been
streamlined. These changes are already making an impact; there are
currently more than 20 applications for banking licences being
considered by the financial regulators so, given time, we will have
real competition and a real regional presence as well. Apart from the
five we already have in place with Williams &amp; Glyn and the TSB
coming forward, those 20 new applications will, I hope, mean that we
will have a substantial number of new banks in the market and that
competition will close some of the problems we currently face. Thirdly,
the Office of Fair Trading is currently undertaking a market study of
SME banking. We await the findings with great interest and will
consider them
carefully.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_30_PT_1/1E1B88E86AC9FA44CB381961FF5DCBC5EDF0B3C0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 January 2014">Thursday,

couple of noble Lords mentioned awareness. The banks are playing their
part. Last week, the major banks launched a campaign aimed at restoring
confidence among small businesses that finance is available. In other
words, they are inviting SMEs to apply with a view to lending money to
them. A core element of the campaign is raising awareness of the
appeals process. If an SME has been rejected by the bank or is unhappy
with the conditions it is offered, it now has a right to appeal. To
date, more than 8,000 appeals have been submitted, of which more than
37% have been overturned, facilitating an additional £40 million
of lending. The scheme provides a vital reassurance that banks will
consider all lending applications thoroughly, but it needs greater
visibility to encourage more businesses to seek funding. The
banks’ campaign to address this is welcome.</hs_para>

recognise that more needs to be done to raise awareness of their own
schemes. The noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, mentioned a number of

the support that is available.</hs_para>

Storey, mentioned the difficulty that SMEs have in getting export
finance. I was privileged to set the remit of and be in the ad hoc
committee chaired by my noble friend Lord Cope, which the noble Lord,
Lord Storey, mentioned. The committee met a large number of SMEs and
listened to the difficulties of raising money. I am pleased to say that
the committee’s report has been published. It made
recommendations to the Government, and the Government have taken action
through UKTI and have come up with a number of schemes to help SMEs to
learn more. One in five SMEs exports. If we achieve a figure of one in
four, we will clear our huge deficit on external trade. I commend the
contribution of that committee because it made a hell of a difference.

conditions for SMEs are improving. The noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth,
mentioned that there is not enough lending. SME gross lending was
39% higher, year on year, in November 2013, and net lending
has been positive in three out of the past nine months, but I accept
that although gross lending has gone up, net lending has gone down.
Lately, it has picked up. In nine out of those 12 months, net lending
dropped, except in the past two or three months when it started to pick
up. This is partly due to many schemes that are now available for SMEs
to borrow money, not necessarily from their traditional
banks.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14013087000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-0003.htm#14013087000027">A
number of issues were raised. I will try to be as brief as possible in
view of the time, and I will be very happy to write to noble Lords. The
noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, mentioned the lack of finance. We have come
up with a number of schemes. He mentioned existing businesses that want
to grow. I agree with him. The restaurant he mentioned was a classic
example of a successful SME business that goes to the bank to borrow
money with a view to expanding. From what I have heard, and from having
been an SME for 30, I know that it is very difficult to raise money,
and quite often the banks want to renegotiate existing loans, adding
covenants and higher margins. It is difficult for existing successful
businessmen to raise money because the banks want to renegotiate and
renege on the original contract. I accept that that is an issue that a
large number of SMEs face. We have heard stories recently about the
banks pulling the plug at the last minute.</hs_para>

Sheikh, said that SMEs are key to our recovery. Of course they are.
They are the engine of the economy. There are 4.6 million SMEs. The
good news is that since 2010 about 460,000 SME have been created. The

I have addressed in my speech. On the relationship between customers
and 
<?notus-xml column=1467?>banks, the noble Lord is right. It is important that banks have a good
relationship with their customers. Quite often, from what is said, the
banks appoint lawyers from their panel of solicitors, who tend to
charge a lot more than the market rate. The banks are effectively
checking the work done by the customer. There is the same problem with
valuation. The banks should really give their customers a choice,
whereby those customers can negotiate legal and valuation fees. The

Justice Day began with a discussion of the future development of the
Justice and Home Affairs area. There was widespread support amongst
Member States for implementation and consolidation of existing EU
legislation, mutual recognition, exploiting new technologies, and
greater coherence between internal and external EU Justice and Home
Affairs activities. Fundamental rights and minimum criminal procedural
standards were also a theme for many Member States. The UK supported
concentrating on the implementation of existing EU law rather than
creating new legislation, and argued against further harmonisation. The
Presidency concluded that mutual recognition should remain the basis of
judicial co-operation and that existing legislation needed to be
implemented and codified. It also said that there was a need to make
full use of e-Justice and new technologies, and to have much greater
coherence between internal and external EU JHA work.</hs_para>

set out its package of measures on procedural rights in criminal law.
The Chair of the European Parliament’s LIBE Committee said the
package would be a priority for the new European Parliament. There were
mixed views from those Member States who spoke in response, with
support expressed in principle but some concerns raised about and the
detail of what the package would mean in practice.</hs_para>

Presidency asked for views on the proposed amendments to the European
Small Claims Procedure Regulation. The UK joined the majority of Member
States in agreeing that the threshold should rise but there was a
difference of opinion about what the new level should be. Most also
agreed with the greater use of electronic communication methods,
provided Member States retained some discretion in their use. Although
not raised by the Presidency, some

lunch there was a discussion on data protection and the issue of
international transfers of personal data. There was broad support
amongst Member States for the principle of extending the rights of EU
residents to third countries where possible but also concern among some
delegations, including the UK, about the lack of an effective
enforcement mechanism outside the EU, the potential for controllers to
be confronted by conflicting legal obligations and a lack of certainty
for data subjects about their precise rights. The UK maintained that
the focus of effort should be on Chapter 5 of the draft Regulation, and
its rules on international data transfers which are enforceable within
the EU. Nonetheless, the Presidency concluded that Justice Ministers
agreed to the geographic scope of the proposed Regulation while
highlighting that there were issues about enforceability outside the
EU. Further discussions will now take place at the technical
level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013065000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130-wms0001.htm#14013065000050">The

PNR was essential to enable authorities to track the movements of

Commission said that the strategic guidelines on the future of the JHA
area needed to take account of a range of new security and migration
challenges. There was also a need to step up work on counter
radicalisation and a number of serious crime areas, including
trafficking in human beings and cybercrime. The European Asylum Support
Office had an important role in supporting some Member States to deal
with excessive pressures on their systems. These issues would be
considered in more depth at DG Home’s conference on the future
of the JHA area on 29/30 January.</hs_para>

highlighted that burden sharing was not the solution and that it would
simply increase the pull factor. Nor should we call into question the
Dublin system, which had only recently been strengthened. Instead,
there was a need to strengthen the external border and reduce illegal
immigration into the EU through practical cooperation, with a focus on
returns and reducing abuse of migration and asylum systems. The UK
stated that future JHA priorities should include better exchange of
criminal records as well as action to tackle trafficking in human
beings and modern slavery, where the UK was introducing new
legislation.</hs_para>

preventing the use of capital losses in schemes to shelter income

has become aware of artificial arrangements where it is argued that
these rules do not apply due to the particular way in which the

my right hon. Friend the Member for Witney (Mr Cameron), has been clear
that it is the Single Market which is at the core of the EU. Membership
of the EU is in the UK’s interest, and the Government remains
committed to the reform priorities that it has set out: a more
competitive, more flexible and more democratically accountable EU.
The Eurozone must have the right governance and

will ensure that whatever new arrangements are established work for
those outside the Eurozone as well as for those within it. The UK can

support available from government to develop innovative solutions that
will reduce numbers and keep them low. The funding is not designed to

tensions between the Somaliland Administration and those clans in Sanag

wish to set up a separate federal state aligned with the Federal
Government of Somalia. These tensions occasionally spill over into
sporadic outbreaks of unrest. The continuing insecurity makes it harder

reform in
Turkey.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14013067000407" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140130w0001.htm#14013067000407">UK
