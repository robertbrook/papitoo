policies of this Government, which are seeing house building increase.
I know that the right hon. Gentleman does not like the facts, but
nearly 400,000 new homes have been delivered since 2010, housing starts
in the last quarter were at their highest level for 
<?notus-xml column=847?>five years—89% higher than the trough in 2009 when he was sitting
in the Cabinet—and there has been a 16% increase in housing
starts over the past 12 months compared with the year before. His
shadow Ministers go around opposing our planning reforms, even though
they are important to get Britain building, and time and again they
criticise proposals such as Help to Buy that are helping our fellow
countrymen and women to realise the dream of home ownership, so here is
a question that he needs to answer: if he cares about house building
and home ownership, why not make Labour councils get on with selling
council houses to hard-working

houses than in Tory councils. Frankly, I am still no clearer at the end
of this exchange what the Prime Minister thinks about the “use
it or lose it” policy. His Housing Minister says that he
supports it, the Mayor of London says he supports it, but the Prime
Minister does not know what he thinks. Here is the reality: he is not
doing enough to close the gap between supply and demand. The truth is
that the number of social housing starts is down, he has shelved his
plans for new towns and rents are rising. Does he accept that Britain

but now he cannot make that argument; then we needed plan B, but now he

What we have set out is the overall level of financial support:
£100,000 when a well is dug; up to £10 million,
theoretically, because of the 1% of revenue that will be paid; and then
this absolutely vital point about 100% retention of business rates,
which could have a very significant effect for local government
finance. The point that she makes is how that is divided up between
parishes, districts and counties, and whether one looks at individual
payments to individual households who might be inconvenienced. I think
that we should look at very local options, making sure that parishes
and individuals will benefit. That is something that colleagues will

Members was that it should be 10% of profits. My point is that 1% of
revenues, which obviously start running the moment shale gas starts
coming out of the ground, could well be a better offer. I am very happy
to sit down with anybody to discuss the issue, because I think that
shale is so important for the future of our country. The point I would
make, having been on Monday to see the oil platforms that are already
on the Nottinghamshire-Lincolnshire border, is that those went ahead
without any of the sorts of community benefits that we are promising
with shale: £100,000 when a well is dug, before any gas has
reached the surface; 1% of revenues, which could be between £7
million and £10 million for a typical fracking well;
and 100% retention of business rates, which for a set of wells could be
£1.7 million, or even £2 million, for a local authority.
Hon. Members should think about how much council tax a small district
or metropolitan authority raises and consider the difference that
£1.7 million or £2 million in revenue could make. By all
means let us talk about the facts and figures and what we can do, but
we also need to persuade people that this can go ahead without the

order, Mr Speaker. I would very much welcome your guidance. I wrote to
the Home Secretary on 9 October last year—14 weeks ago
today—about an issue raised by my constituent, Kerry Bouskill,
on child protection and the Childhood Lost campaign. She was concerned
about young people reporting abuse often not being believed and how
that can be a deterrent. The question on behalf of my constituent was
simple enough: will the Home Secretary outline the steps taken by the

2 December I was advised that changes were needed to the letter before
sign-off. On 11 December I was advised that the letter was awaiting a

countries—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland—and a patchwork of counties from Caithness to Cornwall,
Kent to Pembrokeshire, Norfolk to Antrim, Flintshire to Fermanagh, and

Cardiff to Colchester, and Belfast to Birmingham, and our historic
regions, such as the peak district, the black country, Snowdonia, East
Anglia, the Cotswolds and the highlands. Islands too are places with
their own distinct identity, from Shetland, Orkney and Lewis to
Anglesey, the Isles of Scilly and the Isle of Wight, and they also form
part of our nation’s great heritage; and in each of our
constituencies there are historic towns, neighbourhoods, villages and
hamlets, all with their own unique identity.
But<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T12:38:58"></hs_TimeCode> over the

changes to local government boundaries, parliamentary boundary

artificial names are used and where parts of one area are sliced off to
make up the electoral numbers in another. Over the years, one change
has been compounded by another to create very many anomalies and
muddled identities. All that now needs to be put right, with these real

his constituents feel. While many of his constituents and mine are
struggling with the cost of living crisis, what has been the
Chancellor’s response to the concerns about, and the evidence
of, excessive pay? Does the Chancellor regret the millionaires’
tax cut or missing another year of the bankers’ bonus tax? Does
he reflect on the outrage among the public, which my hon. Friend has
expressed, who want leadership in tackling such brazen rewards? No; the
response of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is to oppose even the most
basic transparency, which would let shareholders know about bankers who
are paid more than £1 million, and to oppose any action in the
UK to tackle the excessive bonus
culture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011573000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0001.htm#14011573000012">The

morning the Chancellor gave his rationale for disagreeing with the
European banker bonus cap. It is a 
<?notus-xml column=862?>shame that he did not take a lead in trying to construct something of
his own to rein in this culture. After all, we would have had a repeat
of the banker bonus tax. The Chancellor’s
argument is, “Oh well, this is just going to
move it all on to pay and on to ordinary salaries.” Surely one
of the lessons of the banking crisis is that the excessive,
short-termist risk and reward bonus culture was driving dysfunctional
behaviour that got us into the mess in the first place. Frankly, I am
sure those bankers will try to find all sorts of little dodges and
weaves to get around the rules, but we have to make the system more
transparent and we need to move towards an remuneration arrangement
that is much more about sustainability, stability, professionalism and
serving the customers. It would be foolish for the Government to try to
sue Brussels on this point and hold out against public opinion, which

my hon. Friends will hear a complacent desire just to move on from

the history of the banking crisis. They will try, with all their might,
to pretend that it was Labour’s spending on schools and
hospitals that caused a global recession in dozens of countries

sense that the banks must be held accountable for the state we are in
has been airbrushed from the Government’s narrative, because
they want to blame their political opponents rather than upset their
corporate friends. Perhaps the Minister likes to turn a blind eye, in
the knowledge that it really was the banks that were responsible for
the global financial crisis, or perhaps he has now genuinely convinced
himself that it was primarily the fault of Governments and that the
banks were only a little bit to blame. Either way, they have the wrong 
<?notus-xml column=864?>analysis, which explains why they have the wrong policies. By failing to
tackle the root causes of recent economic devastation and the deficit

we are on the subject of bank taxation and the levy, let us look at
what the Government have done, because it has been such a colossal
disappointment so far. The Prime Minister promised that his bank levy
would raise £2.5 billion each year, but they have never been
bothered about making the banks pay their fair share, because their
hearts are not in it, so the bank levy has fallen short of that target
year after year. It raised only £1.6 billion in 2011, and
despite their subsequent promises, it then again raised only
£1.6 billion in 2012, and they are expecting a further shortfall
this and next financial year—the Minister could confirm this. In
the past three years, the bank levy has raised £2.1 billion less
than they promised. With £2 billion, we could kick-start the
construction of 80,000 houses or employ more than 20,000
nurses—the same number the NHS is short of. It represents a

Leslie:</Member></B> This is not about shutting branches; it is about
making a more competitive sector. Time after time, we have tabled
amendments to financial services Bills calling for more competition in
the banking sector. The Independent Commission on Banking, chaired by
Sir John Vickers, called for action to diversify the banking sector,
but the Treasury’s approach to divestments of branches from
NatWest and Lloyds was not exactly a raging success. It would have been
better if the Government had taken our advice and gone for a
competition review of the retail sector and not just the business
banking sector. They often say “We are looking at
competition”, but it is usually only in business banking. They
need a more comprehensive approach; the customer needs better service
and competition to bring down fees and charges.</hs_Para>

customers, even though we know it helps people on low incomes to save
money and plan their budgets. The jury is out whether on the seven-day

should be taken towards full portability of bank accounts for

the banks for the lending that they need. The action that we have

introduced rules that require significant parts of bonuses to be
deferred and paid in shares, which means there is now a much better

malpractice in its relationship with the business community. Small
businesses have account managers at the bank who suggest that they
should take money from the bank. They are told that they will be looked
after by their account manager. They are not told that, in the
background, a group of people known as debt recovery executives are
looking at those same deals and asking themselves how they can make
that company go bust and get its assets. They are also thinking about
how they can revalue those assets downwards so that the company will be

watched that happen to businesses in my constituency again and again.
They were told that they were getting a good package and a good deal,
only for someone to appear from another part of the bank to tell them
that their assets had been revalued. Incidentally, the same valuers
were used again and again by the bank to downgrade those
companies’ asset values. The companies were then told that they
were in trouble because they could not pay their debts, but that the
bank would give them another loan, charged at an additional 10%
interest over and above what had originally been agreed. I have watched

When I was at university, the banking system was a solid, solvent
organisation. I had a very right-wing professor, Andrew Bain, who said
that banks should have a low leverage point of about 12.5 times the

transferred to the Clydesdale bank. The bank looked at the
company’s £2 million of property assets and also judged
its assets held in patents and rare mouldings to be worth £1
million. Further down the line, however, other people from the bank
emerged to tell the company that its property had been revalued and was
now worth only £500,000 and that its patents were worth nothing.
The company had been in existence for 180 years, and its owner put
£70,000 of his own personal cash into the company’s bank
account to keep it moving and to prove to the bank that his business
was viable in the long term. It was put into administration anyway, and
it has now closed, with the loss of 70 jobs. I blame the Clydesdale

impartial way—the state of the banking sector when this
Government came to power. It is worth recalling the mess that we had to
deal with when we took over. We had had the first run on a bank in this
country for well over 100 years; we had had the biggest
banking failure in the world; and we had had a decision, taken under
conditions of panic by the former Chancellor and Prime Minister,
effectively to nationalise large parts of the banking system.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T13:58:31"></hs_TimeCode> Opposition

natural course of events under capitalism would have been for those
banks to fail, for all their employees to lose their jobs and for the
branches in all our constituencies to close, followed by a
restructuring process taking place outside state ownership. Instead, we

Minister is now the shadow Chancellor. My hon. Friend rightly reminds
us that the regulatory architecture that allowed this disaster to occur
was also set up by the previous Government. Having been regulated by
that regulator for many years, I know how important it is that the
regulation of banks has been returned to the Bank of England. That is
important because the Bank of England sees the canary in the coal mine
when banks have problems with day-to-day liquidity. The Bank of England
was able to see such problems in the run-up to the crash, whereas the
Financial Services Authority, in its lofty headquarters in Canary
Wharf, was at one remove from that, and there was no ability to join up
the reaction. My hon. Friend makes an incredibly important
point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:00:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000018">At
the start of this Parliament, our Government inherited, in effect, a
state-owned oligopoly in the banking system, and that is not a good
place to be if we want to achieve a competitive and healthy banking

reform the banking system and make it more responsive to the needs of
businesses and consumers up 
<?notus-xml column=878?>and down the land. That cannot be done overnight—it takes time.
Step No. 1 was to reform the system of financial regulation. That was
an extremely thorough and elaborate process, involving many people from
within this House and the other place, and as of last year we had the
final enactment and implementation. So we have taken some difficult and
long-term decisions to reform the regulatory architecture in a way that

I come to the final piece of this journey in passing on to future
generations a banking sector that is, once again, fit for purpose:
addressing this problem of the state-owned oligopoly. We cannot
restructure the failed banks effectively within the Government’s
ownership, and the best way to say that we have closed this terrible
chapter that we inherited in the banking system will be by privatising
the banks that are publicly owned and returning them to the private
sector. We have started on that with the sale of the first tranche of
Lloyds shares. I sincerely hope that the Minister will be able to
reassure us that it is the Government’s plan to return Lloyds
shares to the private sector.</hs_Para>

also argue that it is in the best interests of the economy and the
country that we move now to return RBS, whose share price is still well
below that paid by the former Prime Minister for its shares, to the
private sector, even if that means recognising and crystallising a loss
which is the price we pay for Labour’s banking failure. At the
moment we are in the worst of all possible worlds: we have a system
where we need to allow new entrants to come into the space, but a large
semi-state-owned dinosaur is taking up a lot of market share. It would
be better for that to be restructured effectively within the private
sector.</hs_Para>

argument today is that the Government need to get out of the banking
business as quickly as possible. It is not the role of government to be
setting the compensation of every banker in this country. The
Government must set the framework and the regulation, but this level of
micromanagement is a function—a symptom—of the terrible
inheritance that we received. By getting out, we must recognise that we
will reform the banking sector for our children and our grandchildren.
It will mean that those banks will then restructure within the private
sector, and the socialists will never be able to get their hands back

outside Northern Rock and the chaos that was created, and default would
have been a disaster, for not only the British economy, but for the
wider global economy. Confidence would have completely collapsed in the
banking sector and we would have seen a run on all major high street
banks. The alternatives to Labour’s action would have been

poorest areas were charged to get cash out of machines. The previous

East is renowned for being a wonderful seaside tourist resort. What is
less well known is that it is also a thriving business community. Many
financial services organisations choose to use this corner of Dorset to
base not only significant operations, but their headquarters. They

UK, RIAS Insurance, Barclays and that giant US bank, JP
Morgan<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:14:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Whether
such financial institutions are based in Bournemouth or London, they

finance. The firms that invariably choose Britain in which to
do their transactions cover a range of services,
including insurance, accountancy, shipping, legal services, hedge

to a financial system that we can trust. I urge Members to be careful
when they call for increased levies against banks or random caps on

in Bournemouth are not rolling in money; they are not millionaires.
They are hard-working individuals who will not get the huge bonuses
that have been spoken about in this place. In today’s global,
technological, 24/7 economy, it is simple for a firm to relocate to
another part of the world. That would mean losing UK jobs, taxes and,
most importantly, influence over the regulations. It is important that
we exert a modicum of control when we have this debate. We do not want
the hysteria that we saw in the interventions at the beginning of this
debate.</hs_Para>

the less, I do not dismiss the seismic failure and irresponsible
behaviour of part of the banking industry. Indeed, it is the failure of
our banking system that has caused the biggest economic downturn in
this country. We saw banks lend funds that they did not have to people
who could not afford them and in ways that they did not understand. The
banking system failed because it was not properly regulated. First, the
Bank of England was stripped of its responsibility for keeping the
banking system safe. Secondly, the Financial Services Authority was
focused only on compliance and individual rules and so missed the
bigger picture. Finally, there was failure at the Treasury, where the
banking division was run down. As a result, the total debt reached five
times the size of the entire economy; 10% of the entire wealth of this
country was lost and hundreds of thousands of people lost their jobs
and livelihoods.</hs_Para>

know that other Members want to speak, so let me say in conclusion that
the Government have acted to transform the banking industry through
four key areas of reform. The first area is supervision. The Bank of
England is back at the centre of the supervisory regime, with new
powers to identify and address risks to ensure that banks do not
threaten our economy in the future. The second area is structure, with
new laws to separate the branch on the high street from the trading
floor and therefore protect customers. The third area of reform deals
with the cultural perspective by imposing higher standards of conduct
on the banking industry and recognising the reckless misconduct that
leads to bank failure. The final area is competition, which empowers
customers and gives them the greatest choice. That should incentivise
innovation and competition in the banking
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:20:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000043">Our

manufacturing industry. About 20% of the economy in my constituency is
based on manufacturing, as is about 10% of our national economy, but
only 2.6% of the stock of bank debt is spent on manufacturing. It is
absolutely clear that the banking system in this country does not

Britain. We have a Government who are committed to supporting a banking

1980s, when we had an economic sector that relied not just on banks but
on organisations called building societies. Building societies were

born, the Northern Rock building society was where my relatives put

centralisation of the banking and building society economy happened as
a consequence of the demutualisation and privatisations of the late
1980s. More and more financial power was concentrated in the City of
London, away from local communities. Banking and building societies
became completely divorced from the communities that they represented.
As a consequence, we have the obscenity of bankers’ salaries
being paid by such organisations. The chief executives of RBS, which
has taken over the Halifax building society, and of the Lloyds Banking
Group are paid £5.8 million a year with all the bonuses they
receive. Those figures are from the end of 2010. Such salaries are out
of step not only with the experience of the poorer people in our
communities but with that of the middle classes. They are out of step
with the people who become police officers or teachers for
£20,000 a year, and with the local businesses that need

economic system. We must remember that our Chancellor told us in 2010
that that economic system would clear the deficit by 2015. He has

for Spelthorne (Kwasi Kwarteng), who is a banker, probably does not
know anything about the Sparkassen system, because it supports
manufacturing industry. If he learns anything from this debate, it
should be that the important point is that banks under that system are
geographically restricted, which means that they must invest in their
local community. Germans choose to invest in Sparkassen—20% of
people in each region invest in their Sparkassen, which then invests in
its local economy to provide jobs for young people. It is not divorced

successful during the industrial revolution, when local banks supported
local investment. We must go back to building societies, which even the
Business Secretary has said were an important driver of the economy in
the 1930s. Unfortunately, we have a Government who are not creating

The funding for lending scheme has made only a marginal difference to
lending to businesses. In November last year, we saw the biggest drop
in business lending for more than two years—more than five times
the average monthly drop. I accept that the fall is effected
disproportionately by a fall in lending to large businesses, but it
reveals a worrying approach to business lending, despite the general
optimism in other parts of the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000059">I
therefore want to focus on one area for the remainder of my remarks. I
recognise the importance of small businesses to the growth of jobs and
to the well-being of our nation. Small businesses are crucial to our
future prosperity, and the financing of those enterprises is a major
issue that we need to get right. They employ  more than 14
million people and generate more than £1,500 billion
for our economy. Problems with access to finance are indicative of
broader difficulties in the economy and have serious consequences, as I
know from the businesses in my

people argue that there is no problem with bank lending to small
businesses and that the present issue is one of a lack of demand.
Perhaps some small businesses are not seeking credit to invest and have
constraints on their ambitions to grow. Perhaps a number of small
businesses have generated cash surpluses that are available for
investment, as confidence continues to grow stronger. The Treasury
estimates that amount of money at more than £500
billion.</hs_Para>

for lending scheme has, however, failed to meet the aspirations that we
were promised it would
instigate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:34:24"></hs_TimeCode>. I
welcome the decision of the Governor of the Bank of England to make
business lending the sole beneficiary of the scheme, rather than using
it for all loans. Plainly, he feels that more needs to be done in this
area, but the position seems fairly clear: funding for lending has made
a difference for individuals, but not for small businesses. The
Federation of Small Business has argued that many small businesses have
been affected by a lack of access to financial support during the
recovery and have relied on non-bank lenders to keep them afloat, and
that simply is not good
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000062">I
agree with the Government that business investment needs to increase.
The Treasury estimates that a 10% increase in business
investment in 2012 would have stimulated gross domestic product by a
further £12 billion —almost one
percentage point in 2012, when I was calling for more lending. Cash
balances in the non-financial sector have grown by £104 billion
above the pre-crisis level. Work is needed to translate improved
business confidence into investment. Indeed, business investment is
more than 25% below its pre-crisis peak. That is not a salutary figure,
when we rely on small and medium-sized business to provide the growth
and to generate the wealth that we

increase productivity in our businesses. There is an environment of
relatively stable prices and improving confidence, but we need to

more jobs, high productivity and improved living standards, so small
businesses must have priority. The banks have failed to give them that

some evidence of that. Ministers have boasted today that they have cut
bonuses by 60%, or whatever it is, over the last few years, but we have
not seen a flight of capital from the UK or a flight of banking
business to Singapore or elsewhere. They cannot argue that they are
restricting the ability of banks to pay bonuses while claiming that if
we do that the banks will leave the country. There has been no evidence
that banks cannot recruit or retain people or get the best people,

<?notus-xml column=887?>the fact that the Government have said that they have restricted
bonuses. The question is often asked: what is an appropriate level of
bonus? We have not had an answer.</hs_Para>

some view on this, but we have not heard it. That is why this debate on
bonuses is important. We cannot have a state-run bank where bonuses of
up to 600% are being given but the Government seem to have no view on
it, whereas they do hold the view that public sector workers on
£14,000 a year should not get a 1% increase. That is why it is

second issue that I want to deal with is competition, which is
particularly pertinent to Northern Ireland. As we are sitting here
today, the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee is considering the
banking structure in Northern Ireland where we have a particular
problem because 67% of the market is served by banks such as Ulster
bank, which is part of RBS, the Bank of Ireland and the First Trust
bank, both of which had to be bailed out by the Irish Government. All
those banks find that their lending ability is hugely impaired by the
bad loans and the bad decisions that were made during the property boom
in Northern Ireland, and now they are trying to consolidate their
balance sheets. Lack of competition is one reason why from 2010 until
now lending to businesses in Northern Ireland has fallen by 12.5%.
During the last year, it fell by 5%, even at a time of growth when one
would expect businesses to need to obtain further finance.</hs_Para>

Tomlinson report did not really cover Northern Ireland, but the
excesses that it identified are to be found to an even greater degree
there. Constituents regularly come to me about property loans and the
first question I ask is whether they stopped paying the loans, but they
were servicing their loans and paying the interest, and in some
instances they were even paying down the capital, but their bank
deliberately changed the rules and withdrew the facility, sometimes on
a technicality, and sometimes on a technicality contrived by the banks.
The loans were called in, and when the properties could not be sold,
Ulster bank rode to the rescue and offered to put them on the West
Register and buy them at a deflated price, even though there was an
income stream and, had it waited long enough, the property market would
have picked up some of the difference. The result is that many viable
businesses have been sent to the wall by the actions of the banks
seeking to repair their balance sheet at the expense of the real
economy. The businesses then had to put people out of work because they
were declared bankrupt.

these Opposition day debates about business and financial issues,
whether they be on energy, gambling or banking. The Labour party makes
a mess of things in government, realises there is a problem when it is

us look at some of the issues, the first of which is competition. I
checked this morning and right now 55 different companies are offering
current accounts; there are even 11 different types of account. It is
now so competitive that many banks are paying people to have current
accounts. Therefore there is a real question as to how restricted the
competition is. A quarter of people already do not bank with the big
four, and TSB has just been demerged to form a new high street bank.
But high street banks are only part of the story. It is not in the
motion, but we see from the press that the Labour party will try to
force banks to demerge their branches. In fact, a lot of banking is not
done that way at all. I have not had a bricks and mortar branch, for
business or personal reasons, since 1989, when I took out the First

I want to speak about some of my constituents’ experiences with
the banks, particularly in relation to small business lending. The
banks’ behaviour changed overnight when the global financial
crisis hit, as a number of businesses in my constituency have made
clear to me. They had been repaying loans for years and had never
missed a payment, but suddenly the banks called in the
loans—the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:55:57"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) made this same

but only because we were able to bail ourselves out by using personal
savings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000089">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:56:25"></hs_TimeCode>
problem today is that the banks are still not lending to small
businesses. Most of the 4.7 million small business—those with
fewer than 10 members of staff—that I meet are unable to borrow
money from the banks. They will not lend to them, whether they are the
high-tech growth businesses trying to develop the products we need to
develop our export industry or the mainstays of our
communities—the service firms that support local communities up
and down the country. The banks are not lending, whether the companies
have a good track record or a good business plan.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:57:03"></hs_TimeCode> seems that
the only firms that the banks are lending to—and even here we
are seeing some problems—are the larger ones, the medium-sized
companies that have significant assets against which they can borrow.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:57:20"></hs_TimeCode> am afraid that
the cost of living crisis, which is hitting many ordinary people in
this country, is also hitting those who own or run small firms. It is
just as bad for small businesses as it is for everybody else. The banks

hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas) mentioned the German
system and how he would like to introduce something similar here, and I
agree. Having met representatives of the Sparkassen, I must say that
they have a lot to teach us. They know their customers, are based in
the regions where they lend, understand the local economy and can lend
only in that area. We could also learn something about bonus culture
from the Germany system, because its regional banks’
remuneration is linked to the financial success of the economic area in
which they lend. It is not something that we could introduce here
directly, but we could certainly learn something about having a bonus
culture that is manageable, proportionate, fair and based on success,
and the right kind of success, rather than how much the banks lend. The
banks in Germany are set up to produce jobs and growth and the banking
system is designed to support small businesses.</hs_Para>

of the interesting things I learnt from the Sparkassen is that rather
than us having to become better Germans, we should look at who created
the German regional banking system—it was this county, after the
second world war. We based it on the old stable and steady lending
criteria that we used to have in the old regional banks. We developed
the system in Germany using this country’s experience and
expertise. It is something that I am afraid we moved away from after
the big bang of the late
’80s<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T14:59:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000092">We
can learn from Germany, but there are good examples in this country
too, such as the Merseyside Special Investment Fund. It provides equity
and loan finance to small businesses in Merseyside, and it has been one
of the few sources of such support to businesses since the financial
crisis. Some of its customers switched to it having been turned down
for loans by their banks. People who were unable to borrow from the
banks have succeeded with MSIF. Indeed, local bank staff across
Merseyside sometimes refer customers to MSIF because their own computer
says no, so even they understand the problem. It is important to
distinguish between banking executives and those who get large bonuses
and the ordinary bank staff who do a great job up and down the country,
day in, day out, in serving their customers in the retail
sector—personal and business

about how to lend. It does not just lend money but gives advice and
management support. It understands the local economy and aims to
support jobs and growth. It is not a bank, but it performs many of the
functions of banks and is filling the gaps left by the banks. It shows
what can be done in this country in just the way that the Sparkassen do
in Germany. Those are two examples that we can learn from in supporting
small businesses.

is absolutely right that we in this House should be talking about small
businesses and the challenges they face in trying to get credit and
loans. I represent a borough that is almost exclusively dependent on
small businesses from an economic point of view. Obviously we have
Heathrow airport, but small businesses are the predominant employers.
Banks today are perhaps more reluctant to lend to small businesses than
they were 10 years ago. Small businesses that need to have
loans approved are much more likely to feel confident in a less
centralised structure. They are happier dealing with loan officers they
have known for a long time and if they have good local relationships.
That gives them a lot more confidence than some of the computerised and
centralised forms of banking that we have seen. In Spelthorne, lots of
small businesses use export finance. Because of the proximity of the
airport, they are reliant on foreign trade to do their business. Credit
lines are very important for those sorts of businesses.</hs_Para>

suggest—perhaps this will find less agreement around the

policy makers are saying, “We want your bank to lend more
money”, at a time when capital requirements are higher. It does
not take a very sophisticated appreciation of finance—I was
about to say that it does not take the brains of an archbishop, which
is very relevant in a debate on finance—to realise that it is
very difficult for a bank to extend its balance sheet while increasing
its capital. If we look at it as a pantomime horse, the two ends of the
horse are pulling in different directions in being asked to raise
capital and to lend money at the same time. That is a difficult
balancing

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:06:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman) said,
banks’ leverage ratios were remarkably stable from the end of
the second world war and going into the 1950s, right up until 2000. It
was only after the turn of the century that we saw the almost frenzied
credit expansion that made us so vulnerable in the final denouement
when Lehman Brothers collapsed and the crash happened. Labour Members
have suggested that many causes of the financial crisis extend back to 
<?notus-xml column=893?>the 1980s, with big bang and all the rest of it. In terms of leverage
ratios, though, the serious risk in the system developed relatively
recently, for lots of different reasons. Labour Members would suggest
that a culture of deregulation brought in by Margaret Thatcher was
responsible for some of the recklessness in the system, whereas
Government Members would suggest that it was due to some of the reforms
in 1997, particularly with regard to the Bank of England’s
supervisory role.</hs_Para>

quite content to see vast bonuses and big salaries extended across the

using a lot of those tax revenues for Government spending. There was a
symbiosis in which we were all somehow complicit. I find it interesting
that Labour Members suggest we cap bonuses, because they will remember

such vast sums to the Exchequer, which it used—more than used,

last point concerns the control of the money supply. The banks have, in
effect, seized control of the money supply. They have become major
generators of unsustainable asset bubbles, which is a source of great
instability to the economy and of enormous cost to the taxpayer. They
control 97% of domestic credit creation and have used their virtual
monopoly over it to feed successive property booms and speculative
foreign ventures while allocating—this is the key

payments on traded goods is currently running at a deficit of more than
£100 billion every year, which is frankly unsustainable; and

over the past six months—one in Gateshead on 6 June and the
other in London in December—and they were attended by in excess
of 350 people from various organisations, banks, accountancy firms and
start-ups. It was very striking that, contrary to what

designed to create greater ease for new entrants to enter the market

the Member for Redcar (Ian Swales) has made clear, there is great scope

of us should support our credit unions. I am certainly
wholeheartedly  
<?notus-xml column=897?>behind the Northumberland credit union. We must acknowledge that even
though this Government have done more to give credit unions greater
clout, power and ability to lend, credit unions are still incapable of

only way forward is the creation of local community banks built on a
credit union. I can give the House at least three examples. I have
already mentioned the bank in Salford, which is the former Salford
credit union. The Glasgow credit union is probably the biggest and most
successful in the country: it is effectively a bank in all but name.
Finally, I have the Prince Bishops community bank in Durham, which is
the former Stanley credit union. All are very successful and have great
potential. We need to follow such
examples<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000128">To
touch briefly on the Church, I welcome the fact that Justin Welby is
the new Archbishop of Canterbury. It is savage irony that 500 years
have had to pass for us to have the new type of God’s banker,
who is encouraging the Church to become involved in banking. It can
only be good if the clergy move from being reactive to poverty and
social deprivation—to their great credit, they are amazingly
good at reacting in that way—to being
proactive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000129">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:24:13"></hs_TimeCode>
suggest that the Church has a role, acting with their credit unions and
local community banks, effectively to become the offshoots and outlets
of those community banks. After all, all the vicars that we, as
constituency MPs, know and deal with know which people are in great
social deprivation, going to the food bank or having problems with
high-cost credit and need debt advice. There is massive scope for the
Church to take a greater
role<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:24:34"></hs_TimeCode> by
dovetailing churches with credit unions and community banks. I welcome
the fact that the Church has chosen to buy branches of Williams and
Glyn’s bank, and is setting something up so that we can go
forward. If we can do that and become more proactive in our local
communities, a huge amount can be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:24:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000130">In

communities a bank that we can trust, with a proper brand name and
identity, and one that is part of the community, rather than something
based in London or Frankfurt and completely divorced from that
community. That is the problem that we all face and have identified

second question that Ministers need to answer is where is their plan
for rebalancing the economy. Given the way in which they have acted in

is for the City. Do they just want to reflate it all over again? Are we
back to Tory economics as usual—the so-called FIRE economy of
finance, insurance and real estate—leaving us open to the same
worries that we faced in the past? Let the City of London rip and never

way to deal with the risks that we face is to consider proposals for

banks into retail and investment arms if necessary. We need to keep our

are earned by people in the City of London. They do not feel that it is
in the best interests of this country to have such a concentration of
high earners. That creates risks for which they pay the price. The cuts

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:33:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Redcar (Ian Swales) suggested that there was a pattern to these
debates. The pattern I am increasingly seeing is rather like the
schoolchild saying to the teacher, “I didn’t do my
homework today because he didn’t do his homework
yesterday.” The answer to virtually everything in the Financial
Secretary’s opening
speech<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:34:13"></hs_TimeCode> seemed to
be, “If Labour didn’t do it in 13 years, that lets us off
the hook.” Regardless of whether his accusations about what the
Labour Government did or did not do are 
<?notus-xml column=900?>accurate, for the Government to say, “Well, we don’t have
to bother” is not the answer. There were other aspects of the
Minister’s opening speech that I really have to pick up on for
the record.</hs_Para>

Minister gave the impression that under the previous Labour Government
income inequality mushroomed as never before. By saying something
confidently enough, he hopes that nobody will ever question it, but
what actually did happen? Using the Gini coefficient, the recognised
measure, there was indeed an increase in inequality from 37 to 40 from
1997 to 2009. I am not happy about that—I would have preferred
the Labour Government to have done more to close the inequality
gap—but the real mushrooming of income inequality was from 1979
to 1997, when it sprang up from 26—a low number, which means
there was less inequality—to 37. The Labour Government did not
turn it around, despite several measures to help those at the lower
income level—for example, addressing pensioner poverty, which
most people recognise was done—but it is simply not correct to
convey the impression that our record on inequality was particularly
bad.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011574000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0002.htm#14011574000146">I
represent a constituency in a city where the financial services
industry is particularly important. In the last census, the industry
accounted for 11% of all employment in the city. Many of my
constituents work at some level in the financial services industry. I
was talking to a constituent recently about the bonus culture. In his
field of work, bonuses historically formed a substantial part of
earnings. They were expected and taken for granted. However, they were
deemed to be increasingly unfair to groups of employees who did not
have the opportunity to earn them. After much negotiation, the solution
was to modernise pay by ending the award of bonuses. My constituent
lost £7,000 a year in that process, which was nearly a quarter
of his previous annual earnings.</hs_Para>

am sure that everyone will have grasped that my constituent does not
work in the financial services industry. He is not a banker; he is a
joiner who works for the council’s building services department.
A bonus that is paid every week or every year, with little or no
reference to performance, was, it was argued in the negotiation
process, a distortion of earnings. Why is that argument not applicable
to the banking sector? My constituent claims that morale has been
affected by the changes—turnover and sick leave have
increased—but that made no difference to the view that was taken
on the bonus culture.</hs_Para>

it matter to a country if there are vast differences in income and

envy. We risk increasing social disconnect in our society. People feel
that nothing changes. As politicians, we spend a lot of time being
angsting about why people engage less with politics and why, when we go
to their doors, they say to us, “You’re all the same.
Nothing ever changes. My life never changes. It’s not worth my

rich and I’ll still be the same as I am.” We worry about
how we can do something about that.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:39:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hexham (Guy Opperman) spoke about banking for the less well-off.
Increasingly, and for all sorts of reasons, we would like those who are
less well-off to be banked. For example, those paying for energy bills
through PayPoint usually end up paying an extra charge on top of their
bill, so that the poorest people without bank accounts pay the most. We
want people to be banked so that they can get employment—it is
often a prerequisite because money needs to be paid into a bank
account—and so that they can receive their benefits
payments.</hs_Para>

previous Government took up the question of the unbanked, through the
introduction of basic bank accounts and putting pressure on banks to do
something about it. It was their intention to make it compulsory for
banks to offer basic bank accounts, but the incoming coalition
Government chose specifically not to go ahead with them, and now only
one of the major banks offers basic banks accounts; all the others have
stopped. This is important if people are to have the widest possible
choice, and much as I support the credit unions in my area and much as
I think they have a valuable role to play, they are in their present
incarnation—and will remain so without a lot more
investment—very far from being able to substitute for proper
basic bank accounts and provide for the least well-off. Banks need to
do something about that. It is another important aspect of what they
should be doing for the country.</hs_Para>

hoped he might have been able to throw some light on the debate, rather
than simply trying to bolster his reputation as the Tories’

contraction in lending to business—the biggest drop in more than
two years and nearly five times the recent average monthly decline of
£1 billion. That follows the decreases in lending in the UK by
3% each year since the start of the financial crisis amidst the failure

SMEs. Time after time, however, we have heard that small businesses in
every constituency have been unable to access credit because of the
lack of availability of loans and that the terms on which credit was

Question Time today the Prime Minister suggested that he did not want
the overall cost to increase, but that failed to take account of the
public’s concern about the fact that individuals in the banking
sector who are already highly paid are able to receive bonuses
amounting to twice their annual salaries.</hs_Para>

actually paid in bankers’ bonuses. Perhaps they have noticed

has to be pointed out that it has been estimated that City bonuses in
2012-13 were more than 85% lower than at their peak in 2007-08. I know
there is genuine concern about bank bonuses encouraging short-term
high-risk behaviour, but it is not just the amount that matters; it is
also the structure of the bonuses. There is a difference between cash
bonuses and bonuses paid in shares with the opportunity for clawback if
there is bad 
<?notus-xml column=906?>behaviour or a need to rebuild regulatory
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T15:58:40"></hs_TimeCode>. Under
the PRA remuneration code, large parts of bonuses must be deferred and
paid in shares, aligning the interests of the employee with the
long-term interests of the bank. The implication of many of
today’s comments is that there is a concern about total
remuneration, yet the motion and everything we have heard from the
Labour Front Bench is about only one part of remuneration: bonuses. The
reality is that the European directive and the policy pursued by Labour
will drive up salaries. It is not clear why the Opposition are
interested in only one aspect of remuneration, and we have certainly
not had an explanation of that. It is also worth pointing out that the
Governor of the Bank of England was critical of a cap in his evidence

am pleased that Labour appears to support the virtues of competition,
but that was not its record in government. There were 10 banks in 1997,
but that figure reduced over the following 13 years. The Cruickshank
report, produced in 2000, was supposed to encourage more competition,
but it was blocked by the Treasury and nothing was done. Our record has
involved a much greater focus on competition, and it is a primary
objective of the Financial Conduct Authority and a secondary objective
of the Prudential Regulation Authority. We have a payment systems
regulator, which makes things easier for small businesses, and we have
changed the application process to make it much more proportionate for
new businesses. Furthermore, the regulators indicate that 22 new banks

workers on zero-hours contracts, record numbers of people who want to
work full time having to work part time, and wages failing to keep up
with prices. The average worker is now £1,600 a year worse off
and the number of people being paid less than the living wage is up
from 3.6 million in 2010 to more than 5 million today. The value of the
minimum wage has fallen by 5% over the past three and a half years. For
a full-time worker that means a real-terms pay cut of £13 a

Members know that a strengthened minimum wage and practical policies to
promote the living wage are essential to building a recovery that works
for working people and to securing rising standards of living for the
future. That means stronger penalties and effective enforcement against
rogue employers who flout the minimum wage. It means plans to restore
the value of the minimum wage, which has been lost over the past three
and a half years. It means the Government doing their bit to support
the campaign for a living wage by setting an example with their own
employees and contracts, as Labour councils are doing up and down this
country, and it means the Government sharing the savings to the
Treasury with employers who commit to paying the living wage, as we

It was opposed by the Tories every step of the way, while their

the minimum wage, why we cannot trust the Tories to enforce or

past sins, so be it, but I must warn him and his Government that we

me start with the very basics. It is a little difficult to do so in the
face of the relentless tribalism that we have just heard, but I would
say at the outset that the introduction of the national minimum wage
was a real achievement of the previous Government. There were not many
achievements, but two will stand the test of time: the establishment of
the independent Bank of England and the establishment of the national
minimum wage. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Indeed, there were

that, I attempted to be constructive about the motion, but one
blindingly obvious point is that the centrepiece of the national
minimum wage legislation—the establishment of a non-partisan,
non-political Low Pay Commission—did not even merit a mention.
The shadow Secretary of State referred to it only in response to an
intervention. That is rather important, because it suggests one of two
things. The first possibility is that Labour Members do not understand
how their own system works. Indeed, I heard a Labour Member cry out
earlier, “Why don’t you make it increase the minimum
wage?”, so there are clearly people who do not understand the
mechanism. The second possibility is that Labour Members do not respect
the basis of the system, which is independent advice from a
non-partisan body. That advice has been followed consistently by
successive Secretaries of State, including my Labour predecessors. That
is the strength of the system and that is why there is political
consensus behind
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:50:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T16:50:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0003.htm#14011593000101"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="14011593001617" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0003.htm#14011593001617">Several

legitimate issues were raised about why there was no regional

endorsed the principle of the national minimum wage. However, there is
a perfectly respectable argument for regional variation. As I
understand it, the Labour party now promotes the living wage, at the
heart of which is the idea that there should be regional differentials,
with people in London being paid more and people in the west country or
the north of England being paid relatively less. There is an argument
for that. Why criticise people who have put forward that idea in good

for the Conservatives, although I do not always speak in their defence,
I think that they should get credit for accepting that there is a good

Although I and my party have supported the national minimum wage, there
is a perfectly respectable intellectual and moral argument for not
having a minimum wage. Countries that do not have a minimum wage
include 
<?notus-xml column=923?>Sweden, Finland, Norway, Denmark and Austria. Those countries are all in
the social democratic tradition, but have felt that it is too
problematic. Germany, which has had either social democratic or
national unity Governments for most of the post-war period, has adopted
a national minimum wage only in the last few weeks. In those countries,
where there are civilised values and a sense of solidarity, the costs
and benefits of the minimum wage have been debated properly. Why should
we criticise people in this country who wanted to have such a debate,

return to the thread of the argument, we have had a major shock, and it
has reduced real earnings and the real minimum wage. I fully
acknowledge that; it is a matter of fact. The question is: what is
being done to mitigate the effects? Two major changes have taken place.
First, the Government have recognised that earnings are not the same as
take-home pay and disposable income, and we have therefore concentrated
our tax policy on lifting low earners out of tax. As a result,
2.7 million low earners now pay no income tax. Those working
28 hours a week on the minimum wage pay no income tax, while those on
35 hours pay only one third of the income tax they paid at the
beginning of this 
<?notus-xml column=926?>Government. We have therefore considerably reduced the impact of the
squeeze on real incomes by using tax policy.</hs_Para>

second highly relevant issue is the level of unemployment. After the
great crash in 1929, unemployment rose to 20%. In the recent financial
crisis, countries less affected than the UK have had considerably
higher unemployment—I am talking about France and Sweden, among
others. We reached a peak of 8.5%; it has now gone down to 7% and is
falling. We have record numbers of people in work, while the number of
jobs has increased by 1.3 million, in the wake of this enormous
economic crisis. Now, why has that happened? It has happened because
millions of individual workers, realising that there is a choice to be
made between jobs and pay, have wisely decided that it is much more
important to keep the employment.</hs_Para>

is a deep issue that confronts us as a nation. He is right in his
analysis, and many workers have chosen not to push for pay rises in the
light of that situation. The challenge facing us, however, is surely
one that requires a political response. I disagree slightly with his
characterisation of this Government’s policy. What it has

the Secretary of State an example. The Low Pay Commission recommended
against amending section 31(1)(b) of the minimum wage regulations,
which allowed employers to pay hospitality workers out of their tips.
The last Government took the courageous step of changing that provision
and preventing that from happening. 
<?notus-xml column=927?>That is a good example of where politics looks to the good of the
individual and does not play to what I believe are the prejudices and
fears of people in the Low Pay Commission. Is it not also true that if

right, although I have seen an analysis suggesting that, because of the
effect on corporate taxation, which offsets those gains, he is not.
However, on the more substantive point about politicians intervening to
override the Low Pay Commission, I believe that we should not be
dogmatic about it. In the overriding majority of cases, it behoves the
Secretary of State to listen carefully to the Low Pay Commission and it
would be unusual to override it. He cites one case, and I have actually
overridden the Low Pay Commission—on the apprenticeship wage,
which I thought was excessively low, giving the wrong signal to young
people and others who wanted to do apprenticeships. I made a decision
on that specific issue to intervene and disregard the advice of the Low
Pay Commission. If that became a habit, however, and if its advice were
overridden on a major issue of pay policy, the minimum wage structure
would crumble from being politicised in that
way.</hs_Para>

based on serious analysis. Let me quote a good study carried out by the

of the poorest in society, that creates demand, which in turn creates
jobs. The corollary of that is that the higher the minimum wage, the
more money is put in people’s pockets and the more it
circulates, and we return to a system, as in the 1950s, when inequality
is reduced, rather than the situation now, when inequality is

independence. I have said the Government want a faster increase in the
minimum wage, reflecting the fact we now have a real recovery, and in
order to achieve that the LPC should look at a wider range of factors
governing low pay. They include the fact that at the national economy
level, the Governor of the Bank of England has now said that if
unemployment falls to 7%, he would want there to be some tightening of
monetary policy, as the environment will have changed. We would want to
see what impact that will have on the cost of employment, which has
been cushioned by the Chancellor’s decision to bring in the
employment allowance—£2,000 for the first
employee—as it significantly changes the cost of employment. We
also need to look at the impact it would have on the Government,
because there is an interaction with tax credits, tax yields and
corporate taxation. There is the impact on take-home pay, too, and
therefore we have to factor in our tax
policy.</hs_Para>

confidence that if they complain, those complaints will be followed
through. There are several levels as enforcement is a complicated
process. First, it is a problem of securing arrears and then imposing
fines. We then have a name and shame system, and ultimately there is
prosecution in court, but that has hardly been used either under the
last Government or this one because it requires a demonstration of
proof of intent, which is very difficult to demonstrate.</hs_Para>

me explain how these various levels are now operating. In the last
year, arrears of about £4 million were paid, compared with an
average of about £3 million over recent years. About
26,000 workers benefited from that. Fines are crucial, because under
the last Government and this one, that is where the main enforcement
action has been taken. Last year 700 enforcement cases were taken to
the level of fines. The amount paid was seven times as much as was paid
under the last year of the Labour Government. One can argue about this
from one year to another, and these things fluctuate, but any
suggestion that the regime has become easier is simply not

existence of a national minimum wage is a major statement about the
kind of country that we are. Beyond the clichés about
hard-working families, what does hard work actually involve? Are we
prepared to be citizens and representatives in a country where too many
mothers ship their children from one childminder to another, often late
at night and very early in the morning, because they work for employers
who do not honour their statutory obligation to pay the national
minimum wage?
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:22:29"></hs_TimeCode>This is about
decency, and if the Government are serious about the enforcement and

am proud to have been part of the Government who introduced the
national minimum wage, and I hope that that progressive change has now
become irreversible. Over its lifetime, one of its most powerful
effects has been to start to close the gender pay gap. It stood at more
than 16% when the national minimum wage was introduced in 1999; its
present level of 9.2% is still unacceptable. The greatest burden
resulting from the lack of growth in the economy and from the
Government’s tax and benefit changes has been borne by women.
Women’s employment is also concentrated in poorly paid
occupational groups that include care, cleaning and catering. Whatever
low pay threshold is used, the proportion of working women who are
low-paid is about twice that of working men on low pay.</hs_Para>

need for enforcement of the national minimum wage goes without saying,
and the failure to enforce it is a stain on the stated ambition of the
Government. 
<?notus-xml column=932?>I commend the next stage of the ambition, which is to move
towards a living wage. I pay tribute to Citizens UK and, in particular,
to London Citizens, which have been at the forefront of introducing the
living wage since 2005—so much so that 214 London employers and
12 London councils have now signed up to pay it.</hs_Para>

more people being in better-paid jobs; and the practical benefits that
businesses that pay the living wage report, such as more corporate
resilience and social purpose, reduced absentee rates, greater loyalty

living wage is good for their business; this is about the

for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves), who opened this debate, is right about
one thing: it was a mistake for my party to have opposed the minimum
wage. I am glad that we support it now. If we are honest about our
mistakes, the Opposition need to be honest about what went on: that it
was a mistake to abolish the 10p income tax rate; that median real
wages stopped rising from 2003; and that the value of the minimum wage
did not decrease from 2010 but from 2008. All of us have made mistakes
in these areas, and the Opposition should have welcomed the fact that

relentless focus on helping the lower paid. We should support the
minimum wage because we are the party of aspiration and working people,
and increasing the minimum wage eliminates the poverty trap, cuts the
benefits bill and encourages more people to get back into work. If we

it is important to support a fair wage, we must not hurt small
businesses—the Secretary of State was exactly right on that. We
should move towards a living wage, but there are ways of doing it. The
important thing is to put the burden on government to achieve the
living wage, not on businesses. I support the minimum wage and the
living wage, but we have to make sure that they are not raised to
unsustainable levels. Labour’s solution of offering companies
tax breaks if they pay employees the living wage for a year is said
with the best of intentions, but it has flaws because it does not fully
offset the cost. Many companies would still be unable to meet the
additional cost of paying their workers an extra £2 an hour. It
would also only last a year, so many people would not benefit in the
long
term<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:29:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0003.htm#14011593000192">We
should remember that 5 million low earners in Britain are earning less
than £10,000 a year. To achieve the living wage, we need to look
at two ends of the equation. First, we could reintroduce the 10p income
tax band. That would halve the income tax bill for those on the minimum
wage and significantly reduce the cash gap between the minimum wage and
the living wage. It would also cost less than raising the personal
allowance, and ensure that people continue to pay into the system while
letting them keep more of their own money. Alternatively, we could
continue raising the threshold of income tax. Those are the ways to get
people up to a living
wage<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T17:30:44"></hs_TimeCode>, and I am

insurance is the one tax that is still taken directly out of lower
earners’ pay packets. A worker who earns around £7,500,
which is around half of what the Government say they need to live on,
still pays national insurance. We should take a small step to help the
lower paid by increasing the national insurance threshold, so that it
is in line with income tax for employees. The 2020 Tax Commission found
that nearly three-quarters of company bosses said that national
insurance contributions curbed the rates they paid their
staff.</hs_Para>

idea of a national minimum wage and it took almost 100 years to deliver
it. Incidentally, he also proposed devolution for Wales, Ireland and
Scotland and reform of the House of Lords. Both of those were
introduced after Labour’s historic win in 1997.</hs_Para>

recognise that its employees are creating not only wealth for the chief
executive but wealth and security for themselves and for the country. I

with the minimum wage in the 1960s and had the productivity gains been

the number of jobs on offer at £1 an hour or less. It had a

amount of resources available for its enforcement. That is utterly
disgraceful, because the consequence of the freeze is to make it that

to ensure that the national minimum wage is enforced, that appropriate
penalties are imposed on recalcitrant employers and that we can move
rapidly towards a living wage to bring all citizens up to a
decent standard of living. We owe that to the people of this

owe a debt of thanks to those hon. Members who passed the minimum wage
in 1997. It was, indeed, a great achievement for the Labour

agencies charging workers £2.50 a week for personal accident
insurance, which they buy for pennies and then sell on at a profit to
the worker, when of course the worker is already protected by the
employer’s liability insurance. It is another way of bringing
down the employer’s premium and scamming the workers.</hs_Para>

Standards Inspectorate to come to Corby to investigate the 32 agencies

3,000 local workers. Two of the investigations have been completed, and
penalty charges totalling £1,532 and wages totally £3,154
have been paid back to workers, but that is just the tip of the
iceberg. These are very small figures. The remaining 10 agencies have
an average of £12,000 to pay back to local workers, but for some
of the largest agencies—they are also national
agencies—operating in my area that figure will be up to
£40,000 or £50,000.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:23:29"></hs_TimeCode> two agencies

whether, in those cases, fines should have been imposed? We know that
they have breached the law. If in the other 10 cases we find even more
substantial breaches, as we surely will given the figures HMRC is
looking at, I hope we will impose fines. I welcome the move to increase

The cost of accommodation is now being deducted from seafarers’
wages. The sum deducted is currently £4.91 per day, or
£34.73 per week. On most ships that sail from our ports, seamen
work two weeks on, two weeks off, so that amounts to a deduction of
some £70. That is extraordinary. Do the seamen clock off and go
home on their own boats? Are dinghies attached to the boats? It is
ridiculous, and it is yet another way of undermining pay in the

the Member for North Tyneside (Mrs Glindon) about apprentices’
pay. Along with the UK Chamber of Shipping, the employers and the
unions—the RMT and Nautilus—we have embarked on a drive
to get young people back on to British ships as ratings. They can train
with a grant, and subsequently rise to officer level. We are trying to
encourage people to learn the skills of British seafaring so that we
can maintain the industry itself. Our efforts are not helped by some
recruitment practices, but at least we have a campaign going. Paying
people £2.68 an hour, even when they are apprentices, is not
acceptable. In the last few years, the apprenticeship 
<?notus-xml column=950?>rate has gone up by 18p. That is a derisory amount, and I do not think
that it can serve as an incentive for our young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:32:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0003.htm#14011593000310">We
want the national minimum wage regulations to be reviewed again.
Following a campaign by us, they were reviewed, and we were told that
the minimum wage would apply in British waters, but the Government then
redefined the concept of British waters, which became a narrow channel
consisting basically of the Norfolk Broads. That was about it. As a
result, employers were able to pay below the minimum wage, and also to
avoid some elements of the Equality Act. That is unacceptable in this
day and age. I urge the Government at least to consider enforcement
against that company, so that we can use it as an example to make clear
to other shipowners that we will not tolerate any more poverty pay on

hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) reminded us that in 1906
the Labour party was in favour of a national minimum wage. During the
92 years before we got one, the people who kept the light shining for
the campaign were members of the trade union movement, although I
should add that some union members were not in favour.</hs_Para>

the dark days of the 1980s and 1990s, the person who led the campaign
more than anyone else was Rodney Bickerstaffe, the leader of the
National Union of Public Employees and Unison. In 1997, I was proud to
sit with Rodney at the first Low Pay Commission hearings, where we gave
evidence about what should be done about the national minimum wage. The
union argued at the time that the level should be set at
£4.15 an hour, but unfortunately the Government of
the day, although they were doing the right thing in general, decided
to press for a level of £3.60.</hs_Para>

the Government had listened to the unions, we would not be having a
debate about the living wage, because if the minimum wage had been set
at £4.15 then, it would be a living wage now. That
would not only have been the right thing to do for people in work, but
it would have saved the billions of pounds in benefit that we have been
spending over the past 15 years to supplement the wages paid by
exploitative employers.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:34:45"></hs_TimeCode> could do a
lot worse than listen to what the unions are saying now.
Unison’s submission to the Low Pay Commission for this year

and foremost, the union makes the point that it is clear that the
national minimum wage has slipped behind, and we should move
progressively in stages towards having a living wage for all workers.
In particular we should make up the ground that has been lost, as the
Secretary of State acknowledged, of its being at least 5% behind the
retail prices index this year. The Government as well as the trade
unions should have that objective going
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:35:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:35:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0003.htm#14011593000315">The
subject of breaches of the legislation has been talked about on both
sides of the House. The unions are putting forward the case that there
should be a new formal complaints mechanism, meaning that if a trade
union, law centre or citizens advice bureau puts forward a formal
complaint on behalf of workers, that should 
<?notus-xml column=951?>be treated by HMRC as a formal complaint and must be investigated. That
should be supported, because those are the people on the ground with
direct contact with
workers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:35:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0003.htm#14011593000316">On
enforcement, the unions make the case clearly that instead of freezing

penalties, we welcome the increase and the fact that the penalties will
be for each worker not just per company, but I asked the Secretary of

continued.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0003.htm#14011593000318">The
right treatment for 18 to 20-year-old apprentices has always been
clearly argued for by the trade union movement. The differentiation
based on a person’s age is immoral. If somebody is good enough
to do the job, they are old enough to do the job and that principle
should be enshrined in law. If they are not doing the full job, then
differentiation is fair enough, but if they are doing the full job they
should be paid the full rate. The Secretary of State mentioned that
apprentices were getting a derisory 3p pay increase to £2.68. We
cannot buy a pint of beer in this place for £2.68—and
before somebody from the TaxPayers Alliance has a go at me about that I
will add that we all know that the beer here is subsidised. Apprentice
pay should be at least the development or the youth

Members on the Government Benches at the tail-end of this debate

then went on to give a very tribal response to the shadow Secretary of
State<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T18:38:39"></hs_TimeCode>. He also
said he was delighted to have laid regulations today to increase the
amount in fines that would be 
<?notus-xml column=952?>payable by employers if they did not abide by the national minimum wage

were laid only today yet the Prime Minister announced this policy back

However, the one thing that the Business Secretary has managed to

take away from the fact that the Liberal Democrats were against the
national minimum wage when they were campaigning in the run-up to the
1997 election. They supported it in the Chamber on Second and Third
Reading of the Bill, but that simply shows that they flip-flopped
between what they stated in their manifesto and what they did in the

more action from the Government on these issues, rather than the
restating of policies. When the Prime Minister, no less, announced the

money is given but how effective those enforcement agencies are with
the money that is given to them—a principle that Government

hon. Member for Blaydon talked about care workers. As my right hon.
Friend the Secretary of State said, the guidance on travelling time has
been updated. It is right that we should do more to get that guidance
out. I have been approached about it in my constituency office as the
Member of Parliament for Loughborough and we certainly need to
disseminate it

thank all Members for their contributions. I am aware that I have not

is fair to say that almost everyone who has spoken in the Chamber today
wants to achieve the same goals. We want to see those who receive the
minimum wage paid fairly and we want to see those who do not pay the
minimum wage treated harshly. I am sure all Members welcome
today’s announcement, mentioned by Government Members, that the
fines have been quadrupled from £5,000 to £20,000. As my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State said, we would also like to
increase those fines to £20,000 per worker, which will send a
clear message to employers who think that they can flout the minimum
wage regulations that that is not an option and that they need to pay a
fair wage for a fair day’s work.</hs_Para>

National Minimum Wage each year, despite the worst recession in living
memory, to protect the income of the low paid and increase their wages
relative to average earnings, and is cutting taxes for the low paid to
boost take home pay by £705 a year, taking 2.7 million out of
income tax altogether; welcomes increased employment under this
Government, which is at its highest ever level; notes that the
Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills has asked the
Low Pay Commission for an assessment of how it might achieve a higher
National Minimum Wage in the future without damaging employment;
further notes that the Government has maintained a central enforcement
body that covers all areas of the UK and ensures a consistent approach
and high quality service; and further notes that the Government is
quadrupling fines for employers in breach of paying the National
Minimum Wage and has already made it easier to name and shame employers
who flout the

pressures on acute hospitals have, without question, intensified over
the past couple of decades. There are now a third fewer general and
acute hospital beds than there were 25 years ago. The past decade alone
has seen a 37% increase in emergency admissions. An increasing number
of older patients are being admitted to hospital: 65% of admissions are
of people over the age of the 65. These patients are more likely to
present more complex and multiple comorbidities, and the increased
demand on acute care and the increased complexity of patients’
needs will have a knock-on effect, including placing greater demand on
hospital resources and increasing pressure on registered nurses,
doctors and other health care professionals. It will also, of course,
have an effect on patient care
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:24:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593001453" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0004.htm#14011593001453">I
intend to concentrate on the staffing levels of registered nurses.
Although much of the health debate has become obsessed with changing
and tweaking management tools for commissioners—for example, by
incentivising health systems with payment by results and more
sophisticated tariffs, creating new pathways of care and, as far as the
previous Government were concerned, wasting billions on fancy
information technology systems—front-line nurses are often run
ragged and overstretched on hospital
wards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593001454" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0004.htm#14011593001454">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-15T19:24:46"></hs_TimeCode>

on the risk of excess deaths, indicating that

As we will all be aware, the needs of patients can change not just
daily, but hourly—a patient can rapidly deteriorate—and
just having ticked a minimum-staffing box does not mean that the right
care is necessarily being applied. The lesson to learn from Mid Staffs
is that we followed the bureaucratic tick-box approach and that led to
failings in care, and that just ticking boxes saying we have done
something, however seductive or good it might sound, does not
necessarily mean that patients are being treated right. That is a

Poulter:</Member></B> As my hon. Friend will be aware, the CQC
inspection regime inspects all parts of hospitals. Good care in a
cardiac or intensive care unit is not 
<?notus-xml column=972?>necessarily about having one-on-one nursing; it is also about ensuring
that all the other additional supports and other parts of the
multidisciplinary team are in place to deliver high-quality care. That
is at the heart of what the Government are trying to do. I believe that
the CQC, looking not just at staffing levels but at wider
determinants—for example, using the NHS safety thermometer,
which looks at the issues my hon. Friend raised about
bedsores—and putting together a whole picture of what the care
at a trust is like, is well placed to make judgments. Part of the
CQC’s inspection regime entails full clinical involvement, so it
has become more of a peer-review process about what
“good” looks like from one hospital to another—an
important improvement in the quality of the inspection regime, which
enables it to weigh up staffing issues.</hs_Para>

Friend will be aware that we are going to support the CQC and provide
greater transparency throughout the health system—in regard to

boards will have a requirement specifically to look at their staffing

react to staffing issues as part of its wider inspection regime; there
will be a requirement on trust boards to look at them. On Christmas
day, I visited my local trust and found that staffing levels were
discussed on a daily basis, in direct response to improvements
following the Francis inquiry. I believe the same thing is taking place
in a number of hospital trusts throughout the country.</hs_Para>

cases where hospitals are under-staffed and there is an impact on the
quality of care provided, but these cases need to be addressed from a
whole-care perspective, in which staffing numbers form just one element
of a broader safety assessment. It is right that clinicians and trust
boards have the freedom to agree their own staff profiles, which should
not be dictated from Whitehall or by some blanket tick-box approach
saying “You have met the minimum staffing number; you are
therefore delivering good care”. We know from what happened at
Mid Staffs that that is not the case. We must do everything we can to
support good decisions made in the best interest of patients on the
ground. This approach will give trusts the flexibility to respond
swiftly to changes in patient demand or to meet the urgent needs of
patients who have deteriorated, ensuring that safety and quality care
is available.</hs_Para>

hope he will understand that no single dimension and no single tool can
ensure patient safety and that setting minimum staffing levels does not
necessarily ensure that patients get the best possible care. Patient
safety is not just about safe staffing; it is about listening to
patients, assessing their needs and staff taking action where there are
concerns. The number of staff—not just nurses, but doctors,
physiotherapists, health care assistants and all other important
members of a multidisciplinary team—needed to look after
patients in a cardiac intensive care unit will differ from the numbers
and skill mix required in a rehabilitation setting or another care
setting—and it will differ from day to day, ward by ward and
sometimes even from hour to hour, depending on the care needs of
patients.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011593001494" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/debtext/140115-0004.htm#14011593001494">Ticking
boxes on minimum staffing levels does not equate to good care. As the
Berwick review made clear, ticking boxes in relation to minimum
staffing levels does not equate to good care. Patients must be assessed
individually, and the level of care required to ensure their safety

decision-making by a range of factors that determine safe care. That
should include staffing levels, but they are not the only issue: the
Berwick review made that clear as well.</hs_Para>

<hs_Para UID="14011551000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000007">Twenty years
ago, I was an officer in the Royal Air Force, and I helped to police
the no-fly zone over the Kurdistan region of Iraq. Operation Warden
operated from Incirlik airbase in Turkey. Aircraft from the United
Kingdom, the United States, France and Turkey prevented Saddam Hussein
from waging his war against Iraq’s 5 million Kurds.
During my tour, I joined coalition officers from the military
co-ordination centre in Zakho, northern Iraq. We toured Kurdish
villages in that spectacularly beautiful part of the world. We met
village elders, and spread the word that the aircraft flying above them
were friends, not foes. Of course, we were given a very warm
welcome.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000008">The no-fly
zone saved lives and has meant that Iraq’s 5 million Kurds have
experienced relative stability and peace since the end of the 1991 Gulf
war, but the Kurds had suffered abysmally at the hands of Saddam
Hussein, who carried out genocide against them, most notoriously at
Halabja in 1988. That slaughter of 5,000 men, women and children
remains the worst single incident of the use of chemical weapons
against civilians. Saddam Hussein destroyed the Kurds’
agricultural base, razed thousands of villages and rounded up the Kurds
into concentration camps; it is estimated that about 200,000 people
were killed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000009">When Saddam
Hussein’s forces were defeated in Kuwait in 1991, the Kurds rose
up, but they were set to be annihilated. One million people fled to the
mountains—at that point, they called the mountains their only
friends—and the sight of people freezing to death during the
winter months prompted the then Prime Minister of the United Kingdom,
John Major, to work incredibly hard to initiate a no-fly zone with
other allied forces. It saved the Kurds, and enabled them to rebuild
their economy and society into what it is today: a dynamic, prosperous,
pluralistic, tolerant and democratic part of a federal Iraq.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000010">Britain has a
mixed historical record in Kurdistan, but when I returned there
recently I was left in no doubt about the deep affection and respect
felt there for the British and for the United Kingdom. I was back in
the region last summer as a guest of the Kurdistan Regional Government,
via the all-party group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq—it is
good to see colleagues from that group here this morning. I saw at
first hand the peaceful and increasingly prosperous city of Erbil and
its surrounding areas, a fairly secular region in which Christians,
Jews and Muslims live side by side—we even met a local bishop.
Over 2 million tourists visited the region last year. The
Erbil citadel, 6,000 years old, is a fantastic building. 
<?notus-xml column=276?>The world’s oldest continuously inhabited settlement, it is set
to be a huge tourist attraction. Again, the welcome
was warm and
friendly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000011">I
also saw first hand that the Kurds are looking west. English is their
second language, and they speak it very well indeed. Two universities
operate in English and most of the Kurds who go overseas for their
studies and postgraduate courses choose to come to the United
Kingdom.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000012">The Kurdistan
of two decades ago lived a hand-to-mouth existence. Today’s
Kurdistan is becoming a wealthy and cosmopolitan society, with an
active civil society; but it is still in a transition phase from
genocide, dictatorship and its own civil war. It has many bright
community leaders and public servants—we met many of them, and
they were impressive people—but the practice of politics,
administration and civil society is still fairly new to the region, and
the Kurds are having to learn new skills. They seek to soak up as much
experience, advice and expertise as they can from various bodies,
including the Westminster Foundation for Democracy.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000013">There is a
deepening détente with Turkey. We have to admit that that is
based on hard-headed self-interest: the export of Kurdistan’s
newly explored and vast reserves of oil and gas has overcome decades of
hostility and conflict. That trade is set to be a major gain for
Turkey, with a potentially positive impact on resolving the conflict
with Turkish Kurds—something that is important for the
region—and could also have great positives for European and
British energy security, which we have been discussing so much in the
House in recent
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000014">The
Kurds want British trade and investment because they value our skills
and the quality of our goods and services, but until now we have been
too slow to respond. Many Members here today have seen the Kurdish
success story for themselves at first hand, and we talk about it
regularly. Small and large companies, universities and health bodies
should go over to the region and get  stuck in.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000015">We have a
number of asks of the Minister based on increasing such close
co-operation. There should be direct flights from the United Kingdom to
the Kurdistan region. When we went there last year, we had to fly with
Austrian Airlines via Vienna, which ended up taking seven or eight
hours. Direct flights would help massively. We also need a British
trade envoy to the region. It would be great if our leaders visited
Kurdistan, and even better if we could invite their leaders to come
here. It is important that we are bolder and more positive in
recognising who our friends are, and we have a great opportunity to
make new friends in the Kurdistan
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000016">Having
been helped themselves, the Iraqi Kurds are now helping others. On my
trip there in the summer, we spent an emotional day at the Domiz
refugee camp near the Iraq-Syria border. At that stage—I have no
doubt that the figure has since grown—some 130,000 Syrian Kurds
had fled the fighting in Syria. I spoke with many refugees, including
many children who are continuing their education in specially
constructed schools. The Kurdistan Regional Government deserve praise
for funding and arranging that, after the crisis the Kurds went through
two decades ago.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000017">That ability
to help others now is a far cry from the poverty and despair I saw on
the border with Turkey 20 years ago. It has been a
remarkable journey from genocide to prosperity. I urge
the Minister to help 
<?notus-xml column=277?>efforts to achieve greatly increased co-operation
with the Kurds, not just for our sake but for theirs, and I have five
specific requests to put to him.</hs_Para>
<hs_ParaIndent UID="14011551000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000071">First,
I suggest that the UK Government invite the President and Prime
Minister of the Kurdistan region on an official visit to London to meet
the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary. Secondly, I suggest that
the British Government consider the possibility of a visit by the
Foreign Secretary to the Kurdistan region. I have no doubt that he
would receive a very warm welcome.</hs_ParaIndent>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000018">Thirdly, at a
time when the Government are stressing the importance of overseas
exports and finding new markets, I urge them to appoint a UK trade
envoy to the Kurdistan region. I saw an area that is becoming
increasingly prosperous, and met the Erbil chamber of commerce where
many deals were being done. There are great opportunities for British
companies and business people, and having a UK trade envoy would be
helpful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000019">Fourthly,
we would like a meeting with the Home Office to discuss the visa regime
and how to remove the obstacles to increased cultural and commercial
activities with Kurdistan. I referred to students who are choosing the
United Kingdom for their university and postgraduate studies, and we
should ensure that they are encouraged to come to our wonderful
universities, including my local Huddersfield university, which has
students from 130 nations. Fifthly, with Holocaust memorial day coming
up, I urge the Government to recognise formally the genocide against
the Kurds and to take a full part in marking the annual Anfal day on 14
April.</hs_Para>

conclude my comments because other hon. Members who have experienced
the Kurdistan region first hand have some positive and well-informed
input to make to the debate. The Iraqi Kurds are back from the brink
and making real and positive progress. They are helping their
neighbours, and it is important that the United Kingdom does not
neglect that renaissance in the Kurdistan
region.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/4A8F0C76E5304814355989511C0BA734313E08E0" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="15 January 2014">Wednesday

this debate is my hon. Friend, as well as being my colleague on the
all-party group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq, which I have the
honour to co-chair with the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim
Zahawi), who is also my hon. Friend in this debate. I congratulate my
hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley on securing the debate. It is
good that we have been able to secure a second debate on the Kurdistan
region in less than a year, and a sign of the area’s growing
potential.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000022">In November,
together with some hon. Members here, I visited the Kurdistan region as
part of a delegation from the all-party group, and we saw some of the
issues affecting the area. The contrast between that visit, which was
my sixth, and my first visit four years ago was astonishing and
heartening. During my first few visits, it was easy to feel like a
pioneer, as there were few western faces about, but today there is a
modern airport terminal and several new hotels, each with lobbies full
of local and western business people discussing deals and developments.
It is truly a transformation.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=278?><hs_Para UID="14011551000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000023">During the
visit in November 2013, we went to the Domiz refugee camp near Dohuk,
as did my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley in the summer. The
impact on hon. Members who were visiting for the first time, and on me,
was such that I want to spend a little longer talking about the
situation there. It is the new home, working place and school for
75,000 refugees from the Syrian conflict, of which 13,000 are children.
It is just one of 13 refugee camps in the Kurdistan region and the
largest of the four in the Dohuk province. In a prominent location near
the camp entrance is the child protection unit, which is funded by the
UK Government and run by UNICEF. With my previous working experience of
child protection, I was pleased that we spent considerable time
addressing the issue of children and their
welfare.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000024">The
Kurdistan region has been at pains to welcome Syrian refugees, and
Dohuk’s governor told me that another 75,000 refugees are living
in the province among the host community. Two months ago, there were
150,000 refugees, up from the number that my hon. Friend the
Member for Colne Valley mentioned. Many of the refugees living in the
region have family connections in the area, and highly-qualified
refugees have found jobs and been able to move their families into
permanent accommodation within the community. The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees has described that hospitality and support as
extraordinary. The Kurdistan region has supplied much of the finance
itself, which is a huge burden for a region that is still developing
its services. For example, many of the local Kurdish schools have
double shifts to accommodate all the children who want to attend. The
region is not in a good place  in terms of being able to
welcome refugees, but it is opening its arms to those in desperate
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000025">I
want to emphasise the importance of the Government remembering that the
Kurdistan region of Iraq is hosting refugees. In his statement to the
House on Monday, the Foreign Secretary referred to refugees in Jordan,
Turkey and Lebanon, but did not mention Iraq; refugees are also
flooding over that border and being welcomed there. The Government
should recognise that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000026">I pay tribute
to the Government, who have committed £500 million of their aid
budget to Syrian refugees. The Foreign Secretary made it clear that
further funds will be made available, and I fear that that will be
necessary well before the end of the conflict. As the fighting in Syria
continues, we must ensure that the people in the refugee camps are not
forgotten.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000027">During
our visit, I met representatives of Syrian Kurdish groups who are
members of the Syrian Opposition coalition. The majority of Kurdish
groups oppose the Assad regime, and the representatives we met were
clear that they wanted the British people and Government to have a
better understanding of the situation in relation to the Syrian Kurdish
Opposition. They stressed that the organised Opposition in Syria is
different from the al-Qaeda groups that grab the headlines. Those
groups were asking for greater representation in the
Geneva II talks, and I urge the Foreign Secretary to help to
accommodate
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000029">Turning
to economic development and relationships with the UK, I had the
opportunity to visit the Taq Taq oilfield, run by the Taq Taq Operating
Company and the Turkish-British oil company Genel Energy. The oilfield
is a large local employer, employing 400 people 
<?notus-xml column=279?>from local villages. I understand that the first oil exported to Turkey
will be sold by the end of this month, although all of us in contact
with the region know that there is some controversy about that. I will
not go into that today, but the Kurdistan region has a target of
producing 2 million barrels of oil per day by the end of
2019.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000030">Unlike
in many post-conflict situations, this region of Iraq is not having to
rely on international aid to rebuild its economy. Instead, it is
developing the oilfields to ensure a strong source of revenue for
decades and generations to come. That foresight and enterprise should
be applauded. It was good to meet British citizens working in the oil
industry and clearly enjoying working in Kurdistan with local
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000031">The
region is growing quickly, and the regional Government have been
strengthening their relationship with Turkey. Not long ago, 200,000
troops were on the border of Turkey, but 200,000 people from Turkey now
work in the region. That stability provides a great opportunity to
strengthen the commercial and cultural links between the UK and the
Kurdistan
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000032">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Colne Valley said, the all-party
parliamentary group has long supported improved trade links between the
UK and Kurdistan. Since we began lobbying on the issue of visas, the
capacity to receive applications for visas and to take biometrics in
Erbil has dramatically increased, which we are pleased to see. However,
we know, having spoken earlier this month to the consul general from
Erbil, that more could be done, if the capacity were there. I urge the
Government to look again at the issue and consider providing even more
capability. As has been said, our all-party group would like to have a
further meeting with the Home Office to explore what more can be
done.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000033">We have long
campaigned, as has also been mentioned, on the importance of direct
flights from Kurdistan to the UK. It is good to note that progress is
being made with the recent visit by officials to Erbil. However, it
would be remiss of me not to press the Minister further on maintaining
the pressure for a positive outcome as soon as possible. The UK is the
country of choice for trade for many in Kurdistan, and we should do all
we can to facilitate those contacts. Compared with other European
countries, there is a lack of ministerial support from the UK to
British companies in Kurdistan. Trade and Industry Ministers in Italy,
Germany and other countries tend to visit Kurdistan, often with big
trade missions, and they are all well received by the Kurdistan
Regional Government. Although it was a great pleasure, along with my
hon. Friend the Member for Stratford-on-Avon, to lead a trade
delegation as a Back-Bench Member of the UK Parliament in 2010, so much
more could be done if Ministers were to go out with trade delegations
and the companies that really want to do trade in Kurdistan, to make
those contacts. It is clear that the countries that are giving that
priority are benefiting, through positive contacts with their
companies, and through gaining contracts.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000034">Similarly, it
is good to see that the UK remains the country of choice for the
majority of students who are funded by the Kurdistan Regional
Government on placements overseas as part of their human capacity
development programme. Many universities across the UK are welcoming
students, including Sheffield Hallam university. That is a real benefit
for all concerned and is 
<?notus-xml column=280?>likely to have long-term benefits. The university of Huddersfield, which
has already had a mention this morning, has even formed an alumni
association in Kurdistan, with more than 70 former students and their
families attending the recent launch. We know that many students who
have spent time in the UK carry positive attitudes for the rest of
their lives, which can lead to ongoing relationships in a wide range of
walks of life, including business, academia, and even
politics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000035">The
willingness of the people of the region to help and support people from
other areas of Iraq who have faced persecution, particularly the
Christian community, has been impressive. They have again shown their
good will in providing help to the refugees from Syria. They are a
beacon in the middle east of a stable, democratic and welcoming people
and Administration. It is time for more MPs and Ministers to take
seriously our relationships with the Kurdistan region, and it would be
good to see the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, for example, doing
an investigation into the prospects for the Kurdistan region of Iraq
and the issues facing the Kurds across Syria, Turkey and Iran; that is
just a suggestion. I am sure that other hon. Members will cover
security, but we stress the importance of the Government providing
non-lethal security equipment to help the KRG. The UK must do all that
it can to support the ongoing work of the KRG to develop the resources
in the area and the skills and enterprise of the
people.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/7A0A7A16F83AE5D5D8E69E91E8F29E1481EBD606" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="15 January 2014">Wednesday

extraordinary knowledge, and we respect his service in the armed

are on the Register of Members’ Financial Interests: I am
vice-chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on the Kurdistan
region in Iraq and chairman of the Kurdish genocide task force. I am
privileged to have been to Kurdistan a significant number of times over
the past few years, and every time I have been, I have seen the region
go from strength to strength. Until the 1990s, Kurdistan faced constant
threats to its very existence through war, internal unrest and
genocide, and yet incredibly, it is now a progressive, democratic
Muslim nation, where the rule of law is well established. For
Kurdistan, freedom is not only about elections, but about being a place
where women have equality, all religions are respected, property rights
are manifest, and where a free press is unshackled. It is early days,
and of course there are problems, but the direction is
positive.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000038">Across the
Kurdistan region, business is flourishing, as has been described, and
people are keen on British and foreign investment. Privatisation
continues apace and huge property complexes are being built. There are
significant oil and gas reserves, which, unusually in these parts, are
used for the benefit of the country, not salted away in corruption. As
I pointed out in an early-day motion, which I tabled just before my
visit to 
<?notus-xml column=281?>the region in November with my hon. Friend the hon. Member for
Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi) and the hon. Member for Sheffield,
Heeley, the KRG can become an important ally in guaranteeing the
UK’s future energy security, but we must be aware of the legacy
of the Ba’athist regime. I know from questions tabled by the
hon. Member for Blaydon (Mr Anderson) that there are questions and
reservations about the closeness of Crescent Petroleum to Saddam
Hussein’s genocidal regime, and therefore its current status as
operator in the Kurdistan region. That needs to be examined.</hs_Para>

significant challenges face the KRG, some of which threaten its
survival as an autonomous region in Iraq, as well as all its social and
economic achievements since 1992. I shall describe each in turn. They
are terrorism, the situation in Syria, and as has been mentioned, the
recognition of the genocide.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000040">Since its
founding, the KRG has faced significant terrorism threats, mainly from
Iran and al-Qaeda, but there have been very few attacks, thanks to
tight security. Similar to what people see when visiting the state of
Israel, outside every major building, there are guards checking for
suicide bombers and armed checkpoints are on all the major roads. Sadly
last September, one day after the results of the fourth democratic
elections in the region, there were two linked suicide bomb attacks in
Erbil, one on the Interior Ministry and the other on the next-door
security directorate. I visited the site with my hon. Friends. Seven
security guards died, with more injured. The atrocity was linked to
al-Qaeda, which is thought to control vast swathes of Mosul, an Iraqi
province next to Kurdistan where a strong Salafist movement has been
established. On visiting the site of the attack, one Minister warned
that if action was not taken, Mosul could become a second Afghanistan
in one year, with significant implications not only for Kurdistan, but
for the whole of Iraq. The British Government should take that
seriously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000041">Secondly,
there is Syria. The unstable situation in Syria is a threat to the
KRG’s security and stability. It is thought that the terrorism I
have described is being aided and abetted by terrorists passing through
Syria, trained by al-Qaeda and funded in part from Saudi Arabia,
Somalia and Sudan. In addition to the exploitation of the Syrian crisis
by extreme Islamists, large numbers of refugees are seeking safety in
Kurdistan. Many of the refugees accepted by Kurdistan are Syrian Kurds,
who represent 9%—1.9 million—of the Syrian
population.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011551000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000042">During my
recent trip to the KRG, I, like the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley,
visited the Domiz camp, just 40 miles from the Syrian border, where
there were 75,000 refugees, including 15,000 children. The Kurds,
having experienced centuries of persecution, have welcomed the refugees
and assisted them by providing residence permits and work
opportunities. Nevertheless, the number of refugees, already at
250,000, is due to increase and that will inevitably put the
KRG’s society under strain. In addition to the pragmatic
challenges of hosting such large numbers, the geopolitical consequences
are also of extreme importance. What happens if Syria breaks up
post-Assad? Does the Kurdistan region extend into Syria, with the risk
of a domino effect on the millions of Kurds who live in Iran and
Turkey?</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=282?><hs_Para UID="14011551000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000043">The third
challenge is the genocide. Inexplicably, the genocide against the
Kurds, described earlier, has not been recognised internationally,
causing a deep sense of grievance among the Kurds. I have said in
previous debates in the House on Kurdistan that I have seen there some
of the worst places that I have ever seen in my life. When we go to the
prisons and to Halabja, we see how the Kurds suffered. Major
perpetrators of the chemical gas attacks have not been brought to
justice, and some are thought to live freely in Europe. Many of the
companies, also from the west, that sold Saddam the materials used to
make chemical weapons have not yet faced the criminal courts. In Iraq,
the Ba’athist Arab hatred of the Kurds remains strong in some
areas, even though in 2008 the Iraqi Parliament recognised the
genocide.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000044">In
2013, the Netherlands courts and the House of Commons recognised the
genocide. Despite that, it remains incumbent on western Governments to
push through a relevant resolution in the United Nations. Recognition
would mean that those responsible for war crimes could appear before
the international court and compensation and reparation would be given
to the KRG. The Kurds are a nation that does not live in the past, but
learns from the past. Recognition would help to heal the wounds from
many
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000045">Following

from being exterminated, but that is not enough. The free world has a
real chance of a new, prosperous, democratic and forward-looking Muslim
nation forging ahead. The UK can and must assist the Kurdistan Regional
Government in reinforcing their democratic institutions and fulfilling
their potential. In the short to medium term, we should enter
negotiations with the KRG about the supply of non-lethal security
equipment to be used in the fight against terrorism. Kurdistan and the
geopolitical challenges that it faces because of the instability in
Syria should be considered in any solution that the Government put on
the table at the Geneva

the long term, our efforts should focus on strengthening civil society
and the people’s participation in political life. There are
already two organisation that run projects in Kurdistan—the
Westminster Foundation for Democracy and the National School of
Government—but much more can be done. As has been suggested,
Members of Parliament can lead on that by visiting the region, meeting
our Kurdish colleagues and sharing best practice. If the Government
invited the President 
<?notus-xml column=283?>and Prime Minister of the Kurdistan region on an official visit, that
would send a strong signal to the
Kurds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000050">Kurdistan

influence on the present, and although memories of British policies may
cause suspicions to linger in some parts of the middle east,
in the Kurdistan region of Iraq the UK has generated a huge

implementing a no-fly zone in 1991 to recognising the
Kurdish genocide in this place just last year, the UK has
been a long-term friend of the Kurdish people, but we cannot be
complacent. As a region with a burgeoning economy and even
more potential, it is important that we continue to foster

both.</hs_Para>

the region is not an easy one to operate in, but Kurdistan has made
great strides in cementing democracy and is gradually finding its way

of the most prominent, if slightly controversial, diplomatic
developments for the Kurdish region in recent years has been its
improved relationship with Turkey. As Turkey is one of the UK’s
most important trading partners, the benefits of increased
understanding between the two should not be underestimated. Not only
has the new-found friendship between Turkey and Kurdistan brought
increased stability to the region, but the recently completed oil
pipeline will, in time, also help to strengthen the security and
diversity of European energy supplies. Although the pipeline has been
the cause of some tension with Baghdad, its success should not be
viewed on a zero-sum basis. KRG Ministers have assured me that they are
proactively engaging with Baghdad to establish a new, reliable and
robust revenue-sharing agreement through which the whole country can
benefit from the Kurdish success.</hs_Para>

although I recognise that the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, is
beginning to take a more proactive approach towards
the KRG, he could go further. I hope that the national elections this
year will incorporate all groups in governance and further cement
federalism. Such progress in resolving these kinds of disputes will not
only enhance stability in Iraq, but enable the region to expand as a

resources are not the whole story of Kurdistan. The pipeline is just
one area of progress in a region with a fantastic appetite to work with
the United Kingdom. As the economy grows, KRG Ministers are actively

if one of us had been drawing support from Saddam Hussein and the other
had been drawing support from Iran, and we had been at war only a few
years before. Even so, the PUK and the KDP, for many years, put
together a successful coalition. They put aside their differences. They
built strong institutions in Iraqi Kurdistan, with help and input from
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, which assists with
institution-building in Kurdistan. The two parties encouraged
significant investment in the region, even from investors such as
Turkey that might once have been its enemies—as hon. Members
have said, Turkey has now become very engaged. The governing coalition
also invested significantly in infrastructure. In many ways, the
approach was a model one. The two parties managed to achieve all that
while respecting the rights of minorities, both religious and
ethnic.</hs_Para>

suffered a setback in recent parliamentary elections in Kurdistan, its
supporters did not take to the streets or challenge the results. They
did the traditional democratic thing of having a go at their own
leaders and looking to their own resources to do better next time. That
is a real example to other areas of the middle east. An independence
referendum was even held in Kurdistan that garnered virtually 99%
support for independence, but Kurdish politicians saw the bigger
picture and stepped back from the brink of pressing that case, which is
perhaps an example to another political party not a million miles from
here.</hs_Para>

look at the region through rose-tinted spectacles, however, because
there are problems. It might be better for Kurdistan’s image if
the Prime Minister were not the nephew of the President. The dominance
of the Barzani family is something of a cause for concern, although I
stress that both the President and the Prime Minister are respected
figures who have attracted a great deal of praise for the way in which
they have behaved in office. There are concerns about the human rights
situation, particularly the treatment of journalists. I heard what the
hon. Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) said about the movement towards
freedom of expression going in the right direction, but there are some
real causes for concern, which have been highlighted by Reporters
without Borders. In December, for example, Kawa Germyani, editor of
Rayal magazine, was murdered. I hope that the Minister will confirm
that the British Government will take that matter up with the Kurdistan
Regional Government. Female genital mutilation is prevalent, and I know
that tackling it is a big priority for the Department for International
Development. The Kurdistan National Assembly has made great efforts to
tackle violence against women in all its forms.</hs_Para>

problem, to which hon. Members have referred, is the refugee situation.
I believe that DFID has committed some £18 million from its
large budget to help refugees and host communities in the region, and
it is doing fantastic work with organisations such as UNICEF and Save
the Children, but the situation is complicated. Most refugees from
Syria who enter Iraq are going into the Kurdistan region. There are
even refugees from Iraq in Syria who are trying to return to their
homes in Iraq; they have become secondarily displaced because they have
not been able to return to their home regions. In camps, settlements
and urban areas across Iraq, but mainly in the Kurdistan region, there
are still Palestinian refugees who were granted asylum by the previous
regime. We can do only so much through aid budgets and assistance. In a
sense, the ultimate solution to all these problems is to press the
peace processes for Syria, for Israel and Palestine, and across the
region.</hs_ParaIndent><hs_Para UID="14011551000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000069">It
is right that we should accentuate the positive in a debate such as
this, and I would entirely endorse the requests made by the hon. Member
for Colne Valley for greater diplomatic links, reciprocal visits,
better trade links, and visa relaxation, particularly in respect of
student visas. Of course, I must add to the chorus by recommending the
university of Gloucestershire as a potential destination. I am sure
that the hon. Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham), who is in the
Chamber, would endorse
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011551000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011551000070">The
security situation must be addressed, as the  hon. Member for
Harlow mentioned. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is already
helping the Kurdistan 
<?notus-xml column=287?>Regional Government to address that, but more can be done. We should do
as much as we can to help with the refugee situation on the
ground, but there are many things happening in
Kurdistan to praise and applaud. It is now an example of what many
nations and communities in the middle east could achieve, given peace,
democracy, and
self-determination.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/5FF83E636C2FA6779DD71018A28279E52CC78127" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="15 January 2014">Wednesday

Lucas</B> (Wrexham) (Lab):</Member> It has been a pleasure to listen to
this extremely well-informed debate on the Kurdistan region. It is
testament to the work of the all-party group on the Kurdistan region in
Iraq that so many Members who have taken part in the debate have
actually visited the region, learned so much about it and can speak
with such breadth of knowledge. It is also interesting that Members
have forged relationships with the region through the universities that
they represent. We do not always sufficiently appreciate the importance
of MPs building relationships with different parts of the world through
local contacts and
visits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000003">Before
he had to leave, the right hon. Member for Belfast North (Mr Dodds)
made an important point about the regions of the UK. We have here
Members from right across the UK. We must deal with Kurdish matters not
just at the UK Government level in Whitehall; we MPs must make efforts
in our communities and build personal connections. There are Kurds
right across the UK, often studying. As we know from the hon. Member
for Stratford-on-Avon (Nadhim Zahawi), in the long term, building
strong links over a sustained period will help to create prosperity in
Kurdish
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000004">I
must pay tribute to the hon. Member for Colne Valley (Jason McCartney)
for securing this debate. It  is important that we recognise
his service in the Royal Air Force in the 1990s. We must also pay
tribute to  the people of Kurdistan, who are so grateful for
the commitment of the United Kingdom over the past 25 years.
When I visited the region last June—I refer to my record in the
Register of Members’ Financial Interests—I found that
people were particularly grateful to former Prime Ministers John Major
and Tony Blair. The latter has not been mentioned today, but he is
extremely highly regarded in the region because of the part he played
in safeguarding the role of Kurds in Iraq throughout an extremely
difficult
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000005">We
have heard about the progress made in the region. It must have been an
extraordinary experience for the hon. Member for Colne Valley to visit
a peaceful Kurdistan, after previously making a flying visit, if I may
use that phrase. He will have seen the extraordinary progress in the
country that I saw, and the appetite there for all things British. I
must say to the Minister that the impression that I got—I am
sure the Government will agree—is that the door is open and
needs only a gentle push as far as UK universities, trade and cultural
links are concerned. There can be a strong, vibrant relationship to the
benefit of Kurdistan and the UK, if only we give that door a gentle
push.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000006">Last
week, I had the pleasure of meeting the consul general to talk about
the progress made even since I visited last June. It was good to hear
that we are building better links. We must be conscious of issues such
as immigration caps when we are talking about student visas. We can
talk consensually about the importance of bringing Kurdish students to
the UK, 
<?notus-xml column=288?>but we must recognise that if we are to impose rough caps, that might
affect the ability of our universities to build close contacts with
regions such as
Kurdistan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000007">The
co-chair of the all-party group, my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield, Heeley (Meg Munn), has contributed an enormous amount to the
strong relationship between Parliament and the Kurdistan region, and we
heard her depth of knowledge on the issue. I would like to pick up on
what she said about the Domiz refugee camp, which I visited, as did a
number of other Members, and where 75,000 people are living. When I
visited, the environment was extraordinarily calm. I had a haircut
there, which was very high quality indeed. A meticulous gentleman
applied to my hair a strange substance that is not normally applied to
it. The community there is working extremely hard in very difficult
circumstances, and the UK Government are giving it a great deal of
financial support, for which I pay tribute to them. Our consul general
is playing an important role in assisting with that support, alongside
the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The Kurdistan
Regional Government are also working hard to provide a strong base to
support the huge number of refugees that are going into not just the
camp but the rest of Iraqi
Kurdistan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="Meg Munn" PimsId="2044" UID="14011554000024" xid="441" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000024">Meg
Munn:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is making an important point about
the refugee camp. I am greatly concerned about the 13,000 children
there, and the fact that there are only four schools. There are efforts
to increase the number of schools so that these children, who have
already suffered displaced lives and a great deal of trauma, can
continue their education. Does he support my call for the Government to
look specifically at supporting the provision of schools for those
children?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Lucas" PimsId="1569" UID="14011554000025" xid="370" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000025">Ian
Lucas:</Member></B> Absolutely; I would certainly support that call. I
visited a school in the camp and spoke to the head teacher. It was
quite extraordinary to see the enthusiasm and interest that the
children attending the school showed to visitors to the site. We are
doing a good job on site, but because of the continuing pressure from
the appalling events in Syria, I am afraid that the pressures on Iraqi
Kurds in the camps also
continue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000010">I
echo my hon. Friend’s point about the fact that Iraq is housing
huge numbers of refugees. For reasons I do not really understand, Iraq
is not generally referred to as providing support for refugees from
Syria, but there is huge pressure on Iraqi Kurdistan from Syrian
refugees, and we are doing a lot there. We must recognise that whenever
a statement is
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011554000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011554000011">I
ask the Government, as the Labour party has done previously, to
consider whether, in a very limited number of cases, they should offer
refuge to individuals who have fled Syria and are now in places such as
Iraq. There are people who have serious medical difficulties or
particularly close family contacts here, and they could be offered
direct refuge in the UK. We have pressed the Government previously on
this issue. In a limited number of cases that option should be
considered, because at present we are not offering any places to those
individuals. We should consider doing so, and I ask the Minister to
reflect on that.</hs_Para>

the hon. Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) about the Anfal, which I
heard about on my visit to Iraqi Kurdistan, when I met relatives of
individuals 
<?notus-xml column=289?>who had disappeared in 1988. As I have said before in the House, I
remember seeing a TV programme—I think it was
“Newsnight”—on the Halabja attacks in the late
1980s, which has stayed with me forever; it was very powerful indeed. I
think we made a lot of progress in our discussions on this subject in
the debates that we have had during the last year. I pay tribute to the
right hon. Member for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) for the
work that he did. I can report to Members here that after a debate that
took place last year, I had some private discussions with him about
trying to take this issue forward on a consensual basis—it is
clearly not a partisan matter—and we would like to try to
continue that process with the new Minister, who is here
today.</hs_Para>

as far as the Kurdistan Regional Government are concerned, the
recognition of the genocide is a major issue and that there is a strong
feeling in the country that there is not the level of international
recognition that there should be, so the steps taken by the UK
Parliament last year were welcome. They helped to inform the debate,
which we need to take further at Governmental level. I am happy to
continue the discussions in which the right hon. Member for North East
Bedfordshire played such a positive role.</hs_Para>

the co-chair of the all-party group on the Kurdistan region in Iraq,
the hon. Member for Stratford-on-Avon, does not need any lectures from
me about Kurdistan. I simply say to him that as a visitor to
Kurdistan—I visited it for a limited period—I was
fascinated by the region. It is such an important region, because it
has played such an important role in the past 25 years in UK politics.
In the context of current events in the middle east, it would be very
valuable for all Members to visit Iraqi Kurdistan, whatever their
position on it has been in votes in the past 10 years; I know that we
have a number of different positions represented in Westminster Hall
today. Visiting Iraqi Kurdistan makes a valuable contribution to
one’s knowledge of the region, and visiting it would help to
inform Members who have not been there about the progress of democracy
in the middle east, because it is an important example of a place where
progress has been made.</hs_Para>

when I was in Erbil, I had the longest political interview that I have
ever had on the Rudaw television channel. It was a wide-ranging
interrogation on policy across the middle east. I would love to have
that on the BBC, but unfortunately the interview went on for longer
than “Newsnight”; I think my interview lasted 50 minutes,
whereas “Newsnight” has a 45-minute running time. As I
say, there is progress in the region on democratic debate.</hs_Para>

referred to by the hon. Member for Colne Valley is an extraordinary
historic site. When one says to one’s constituents, “You
should go to Iraq for a holiday”, there might be a certain
amount of scepticism initially, but that citadel is the
longest-occupied site on earth and it is an extraordinary place to
visit. I am quite sure that in the future people will go to Erbil, and
there is a strong view—is there not?—that we need to work
towards introducing direct flights from the UK to the region, so as to
facilitate that type of visit for our constituents. I am sure that that
would be widely appreciated across the House, both for tourism and for
business.</hs_Para>

that I will have to refer to my university in Wrexham, Glyndwr
university, which as we speak is holding discussions with the
university in Erbil about possible relationships between them. Again,
that shows the appetite in the UK for building relationships with the
Iraqi region of Kurdistan. There will be more contact between Iraqi
Kurdistan and the rest of the world in the future. The region wants
contact with the UK and its different regions. We really need to seize
that opportunity and do the best that we can to ensure that we are
right at the forefront in pushing at that open door that I referred to
earlier.</hs_Para>

region of Kurdistan is a very tough neighbourhood indeed. We must
remember that it is bordered by Iran on one side and Syria on another,
and that Turkey is to the north. Notwithstanding that difficult
environment—it is such a difficult political environment, with
so much violence, including the violence in the rest of
Iraq—there has been real progress in the region, and that is
quite extraordinary.</hs_Para>

help the Kurdistan Regional Government to build better relations with
the Government in Iraq; relations between the two have been the source
of some tension. It is also important that we recognise that those
tensions continue, particularly over the pipelines that deliver oil

issue, and I hope that the UK Government will play a positive role in
trying to build relations, especially in the context of the election

a great deal about the positive nature of the relationship between the
region and the UK. I would like to flag up the issue of female genital
mutilation, which is still an issue in Kurdistan. We can play a
positive role in engaging on that issue with the Kurdistan Regional
Government. I think that they would accept that it is an issue on which
progress needs to be made. This is a country that is developing a
democratic tradition. That has happened there very recently, and it is
very important that difficult issues such as this one are addressed in
their cultural context.</hs_Para>

important players in that process will be the Kurdistan diaspora
community in the UK. That community is very important indeed, and they
are very active and willing to engage with UK political
representatives. I hope that they will engage with more and more MPs to
try to get them to recognise the importance of the Iraqi Kurdistan
region, and to get more of them involved in the all-party group on the
Kurdistan region in Iraq. That group has achieved a great deal. We have
heard about the work being done with universities and businesses
locally as a result of the group’s work, and that can only be
further developed by having more MPs involved with the group. I am not
sure how many of my colleagues in the House will welcome this, but I
encourage members of the Kurdish diaspora here to contact their local
MP to try to get them involved in the group, because they will then
learn about the progress made in the northern region of Iraq, and will
also build better links between the UK and the region.</hs_Para>

our good relations with the region, both under the previous Government

There are still opportunities there, and we need to build

political divide over, and the positive picture of the UK in the

one of those remarkable occasions on which I have addressed every

work of the all-party group has been superb and continues to be so. We
agree that we need to do much more in the area on education, cultural

feeding habitats for many birds, such as finches and buntings, have
disappeared or have been greatly reduced. Greater use of pesticides and
herbicides has removed critical food resources, and the loss of hedges

combined with intensive grassland management to take away vital

changes that I have been talking about have been driven by farm
incentives under the common agricultural policy, which paid farmers to
produce more, and these days, there is also pressure from competition
to produce food ever more cheaply, but we know what some of the answers
could be. As several of my hon. Friends present have proved, a
farmer’s knowledge of his land is second to none. Many farmers
leap at the chance to work their land in a way that provides a good
habitat for plants and animals. I pay tribute to the many farmers who
work tirelessly to conserve and improve 
<?notus-xml column=299?>habitats. Working with conservation groups, wildlife-friendly farmers
have come up with the big three essential elements for farmland birds
to thrive: safe nesting sites; invertebrate food for chicks in the

noticed with interest that in a recent edition of <I>Country Life</I>,
the Game and Wildlife Conservation Trust has urged both farmers and

answers can be provided by simple solutions. A skylark plot is a tiny
patch mown into the centre of a field. It allows birds to enter the
thick crops and nest safely away from predators. Skylark plots have
raised breeding success by 50%, but they are small enough to have no
significant impact on crop yields. Other actions require a bit more
effort, but we know that they work.</hs_Para>

moment, the main tool for improving biodiversity is agri-environment
schemes, under which farmers receive money for environmental
stewardship. Let me give a couple of examples of the difference they
can make. Under such schemes, cirl bunting numbers in south Devon have
increased sevenfold, from 118 pairs in 1989 to 862 pairs in 2009. I am
certainly showing my age when I say that I can remember going to watch
cirl buntings in Buckinghamshire. Now they are completely confined, in
England, down in the south-west. That is another example of how species
have just disappeared. In Wiltshire and Norfolk, stone curlew numbers
have recovered from just 160 pairs in the 1980s to 400 pairs in 2012,
thanks to farmers working through agri-environment schemes. When we get
the system right, farmers are expert in looking after our natural
world.</hs_Para>

of the system have not been quite as effective. The entry level
stewardship part of agri-environment has been
untargeted—frankly, some farmers have received money for old
rope, as far as I, a non-farmer, can see; that is what it looks like to
me. There are  65 activities to choose from under the scheme.
Many farmers involved in the entry level stewardship have opted for the
simplest measures that have the fewest benefits. One example is the
low-input grassland option, which entails only modest restrictions on
the use of fertiliser and provides few if any benefits to wildlife. The
other big problem with environmental stewardship is that it has not
been targeted properly. At the top end of the scheme, higher level
stewardship has been targeted in 110 areas across England under a set
of priority themes, but the entry level has been completely untargeted.
That means that farmers can receive money for actions that make no
ecological sense for the areas they are farming.</hs_Para>

from the common agricultural policy is divided into two parts: pillar
one is a direct payment based on land-holding, and pillar two is for
rural development, including the agri-environment money. In December,
the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced that
it would transfer 12% of CAP funds from direct payments to rural
development. The maximum of 15% would have been better, but 12% still
provides a hefty £3.5 billion to spend between 2015 and 2020. I
would welcome the Minister’s confirmation 
<?notus-xml column=300?>that the Department seriously intends to increase the transfer to 15%
from 2018. Slightly less than £3.1 billion of that money will be
spent through the next round of agri-environment spending,
known as the new environmental land management scheme. It is a real
chance to make good on the two big issues.</hs_Para>

scheme must be targeted and, when we are talking about farmland birds,
farmers need to deliver the big three conservation solutions if they
are to receive the money. The Minister will be aware that DEFRA will
make its decisions about the design of NELMS over the next few months.
It is a great opportunity to design a scheme that will deliver for the
environment by supporting farmers in taking the ecological steps that
will enhance the value of their land for wildlife and the public at
large. I hope that the Minister can assure me that biodiversity will be
the top priority of the NELMS scheme. More specifically, I hope he
agrees that to deliver the maximum value for money, we need a system
that will dish out money only when farmers deliver the core
conservation actions along with a system that targets the menu of
conservation options to the area

want to touch on the direct payments, as there is an opportunity there
as well. The rules for greening direct payments were watered down
during the EU negotiations, but the UK can still make a couple of
decisions to ensure that the subsidy delivers value for money. Again,
we need to see a list of actions for the ecological focus areas that
will make a real difference to biodiversity. DEFRA is about to review
the cross-compliance rules, which are designed to ensure that farmers
abide by the rules before they can make a claim. That includes rules
like the retention of hedgerows and protection for sites of special
scientific interest. The CAP costs the UK £10.3 billion a year,
which is £398 a household. It is only right that we ensure that
the money goes to farmers who are sticking by the rules and delivering
maximum public benefit. I hope the Minister agrees that the rules need
to be strengthened.</hs_Para>

positive effect on people’s well-being, unlike pay rises or
promotions, which only give a short-term boost, however welcome.
Connection to nature is vital. Farmers are the stewards of three
quarters of our land, so we must ensure that the system helps them
deliver a healthy countryside. There are economic implications, too. We
know that our farmers need to be competitive to provide affordable
food, but we also know that they need help to deliver the wider
benefits from their land. We have all heard about the plight of the
bumblebee: of the 97 food plants that bumblebees prefer, 76% are in

opportunity to design a system that puts nature at its heart and

Friend the Member for Uxbridge and South Ruislip (Sir John Randall) on
securing this debate. He is passionate about bird life and has been a
member of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds for some 50
years, which shows real dedication. I grew up around wildlife on a
farm. In Cornwall, we used to get a lot of lapwings, because they often
overwintered there. Like him, I have a passion for birds and wildlife,
and I want to see the common agricultural policy promoting
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011562000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011562000059">My
right hon. Friend highlighted that the trend in recent decades has been
bleak. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs measures
how birds fare through the farmland bird index, which is published
every year as part of its biodiversity indicator suite. The index looks
at 19 widespread species that feed in open farmland during the breeding
season, and includes species such as lapwing, grey partridge,
greenfinch, wood pigeon, skylark, corn bunting and yellowhammers. The
evidence shows that the main decline in the index was from the late
1970s to the early 1990s. While the decline has continued, it has
slowed since then.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011562000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011562000060">It should be
noted that not all farmland bird species have followed the overall
trend. While grey partridge, turtle dove, tree sparrow and corn bunting
are among those declining, wood pigeon, jackdaw, goldfinch and stock
dove have all shown substantial increases. The 
<?notus-xml column=302?>wood pigeon, for example, has benefited from the increased
availability of food as a result of cropping
patterns switching to more oilseed rape, as many farmers could tell
us.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011562000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011562000061">The causes
for the overall decline are complex and varied, but it is clear that
the sharpest rate in decline coincided with major changes in
agricultural land management and intensification. First, the switch
from spring to autumn sowing of many cereal crops led to a loss of
overwinter stubble fields, which has had a major impact on food
sources. Secondly, the increased use of agri-chemicals, particularly
during the 1970s, played an important part as well. Thirdly, the loss
of field margins and hedgerows meant that farmland birds lost not only
valuable sources of seed and insect food, particularly over the winter,
but suitable nesting habitat. Recently, other natural factors have had
an impact, particularly the weather. Many species have been vulnerable
to the recent wet summers and cold winters. There is also disease; we
know, for example, that trichomonosis has affected the
greenfinch.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011562000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011562000062">For some
ground-nesting species such as lapwing, and game birds such as grey
partridge, we have to acknowledge that predation by foxes and other
predators has been a factor. The impact of predation varies between
species. For farmland songbirds, for instance, there is little evidence
of an effect, perhaps because they often have more than one brood and
will re-nest after predation, and are therefore better able to
withstand its effects. There is some evidence that predation is likely
to have a greater impact on bird populations where habitat is in poor
condition, perhaps because it has been degraded through overgrazing;
nests may be more exposed and suffer higher loss rates to
predators.</hs_Para>

outlined the causes of the decline and the nature of the problem, I
want to say something about what we hope to do, and the possible
solutions. Our agri-environment schemes are the principal means of
improving habitat for farmland birds in England; they provide funds for
farmers to manage the cropped environment and provide additional
habitat and food on their farms for farmland birds and other wildlife.
Agri-environment measures that benefit birds include providing
overwintered stubble, so that there is seed in winter, and wild bird
seed mixtures in spring and summer, and the sympathetic management of
hedgerows. Today there are about 50,000 farmers in England in
agri-environment schemes, representing about 70% of available farmland.
As part of the rural development programme for England, we spend about
£400 million a year on those
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011562000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011562000064">As
I said earlier, although we have stemmed the rate of decline and have
turned a corner with respect to some species, we need overall to ask
why, having spent a great deal of money in recent years on such
countryside stewardship schemes, we have not yet reversed the decline,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon), other hon.

thing to consider is management options under the stewardship schemes.
We would certainly have liked better uptake of management options

result of the review, we introduced into the schemes specific measures
that enable farmers to provide supplementary feeding for birds in
winter, to begin to address what is known as the hungry gap between
midwinter and early spring, when seed food is depleted and before other
food sources become available. That simple measure involves providing
seeds on the ground or in hoppers to supplement the seed in stubble and
wild bird seed crops. Another new measure that we introduced in 2013
involved leaving the last cut ryegrass silage unharvested, to allow
grass to set seed and provide a seed source over winter.</hs_Para>

The new scheme will build on the acknowledged successes of the

develop the approach. The directed option choice will enable us to
encourage farmers to maximise the environmental outcomes on their land,
in response to the agreed environmental priorities in their area,
rather than simply seeking the lowest-cost or most convenient options.
In addition, we shall adopt a landscape-scale approach to establishing
NELMS. I hope that that will result in some critical mass and wildlife

are entirely compatible with modern farming practices. I recently had a
meeting with the RSPB, and we discussed some of the good work that they

farmland birds at Hope farm has doubled since 2000, mainly because of
land management undertaken through environmental stewardship. A
particular success has been the fourfold increase in skylark numbers,
which has been achieved simply through skylark plots. The RSPB
representatives described to me how during the drilling of a cereal
crop the drill is shut off periodically to produce the skylark plots.
That is a simple management measure, which does not really affect the
profitability of the farm, but has a huge effect on the skylark
population. I look forward to my meeting with the RSPB and learning
more about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011562000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0001.htm#14011562000077">I

before recovering slightly to £684 million by 2020-21. On 21
November 2013, London Underground, backed by its owner, TfL, and the
Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, announced a policy called “Fit
For The Future—Stations”, which includes closing every
ticket office at all 240 stations, cutting 950 of the 5,750 station
staff positions, which equates to a 17% cut, and removing supervisors
and senior staff from many stations. At the same time as revealing
station staffing cuts and ticket office closures, London Underground
announced with a big fanfare a separate policy of 24-hour
operation at weekends on some tube lines. The timing of that
announcement was greeted by the staff of London Underground and others
as quite a cynical move designed to distract attention from the plans
to close ticket offices and slash station staff

on their Oyster card or contactless payment cards to travel, or they
will have to pay higher prices for paper tickets. Passengers will have
to buy tickets online, if they can, or at shops, and they will have to
find the correct ticket on the self-service machines. Experienced tube
workers have said clearly that there are real fears that errors or
problems with tickets will no longer be resolved at stations, because
there will be no ticket office and of course the shops that sell

1.273 billion in 2013-14 to 1.448 billion in 2020-21. The same plan

me finally counter some of the arguments that TfL put forward, some of
which are bizarre. TfL has said that only 3% of journeys involve a
visit to a ticket office, but that is 100,000 people a day. Even if the
majority do not visit ticket offices, it is essential that there is a
service for those passengers who do. TfL has said that London
Underground’s plan will make its staff more visible around the
stations. I find that difficult to believe when 950 staff—17% of

McDonnell:</Member></B> I will conclude by quickly refuting some more
of TfL’s arguments. TfL said that other countries’
underground systems manage without staff or ticket offices. The London
underground has won international recognition and awards largely due to
having station staff and a good service; many other metros do not. If
we level the service down, it will undermine the whole level of
service. In Washington, which removed all staff and moved to a fully
automated system, the press, after another accident, called the lack of
safety the “price of parsimony”. TfL said that new
technology means that the London underground needs fewer staff. New
technology can improve the London underground, but only if it is used
alongside, not instead of, staffing. Too often, TfL uses increased
mechanisation as an excuse for getting rid of
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000091">Frankly,
we need some clarity on all this. The Minister has a role to play in
what goes on in London. This debate is an opportunity for us to ask him
to intervene. Will he clarify exactly what the discussions were between
the Government and the Mayor that led to the decision to make these
cuts in this way? Ministers have a role to play and one thing the
Minister could do is impress on the Mayor that there has been no public
consultation to date on these cuts. It would be helpful if he joined us
and urged the Mayor to consult Londoners. We are making a simple
request: listen to Londoners. The Minister might be able to help us get

on the equality impact assessment.</hs_Para>

worried about safety. The Minister has a role to play in meeting the
Mayor to look at what assessment has been made of safety in light of
the threats of terrorist attacks and the potential for accidents. The
Mayor has not met the unions for six years. Will the Minister join us
in urging the Mayor to meet the unions? Secretaries of State and
Ministers of this Government meet trade unions almost daily, including
the TUC, the general secretaries, and others from other unions. The
Mayor should at least do that, too. He owes that debt to the unions
that represent these staff. The Minister could play a valuable role
here. If he does not, London MPs will have to play it. We will join in
with those campaigns, with passengers and with trade unions, to try to
ensure that the staff are protected and our ticket offices stay

by London Underground during the London Olympics last year. That was a
great success and a feather in its cap. It is planning to introduce a
new 24-hour service from 2015, and I know from travelling late at night

some people might. Other scenarios include terrorist attacks, people
falling on to the line—it is rare, but unfortunately it does
happen from time to time—wheelchair users needing help or
advice, someone collapsing or falling ill on a station, and someone who
is autistic needing things explained to them if they do not understand.
In all those scenarios, what is needed is advice, which is more readily
available under these proposals. Staff will be in the ticket hall or on
the platforms—in the public areas of the stations—rather
than behind glass at the ticket office. In those scenarios, the
proposals will be an improvement on the current

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member> As
we have heard, 3.5 million journeys are made on the tube every day.
Millions of Londoners use the tube every day, and, next to housing,
public transport is one of the most important issues for ordinary
Londoners’ health and well-being. Londoners have been fortunate:
under the visionary stewardship of Ken Livingstone, first as leader of
the Greater London Council and then as Mayor of London, millions were
invested in London Underground, to do up stations and for new
services—notably the Overground line, of which I am a happy user
every day. I pay my respects to the people who staff Haggerston
station. I congratulate Sir Peter Hendy, whose stewardship of London
Underground in good times and bad has been exemplary. The way he
delivered and kept London moving during the Olympics has been noted on
all sides. Perhaps one day a statue will be raised to him—by
public subscription, of course, not paid for by
taxpayers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000105">Until
now, I should have said that Transport for London has been able to
withstand the worst that Boris Johnson could try to do to it; but now
it is proposed, in one fell swoop and without consultation, to close
every single ticket office. I listened to the explanations read from
the Transport for London briefing of why that is a good idea; but they
sounded like the views of people who do not use the underground. People
who use it will have seen the queues outside ticket offices every day,
particularly on a Monday morning. What are the people who queue up
going to do? People who use the underground will know how often the
machines do not work or gobble up money; they will understand that even
in a relatively small tube station such as Westminster, there are
hundreds of tourists whose first language is not English, who need
someone to talk to.</hs_Para>

well and good to come to the Chamber and read out the Transport for
London briefing; we are talking about the realities of London
Underground, and the reality for the people who must use it, whether
they are regular commuters, people from out of town or the thousands of
tourists who throng through tube 
<?notus-xml column=319?>stations in zones 1 and 2 every day. As the House has already heard, the
millions of London commuters whose fares are being ratcheted up do not
understand why they are paying more to travel when the level of service
may well come down. It is not enough to say, as Transport for London
does, that it is because so many people now use Oyster cards. We need
to think about out-of-town business, the elderly and disabled, and
tourists, and weigh up the promises that there will be more staff on
the stations to help
commuters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000107">The
first thing to consider is how commuters see the proposal and how much
hostility there is to the closing down of every ticket office on the
network. Many members of my family have worked in transport, and I
would always argue that London Underground is only as good as its
staff. Those staff have in good and bad times shown London Underground
exemplary loyalty and a deal of flexibility. On 7/7, they showed how
brave and committed they were. What are they being given for
all those years of commitment—for building the underground
service that still serves Londoners so well? The answer is up to 1,000
job losses and on top of that, and in my view worse, a drive to employ
more agency and casualised staff. We are moving away from secure,
stable jobs that offer a lifetime career to casualised employment. As a
general point, I deplore the hollowing out of London’s economy
through the replacement of stable—and, yes,
unionised—jobs with casualised agency workers. That cannot be in
the interests of a stable society and stable employment in
London.</hs_Para>

regular user of London Transport services and I bow to no one in my
respect for what it has achieved, particularly under a Labour leader

every ticket office without consultation. All the polling shows that
the majority of passengers are unhappy. Boris has yet to explain,
certainly to London MPs, how the proposal can possibly improve the
service. We know that more and more people are using Oyster cards and
that Ken Livingstone introduced a smaller programme of closures when he
was the Mayor, but now we face the elimination of every ticket office
on the network. That cannot be right. I shall fight the closures on
behalf of ordinary Londoners, staff and a London that works—a
stable community that offers jobs and life chances to its citizens.

Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington because it is the one I use

between Network Rail and the Piccadilly and Victoria lines. It is not
well laid out and was never well designed, and it has no ticket
barriers; there is nowhere to put them. There are plans to change the
station, but the changes are some years away. That means the station
becomes very overcrowded, and frequently in the morning rush hour staff
must stand in the street and ask the public not to come in until the
numbers on the platform can be reduced. There is no physical way to
stop them because of the lack of barriers.</hs_Para>

First Capital Connect ticket office and another for London Underground.
For reasons that are beyond me, each seems to deal only with its own
business. It should be possible for them to deal with each
other’s business. The ticket office is very busy, with people
making inquiries about Oyster cards, lost Oyster cards, or student
travel; there are people using the freedom pass, who may have mislaid
it or have a problem using it, and people simply trying to buy tickets
or find where to go. They get a good response and good help from the
very hard-working staff in that station. If the ticket office is
closed, what are they supposed to do? The hon. Member for Hornchurch
and Upminster (Dame Angela Watkinson) gaily told us that only a small
percentage of the total number of travellers will be affected, but as
the hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington said, that is 100,000 people a

Would we really have Wembley stadium operating with only ticket

this plea, we do so to retain jobs, obviously, and to ensure that the
public are properly represented and dealt with in ticket offices. We
also do it from the point of view of station safety, because, in the
days when not enough staff were at the stations and there were only,
quite often, inoperative CCTV cameras inadequately guaranteeing the
safety of passengers, the number of assaults went up and the number of
passengers at night went down, and the number of people trying to drive
in and out of London went up while the number of public transport users

is less congested, and it has a much better sense of

possible in London, where there is massive public opposition and a
strong, well organised, trade unionised work force, which, frankly, has
a tradition of taking industrial action, that will make it very
difficult to fight similar threats in other parts of the country.
However, I assure anybody who is listening that we will fight any
attempt to reduce staff in other parts of the country, and in Ayrshire

reality is that it is in none of our interests to have a transport
system that does not have staff and people on it to look after

We are talking about approximately 1,000 job losses as a result of the
240 ticket office closures in London, affecting not only
ticket office staff but supervisory staff, managerial positions and
staff in control rooms. It is happening as part of Government proposals
to take staff away from our whole public transport system, and in
particular the railways and the tube lines. That is why this debate and
this dispute are relevant to every part of the country.</hs_Para>

days a year to provide the London Underground’s services. They
are fantastic. Look at the tourists from across the globe; we want as
many people coming to London as possible. We do not want to keep them
away for fear of having a dreadful service in London. Look at the
people who work on the underground and the valuable contribution that
they make to the economy, and yet we think nothing of slashing jobs and
stations at the cross of a pen. Millions of ordinary people use the
underground as a means of getting across London to work. We have to
consider all that.</hs_Para>

As my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington said, passenger
journeys on London underground will rise by 13.75%, from
1,273 million to 1,448 million by 2021. London Underground
is a flourishing organisation, which needs more staff, better health
and safety and a whole new structure to cater for the people who will
use the service. I cannot understand how the hon. Member for Hornchurch
and Upminster (Dame Angela Watkinson) can suggest, even with the best
brief in the world, that closing the 240 ticket offices and cutting 950
jobs will be an improvement to the service. Perhaps somebody can
explain to me how it will improve it. We need to make sure that the
service is top class and stop cutting the jobs, and we need to make
sure that the service is there, embracing people from across the globe,
and to get to grips with
reality.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14011581000343" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000343">3.39

to me this is part of a wider ideological assault on the public sector
and on public services. We have heard eloquent testimony today from
hon. Members about the contribution that London Underground staff make
to ensuring that we have a quality service. We should be proud of and
cherish the personal attention that they give members of the public.
The Minister should use his good offices to ensure that the Mayor
recognises the important role that those staff play and that the Mayor
meets their trade union representatives, so that he can hear directly
from them and, we hope, they can change his

are two closely related issues in the debate, and I would like to begin
with the question of station staffing levels, because the

those Londoners whose jobs are at

passenger may experience inconvenience if staffing levels are reduced.
How many of us have come across faulty barriers or ticket machines, but
have known exactly where to find help? How many of us knew where to go
for advice when a service was cancelled, especially late at night?
Clearly, it was the ticket office. Just yesterday, I arrived on the
platform down at Westminster to find services disrupted, so I could not
travel by tube and needed a refund on my Oyster card. I knew that that
service would be provided quickly and courteously by staff in the
ticket office, and of course it
was.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000131">Such
experiences are common to us all, but as my hon. Friend the Member for
Hayes and Harlington set out very clearly, we know that Boris
Johnson’s plans to close all ticket offices and cut 17% of
station staff will hit disabled passengers particularly hard. These are
passengers who Transport for All has warned could face new
barriers in trying to travel to work, to see friends and family and to

are other long-term considerations that have to be addressed, including
the future of London Overground which, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) rightly said, is an
excellent service. Services and stations on the West Anglia lines are
due to be transferred from Greater Anglia to London Overground next
year, and commuters on those lines will be hoping that the promises
made on investment and improvements in service quality will be upheld.
As the Campaign for Better Transport has powerfully argued, the highly
visible improvements that London Overground made in 2007, which
included putting more staff on stations, have improved passenger
satisfaction, driven up revenue and transformed the image of many local
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000148">As
Ministers help to oversee the transition of the lines, will they
satisfy themselves that this round of job losses is not the first step

surely apply: why take that approach to the overground but not the
underground?</hs_Para>

more expensive equipment as they replace ticket-office functions, which
could make them targets for abuse and theft. Of course, the staffing
reductions will be much higher at some stations, raising the prospect
that individual members of staff could be left in unsafe situations,

Member for Hackney North and Stoke Newington (Ms Abbott) spoke about
the great achievements of the previous Mayor, but it is important to
recognise that under the current Mayor, platform staffing levels have
risen by 12% and demand by 23%. The Government recognise that transport
is the key to unlocking growth and jobs, and they provide the financial
settlement that allows the Mayor to fulfil his responsibilities for
transport and operational matters. The Government are providing more
than £10 billion to TfL over the current Parliament, which
includes more than £4.5 billion to support the tube upgrade. The
Jubilee line upgrade has been completed. The Victoria line upgrade
features new trains, tracks 
<?notus-xml column=327?>and signalling and a 21% increase in capacity. The Metropolitan line has
a new fleet of air-conditioned trains. The Government have provided the
Mayor with a guarantee that enables him to move ahead with the proposed
Northern line extension to Battersea. The upgrade of the sub-surface
lines, in which my hon. Friend the Member for Hornchurch and Upminster
and I take a particular interest, will increase overall capacity by
33%. The spending round announcement last summer included a huge

Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) challenged the Mayor on
trust. Memories are short on so many things; I remember the previous
Mayor telling us in 2004 that there would be no increase in fare levels
if he were re-elected, but the following January fares went up by a
minimum of 4%. One must be careful when talking about trust, because
that contention applies as much to Mayor Livingstone as to Mayor
Johnson. The hon. Lady questioned me about fares, and the Mayor has
said clearly that the extra accommodation that is needed can be found
from TfL’s budget by a combination of efficiencies and increased
commercial revenue. In the huge budget provided by the Government,
there is scope for TfL to find the relatively small amount that the
hon. Lady mentioned. The Mayor has decided, quite rightly in my
opinion, to hold London fares down to RPI plus zero. I think it will be
possible to find the amount required to do that, and it will be
sustainable if he continues to deliver efficiencies and value for money
and ensures that the money that the Government give to TfL is best
spent.</hs_Para>

pointed out that London continues to grow. We are set to see a further
1.8 million people by the 2030s, which is enough to fill an extra tube
train per week. It is quite right therefore that TfL set out its vision
for the future of the tube on 21 November. The core commitment at the
front of that vision is that all stations will be staffed and
controlled when trains are running and there will be more staff visible

look at it, the way in which passengers choose to pay for their travel
is changing. That is an incontrovertible fact, even though we may not
like the 3% figure. Over the past five years, demand for travel has
risen by 23%, but ticket office sales have fallen by 43%. At the same
time, to meet customers’ expectations, station staffing needs to
increase. The ticket office is not 
<?notus-xml column=328?>the heart of the station; it is simply a room. The staff are at the
heart of a station’s operation. TfL’s vision for London
will allow them to be better equipped with technology and information

decrease in station staff will be less than that, because TfL proposes
to create 200 new jobs in ticket halls and on stations. Furthermore, as

repairs and manorial rights in Wales and England. As the Minister will
know, such rights are ancient. In the case of chancel rights, they
include the repair of parish churches, particularly Anglican ones. In

extraction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000173">The
matter has been brought to my attention recently when residents of my
constituency became aware of overriding rights, often by accident or
when ownership of titles changed and, once aware, the new owners
attempted to exercise their rights. The problem goes back over decades.
Chancel repairs and manorial rights are very much relics of the past.
Many such rights go back to the Domesday Book, and others have evolved
over many centuries. Often, they have lain dormant while properties
have been built, boundaries extended and land use changed. People have
bought their properties in good faith. They have paid for legal fees
for searches and conveyancing and have not been aware that any
overriding rights exist. Many constituents of mine, and people from

going to say about Anglesey and Lord Treffos. I acknowledge that many
people have raised this issue with the county council, local
councillors and their local Assembly Member, and they have taken it
forward. I have raised it a number of times in this House and the most
appropriate place to raise it is in this House of Parliament, which
confers rights on individuals, including manorial rights, and which
should be protecting the rights of individuals.</hs_Para>

about Lord Treffos in a second but, as has been indicated, this issue
has caused concern in my own constituency because of Lord
Treffos’s claims. However, I have also been contacted over the
weekend by people across Wales and England, including the county of
Wiltshire, where a community council is concerned about the rights
being established—or, rather, it has become aware for the first

to gain assurances from the Government that they will alleviate
people’s concerns. It is one of the unintended

question is why these manorial rights were not included in original
deeds, because many people paid for conveyancing and searches, believed
that they had full freehold and were unaware of these overriding
rights. In the 21st century, those people need the right protection. I
want to examine the role of the Land Registry and how it deals with
issuing notices, as well as the legal tone of those notices. Indeed, in
my part of the world it is important to note that Welsh language
provision was not available when these notices were first sent out,
when by statute it should have been available.</hs_Para>

to look at the role of the legal authorities, which could perhaps lead
in providing collective responses in the future, so that the burden
does not fall on individuals. They could also perhaps look to rebalance
these rights in favour of the freeholder today, to ensure
that—as the hon. Member for Arfon (Hywel Williams)
said—mortgage lenders are aware of the benign nature of these
manorial rights, so that they do not consider them to be a restriction
on the remortgaging or indeed the sale of properties. I ask the
Minister to look very carefully at that issue.</hs_Para>

make no apologies for briefly highlighting the situation in Anglesey,
where there is the ancient title of the Lord Trefoss, which originates
from the Bishop of Bangor’s diocese. The title is today held by
Stephen Paul Hayes, who I understand purchased it, perfectly
legitimately, at an auction in the early 1990s. I now understand that
the title, including the manorial rights of hunting, fishing and
mineral rights, is up for sale on a website for $45,000. I have also
been made aware that a document exists from the district valuer, dating
back to 1950, showing that in 1940 the Bishop of Bangor gave the then
title to University College of North Wales, now Bangor university, and
that the claims of interest in the manor are limited to commons and
waste lands within the provision of the law, including the Property Act
1922. I am not a property lawyer, but I make the point clearly that it
should be possible for individuals to find out the exact titles, and
that information should be included in their deeds. Surely the role of
the Land Registry should be to assist individual freeholders and not to
put out a generic letter that causes so much concern. In
layperson’s terms, any such letter should have explained the
reasons for what the Land Registry is doing, as well as the manorial
rights and
titles.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000192">I
will now move on. I realise that we will now finish at about 4.45 pm,
so I will try to be brief for the rest of my remarks, so that the
Minister can give a full reply to the debate. I want to look at the
role of the local authority in Anglesey, because it too has been issued
with some of these notices as its land falls within the manorial
rights. The first point in the notice that was being distributed by the
Land Registry was that the manorial rights being claimed by Lord
Trefoss are actually contained within the local authority itself. As
Members will know, over the years a lot of responsibilities have been
passed from landowners to local authorities, as County Council Acts in
the 1800s and various other measures have meant that authorities have
taken over services. Today, highways, street lighting and all those
main services are provided by the local authority. The local authority 
<?notus-xml column=332?>could be—in fact, it needs to be—a single body
that could object to manorial rights on behalf of a number
of households within its jurisdiction. That would be a way
forward.</hs_Para>

benefit of the Minister, I will also examine briefly the role of the
Land Registry in the distribution of these notices. The explanatory
notes to the notices attempt to clarify the reasons for the notices
being issued. However, many people have been so concerned that, as the
hon. Member for Montgomeryshire said, they have gone—at great
cost to themselves—to a solicitor for clarification, because
they found the notice to be a little threatening and they were
certainly unable to understand it. Also, as I have already said, there
has been an issue with the lack of Welsh language provision, which is
not acceptable under current statute.</hs_Para>

Regarding the issue of language, however, our local newspaper has come

also allowing the landowner the right of reply, so that he can explain

Owen:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Lady for that intervention. Indeed,
I am in a similar position, but it should have been the duty of the
Land Registry to provide clear and concise notices in the first
instance. It is an unintended consequence of previous Acts that this
method of informing people has come into being, and in the future I
want to see a clearer way by which manorial rights can either be
extinguished or at least explained to individuals. We are singing from

the biggest purchase that they will make in their entire life, and they
want security for themselves and their family. I feel for them in that

rights are certain rights over land that were specifically preserved
when most remnants of the manorial system were abolished in 1926. These
rights may take several forms, but include sporting rights and rights
to timber, mines and minerals. Until recently, those rights bound the
owners and buyers of land, whether they knew about them or not.

of the aims of the Land Registration Act 2002, which I understand
passed through this House without a Division, was to bring more
information on to the register of title, so that it formed a more
complete record of legal ownership. Manorial rights are a good example
of a hidden burden that the policy was designed to expose. The 2002 Act
gave the owners of these rights 10 years to bring them on to the
register to ensure their continued existence. Naturally, the approach
of the 10-year deadline brought forward a number of registrations and,
unsurprisingly, issues around these manorial rights have arisen as the
owners of the rights have had to consider what to do, and some property
owners have been reminded—or perhaps have learned for the first
time—that someone is claiming that their property is subject to
these
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000210">In

conveyancer when they bought. However, in other cases, these rights
were not apparent at the time of purchase, and owners are finding out
about them for the first time when they are contacted by the Land
Registry. The Land Registry has received more than 73,000 applications
to enter a notice claiming manorial rights on properties across England
and
Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000211">Although
I appreciate that letters from the Land Registry have arrived without
warning, there is little that it could do about this. It can only
notify property 
<?notus-xml column=335?>owners that an application has been received, resulting in a notice of a
claimed right being entered on to the register in respect of their
land. The statute requires the notice to be entered. The Land Registry
appreciates that it can cause concern and upset when people receive a
letter from it saying that a third party has protected a claimed
interest. However, that letter gives the property owner an opportunity
to consider the issue. The letters give full details of the third party
making the application, as well as Land Registry details, so residents
can ask for further information if they require it. The Land Registry
has worked with applicants to try to ensure that those affected by
notices are able to access more information via the
applicant.</hs_Para>

Land Registry has also produced a guide for property owners that sets
out in simple terms what these rights may consist of, and what steps an
owner can take if they dispute that the claimed rights affect their
land. That guide is available in English and Welsh, both on the Land
Registry’s website and from any Land Registry office. However,
following discussions with the Land Registry, I confirm that it will

an owner disputes that their property is subject to the rights claimed,
the Land Registry does what it can to help the parties in the dispute.
For example, it encourages the party claiming the rights to
produce its evidence at the earliest possible stage, and in
many cases that brings the matter to a conclusion. The Land Registry
always gives the parties the opportunity to try to resolve their
dispute, and the time to do so. In addition, where it can, the Land
Registry will try to assist, if asked, by expressing its view, based on
the available evidence. However, hon. Members will understand that the
registry must, throughout this process, remain strictly
impartial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000215">Where,
after negotiation, the notice holder decides to withdraw their
notice, the Land Registry arranges for them to lodge a
withdrawal. So far, approximately 6,000 properties have been
voluntarily released from notices. If it is clear that the parties
cannot settle their dispute, the Land Registry is required to send the
case to the land registration division of the property chamber
first-tier tribunal for a judicial decision. In such cases, the
registry has to await, and then act on, the tribunal’s
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000216">The

property owners and those claiming legal rights over properties. It has
therefore produced a guide about the dispute process and the various

the Welsh language, Land Registry policy is to send communications in
the recipient’s language of preference, if that is clear from
the register. If the language preference appears to be English because
there is no contrary indication on the register, communications will be
sent in English. If it is apparent from the register or from any
subsequent contact that the recipient prefers Welsh, however, the Land
Registry will communicate in Welsh. The Land Registry’s website
has extensive information in Welsh. It would prefer to continue to try
to meet the personal preferences of recipients, rather than send large

customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000218">The
hon. Gentleman mentioned that there has been quite a lot of publicity
suggesting that the existence of manorial rights has caused difficulty
in getting property loans. The Land Registry has been monitoring the
situation and, where it has been able to contact individuals who may
have been affected, those individuals usually, but not always, turn out
not to have been affected. We know that in some cases there has been a
short delay in granting a loan because of an earlier application by the
property owner to remove the notice. The lender would have wished to
ensure that any dispute had been resolved before proceeding. In one
case, the property owner changed lawyers because of concerns about the
advice given, and the change in lawyers enabled the loan to be granted.
The Land Registry stands ready to assist anyone else facing similar
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000219">The
fact that a notice has been entered in the register does not
necessarily mean that the right claimed actually exists. Whether the
right exists will depend on the facts of the case. Home owners and
other landowners remain as free as they were before the legislation to
contest a claim. The requirement to enter a notice to protect manorial
rights removes uncertainty and unpredictability by making it apparent
that such rights are claimed. It is a positive development for property
owners in general that such rights have to be recorded on the register
and may be lost if they are not recorded. Registration of manorial
rights is, of course, distinct from exercising those rights. In the
case of mineral rights, to which the hon. Gentleman referred at the end
of his remarks, planning consent is required in the normal
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000220">I
am happy to write to hon. Members who have spoken and interjected on
the points raised. The registration requirement will ultimately achieve
a better balance between the interests of the owners of manorial
rights, the interests of those who are subject to the rights, and the
interests of those who may at some time in the future purchase a
property affected by such rights. I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman

million of that is provided directly by PCCs to ACPO centrally, with
the remainder almost all going to national policing units still
overseen by ACPO—something that I and other members of the

PCCs to whom I have spoken do not in any way interpret recommendation
4, on having a change management programme, as a criticism of the Home
Office; rather, they see it as an offer to work with the Home Office to
ensure that the transition from ACPO happens, and to provide a final
year of funding to do so. The Parker report’s other three
recommendations also strongly support the changes to the policing
landscape driven by the Home Office, and they will be welcomed by
members of the Select Committee, and by many chief constables who are
perhaps not part of the ACPO in-group, if I may describe it in that
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000224">The

Select Committee would probably also add that Alex Marshall and the
College of Policing are in charge. The College of Policing is a new
body that will take time to get into its stride, which I believe it is
now doing. It is important that chief constables look to Alex Marshall,
who is operationally in charge of the college, to provide that
leadership, because it now happens through the College of Policing,
rather than through
ACPO.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000226">Recommendation

an important stake in the speed of decision-making and the priorities

review, which praises the historic work of ACPO, recommends a
collective national policing function to conduct operational and
managerial co-ordination, and argues for reform. It has been embraced
by ACPO and supported by the Association of Police and Crime
Commissioners, which are now collaborating in a transitional board.
Does he accept the importance of a focus akin to that which ACPO has
provided historically? Whatever the future reforms, there should be
that focus on the effective co-ordination of operational and managerial

oversight. As I said in my maiden speech, if Labour is now not the
party of democratic oversight, 
<?notus-xml column=339?>which the right hon. Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw)
has an honourable record in pushing, but of ACPO, then it can stand on
that basis, but that is a sad change. I am not sure whether, in the
shadow Minister’s remarks, there was a degree of confusion
between ACPO and the National Police Coordination Centre, in terms of
that national co-ordinating role during times of crisis—the most
obvious recent example is the riots. Everyone agrees that that role is
required, but we need appropriate oversight of that, and there is
appropriate oversight in that centre. The president of ACPO does not
have direction and control; he is one of a number of people serving on
the new body, which includes representation from the Cabinet Office and
the Home Office. That is the right
model.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000236">It
is perfectly fine to discuss and develop the idea of whether chief
constables need a collective view, and whether or not the body should
be called the chief constables’ council. The traditional
tripartite model involves the chief constable and the police authority
locally, and the Home Office setting the national framework.
Unfortunately, over several decades, ACPO began undemocratically to set
that national framework centrally, when it is much more appropriate for
such things to be delivered locally and with democratic oversight. If
there is to be a chief constables’ council, which is perfectly
sensible, it should be run by a part-time chair elected by the
members—even ACPO was run in that way before 2003. There is no
need for some great legal entity and superstructure that has human
resources, finance and legal functions; it can operate like the other
business areas. The elected chair could use his staff officer and a
number of officers within the local force as appropriate, with the
costs falling as they lie with the business area. That is the
appropriate model, which would allow chief constables to work together,
with the chair speaking on their behalf when appropriate. That is all
that is required, and we must be sure that the transition does not
allow a revamped ACPO to return from the
dead.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14011581000350" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000350">4.53

discussion between chief constables, but far more than that has been
accumulated and gone into the new structure, as I have seen in many
cases. Several years ago, the Cambridgeshire police authority was told
that it had to agree a particular policy on Tasers, because it had been
mandated by ACPO. The police authority should have known better than to
accept the policy, but that is what it was told, in writing, from the
chief constable at the time. That is simply inappropriate. It is not up
to ACPO to set that sort of
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000241">The
Parker review is deeply critical on several points, as was summarised
by my hon. Friend. Some things have been annoying many of us for a long
time, such as the fact that it is a private limited company and exempt
from freedom of information requests. In fairness, the president, who
is on the parliamentary estate today, has highlighted those as things
that he would like to change, but I have not seen them change yet. We
have the opportunity to change things now as a result of the Parker

constables’ council, yes to a place for chief constables to
talk, engage and interact, and yes to it having a part-time chair, who
should have support and be able to be involved with operational
policing. ACPO should be trimmed down, with far more responsibilities
lying with accountable bodies, and far less of the power that it has
accumulated. Many people at ACPO have worked hard and with the best of
intentions, but it has not been accountable, and it has led to a few

jobs to ex-officers without following the procurement processes that it
created displays a form of corruption. It is a club working in its own
interests. The report does not identify that, just as it does not
identify the organisation’s moral vacuum. There have been many
challenges to our police service, but has this organisation reviewed
the issue of better leadership, or what should be done? Has it looked
at how many women are in the senior leadership of our police forces?
Has it looked at ethnic minorities? Has it challenged itself? Has it
looked at new entrants into the forces? Has it looked at why white
males largely dominate the senior positions within our police? It has
not. For those reasons, we should draw a line under ACPO. The PCCs
should not give this organisation a penny piece beyond some
transitional funding. The Home Office should be much more focused on
ensuring that any money that it pays for ongoing projects does not seep
over into the overall running of this organisation. ACPO is finished
and should be wound up; the sort of organisation outlined by my hon.

Minister for Policing, Criminal Justice and Victims (Damian
Green):</Member></B> It is always a pleasure to serve under your
chairmanship, Mr Rosindell. It was also a particular pleasure to hear
some thoughtful and trenchant views in the course of this short debate.
Those who spoke, most of whom are members of the Home Affairs
Committee, have thought about the subject deeply and long. Furthermore,
the right hon. Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz), the Chair of the
Select Committee, said that a report is gestating; as ever, we look
forward to its birth. I was especially grateful to the right hon.
Gentleman for saying that he was “excited” about the new
policing landscape. There were many reasons why we conducted such a
widespread and radical reform of the police. It was extremely necessary
to improve policing in this country. It is an uncovenanted and added
bonus that it excites the Chair of the Select
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000247">The
time is right, amid all this change, to look again at the role of ACPO
to ensure that it has adapted to the massive change and reform
programme introduced by the Government, because the whole of the
policing landscape has been reformed. As was said by my hon. Friend the
Member for Rochester and Strood (Mark Reckless), who introduced the
debate so thoughtfully, police and crime commissioners have given
communities a greater say in policing and introduced new lines of
accountability for chief constables. Also, the Independent Police
Complaints Commission has been strengthened to ensure the highest
standards of police integrity, which is clearly an ever more important
reform; the National Crime Agency has been created to lead the fight
against serious and organised crime; the inspectorate of constabulary
has been made more independent; and the College of Policing has been
established to provide professional standards for policing. It is
therefore essential that ACPO’s functions are now delivered
within the ethos of the new policing landscape.</hs_Para>

the short time—a little more than a year—that PCCs have
been in office, they have innovated by developing strategies to tackle
drug and alcohol misuse and the problem of people with mental health
problems being held in custody cells; they have worked with young
people to improve engagement; and they have driven innovation in
technology to improve policing. They have done all that while holding
their forces to account and scrutinising police performance. Many PCCs
have wasted no time in introducing new processes to hold chief
constables to account for the delivery of the PCC-prepared police and
crime plans and in driving value for money. All that has fundamentally
changed the accountability process in and governance of policing for
the better. I am grateful for the endorsement of that change in the
tone of the debate so
far.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000249">PCCs
have reviewed the role and remit of ACPO within that new
context—this is essential, and I very much welcome it. Various
hon. Members have talked about the Parker review, which demonstrates
that PCCs are providing an impetus to reform at the national as well as
the local level. They are of course innovating and delivering policing
more efficiently in each of their individual areas, and not only have
they brought real local accountability to how chief constables and
their forces perform, but they are working hard to ensure that their
local communities have a stronger voice in
policing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000250">Everything
is happening against the economic and fiscal background with which we
are familiar. In the current climate, it is essential to drive
innovation and transformation that deliver value for money, so that
savings can be made and priority given to front-line policing. PCCs are
doing this at the same time as they are delivering against their
national responsibilities, which I hope is putting an end to the view
of some people that that is a weakness of PCCs. I think that it is a
strength.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000251">I

about to come on to the college and its vital, central role in future,
but first I will point out the one part of the Parker review with which
I disagree: the need for a centralised change management programme for
police reform, potentially run from the Home Office. That is exactly
what we do not need and is very much against the ethos of the more
accountable, locally driven and bottom-up police service that we are
introducing. That is one of the reasons why I am so glad that the PCCs
have grasped the nettle of reform themselves, because it shows that we
do not need a small group in the Home Office driving all
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000259"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Reckless" PimsId="5627" UID="14011581000423" xid="1136" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000423">Mark

report in that way. I can see how the Minister might, reading it
broadly, but that has not been their interpretation, to the extent that
change management is needed and the Home Office’s co-operation
with that is desired. I believe that is an issue for the transitional
final year funding that PCCs are prepared to offer to help the Home

said. I am conscious that PCCs want to do that. I am not saying that
there is no role for the Home Office—there is of course a role

committee precisely so that the legitimate interest that the Home

of ACPO in the round. It concluded that reform was needed to ensure
that chief constables have a forum with functions and structures that
fit the new police reform landscape. I support that objective. The
changes to the policing landscape that followed the publication of the
review of ACPO will take time to 
<?notus-xml column=346?>unfold. Once those changes take place, it will be essential that they
work. We have already seen the changes the Government have made to this
part of the policing landscape through the creation of the college.
Those changes have worked because they have been supported by all parts
of policing—by chief constables, PCCs, the Police
Superintendents Association, the Police Federation and those trade
unions that have members who are police staff. The changes to ACPO need
to be worked through in exactly the same
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011581000271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/halltext/140115h0002.htm#14011581000271">I

their opposition to capping the total number of IAS on the proposed

Thurso:</Member></B> We are continuing the exercise, described in my
previous answer, that aims to ensure that contractors and
subcontractors providing services to the House pay those workers
assigned to our services the LLW. Discussions are taking place with two
contractors who have dedicated workers carrying out a service on the
Estate who do not currently pay all of those workers the LLW. We are
doing the same with two companies who use a subcontractor based outside
London to provide services to the House. These discussions might be
prejudiced by naming the contractors, and the individual workers are
entitled to privacy in relation to the wages they are paid. The wider
exercise of identifying the wages paid by more than 750 contractors and
subcontractors providing services to the House continues at pace but is
a massive task. Where instances of non-payment of a living wage are
found, steps are being taken to address this. I will be able to provide
a fuller update on the outcome of this process by the middle of
April.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/43A6274889D9ED177526626A02A10E6334A0DA58" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="15 January 2014">Wednesday

Solicitor-General:</Member></B> The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) is
committed to the effective and efficient prosecution of cases in every
police force area in England and Wales. The CPS Board has concluded
that there are real operational benefits to the CPS in consolidating
its teams into fewer, larger—digitally enabled—regional
hubs. In addition to unlocking worthwhile financial savings, the office
consolidations which have already taken place have allowed teams
carrying out similar work to combine, accrue the benefits of economies
of scale, sustain performance and increase resilience.</hs_Para>

in CPS estate has not altered the fact that on a daily basis CPS
lawyers and administrators work very closely with police colleagues to
prosecute cases, including face to face meetings where these are
appropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140115101000387" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/text/140115w0001.htm#140115101000387">At
the same time as making the changes to its operating model the CPS has
undertaken to provide the police with certain core commitments ranging
across the provision of advice, charging decisions, advocacy in court,
bespoke services for serious and complex cases, joint (CPS/Police)
performance reviews, single points of contact to discuss issues or
concerns, and regular meetings at senior management levels both locally
and nationally, to both maintain and build on current working
relationships.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140115101000388" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/text/140115w0001.htm#140115101000388">The
introduction of digital working by the CPS and wider criminal justice
system also means that its work can be conducted without reference to
current geographical or process boundaries. For example, national
charging arrangements for volume cases were introduced in April 2013
administered by CPS Direct (CPSD). This provides a 24 hour digital and
telephony charging service for every police force regardless of
location. Equally, digitally enabled remote working now allows
prosecutors to work at short notice, when required, with the police in
police stations and
courts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140115101000389" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/text/140115w0001.htm#140115101000389">The
net effect of the changes to the CPS' operating model in terms of
estates and digital working is therefore intended to enable prosecutors
to provide a better service than ever before to the police in terms of
expertise and
advice.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="140115101000045" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/text/140115w0001.htm#140115101000045">Fraud</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="140115101000390" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/text/140115w0001.htm#140115101000390"><B><Member PimsId="4821" UID="140115101001523" xid="857" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/text/140115w0001.htm#140115101001523">Emily

next financing period for European Union (EU) development assistance,
covering 2014-2020. 
<?notus-xml column=571?>My officials are working closely with counterparts in the Commission,
the European External Action Service and other member states to ensure
that gender equality is fully integrated in the legal regulations and
operational guidelines that form the framework for EU development
programmes over that period. We want to see EU development assistance
geared towards empowering girls and women, to enable them to have
voice, choice and control, as we are doing in our bilateral programmes.
The hon. Member for Stone's Private Member's Bill, which this
Government supports, aims at adding further drive and focus to HMG's
strong commitment to support for girls and women as part of the UK's
international development effort. If passed into law we see this as a

Penning:</Member></B> In the timeframe for this question, the
Department has let many of its contracts via cross-Government
arrangements put in place by the Crown Commercial Service (CCS),
formerly the Government Procurement Service. Thus the need to enter
into collaborative procurement exercises with other Government
Departments has been minimal. Going forward, the restructuring of the
DWP's commercial function where some of our contract teams migrate
directly to CCS will mean this trend will continue and is likely to
increase. Those categories that remain under DWP control may be
sufficiently distinct to this Department to make the need for
collaboration with other Departments less likely.</hs_Para>

have legal responsibilities under the Data Protection Act (DPA) 1998

and shared. This is not a new requirement and does not just relate to
care.data. The leaflet is not just about care.data but all uses of data

the first phase of the Oxford Flood Risk Management Strategy which
seeks to reduce flood risk to 3,600 homes and businesses. This includes
£2.5million of investment in de-silting channels, increasing the
capacity of structures and providing temporary defences. The

technical solutions and funding options for reducing flooding in

Rogerson:</Member></B> Various assessments have been made of the costs
of implementing the Water Framework Directive (WFD) in England and
Wales. One of the most recent was to inform the first River Basin
Management Plans, which set objectives and programmes of measures for
the period 2009-15. This estimated a total cost of £300 million
arising from actions undertaken in that first cycle alone. Benefits
have also been
assessed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140115101001391" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140115/text/140115w0002.htm#140115101001391">The
most recent assessment by Government of the full costs of
WFD implementation was made after adoption of the Directive. For
England and Wales an annual cost of £900 million was estimated.
The Environment Agency is now updating this analysis of WFD costs as
part of the review of River Basin Management Plans for 2015-21. Draft
Plans will be subject to a six-month consultation later this year. When
Ministers agree the final plans, they will take into account the
balance of costs and benefits and the appropriate phasing of
improvements over this period (to 2021) and beyond to
2027.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Correction" ColStart="11"><?date 2014-01-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_15_PT_1/84F269796DEF414667A05BB651A0DCB3898235BE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 January 2014">Wednesday
