Clark:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The purpose of
individual electoral registration is to make sure that those who vote
are those who are entitled to vote, so the accuracy of the register is
important as well. It is not just important, vital though it is, for
voting, because identity fraud is often associated with a fraudulent
entry on the electoral register. In fact, the Metropolitan police found
that nearly half of fraudulent IDs corresponded with a fraudulent entry
on the register. That is another good reason why this change is
important.</hs_Para>

answered a question or two once in a while. The real reason that
thousands of people were stuck in hospital over Christmas is that cuts
to elderly care make it harder to discharge patients back home. Those
cuts also have a knock-on impact on A and E. Official figures show that
over Christmas, 13 patients had to wait at least 12 hours on trolleys
before being found beds. What message does the Deputy Prime Minister

unaddressed for 13 years. We have offered £3.8 billion to local

of widespread public concern, and my hon. Friend will know that local
public services are funded on a needs-based formula, which relates in
large part to the number of people in a local area. The changes in
population in a local area are reflected in the funding settlements for
our schools and health system. To that extent, changes in local
population are of course reflected in the funding provided to our local
services. More generally, I think we all need to work together to
ensure the public have confidence that we have a firm but fair
immigration system that welcomes to this country people who want to
contribute to the United Kingdom and play by the rules. We must,
however, stamp out abuse and illegality, and ensure that in the
European Union, for instance, the right to move to look for work is not
synonymous—as it was in the past—with the right to claim

net immigration. I very much want to see this happen more quickly, with
the reintroduction of exit checks that have been removed in the past

infrastructure investment is clearly needed, which is why, in my view,
High Speed 2 will play such a galvanising role in healing the
north-south divide. We need to liberate local areas, such as with the
Tees Valley city deal, so that they can make their own economic
fortunes rather than constantly being at the beck and call of decisions
made in Whitehall; and we need to celebrate the fact that, unlike

comments and I strongly agree with him. At the end of this Parliament,
we will have left England in particular significantly more devolved in
how money and powers are allocated than it has been for a very long
time. For instance, the devolution of business rates, which is often
unremarked upon, is probably the greatest act of fiscal devolution for
a very long time. I strongly agree that devolution should be not just
an urban phenomenon, and at the heart of the local growth deals lies
exactly the promise that city deals in urban areas will be extended to
rural areas too.</hs_Para>

Parliament’s will is that they should be, it is my job to

enunciated

serious offences would ever be referred. But there needs to be finality
in sentencing and, of course, if many more cases are referred, that

various offences under the Sexual Offences Act 2003, to which we have

not to end up with a system where the Court of Appeal becomes the

although it is also right to say to my hon. Friend that the previous
practice, whereby the prosecuting counsel could have no contact
whatever with the witness, is now at an end. There is now an
opportunity for an introduction and an explanation of how the court
process is likely to develop, which I think is a great improvement.
That said, there should be no suggestion that a witness is being
coached, which my hon. Friend will appreciate could undermine a
prosecution case. Those two things have to be balanced. A point that
was always made to me when I prosecuted was the absolute necessity of
informing witnesses, introducing oneself to them and keeping them
informed within the bounds of propriety and the court process about
what is actually going on, including talking to witnesses who turn up
to find that they are not needed because the defendant has pleaded
guilty. It is important to explain that to them.</hs_Para>

there will also continue to be some information on contempt available

Minister for Europe (Mr David Lidington):</Member></B> I have been
asked to reply. The European Council focused on three things: defence;
economic and monetary union; and EU enlargement and association
agreements. On defence, the Prime Minister made it clear that NATO
would remain the bedrock of our national defence. As a result of United
Kingdom lobbying, NATO’s Secretary-General Rasmussen was invited
to attend and address the Council as a symbol of the importance of the
European Union’s efforts, which complement rather than duplicate
the role of NATO in our collective security. It is right for European
countries to co-operate on defence issues such as tackling piracy, and
this country has consistently supported other European allies,
including the French efforts in Mali. However, it is important that
defence co-operation is driven by nations themselves, on a voluntary
basis, according to their own priorities and needs, and not by the
Brussels
institutions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010734000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0001.htm#14010734000004">My
right hon. Friend the Prime Minister ensured that the conclusions
excluded any ambiguous language or proposals that could lead to new
bureaucracy, new EU institutions or increased EU competence on defence
and security matters, including any ambitions to own dual-use
capabilities such as remotely piloted air systems. The conclusions of
the Council were clear that nations, not the EU institutions, were in
the driving seat of defence policy and would remain
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010734000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0001.htm#14010734000005">On
economic and monetary union, the United Kingdom is not in the eurozone
and will not be joining the euro, but we want our trading partners in
Europe to have a strong and stable currency and we support their
efforts to achieve that, provided that Britain’s interest are
properly protected. My right hon. Friend ensured that there would be no
financial liability for this country from banking union or from any
future euro area mechanism of loans or guarantees for eurozone
countries The conclusions also reiterate the importance of making the
EU more competitive, including cutting red tape for
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010734000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0001.htm#14010734000006">On
enlargement and association agreements, the European Council welcomed
the initialling of association agreements with Moldova and Georgia, and
made it clear that the EU’s offer to Ukraine remained open. The
United Kingdom has long supported enlargement  because the
prospect of EU membership has proved a huge driver for peace,
prosperity and reform across our continent. My right hon. Friend made
it clear that he continued to support enlargement and saw it as one of
the European Union’s greatest strengths. At the same time,
however, he argued that when new countries join the EU in future, we
should look again at the transitional arrangements for the free
movement of workers. He argued, too, that the free movement of workers
was different from the free movement of people seeking the best benefit
deal. Other member states share our concerns about this matter, and we
look forward to continuing those discussions over the coming
year.</hs_Para>

here today, it is the Prime Minister who is meant

Prime Minister not here today? If he has a good excuse for not being
here today, why could he not have made a statement yesterday? Is it now
Government policy not to make statements following European Council

statement, that even if the Prime Minister had to make such a

the official Council conclusions. The written statement makes it clear
that there will be no EU ownership, no EU headquarters, no reference to
Europe’s armed forces, no European pooled acquisition
mechanisms, no EU assets and fleets, no EU drones and no EU air-to-air
refuelling tankers. Of course, that leaves one to wonder what there

Lidington:</Member></B> First, I am grateful for the hon. Lady’s
words of welcome. Let me respond to her first question by reminding her
that since May 2010 my right  hon. Friend the Prime Minister
has made no fewer than 18 oral statements here following Councils that
took place while Parliament was sitting—that is double the
number of such oral statements given by his immediate 
<?notus-xml column=175?>predecessor. It has been the practice of successive Governments not to
make an oral statement following Councils taking place during a recess,
and my right hon. Friend therefore made a full written ministerial
statement on Monday, which set out in detail the key outcomes from this
Council.</hs_Para>

Lady’s important points about common security and defence
policy, the key is to understand the distinction between ownership by
the EU of defence capabilities, which we do not support and have
resisted successfully, and co-operation by European countries in
providing greater defence and security capabilities. What was good
about the conclusions both of the December European Council and of the
previous week’s Foreign Affairs Council on CSDP matters was that
they made it very clear that the EU first had to work with, and not
duplicate, the efforts of NATO and work alongside other partners in
different parts of the world. Secondly, they made it clear that the EU
would look for ways in which to encourage co-operation on capabilities,
for example, on drones, which she mentioned. That is not some new
EU-directed operation, but a facility that individual members of the EU
can decide whether or not to take part in. There is no secret plan to
direct some Euro drone out of the Berlaymont; it is very different. It
is about co-operation between willing member
states.</hs_Para>

defence industry point, the conclusions made it clear that the European
defence sector needed to become more competitive and efficient. The
language that we successfully negotiated makes it clear that rather
than there being any question of European national champions, the
defence sector must comply with European law, which means that there
must not be illegal state subsidies, except where subsidies are
explicitly protected under the treaties. The language also makes it
very clear that we, or indeed any other country, are not in any way
constrained from continuing to work with the United States or other
international partners on our defence industries. When the hon. Lady
comes to look in more detail at the conclusions, I hope that she will
agree that it was a good outcome for the United Kingdom and a
successful negotiation.</hs_Para>

about CSDP matters, I do not agree with him. I, too, want to see a
European arm of the Atlantic alliance that is more credible and
effective than it is at the moment. That is certainly a message that I
hear consistently from the other side of the Atlantic as well. But
there is a difference between that and the European Union and its
institutions owning and directing those policies. What we support and
advocate is a system in which European countries take more seriously
their obligations to deliver effective security and defence
contributions to that trans-Atlantic alliance, and that is where the
conclusions of the European Council represented a clear victory for our
vision. It advocated an emphasis on capabilities and political
commitment, not on new EU institutions and not on the EU ownership.
Rather, it insisted on the EU complementing NATO and working with the
grain of member state responsibility and competence over defence
policy.</hs_Para>

European co-operation in defence to be based on nation states putting
their forces into joint operations when appropriate, which works very
well with the naval counter-piracy mission and various land operations

efforts to the Pacific and is taking 20% of its defence spend out of

we not only managed to secure important and positive British interests
that take the development of the common security and defence policy in
the direction that the UK has long advocated, but—and she
omitted to mention this in her question—we secured key
safeguards on the operation of the banking union to ensure that the
taxpayers of this country are not liable for the consequences of any
solvency decision made by our eurozone colleagues. The Opposition might
have had the grace to pay tribute to what the Prime Minister achieved;
otherwise people might come to think that the Opposition are somehow

illegal workers and quadrupling the fine for paying people below the
statutory minimum wage. Under the previous Labour Government, the fine
for paying somebody below the minimum wage was £5,000 per

Minister that the observations made by the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) and my hon. Friend the Member for Stone (Mr Cash)
illustrate that there is no reduction in the enthusiasm of some of our
continental partners about creating an EU defence identity in conflict
with NATO? Should not those countries be working within NATO to
strengthen NATO’s capabilities as the United States inevitably
reduces its interest in Europe in favour of the Pacific? I remind my

to this Government, are written into law. If my hon. Friend looks again
at the detail of the language in the European Council and Foreign
Affairs Council conclusions, he will see a welcome emphasis on the need
for the EU to complement NATO and the importance of capabilities. The
issue of an EU operational headquarters, which was the cause of a

evidence that we are winning the argument on the direction in which the

the hon. Gentleman is right on that point, although  of course
it in part reflects the fact that the majority of people from elsewhere
in the EU who are here are of working age and not retired and in
receipt of pensions, so it is not an exact comparison. I very much
agree that we should acknowledge that the great majority of people from
other EU countries who come here do so to work, to pay taxes and to
contribute to society, but that does not mean that we should dismiss
the cases in which 
<?notus-xml column=179?>there is evidence that people have either tried to exploit our benefits
system or have engaged in organised or perhaps low-level but still very
antisocial crime. It is right that action is taken to tighten up access

the CSDP within the European Union as we look to our co-operative
defence and security arrangements, bilaterally with other European
countries and with countries elsewhere in the world, as mechanisms by
which we can enhance and strengthen the United Kingdom’s
security and defence and take forward our global security objectives.
Provided that that is done in the right way without the accretion of
new powers to EU institutions or the establishment of new EU
institutions, then we can succeed in benefiting from sensible,
pragmatic co-operation between willing European countries in  a

support themselves, from those who are not able to do so—a
principle of free movement to work which benefits a large number of
United Kingdom citizens as well as people from other European Union
countries. Secondly, when we come to look towards future enlargement of
the European Union—we are some years away from any other country
being ready to join the EU—we need to revisit the issue of
transitional controls and ask ourselves whether simply having a
specified, perhaps somewhat arbitrary, number of years after which all
controls come off is the right way to address the issue. My right hon.

direction from all 28 Heads of State and Government that the
Commission should stick to what is given under the treaties, that there
should be no attempt at competence creep and that there should be no
move towards national European champions or a circumvention of the
freedom of member states to strike sensible defence partnerships with
countries outside Europe, and instead that the Commission should work
on ways to make Europe’s defence industries more competitive and

Romania, Bulgaria and other accession countries. The treaty of
accession, which was negotiated by the last Government and agreed by

controls on migration from Romania and Bulgaria should continue for a
maximum of seven years. We were right to put transitional controls in
place for the full seven-year period. Unlike in the case of the 2004

complementing and not duplicating or being a substitute for NATO was
reinforced by the presence of Secretary-General Rasmussen at the

On a point of order, Mr Speaker. At 5.15 pm on Sunday
at Her Majesty’s prison Oakwood, which is managed by G4S, a
group of prisoners refused to be locked down. That led to a
10-hour disturbance in which they allegedly barricaded the
Cedar wing and smashed windows. According to the BBC, up to 50
prisoners were involved, and eventually officers in riot gear had to
enter the prison. We now know from leaked reports today that there was
another disturbance back in November. Staff in riot gear were again
deployed to a disturbance involving 18 prisoners, most of whom were
said to be drunk and armed with pool cues, and who threatened prison
officers and lit small paper fires. The following week, there were five
outbreaks of violence in which staff or prisoners were attacked. We are

demonstrated that it was easier to obtain drugs than a bar of soap,

They are deeply rooted in their local communities and provide great
support and personal services. They are well supported by leagues of
friends who work tirelessly to raise funds and improve services and

is much closer to home than many other health facilities, and they have

hospitals such as the one I represent in Deal in my constituency have a
real role in the future of the NHS. They provide cheaper care beds than
an acute hospital can provide; they are a good basing for community
services and a potential engine for bringing together health and social
care in our community. They relieve the bed blocking pressure on busy
acute hospitals where beds are often scarce. They do intermediate
care—step up, step down, end-of-life care, palliative
care—very well. It is better to have care that is local and more
cost-effective, and such hospitals are well positioned to help with an
ageing
population.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0001.htm#14010751000021">Community
hospitals up and down the land provide diverse services. Deal hospital
serves a population of 36,000, and services include minor injuries,
diagnostics such as X-rays, care beds, antenatal care, mental health
support, community clinics for cardiac nurses, sexual health, baby
clinics, eye tests, dietary advice, and even a dental suite.
Out-patient clinics are also provided. Sadly, the local acute trust
wants to withdraw those services, but my case is that where
patients—particularly elderly patients—find it hard to
travel, we must be more understanding with our out-patient services,
and more careful to provide them locally. With an ageing population and
people who find it hard to travel long distances, it is important that
we can carry out more local services in our community
hospitals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0001.htm#14010751000022">With
the transfer of many community hospitals to the NHS PropCo, many were
worried—at least in Deal, and more widely—that the
hospital would close. I ran a campaign to save the hospital that saw
2,500 local households—that is 20%—answer a survey, and
more than 400 people pack into a public meeting. Those institutions are
cared about deeply. People care about community hospitals; they want to
save them and to know they have a secure future. They worry about their
hospital being in the PropCo, and those concerns will not be reduced by
today’s report in the <I>Financial Times</I> about the
difficulties that PropCo has had.</hs_Para>

communities should be able to own their hospitals if they wish. Many
will ask, “How we can possibly allow that? How can people in
local communities have responsibility to look after a community
hospital? Look at them—they have straw in their hair, green
wellies, and they can barely speak English.” My answer is
simple: many, possibly most, community hospitals were founded by public
subscription in local community trusts. As people did it then, so they
could again. I think we can trust our communities to run hospitals
properly and competently, and history teaches us that they did it very
well in the past.</hs_Para>

not have community hospitals back in local ownership? Why cannot
community trusts take back those hospitals and social enterprises?
Whether it is the big society, localism, Labour’s co-operative

concept, idea and ideal. Why cannot GPs take up the management and have
right of admission, as they used to? This is not just an issue for
Deal, which I represent, but a concern up and down the land. There are
clever people up and down the land, as well as brilliant leagues of
friends who do much good work. There are community hospitals such as

important to remind the House of several key points. The first, 
<?notus-xml column=195?>and in my view one of the most important points, is that we must
remember the sufferers of this dreadful condition in everything we
debate today. Mesothelioma is a fatal disease caused only by exposure
to asbestos and while its severity can be affected by other factors, it
is effectively a disease contracted simply as a consequence of going to
work. Doctors who treat meso victims will tell you that it is by far
the worst type of lung cancer you can contract, and unfortunately it is
likely to cause not only a swift death but an incredibly painful
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000047">Mesothelioma
is not an industrial working-class disease. Although it may be more
prevalent among those who have lagged ships or worked in heavy
industry, the truth is that anyone exposed to asbestos can become a
victim of mesothelioma. We are seeing an increasing number of teachers
suffering from this disease and of course there are those who contract
it via secondary exposure, such as the wives who washed their
husbands’
overalls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000048">Medical
research to help ease the pain and suffering of those who contract
mesothelioma is essential, but we must also try and find a cure, not
least because we know that the peak of those to be diagnosed is yet to
come. Nearly 2,500 people will die from meso this coming year and over
the next 25 years some 60,000 might die from the disease, but research
into this cancer is shamefully
underfunded.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000049">Before

insurers—AXA, Zurich and RSA—to provide funding of more
than £2.5 million to the British Lung Foundation to invest in
research projects. It was good to meet many of my former colleagues at
a reception held in the House last year to see progress on some of
those projects, one of which has been the incredibly important
development of a meso-bank. The meso-bank collects tissue and blood
samples from sufferers and will provide an opportunity for fundamental
and translational research, which will help not only those with the
condition in the UK but those in developing countries where the export
and use of asbestos has been less controlled—an issue that the
right hon. Gentleman also raised in Committee.</hs_Para>

meso-bank there have been other projects including those being run at
the Queen Alexandra hospital in Portsmouth, which is looking
at whether specialist palliative care immediately after diagnosis could
help relieve the symptoms of mesothelioma, and that at the University
of Sheffield which is looking at different treatment packages to
relieve pain from this awful disease. Those projects are excellent,
top-quality research projects, which would not have been possible
without the initial grant from the big four insurers, but unfortunately
the funding comes to an end this year, which is somewhat disappointing
given that we are about to start the upward trend in those being
diagnosed with
mesothelioma.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000051">Sadly,
meso research funding lags far behind that of other cancers with
similar mortality rates. Myeloma and melanoma had £5 million and
£5.5 million spent on research respectively, which is about 10
times more than on meso—the irony being that the UK has the
highest death rate from mesothelioma in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000052">The
amendments would kick-start a long-term secure funding stream for
further medical research into mesothelioma by placing a hypothecated
levy on all members of the industry, not just the big four. There is
concern about whether that would create a precedent 
<?notus-xml column=196?>for such a levy, but that precedent already exists.
We have seen levies placed on the gambling industry, under the Gambling
Act 2005, to fund projects related to addiction, and on lotteries, for
similar reasons. Levies have also been placed on utility companies.
This could be done for the right reasons—to provide essential
funding for research

have read <I>Hansard </I>for the previous discussion on this matter, so
I know that the Minister pledged to raise the issue with the industry.
My sources tell me that that has now happened, so it would be useful to
have an update on the meeting. I believe it was agreed that
further discussions with the ABI and the British Lung Foundation were
to be arranged but that this has yet to happen. I appreciate that with
the severe weather over the Christmas period there may have been a
delay, but it would be extremely helpful to the House if the Minister
could update us on where he thinks this is now going. While I recognise
the desire from the Minister for it to remain a voluntary agreement
between the industry and research organisations, I would be keen to
hear what he intends to do if there is no long-term stable funding
agreement, and whether he would commit to introducing secondary
legislation to this Bill if that is the case. It would also be helpful
if the Minister could commit to the Government overseeing the
facilitation of the voluntary scheme. By what date does he hope it will

is undeniably a dreadful condition and research into it is shamefully
underfunded. We anticipate more people will be diagnosed over the
coming years, from all occupational backgrounds, so it would be helpful
to have a strong commitment from the Minister —albeit one
recognising that this is not wholly his departmental
responsibility—that there will be progress in trying to discover
a cure and/or suitable treatment to relieve the horrible suffering from
mesothelioma.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000055">In

be with us today to speak to it. I am sure that the very best wishes of
the whole House for a speedy and full recovery will be relayed to his

thank the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) for her
contribution today and the work she has done through the all-party
group with my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale
East. We wanted to ensure that my right hon. Friend’s amendments
were debated in the House and taken forward due to the importance of
this issue. He worked tirelessly on behalf of his and all of our
constituents on this important issue, which still blights the lives of
thousands of people. There remains no cure for mesothelioma, but it is
vital that research continues to offer hope to those still suffering
from asbestos-related diseases. It is also essential that sufferers
receive the maximum possible compensation, and that it is not reduced
by having to pay legal fees. My right hon. Friend sought to improve
this proposal and I intend to press it to a
vote.</hs_Para>

clause 2 seeks to ensure that a small part of the levy imposed on the
insurance industry—no more than 1% of the total claim
bill—is used to fund additional research into mesothelioma. Some
2,400 people a year die from the disease, and it is estimated that
approximately 56,000 to 60,000 people, as the hon. Lady said, will die
from this terrible disease in the next 30 years unless a cure is found.
In the other place, the Government continually suggested that they were
sympathetic, but they did not provide a guarantee to support and
implement a scheme to fund mesothelioma research on a sustainable
basis. That is why my right hon. Friend is so determined to see a small
proportion of the levy used for research purposes. As I said at the
beginning, my right hon. Friend is a tireless campaigner for
mesothelioma victims. I hope this House will feel able to support these

has long been neglected in terms of research funding. Lord Alton
highlighted that while mesothelioma received £1.4 million in

expose the myth that mesothelioma is related only to industrial
diseases. The hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)
mentioned the impact on teachers, but it also affects children,
ancillary workers, janitors and all kinds of people who are now
employed by, or attend, schools. I ask the Minister to take the time to
look at the excellent TUC and National Union of Teachers report on
asbestos in schools and future compensation payments. There is evidence
that some 75% of state schools have asbestos in their buildings. That
is a time bomb waiting to explode. It is important to get that message

is important to let potential governors of private fee-paying schools

support new clause 2, which, in the absence of the right hon.
Gentleman, was moved by the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford
(Tracey Crouch) and is supported by the other hon. Members who have
spoken. It is clear that investment in research into mesothelioma is
desperately needed. The UK has the highest rate of the disease in the
world. That is not a number one spot that we should be proud of, but
one we should be working to change. The British Lung Foundation, which
I will refer to throughout my small contribution, estimates that 2,400
people will die of the disease this year and that in the next 30 years
more than 50,000 people will die of mesothelioma unless new treatments
are found.</hs_Para>

little is spent on mesothelioma research in the UK, compared with other
cancers with comparable mortality rates. In 2011, the National Cancer
Research Institute reported that £400,000 was invested in
mesothelioma research by its partners. That compares with approximately
£5 million and £5.5 million spent on myeloma and melanoma
respectively, two cancers that kill a similar number of people each
year. I have been informed that the research amendments would charge a
small additional annual administration or membership fee to
participating insurance firms. Those small payments would make a huge
difference to the future of mesothelioma research in the UK and could
lead to a cure that would save tens of thousands of lives. It is
estimated that 150 insurance firms are active in the
employers' liability insurance market. This measure could raise a vital
£1.5 million each year for mesothelioma
research.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000066">I
am also informed that during debates in the House of Lords, the
Government suggested that the lack of mesothelioma research is due to
the poor quality of research proposals, not the funding available, and
that therefore a fund for mesothelioma research would not represent
value for money. That was the spirit of the Government’s reply
to the debate in the House of Lords. The British Lung Foundation,
however, put it to me that that argument does not take into account the
opinions of many eminent medical and research experts. Advances have
already been made through research by the BLF and others. More funding
will attract more and better quality researchers and research proposals
to an area of research that is still playing catch-up, having been
neglected for so long. Members have talked about other cancer charities
that are better funded. The BLF, as an individual organisation, has
awarded more than £2.5 million to mesothelioma research in the
past three years. The Government, with great respect, have fallen
short. The BLF uses a robust international peer review process to
ensure world class quality that is respected the world over, and its
research and advice is sought by other countries. The experience does
not identify any shortage in quality
whatever.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000067">In

important aspect of prevention mentioned is the risk to children in

There is emerging technology for real-time testing of asbestos fibres
in schools. We must continue to have a strong research base not just to
relieve those who are suffering the terrible symptoms of the disease,
but to research treatments and, most importantly, to look at how we
prevent and protect in the workplace, so we can prevent exposure to
asbestos. As all Members will know, this disease is caused entirely by
exposure to asbestos, and it will be a real wasted opportunity if we do
not make this funding available to advance

McDonnell</B> (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</Member> Obviously, I pay
tribute to the work of my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe
and Sale East (Paul Goggins). One reason he tabled the new clause and
amendments was that, although we commend the insurance companies that
came together voluntarily to contribute £2.5 million, there are,
as has been said, 140 to 150 insurance companies, and one of
his concerns was the virtual impossibility of securing an agreement
across them all. I hoped his claim would be put to the test before now.
Had we secured a voluntary agreement by now, we would not have required
the new clause and amendments, but it has not been possible, and I
doubt the feasibility of bringing all those companies to the table and
securing a voluntary agreement to raise sufficient funds.</hs_Para>

factories in the north-east when I was a youngster, and I can remember
the Hebden bridge experience and the asbestos factory there. For
limited periods—tragically—I have known many mesothelioma
sufferers, and the two things they want are, first, speedy compensation
so that they and their families can get some compensation while they
are still alive, if possible, and secondly, that no one else should go
through this absolutely appalling suffering. That is why the emphasis
has been placed upon seeking prevention. I agree with the hon. Member
for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) that education is critical,
and that is why some of the original funding—a limited amount,
admittedly, but at least some—from the insurance companies was
put towards education and, more importantly, finding treatment
practices and palliative measures that would reduce the suffering and,
in the short term, not the long term, finding a cure.</hs_Para>

reasons, the new clause and amendments are key to the Bill. Without
them, the Bill will not be as welcomed as many of us would have
thought. I therefore urge Members and the Government to recognise this
as a matter of urgency. We cannot wait for voluntary agreements any
longer; we need legislation in place that can generate the income for
prevention activities and research. Like other hon. Members, I hope
that my right hon. Friend comes back healthy and spritely to engage

found, yet, as has been shown, very little funding in the UK is being
directed to research into mesothelioma. Tragically, the UK leads the
world in the incidence of mesothelioma, so one might have expected us
to want to lead the world in investment in research to find a cure and
treatment.</hs_Para>

Friend reports. For anyone suffering terribly from a disease they know
will be fatal and cruel in its passage, 
<?notus-xml column=201?>one of the most important things is being as close as possible to home,

across the House have pointed out the differential in the level of
funding afforded to mesothelioma research relative to that directed to
other medical conditions and other cancers. In fact, mesothelioma
research receives no state funding at all, yet as more people access
payouts from the scheme introduced in the Bill, the Government should
begin to enjoy financial savings as a result of reduced statutory
payouts. It is not one the amendments proposed today, but the Minister
might like to consider whether the savings that the Government can look
forward to enjoying might also, to a degree, be directed towards
funding further research into a treatment and cure for this terrible
disease.</hs_Para>

mesothelioma research receives £1.4 million of entirely
voluntary and private sector funding, and I pay tribute to the
voluntary and private sector funders, including the insurance funders,
that have made those research funds available. Some £1.4 million
is available to mesothelioma each year, compared with, for example,
£22 million for bowel cancer, £41 million for breast
cancer, £11.5 million for lung cancer and £32 million for
leukaemia. Clearly we are not anxious to be in some form of
league table for which form of cancer is the most deserving of funding
for research—all are terrible for those hit by them and for
those close to them—but it is clear that mesothelioma is a poor
relation in the funding that is available for research, and there is a
real will across the House and, as we know, in the other place to
address that matter during the passage of the Bill.</hs_Para>

was debated extensively in the House of Lords as a result of an
amendment tabled by the noble Lord Alton. At that time, a number of
useful and welcome pledges were secured from the Health Minister, the
noble Earl Howe, including the announcement of a joint strategy between
the DWP and the Department of Health on how to encourage proposals for
high-quality research into mesothelioma. Since Lord Howe’s
statement in the House of Lords, we have heard that a meeting has been
hosted with potential researchers and funders to begin to take forward
the implementation of that strategy. We are pleased to hear
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000084">As
the Minister will recall, when we debated the matter in Committee my
right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East absolutely
rejected any suggestions that it was a lack of suitable research
proposals, rather than a lack of adequate research funding, that was
leading to the dearth of activity in mesothelioma research. The
proposal in the new clause, which was made at every stage in Committee
and in the other place, is very modest in the context of the overall
scheme that we are discussing. It proposes a supplement of 1% to go
towards research funding on the levy on insurers. That is not 1% of
gross written premium, but 1% of 3% of gross written premium—a
very modest sum for a multibillion pound insurance industry to afford,
but a sum that could make an exponential difference to the scale of
research that is possible into the disease. I hope that the Minister is
listening carefully to the pleas that we should secure that.</hs_Para>

my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East listed a
series of research programmes that are already under way; the hon.
Member for Chatham and Aylesford also referred to those programmes. We
would like to take the opportunity to secure funding to extend, expand
and continue those research programmes, and to open the opportunity for
further new areas of research—as I say, there is no shortage of
good research ideas.</hs_Para>

important to note that such research would of course be of benefit to
mesothelioma sufferers in this country. We have the highest incidence
of mesothelioma anywhere in the world and, as hon. Members have pointed
out, the reach of mesothelioma is extending; not just to those who
worked in our traditional industrial sectors but across other sectors.
Schools have been particularly highlighted, as have family members who
may have been exposed to secondary contamination when workers brought
home asbestos fibres on clothes and work
equipment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000087">Not
just sufferers and their families here in the UK but sufferers right
across the world will benefit from investment in research. That is an
important point, and one that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Wythenshawe and Sale East would have wanted us to consider this
afternoon. In the UK, we think that we are shortly to pass the spike in
mesothelioma. The history of asbestos exposure and of health and safety
action and legislation to prevent people from being continually exposed
to that risk means that the spike in the number of sufferers will come
within the next few years. That is to be welcomed tremendously here in
the UK, but it is absolutely not the case around the world,
particularly in developing economies—especially developing
economies where health and safety standards may be much less rigorous
than we are used to in this country and where economies may be
expanding very rapidly—where hundreds of thousands, if not
millions, of workers may even now be exposed to the risk of
mesothelioma despite all the collective knowledge and wisdom that we
have of the damage that exposure to asbestos will
cause.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000088">It
is also important to note that in many of those developing economies,
UK companies and businesses will have business interests and
investments. In some cases they may be drawing profits from industries
that are continuing to expose workers worldwide to that risk. The moral
obligation on us here in the UK to lead the world in research funding
arises first because of our early experience of asbestos exposure and
mesothelioma and secondly because we continue indirectly to be
complicit in the exposure of workers in developing economies around the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000089">It
has been powerfully conveyed this afternoon how strongly the House
feels not just about making sure that the funding proposals come
forward, but that funding to support and encourage future proposals is
guaranteed and secured. I know that the insurance industry feels as
concerned as any of us to address the horrors of this disease and to
seek to turn a corner in dealing with the risks to which we have
exposed too many generations. I hope that it too will consider this
very modest proposal, which merely builds on the voluntary contribution
that many of them are already making. I hope that the industry will not
feel that this is a step too far for them to contemplate. Even if it
does feel that, it is the responsibility of those of us in this House
first and 
<?notus-xml column=203?>foremost to speak up for victims—today’s victims and
victims in the future. That is why I hope that the Minister

have also spoken to Lord Howe, as I committed to do in Committee. As
the hon. Lady said, we have had the first meeting. One of the things I
touched on with him was the issue of quality of research. That matter
has been taken out of context slightly, although there was no intention
to do so. It is like when anyone bids for anything; they have to tick
the right boxes. When people go for a loan at the bank, they need to
make sure that they have ticked the right boxes. It is not a question
of the quality of research; in many cases, it is how that research has
been bid for by the establishments.</hs_Para>

that the National Institute for Health Research provided £2.2
million in 2012-13 on top of the £1.4 million from
the private sector. There has been money and we expect more money to
come as bids come forward that match the way in which the research
funding is allocated. I completely agree with the shadow Minister that
we need to look at research not just in this country, as a developed
nation, but for developing countries. A lot of the industries that
developed products with asbestos in them have been selling them to the
third world for many years. Thank goodness, many of the nations that we
traditionally thought of as third world nations are now developing
nations, and it is important to force this issue
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14010751002043" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002043">2.30

points.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000606">First,
let me identify myself and my constituents with the tributes that have
been paid to my right hon. Friend the Member for Wythenshawe
and Sale East (Paul Goggins). My right hon. Friend has been
a champion of my constituents as well as his own in all his work on
issues relating to mesothelioma. Like many other Members whose
constituencies are hotspots for the condition, I greatly appreciate the
work that he has done over the years in trying to help those who suffer
from it, and, indeed, his work more generally as a widely respected
parliamentarian. I know that the whole House wishes him a speedy
recovery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000607" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000607">Secondly,
let me pay tribute to the Minister for managing to take the Bill so far
forward—further forward than I managed to take the measure that
I attempted to introduce when I was a Minister in the Department, which
was slightly more wide ranging and was certainly brought to a halt more
effectively. It is with some admiration that I pay my small tribute to
the Minister—or, rather, my large tribute, for why should
quantum be an issue? Actually, it is the issue in this part of the
Bill, but we shall come to that shortly. I know of the pressures that
the Minister has faced externally and within the broader Government
over this issue, and I think he has done extremely well to get us to
where we are now.</hs_Para>

that, I should explain why I tabled my three amendments. There is no
position that cannot be improved with a little bit of thought, and in
any event it is right to test the arguments. The amendments seek to
increase the share of the amount that the arbitrator gives the victim
that actually reaches the victim, and to give the legislation an
earlier start date—2010 rather than 2012.</hs_Para>

address the compensation issues first. My amendment says compensation
should be 100% of what is due. Nobody in the discussions we had on
Second Reading and in Committee has made a moral case against giving
somebody 100% of what they are entitled to. In fact, some very powerful
speeches were made in this place on Second Reading on precisely this
point, and I think it was my hon. Friend the Member for Blaydon (Mr
Anderson) who pointed out that within a few months the victims are
going to be 100% dead, so 100% compensation does not seem unreasonable.
After all, the employers paid 100% of the premiums and they thought
they enjoyed 100% of the cover. Had there been recourse in law, they
would have got 100% of the damages. In not one of these cases has the
defence argued that to some extent the victim contributed to his or her
own misfortune, and, when we think about it, what contribution could
they have made that led to their own misfortune—breathing? It is
a ridiculous contention. The victims are not to blame and therefore
they should not have their compensation
cut.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000610" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000610"><Member ContinuationText="Hywel Williams" PimsId="4619" UID="14010751002584" xid="637" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002584"><B>Hywel

us today is the rules for a very specific scheme that evolved through a

My brother, Bob, died of this condition. He worked for BP all his life.
When it was proven he had this condition BP worked as hard as it could
to give him as little as possible. The company put all that money into
addressing the oil spill in America, yet that is how it treats its own
employees. I feel very strongly about this, therefore, and support my
right hon. Friend’s amendments absolutely, and I do so, too,

Yorkshire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000613" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000613"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Nicholas Brown" PimsId="2330" UID="14010751002587" xid="71" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002587">Mr
Brown:</Member></B> I care about this issue and I know my hon. Friend
cares about it, too, and it is true that many Members of Parliament on
both sides of the House, but especially those who represent communities
that suffer disproportionately from this, know that their constituents
face a desperate injustice. The burden of this condition is not shared
evenly across the country. It affects our population by class;
working-class constituents are far more likely to suffer from it than
middle or upper-class 
<?notus-xml column=210?>ones. It affects our constituencies by region, too; there are regional
hot spots, historically found in areas of heavy industry where people
were very likely to be exposed to the dust, whether because they
sprayed it on railway carriages or worked with it in the shipyards or
as thermal insulation engineers and were not properly

a responsibility to do what is right for the victims and if

premiums and prior to 2007 there was an assumption that pleural plaques
cases could go against the insurers. It was only the High Court 2007
judgment that put a stop to all that. The premiums did not have to be
refunded; they were just kept. The figure I have for that is over
£1.4 billion held by the insurers. If companies have taken
premiums for something they are never going to have to pay out for,
that seems to me to be a pretty good
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000623" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000623"><Member ContinuationText="Toby Perkins" PimsId="5518" UID="14010751002596" xid="1043" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002596"><B>Toby

cases, just as I do, and for the same reason: the industrial heritage
of his constituency. We know that the profile of the victims is
forecast to be different from the historical legacy, but it depends on
the effectiveness of the protection measures we as a House have put in
place. That was done with all-party consent—in fact, I think I
was the Minister who moved the last set of regulations covering
asbestos. We do not yet know how effective they are, however. As has
been said from the Opposition Front Bench, we expect the number of

know that that will be the case. I hope it will be, but we need to
maintain our vigilance. The new cases will come from building
contractors, people dismantling, rather than erecting, structures, and
people who have come into contact through, perhaps, thinking they were
dealing with a solid piece of material and who then hammered a nail
into it or scratched it and breathed in the dust.</hs_Para>

Brown:</Member></B> I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister on that
point. My thoughts are with the young children in Leeds who found an
abandoned pile of what turned out to be asbestos dust that had not yet
been mixed with water and used for its purpose. The children, being
children, formed it into “snowballs” and threw them at
each other and breathed in the dust. Some 40 or 50 years
later, their cases are now turning up as mesothelioma cases, but who is
the insurer or the employer? It is difficult to say who is the
responsible party. No one could possibly argue that those young
children contributed to the ill health that they are suffering later in
life. The Minister rightly says that we must deal effectively with such
public liability cases, and I wholeheartedly support him in trying to
find a way of addressing the matter.</hs_Para>

arguments against my proposal for 100% compensation. The
first—and, incidentally, the weakest—is that it would
incentivise the victim to see whether there was an insurer or employer
against whom a case could be taken. It is argued that the prospect of
getting 100% compensation, compared with 70% under the proposed scheme
of last resort, would incentivise someone—whose life expectancy
was now a matter of months rather than years—to go out and hunt
for the insurer or employer, using whatever resources were available to
them.</hs_Para>

and think about that. How on earth would an ordinary citizen go about
tracking down those missing people? A good argument that was made in
the other place was that the incentivisation should surely work the
other way round. If there is to be incentivisation through paying less
compensation, surely we should make the compensation not 100% but 110%,
so that the administrators of the scheme, who had access to the former
insurance companies’ records, would have to go hunting to
determine whether it was possible to launch a case. They should be the
ones to be incentivised. I am not arguing for more than 100%
compensation, by the way, although I did table a proposal to that
effect in Committee.</hs_Para>

suggesting that some poor old victim whose days are numbered should

objection to the payment of 100% compensation is that it would break
the agreement that the Minister has made with the industry. I know that
he does not take offence when people like me say that a lot of premiums
have been taken to insure against things that the industry is now not
going to have to pay out on. It would pay out if I had my way, but the
law established in 2007 says that it need not do so. The pleural
plaques judgment has meant that the industry is the beneficiary of the
premiums that it has taken in relation to pleural plaques, although not
to mesothelioma, because the cause of action has been struck down. I
think I am right in saying that that does not apply in Scotland or
Northern Ireland, although it certainly does in
England.</hs_Para>

Gentleman earlier before he moved on to this point. I completely agree

Brown:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for that

distasteful one, and I am glad that the Government are not associating
themselves with it. That makes it clear that the argument is about
affordability within the parameters of the scheme.</hs_Para>

the case for 100% compensation cannot convincingly be made, even by me,
if the test is affordability within the parameters of the scheme.
Amendment 1 proposes a figure of 80%, and whether that would be
affordable within the parameters of the scheme is a finer point. I am
not giving in, however. I believe that the victims deserve 100%
compensation, but I understand that, if the Government are saying that
the test should be the parameters of the negotiated scheme, we will
have to maximise the money available to the victims within those
parameters. We have all used the useful chart produced by the
Minister’s Department as the factual background to the debate.
The outcome will depend on whether we factor the percentages over four
years or whether we take a longer, 10-year view. The Minister will not
be surprised to hear that I take the longer view because I
want the victims to have more
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000638">In
determining whether the proposals are affordable within the parameters
of the scheme, the Minister needs to explain two points. First, he must
explain why 80% compensation would not be affordable, on his
own figures. My submission is that it would be if it were
spread over a longer time period and therefore cost less per year. 
<?notus-xml column=214?>The second point involves the cost of lawyers. This is set out in
regulations, and the Minister is right to say that it should not be in
the Bill itself, but the legal costs are going to have to be met. The
estimate was £2,000 per case, but the figure then rose to
£7,000. It is not clear which is the right figure. I do not want
to mislead anyone; the cost will not come out of the money awarded to
the victim, but it will come out of the overall cost of the scheme. The
question of whether the cost is £2,000 or £7,000, or
somewhere in between, will therefore make a difference. Will the
Minister tell us what the correct figure
is?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000639" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000639"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mike Penning" PimsId="4833" UID="14010751002604" xid="849" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002604">Mike
Penning:</Member></B> The figure is £7,000, and the right hon.
Gentleman is right to say that the figure comes out of the overall cost
of the scheme—out of the 3%. If the claimant pays less than that
figure, they keep the difference—thus, it becomes part of their
compensation. We discussed the reason why the figure moved in Committee
and in the Lords: it was felt that £2,000 was too low and so
people would not get the sort of legal advice they needed. We
desperately did not want the situation that had happened with other
schemes whereby the legal teams got more money out of the compensation
than that—that is why the figure is £7,000. In the
negotiations I have been having, the feeling has been that the actual
amount will be less, so the recipients or their loved ones will get the
difference.</hs_Para>

Brown:</Member></B> I understand what the Minister is saying, and we
all travel in hope—I certainly travel with him in hope. I hope
this does not sound unduly cynical, but once the legal profession knows
that a maximum of £7,000 is available for the cost of
administering this, the work done and the effort put in by the
individual law firms is likely to rise up towards the £7,000
ceiling. The Minister’s hope that simpler and more
straightforward cases will confine themselves to a lower fee is
correct, and I am with him on it, but I have the feeling
that things will not work out that way. If they do not,
there will be a cost on the scheme and so it will become harder to say,
“We will put up the money for the victims” because the 3%
ceiling will have been approached.</hs_Para>

issue in this group of amendments is when the scheme should start. The
Government’s proposal is to start it in 2012—backdating
to the commencement of the Bill’s proceedings. My argument is
that it should be backdated to the date of the consultation that led to
the Bill. The consultation started under the previous Labour Government
and was designed to meet exactly the same problem that the Government
have identified. That consultation was on a slightly more generous
scheme than this one, but of course the fruits of that consultation
have not been heard and the discussions were only in their infancy when
the general election interrupted proceedings.</hs_Para>

possible to make a case for a much earlier start date for a scheme of
this nature. We could go back to the date of guilty knowledge for the
industry as a whole, which would take us back before the second world
war—if we were being really rigorous. There are certainly
milestones in how our thinking has developed on these issues which go
back a lot earlier than 2010. However, the Opposition Front-Bench team
and I have put forward the most modest proposition that it would
be possible to conceive of. We are saying that the
start 
<?notus-xml column=215?>of consultation was the start of legitimate expectations in the minds of
the victims who were being consulted and it put the industry on notice
that there was to be a statutory scheme or that at least the then
Government were contemplating such a scheme. This could not have come
as a complete surprise to the industry.</hs_Para>

Seabeck:</Member></B> I entirely agree with the point my right hon.
Friend is making. When the consultation was taking place under the
previous Labour Government, my constituents did become enthused. There
is not too much to enthuse someone suffering from mesothelioma, but
they were enthused because they felt there was some light at the end of
the tunnel. It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that we do look back
in this regard. I have no doubt that the insurance companies, which
understand risk better than anybody, would already have started
planning at that stage to deal with a start date going back to
2010.</hs_Para>

Brown:</Member></B> My hon. Friend, who represents a community that
faces exactly the same issues as mine for exactly the same
reasons—wrongful exposure to asbestos dust—will have
constituents raising exactly the same issues with her. She says that
the industry ought to be experts in assessing risk. That is certainly
true, but it did not half get it wrong over asbestos. We can all
remember the crisis over asbestos liabilities that the industry went
through. What relieved the burden more than any other single thing was
the 2007 judgment on pleural plaques, which meant that that much larger
swathe of cases was taken off the shoulders of the insurers, so the
remaining insurers were better able to deal with the mesothelioma
cases. We also saw some unhappy episodes relating to the work of
Lloyd’s. We will perhaps not go over those again, but they did
not reflect well on the industry, which is why we should be a little
careful before taking everything it says to us absolutely at face
value.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14010751002045" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002045">3.15

point to make for the earlier start date relates to the
short life span of the victims. New drugs such as Alimta, however, are
offering a few months’ extra life to the people for whom they
actually work—responses to these drugs are different depending
on the individual. We are talking about an early but very promising
development, and I am proud of the work that Newcastle university has
helped to do in the development of this intervention. This underpins
the points made in our earlier debate about the need for more research.
If we bring the start date back, living people could possibly just come
into the scope of the scheme. In any event, their families will fall
under the scheme and it is for the dependants and the families that we
should make this modest decision and use the start date of the
consultation, when the then Government’s intentions were clear
and the industry was put on notice, rather than do the meanest thing
possible and make the start date 2012. I understand that it is
anticipated that an extra 600 cases, or something of that order, would
be affected by such a move, but the Minister will have a better
figure.</hs_Para>

Crouch:</Member></B> It is a pleasure to follow the right hon. Member
for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown), to whose contribution I
listened with interest. I rise to speak to amendment 1, which stands in
my name and that of other hon. Members from all parts of the House. It
is an amendment on a variation of the theme: there is not a consensus,
particularly among campaigners for fairer compensation for mesothelioma
victims, that the current 75% figure is acceptable. Despite the
excellent efforts of the noble Lord Freud and the Minister to bring
this Bill before the House, I am afraid that there is still some
disappointment that the level of compensation does not go far enough.
My amendment seeks to increase the level of compensation from 75% to
80%, and not to the higher percentages proposed by others. Although I
recognise that 100% would be the most perfect outcome for victims, the
truth is that the legislation would probably not be in front of the
House today if that were the case and if that were the only option
under consideration.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010751000651" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000651">Although an
extra 5% compensation does not sound very much, it is the equivalent of
an average extra £6,000 to the victim, which is no small sum to
someone trying to finalise their financial arrangements before they
pass away. To those of us who seek justice on their behalf, that seems
a much fairer figure, not least because they will be asked to give back
100% of the industrial disease and social security benefits that they
have received as a consequence of getting mesothelioma, and that is
estimated to be around £20,000 on average.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010751000652" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000652">Much has
already been said on that issue during previous stages of this Bill in
both Houses. I will repeat what I said on Second Reading, which is that
the noble 
<?notus-xml column=217?>Lord Freud deserves praise for negotiating with the insurance industry
and for raising the original figure for compensation from 70% to 75%.
However, sources in the insurance industry told me that the noble
Lord Freud himself wanted 80%, and therefore by moving this
amendment today, I am merely reiterating the Minister’s previous
desire for a better outcome. Then, with the support from
colleagues today, he could have a parliamentary mandate to go back to
the industry to start renegotiating compensation levels.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010751000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000653">The
negotiations and their subsequent outcome were based around another
figure—that of the cost of the scheme to the insurance industry
being no more than 3% of gross written premium. The argument for
introducing the arbitrary figure of 3% was to ensure that the insurance
industry would not pass on to its own customers the cost of running the
scheme. In its more recent impact assessment, the Government
surprisingly
stated:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14010751002024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002024">“It
is possible that insurers will pass the cost of the scheme onto
customers via increased premiums. If it did happen the impact on
customers would be relatively low, estimated at 2.46% on average per
year on EL insurance
premiums.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14010751000654" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000654">Given
that inflation is currently running higher than the estimated potential
increase in employers’ liability premiums as outlined in the
impact assessment, I am pretty certain that the premiums will go up
regardless of this scheme. That means that the insurance industry will
incur no net loss as a consequence, especially as it will still receive
the same Government funding incentive to smooth the first four years of
the running of the scheme. The argument being put forward about the EL
insurance premium rise is a bit of a red herring. The real debate is
around the assumptions of the scheme. Under previous assumptions of
legal costs, the scheme could have been extended to provide
compensation of 80%. We have had that debate before. We had it on
Second Reading and throughout the Committee stage, and the right hon.
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East has mentioned it again. Revised
figures of costs—assumptions provided to the Department by
insurance and personal injury lawyers—mean that 80% compensation
would push the levy over a four-year period above the 3% figure, albeit
marginally. However, over a 10-year period—the period I too
prefer to look at given the longevity of the mesothelioma disease and
when it is likely to occur—80% compensation is well below the
threshold at 2.61%. Arguments over the precise nature of legal costs
aside, albeit ones that were superbly made in Committee by my hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Stephen
Phillips), it seems incredibly unfair that two days before Second
Reading in this House, assumptions were changed, and that was wholly
for the convenience of the insurance industry. Unfortunately, that
means that the victims of the disease will not get the extra
compensation they
deserve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000655" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000655">I
have been warned that if my amendment were to be agreed, the insurance
industry would walk away from providing the scheme. I am afraid to say
that that is bunkum, and it would be incredibly foolish of
the industry to do such a thing. It has highly paid public
affairs advisers—I should know as I was one before I entered
this House—who will be telling their bosses to read the mood
music from the contributions to debates on this Bill in both Houses.
There have been calls for the scheme 
<?notus-xml column=218?>to pay out compensation of 110%, 100% and 90%. There
have been calls for the legislation to extend to other asbestos
diseases such as pleural plaques and to include those suffering from
mesothelioma from secondary sources. There have been references to the
profits made by the UK’s £40 billion insurance industry
and there have been expressions of disappointment in the long-term
failure of the industry to deal with this matter prior to statutory
intervention via this
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000656" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000656">Do
I think the insurance industry will walk away from this Bill leaving
tens of thousands of mesothelioma victims without compensation? We are
talking about victims who contracted a fatal disease because they did
the honourable thing and went to work to provide for their family and
who need this scheme because of poor record keeping by the insurance
industry and/or their employers. No, I do not think that will
happen.</hs_Para>

Lady on what she has done and on what she is saying so far today. I
hope that she is right, but does she not understand the track record of
these insurance companies? They have challenged mesothelioma victims
for decades, and I hope that we can stop them today because people are
getting fed up with the way they
behave.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000658" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000658"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tracey Crouch" PimsId="5551" UID="14010751002614" xid="1041" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002614">Tracey
Crouch:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. Decades ago, the insurance industry would have held up
its hands and said that, in hindsight, it had treated victims very
badly. To be fair to the bigger players in the insurance industry, they
have certainly tried, over the past five to 10 years, to improve the
system of compensation for victims. They have set up the Employers'
Liability Tracing Office and provided funding for research. Some of
those bigger insurers have started to play catch-up for the
mesothelioma victims. However, I recognise the concerns expressed by
the Opposition over pleural plaques. As it happens, I was part of the
insurance team that ensured that pleural plaques did not become a
legislative issue in this House, and I stand by that decision today.
That will remain a difference of opinion that we have on a specific
asbestos-related disease. Where we do need consensus is over
mesothelioma. It is a fatal condition and one that will kill somebody
incredibly quickly and very painfully. I want to make sure that those
victims who cannot trace their insurer or employer have access to the
scheme and get the most amount of compensation
possible.</hs_Para>

support her amendment this afternoon. However, the impact of the
£6,000 she mentioned—the additional 5%—on the
people in my constituency who have been affected, or know someone who
has been affected, by this, cannot be underestimated. I entirely concur
with what she said on the figure, and I hope that the Minister will
listen and consider how the £6,000 will impact on the people in
our
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000660" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000660"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tracey Crouch" PimsId="5551" UID="14010751002616" xid="1041" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751002616">Tracey

Sheerman:</Member></B> I know that the point about traditional
employment and so on has been reiterated many times, but my dear
brother, Robert—Rob—who died of this disease, worked in
the research centre at Sunbury-on-Thames for British Petroleum, one of
the leading science and technology companies in the country. As my
right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown)
said, those people knew about the disease very early on. Does the hon.
Lady agree that the insurance industry too often hides behind the trade
association, the Association of British Insurers? We cannot get through
to the real insurers as that very combatant trade association gives
them cover.</hs_Para>

Crouch:</Member></B> I am interested in the hon. Gentleman’s
first point about occupations. We must be very clear that this
situation is not confined to the traditional working class, although it
is more likely to be prominent as they were more exposed to asbestos
than anybody else. Anyone who has been exposed to asbestos is in danger
of contracting mesothelioma. On the hon. Gentleman’s second
point, he must recognise that there are 150 players in the insurance
industry and it is only fair that they should have a trade association
that represents them. When I recently looked through the ministerial
meeting list, I noticed that although the ABI was meeting with
Ministers it did so with the top four insurers by its side. There are
representatives in such meetings of the individual insurers as well as
the trade association.</hs_Para>

me go back to the question of whether the insurance industry will walk
away from the Bill. I do not think that it will. It needs to be
reminded that it will receive a £17 million taxpayer-funded gift
to help smooth the running of the scheme for the first four years,
followed by a £30 million loan. I think that that is rather
ironic, given the fact that it will be part paid for by the victims
through the recovery of benefits. The industry needs to be firmly
reminded of that, not least because many people in this place could say
what £47 million could be better spent on. We want to ensure
that the mesothelioma victims get fair levels of compensation, but they
will do so through Government-funded assistance to the insurance
industry, which has been strongly criticised in the past for not doing
enough.</hs_Para>

industry starts to cite pressures on finances because of flooding or
economic circumstances—we can be sympathetic about some of the
initial costs of the recent severe weather—it is important to
remind it that the scheme has been long in the making. Risk analysis
was done long before the Bill was introduced and reserves were
allocated accordingly, which was a point made by the hon. Member for
Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green). That is what good companies do:
they manage risk for others and for themselves.</hs_Para>

may, make a party political point. We should remind the industry that
since the coalition was formed it has had its corporate tax rate cut
and its employee costs reduced, that steady growth in the economy has
created stability, particularly for those on the FTSE, that share
prices have increased and that thousands of small businesses have been
created, all of which will require some form of employers’
liability insurance. Business is good for the insurance industry at the
moment.</hs_Para>

the industry for many things, but, at a time when business is growing
and returns on investments are being maximised, to threaten to walk
away from a scheme providing victims with compensation that they should
have been able to receive through the civil procedures but cannot,
through no fault of their own—a scheme that will be funded
through £47 million of Government money—is utterly
outrageous. I am absolutely certain that that decision would come back
to haunt them later and, based on other Members’ contributions
today and in the Bill’s earlier stages, would have far more
punishing consequences than that proposed in the amendment.</hs_Para>

my amendment to a vote this afternoon. I had hoped that I would receive
the backing of the Government but, regardless of the outcome, I urge
the Minister in this House and the noble Lord Freud to return to the
issue of increasing compensation for victims. If it remains at 75%, the
question will not be over and could be returned to in the future.
However, with cross-party consensus on 80%, not only would it be harder
to increase compensation levels down the road and in the future, but it
would be a welcome and worthwhile compromise for politicians, support
groups and those most affected by this dreadful disease, the
mesothelioma victims
themselves.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_07_PT_1/6DF4C25CFDCB1CF4CF58D2B361852C2C4D1D37A9" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="7 January 2014">Tuesday

get some compensation, not for them but for their families. That is the
important thing. The most graphic description of mesothelioma I have

very toxic view. That is based on my own experience some years ago in
Scotland, where there is a different legal system. Then, when were
people were diagnosed with any asbestos-related disease, their claim
died with them. The insurance companies would go to court and have
sitting beside them a doctor who would, from a distance, try to gauge
how long the person had to live, and the companies would then find some
sort of technical reason to get their case put back

immediately. There is no doubt that the companies have been preparing
for the scheme since the day the consultation was launched, and there
is no reason why we should be letting them set the agenda in

that the insurance companies, as opposed to the victims, could agree to

not only the Government, but the industry, is happy. If we set the

it is hard to find anyone who has not been affected in some way by
asbestos, whether through family members, friends or colleagues, many

purely to appease the insurance industry. First and foremost among
those is the cut-off date for diagnosis, 25 July 2012, which my right

be put back to 10 February 2010, when the original consultation
started, as my right hon. Friend suggested. I understand that that

about cost. However, it is my understanding that with that change, it

the Bill is very limited in terms of who it supports and helps. It is

final point is about the level of compensation. Frankly, 75% is
insulting. We must remember that the Government were proposing a 70%
limit. My opinion is that a fair level of compensation would be 100%,

through the Bill and I am puzzled by the fact that there is a
threat—if we do not agree to something that is a lot less than
what people deserve, the insurance companies will walk away. I always
thought that if the Government pushed through a Bill that said 100%, it
would be 100%. If that is what the Bill says, surely that is what it
means and what the insurance companies will have to do. From what has
been said throughout the stages of the Bill, it appears that the
insurance companies are running this, not Parliament. That concerns me
because there have been great discussions and great debates on all
sides, but I am yet to hear any persuasive reason why the victims
should not receive 100% of their

must remember that these insurance companies do not lack finance. They
have had the money already, so why should we accept that those victims
and sufferers—and their families and carers—should have
anything less than 100% compensation? The claimants under the scheme
have to meet the same standards of evidence and burden of proof as
those who make successful civil claims. The only difference is that
those who make a successful civil claim get 100% of the

on what we could get agreement on without putting a further burden on

that the insurance companies had to be dragged to the table, because
contribution after contribution has cited examples where the first
thing an insurance company does after an individual has been diagnosed
with mesothelioma is run away and deny it for as long as possible in
the hope that the problem goes away. In Committee, I applauded the work
done by successive Governments in getting the Bill to this stage. We
are just a little too far away from this Bill being absolutely
fantastic for mesothelioma sufferers. Three or four points mean that it

return to the point that the insurance companies are not companies that
are just surviving. They have made profits over generations—10,
20, 30, 40 and 50 years. They took the premiums and invested the money.
Never mind contingency funds, the funds should be there—unless,
of course, the money has been paid out in dividends or in other ways.
That means that the money that should have been there for mesothelioma
sufferers is not there any more because it has been given to
shareholders. That is simply a point. The insurers paid out nothing on
the untraced policies that they lost or destroyed. Again, that is not
the fault of the people who are suffering—it is not their
difficulty. Remember, the only thing wrong that they have done is to
attend the workplace. For goodness’ sake, we cannot forget that

down, threatening all kinds of legal action. They threatened to
challenge the legislation in Northern Ireland; the argument was that we
would be raising expectations and that the measure would be delayed for
years. But at the end of the day, when it was seen that there was a

General when I was a Minister in Northern Ireland; I am sure other

than, as in the negotiations on pleural plaques, there not being a

Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) said, at the end of the day this
Parliament sets the rules by 
<?notus-xml column=230?>which insurance companies and everybody else must abide. I understand
that the Minister has had the discussions with the insurance companies.
I have to say that I think that the companies have come out with a very
good deal. Do not forget; despite the fact that we are dealing with
people who perhaps cannot trace where the insurance was with their
companies, that does not mean that, in most cases, the insurance was
not paid. The premiums went to the insurance companies. They benefited
from the money and they have not paid it out when the claims were made.
This is not a case of there never being any insurance paid, in many
cases. In most cases, the insurance was paid and the insurance
companies have
escaped.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000735" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000735">Secondly,
as has been pointed out, as a result of House of Lords decisions and
other decisions on claims that could have been paid for pleural
plaques, for example, the insurance companies have got a windfall. We
can debate the size of that windfall but figures up to
£1.4 billion have been thrown around. On top of that,
the Government will underwrite part of the cost; £17 million
plus another £30 million loan to them. Then, the companies will
only have to pay out 75%, and 50% of the people who should have been
covered—because they did experience health problems as a result
of exposure to asbestos—are not even covered. I reckon that that
is a very good deal for the companies. If this House were to say,
“We think that the deal struck is overly generous and we are
going to make amendments to the Bill to compensate for the overly
generous deal that was struck,” I doubt very much that the
insurance companies would walk away or that they would challenge it,
especially as the mood of the House is that many people who should have
been included in this are not, and that there are levels of
compensation that should have been paid that are not being paid. Those
are the kinds of arguments that I have found persuasive when listening
to the arguments for the
amendments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000736" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0002.htm#14010751000736">The
Minister is the one who has sat face to face across the table with the
insurance companies. It is his judgement that the insurance companies
will not buy any strengthening of the Bill. Given the generosity of the
deal and that insurance companies try to eyeball Ministers and see who

to it now. The risk is, of course, fairly minimal in any case. First,
it has already been covered and, secondly, I heard the Minister say
that this cannot be passed on through additional premiums on
employers’ liability insurance. No Minister can guarantee that
when insurance premiums go up, some of the marginal increase is not to
enable the additional costs to be recouped by the insurance industry. I
do not know what kind of scrutiny of employers’ liability
insurance premiums the

is acceptable. For 28 years, I represented east
Belfast—the inner part within the shadow of the

suffered as a result of exposure to asbestos in the shipyard. I have
seen the suffering that they went through. I have gone into their
houses and seen people who could hardly walk across a 12-foot wide
living room, who could not climb the stairs and who knew that they were
in for a horrible and painful death. Those are the sort of people we

with the issue of the cut-off date. I understand that cut-off dates are
difficult: how should we choose them? No matter what is chosen, some
people are going to feel aggrieved or short-changed. The proposer of
the amendment spoke about a range of cut-off dates, going right back to
before the war when people first knew that exposure to asbestos led to
a terrible disease and death. However, there must be some logic to the
cut-off dates that we set, and, in seeking that logic, we should be
asking how we can apply it in order to encompass as many people as
possible.</hs_Para>

not particularly happy with it, there is logic in the argument for a
cut-off date of 2010, when expectations were first raised and the
insurance industry was first notified, and when preparations for the
payment of compensation could begin. The Minister said that setting a
date of 2010 would add £80 million to the cost of the Bill, but
I should like him to explain how he arrived at that figure. Given the
75%, the cost of payments will be £343 million over the next 10
years. It has been accepted—and I saw the Minister nod on a
number of occasions when this was mentioned—that the bulk of
cases will arise in future years. How can we have a figure of
£343 million for the next 10 years, during which we expect the
bulk of cases to arise, and a figure of £80 million
for the two years preceding 2012? Those figures simply do not add up. I
should be happy to hear the Minister’s explanation now, or, if
he prefers, when he sums up the debate, but I suspect that the figure
has been over-inflated and gold-plated in an attempt to establish
arguments for not setting a date of 2010, presumably because the
insurance companies will ensure that that does not
happen.</hs_Para>

appreciate the work the Minister has done but this debate saddens me.
We have got a situation where employer liability was paid to these
insurance companies. They have had their money and they have run with
it. People have died, and that was not a surprise. We have known for a
century that asbestos kills people, so the fact that people would need
compensation was not a surprise. The whole argument about the cut-off
date, and that we cannot just spring this on the insurance companies,
is nonsense. Looking back over the last decade, at the Fairchild rules,
the Barker rules and the Rothwell rules, we can see that those were all
cases in which the industry tried to get out of its
responsibilities.</hs_Para>

absolutely no excuse for what is going on here today. The least that
should be done is that we should start the scheme from 2010, because
that is the last point when insurers can say, “We did not
realise we were going to have to face up to this.” They should

in that? Has anybody made the case to say that that is fair? It is
obviously wrong. Somebody who goes to the courts because the employer
is identifiable will get, on average, £154,000, whereas under
this scheme the most somebody will get, even though they have to go
through all the same hoops, except that they do not have an identified
employer or insurance company, is £115,000. So they are already
£39,000 worse off. Then 100% of the benefit they had is going to
be clawed back because they are lying on their death bed—it

1960s, a Ferodo factory was established just outside my home town of
Caernarfon. The slate industry was dying at the time, and many slate

which I referred earlier in an intervention. At the time, people
believed in economic planning and the plan was to establish a large
factory in the constituency to mop up the unemployment arising
subsequent to the closure of the slate industry. Ironically, the
factory was that of the Ferodo firm, which then used asbestos in the
production of brake linings, leading to cases of mesothelioma in my

scheme is being set up for individuals who have not only been diagnosed
with a terminal illness, but who have been suffering the misfortune of
being unable to trace their employer’s insurers. It is plainly
unjust that these claimants should automatically lose a significant
percentage of the compensation that is rightly theirs through no fault
of their own. The industry has argued that mesothelioma claimants
should be encouraged to look at all other avenues before making a claim
under the scheme. At a meeting I had some months ago with insurers,

made to me by representatives of the insurance industry when I met them
on this issue. I understand the argument that it would spur people on
to take any action they can and that the fund should be a matter of
last resort, but it seems that we are in danger of giving the
impression that the Government are heedless of the bitter realities and
the ferocity of this disease. I am sure that the Minister does not see
it that way, but that is the impression that might be given to
sufferers in the short time that is available from diagnosis to the
outcome. There are also cruel pressures on their families. As we have
already heard, sufferers can die very shortly after being diagnosed,
which leaves their families with little time to seek more positive
avenues of compensation. There is the matter of basic humanity here.

am particularly concerned about this, because the Government’s
impact assessment says that the levy will raise £371 million
over 10 years, but I have subsequently learned from the economist at
the Department for Work and Pensions that their modelling to
arrive at that figure is based not on 3% “not going
anywhere” but on how much it costs to meet payouts at 75% of
average civil damages and the associated costs. In fact, the figure of
£367 million in the impact assessment, which is what the
Government have been relying on as the cost of the scheme that they say
is affordable to the industry, means that the industry will face a levy
of just 2.46% over 10 years. I know that the Minister has assured us
that there will be a review after four years of the operation of the
scheme, the amount the levy has raised and what can be done to increase
the rate of payments beyond 75%. Indeed, the Minister has said to me
that there might be other things that can be done,
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000793" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000793">If
the industry can afford 3% today, it can afford 3% over the lifetime of
the scheme. If the rate were maintained at 3% over the first 10 years
of the scheme, it would raise £452 million rather than
£371 million. That would be a further £81 million for
sufferers that the industry is telling us it can afford. Indeed, the
industry thinks that the scheme will run for 30 or 40 years and talks
about there being a cost of £30 million to £35 million a
year, or £1.2 billion to £1.4 billion over the whole
period of the scheme. The cost of 100% payouts going back to 1968 will
be £1.1 billion, so 3% would allow us a much earlier start date
and to increase the rate while leaving some money over for research or
to cover other diseases.</hs_Para>

me that there is plenty of scope to enshrine the level of 3% in
legislation. The industry can afford to pay it and we have no reason to
believe that it cannot or will not be able to afford it in the future.
The industry says that that is an acceptable levy that would put more
money into the scheme, if not immediately then in subsequent years. The
industry will face the levy during the first four years of the scheme,
so we are not asking for any extra money during those years. I cannot
understand why that levy cannot be enshrined in the Bill

a compensator of last resort. The industry has been planning for a
scheme based on market share of employers’ liability insurance,
either historic or current. In its response to the Labour consultation,
the industry concentrated on only two costed models and made it quite
clear that that was the basis on which it expected the scheme to
proceed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000798" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000798">It
has been noted, although I think some of my colleagues were rather
sceptical about the figure, that backdating to 2010 could increase
costs by £80 million over 10 years. I think that figure is
acceptable and understand why the Government have suggested it. We will
see an early spike in claims during the first few years of the scheme
and in later years, of course, we will expect the number of claims to
reduce. I accept that backdating the scheme to February 2010 would
breach the 3% levy by taking it to 3.56% over the first four
years of the scheme, although it would be comfortably within 3% over
the first 10 years. Ho0wever, I strongly contend that for a
multi-billion-pound industry that is receiving, as colleagues have
pointed out, a £17 million gift and a £30 million loan
from the Government, it could easily swallow that cash-flow issue,
especially given that, as has been pointed out repeatedly
this afternoon, it has been taking income in premiums for such policies
over years—in fact, over decades. The money is already in its
hands.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000799" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000799">Let
me remind right hon. and hon. Members that it is not possible to access
the scheme unless the technical committee that will manage it takes a
view that an employers’ liability insurance policy was in place.
It is not possible to access the scheme on the basis that there was no
policy; there must be prima facie evidence that there was a policy and
that premiums were therefore
collected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000800" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000800">I
understand and strongly sympathise with the points made by colleagues
about the moral case for 100% of average civil damages to be the basis
on which the scheme should operate. In fact, I believe that that is the
Minister’s, and everybody’s, moral preferred position in
relation to the victims of this horrific disease. I was very pleased to
hear him put on the record—I think it is the first time he has
had the chance to do so—that it was not his view that a figure
below 100% was necessary to create some sort of incentive to sufferers
to find an insurer rather than simply come to the scheme. I think we
have all found quite offensive the suggestion that sufferers are in
some way shopping around for the best deal. I am grateful to him for
putting on the record that the Government do not believe that that
would be the case.</hs_Para>

was struck by the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Middlesbrough (Andy McDonald)—sadly, he is not in the Chamber at
the moment—that because of well-established principles of
contributory negligence, in paying out less than 100% to victims we
albeit inadvertently send a message to them that it may be perceived
that to some degree the suffering that they are facing is their own
fault. That is an extremely unfortunate and unjustified message to send
to victims who have contracted a disease simply from going out to work
to earn a living and support their families. I hope we can all accept
that whatever the constraints imposed by the deal that the Minister has
been able to negotiate, the moral case for mesothelioma sufferers
coming to this scheme is that they should be compensated in
full.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000802" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000802">The
proposal by the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch)
is supported right across the House. We recognise that an 80% payout is
a very reasonable compromise even within the terms of the scheme that
the Minister has negotiated. There would be more money in the scheme if
the Government and the industry stopped messing around with the likely
legal fees that claimants would be facing. The fees were £7,000
and then went down to £2,000, which somehow magically allowed us
to get the payouts up to 75%, and now they have gone back up to
£7,000 again. The hon. and learned Member for Sleaford and North
Hykeham (Stephen Phillips) is not able to join us in
today’s debate, but in Committee he made some very
telling points about lawyers’ fees. He is a well-paid lawyer, so
I am sure he will forgive me for saying that he ought to know
—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> The fees were considerably
more modest than his fees, as I think we all heard. He pointed out that
any assumption in the basis on which legal fees were
calculated within the scheme would create the danger of that becoming
the tariff for its legal fees. The Minister undertook to have further
discussions to see whether it would be possible to bear down on the
level of legal fees.</hs_Para>

been advised by an asbestos victims support group that it
has been asked to help to get mesothelioma victims to put pressure on
their lawyers to keep the fees low. That is unacceptable. At a time
when they are coping with an appalling illness and worrying about the
future for their families, as they know they may not even survive to
receive the compensation that they are due, the last thing they need is
to get into an argument with their lawyers about fees. I really hope
that the Minister is able to do much more than simply pass the problem
back to victims. Perhaps he will respond to that point in his
comments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000804" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000804">Another
issue that we discussed in Committee and have not yet got to the bottom
of is that a whole range of other fees are covered by the levy, as we
have debated during the passage of the Bill: the insurance
industry’s legal fees of £24.2 million, as distinct from
the victims’ legal fees; the scheme administration costs of
£4.4 million; and the set-up costs of £1.4 million. In
Committee, the Minister assured me that the industry’s legal
fees would be spent to the benefit of claimants and said he would get
back to me if he was wrong about that. As he has not done so, I assume
that those fees will be spent for the benefit of claimants. However,
since he told me that on 12 December, I have been racking my brains as
to how they would be spent for the benefit of claimants, and I have not
been able to think of anything. I therefore hope that he will now be
able to give me chapter and verse on exactly how those fees are to be
deployed.</hs_Para>

also hope the Minister will be able to confirm that the sum set aside
for setting up and administering the scheme will contain no profit
element. This is of particular concern, because we know that the
insurance industry itself is likely to bid to run the scheme. The
Minister assured us in Committee that the process of appointing the
body to run the scheme would be a competitive one. He said it would be
based on value for money and commercial criteria, which is welcome, but
those criteria would not necessarily preclude the administrator from
making a profit: they might simply have to come up with the best
price.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000806" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000806">I
am still in some about doubt about the position on arbitration costs
and whether they are also being taken out of the levy. The Minister has
not yet responded on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000807" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000807">All
those factors could serve to deplete funds that could otherwise be
deployed to more generous payouts or to an earlier start date. It
really is not good enough that we are still in the dark at this very
late stage as to how much of the levy is earmarked for expenditure
other than direct payments to
victims.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14010751002052" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751002052">5

welcome the debate we have had this afternoon and the attempts made by
Members throughout the House to extend the generosity of the scheme to
victims. I very much hope that the Minister will be able to give us
some positive reassurances as to how that can be achieved, because I
know he shares with all colleagues the wish for the scheme to be as
generous as possible. It is strongly our view that there is
every reason to believe—we have heard the evidence this
afternoon—that the scheme can afford to be more generous than it
is at

I thank in particular the shadow Minister, the hon. Member for

agree that we have been as helpful as possible to her, her team and
other colleagues, not only through letters but through access to our
team managers. I am slightly concerned about the technical questions

there will be a review after four years. I have committed to the 3%
figure beyond the four years, as is absolutely right. I will come back
to the £80 million that has been touched on in a second.
Actuaries have looked at this very carefully and the Health and Safety
Executive, for which I am also responsible, has looked at the costings.
We will consider the review at the end of the four years, but there is
no way in which the figure will drop below 3%. As far as I am
concerned, that will flow through until we get 100% of
compensation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000817" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000817">It
is very important for hon. Members to understand that we are talking
about 75% of the average, which means that some people will be worse
off—I fully admit that—but that some people will get more
than they would have done if they had been able to trace their insurer
or employer and go through the scheme. That is an interesting parallel.
The percentage is an average, and in working with an average some will
be on one side of the line and some will be on the other side of the
line. I know that it is really difficult for those on the wrong side of
the line in theory, but there will be people on the other side of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751000818" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751000818">Where
should the arbitrary line be? Of course I could say, as I did in
Committee, that the consultation issued by the Government before the
last election included a proposal to do nothing. I accept that there is
a proposal to do nothing in most consultations, but it was there. I do
not, however, think that that is the biggest issue; the biggest issue

amendment was discussed in Committee on 12 December and
relates to the fact that HMRC has now decided that a High Court order
will be needed in order for it to release the employment records of
deceased customers and protect employers’ confidentiality.

their prima facie case that an employers’ liability policy of

Data Protection Act, disclosure about employers to customers while
still living is permitted because that would be part of their personal
information. But this cannot apply once the customer is deceased. It
might then be possible to look to the Commissioner of Revenue and
Customs Act 2005 to enable access to employment records but this does
not appear to offer circumstances in which HMRC is prepared to release
the records without a High Court order, as HMRC confirmed in a letter

is a worry in relation to the diffuse mesothelioma payments scheme
because it will be very burdensome for families to get such a court
order—burdensome and potentially costly. We must recognise that
the need to do so will be quite frequent because victims die so quickly
after diagnosis. The Data Protection Act exemption that is available to
customers while still living will in many cases not be
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751001920" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751001920">When
we discussed the matter in Committee before Christmas, I asked the
Minister what consideration had been given to the impact of the changed
interpretation on mesothelioma victims. I asked what consultation had
been carried out and how the change in interpretation could be
reconciled with the Ministry of Justice’s aim to speed up the
process of claims. I emphasise of course that this is an issue not just
for those coming through the diffuse mesothelioma payments scheme, but
for anyone pursuing civil claims in relation to the
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751001921" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751001921">Since
our debate in Committee I have learned that the concerns that I raised
are shared more widely. Coroners, in particular, are becoming very
anxious. I am sure that the Minister will be aware that in the
Liverpool coroners court the other day, the coroner required HMRC
to produce the employment records of a Mr Roger Carmichael.
HMRC, relying on its new interpretation of the law, declined to provide
those records and to appear before the coroner. I understand that the
ruling is now being challenged in a judicial review. Clearly, with the
matter proceeding through the courts, both the Minister and I are going
to have to be careful in what we say about that case—indeed, I
do not intend to say anything about it.</hs_Para>

clear, however, is that the situation is just a mess—a mess that
will bear adversely on mesothelioma sufferers and one that we need to
sort out. It is potentially a costly mess for the Government if, for
example, coroners needed to be funded to make applications to the High 
<?notus-xml column=253?>Court for the release of employment records. It is potentially a mess
because it could be a breach of the Government’s obligations
under the European convention on human rights, particularly in respect
of people’s ability to exercise their article 2
rights, which would apply to mesothelioma claims. It is a confused mess
when it comes to coroners’ matters as to whether the
Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Act 2005 or the Coroners and
Justice Act 2009 prevails on disclosure—a mess that I imagine
would be a subject of the judicial review. In any event, if
we are speedily to introduce the diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme,
it is a mess that we—and, I am sure, the Minister—will
want to see speedily sorted
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751001923" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751001923">This
mess has arisen not because the law has changed, but because
HMRC’s interpretation of the law has recently changed. Of course
we understand and I accept that if HMRC receives legal advice saying
that it should act differently from how it has worked previously, it
cannot casually disregard it, but there is clearly an urgent need to
clarify the exact position. The judicial review to which I referred
might not adequately clarify the position for mesothelioma sufferers
and their dependants coming into this scheme because, as I say, it
might make a ruling only on mesothelioma matters before the
coroner—not necessarily or likely to be applicable to accessing
this scheme.</hs_Para>

the Minister recognised this concern when I raised it in Committee and
he said that he was anxious to see it resolved, but reluctant to do it
in this Bill because of his wariness around ping-pong. While I am,
frankly, doubtful whether this would be a major stumbling-block if we
had to ping this back to their lordships, who I think would be pretty
happy to see an amendment put through simply and straightforwardly to
address the particular problem, I understand that the Minister, in
conjunction with his colleagues in other Departments, is now looking
for another legislative vehicle.</hs_Para>

certainly welcome, but I have to ask the Minister whether he is going
to find that legislative vehicle quickly enough for it to be available
before the diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme comes into effect? He
has repeatedly stressed that this scheme needs to be up and running by
the summer of 2014, which does not leave a lot of time to find a
suitable legislative vehicle to sort out the problem and ensure that it
is dealt with robustly so that the scheme can properly be the
beneficiary of such sorting out. I am thus extremely anxious that the
Minister might find himself in some difficulty if his colleagues cannot
oblige him with a handy, urgent and useful Bill.</hs_Para>

might like to think about accepting this amendment. It is intended to
help what he says he wants to happen, which is to get the scheme up and
running, operational and effective as quickly as possible. It is not a
contentious amendment; it is not one about which there is going to be
any dispute either here or in the other place in respect of what it is
designed to achieve. The amendment is narrowly drafted to relate
specifically to those seeking employment records in relation to
accessing the scheme that this Bill covers. If the Minister is unable
to accept my amendment, I hope he will be able to assure me at least
that the matter will be sorted 
<?notus-xml column=254?>out in good time before the scheme comes into operation this summer. I
hope he will explain how he thinks that will happen. We do not want

amendment and for setting out her position early when she said that she
would not press the amendment to a vote. She is quite right, and I
reiterate the point I made in Committee: I do not think this is the
right Bill for addressing that important issue. I agree that the change
in HMRC’s interpretation of the existing law—as opposed
to a change in the law itself—is a massive issue, but
fortunately there is time for us to deal with it between now
and July. I have been meeting Justice Ministers to discuss the matter.
As I am sure the House will understand, the Ministry of Justice does
not want the courts to be clogged up with people asking for court
orders in order to obtain their employment records, and I am sure that
that was not the intention when the legislation was
enacted.</hs_Para>

priority—apart from publishing the regulations, which we hope to

Minister, and we will find a vehicle to simplify the way in which the
employment records are obtained for those who are making claims on the
mesothelioma fund, so that we can do exactly what it says on the tin.
What we have wanted to do all along is secure a speedy resolution for
those who need access to the fund because they have no other recourse,
and it is imperative for the House and Ministers to ensure that that
happens. I hope the hon. Lady accepts that we are working very hard,

substantial Bills such as the Deregulation Bill may make some progress
between now and July, we have not observed legislation proceeding all
that speedily under this Government, particularly given the notorious
requirement for a legislative “pause” while Ministers go
off and rethink from time to time. Obviously, if the Minister has to
use colleagues’ primary legislation to deliver his intent, he

tribute to Ministers in this Government and past Governments who have
worked over many years to bring us to the point we reach today, and

very complex and technical details of this Bill? I also want to echo
the Minister’s thanks to his officials, who have been extremely
helpful, in this Chamber and the other place, and to both Opposition

consequences of different scenarios, which we sought to test as we

little further than we have managed tonight. The Bill could be so much
better than it is and, in the House of Lords, in Committee, on Second
Reading and again this afternoon and this evening, Members on both
sides of the House have highlighted its deficiencies and have suggested
very constructive, practical—and affordable, where cost
implications have been involved—ways to remedy them. It is
disappointing that the Minister has felt under such pressure from the
deal that has been done with the industry that he has been unable to
accept any of the amendments, which I think have been brought forward
in a very constructive manner. I think the Minister himself said that

matter of concern that we are passing legislation today that we already
think will need improvement in four years’ time. I hold the
rather old-fashioned view that we ought to try to get legislation right
first time, and it is a shame that we already know that Parliament will
want to come back to certain areas of this legislation after four
years. Mention has been made repeatedly during the passage of the Bill
of the areas involved. They include: eligibility; access to the scheme;
the cost of running and administering the scheme; the processes
surrounding the scheme; the funding of research into the treatment and
cure for mesothelioma; and, of course, the generosity of the scheme.
There is a clear need for us 
<?notus-xml column=257?>to make progress in the development of each of those areas, and I

progress.</hs_Para>

question of generosity, it is widely agreed that there is no moral case
whatever for sufferers to receive a payout of less than 100%. Even if
we accept that there is a constraint on 100% payouts that is
dictated by affordability—the industry has suggested that that
affordability is restricted to an amount set at 3% of gross written
premium—I suggest that that figure is laughably small in the
context of a multi-billion pound industry that has been collecting
premiums and avoiding payouts for decades. There should have been some
scope for pushing the industry for more.</hs_Para>

level of payouts and, crucially, to protect the 3% levy were all

the House did not vote for them. Those amendments would have meant:
more money for victims; more victims benefiting; the possibility of
more asbestos-related diseases being covered; more funding for
research; and the inclusion of the self-employed and those who are
currently forced to access less generous schemes.</hs_Para>

the Government’s response, as articulated by Lord Howe in the
House of Lords, has been welcome as far as it goes. We very much hope
that it will bear fruit in bringing forward more, better-funded and
more fully developed research proposals. However, we really cannot
overlook the moral responsibility of everyone involved in the sorry
history of asbestos exposure to invest now in the best quality research
that we can possibly promote to tackle this horrible disease. It was
pointed out earlier that our obligation is not just to sufferers who
are experiencing and dying of the disease now, and not just to
sufferers in the UK. Developing economies mean that exposure rates
around the world will rise for many years to come. Good research
programmes and proposals exist, and more will come forward. Ministers
have given a welcome indication of what they intend to do to galvanise
and support such proposals, but we will want to keep a close watch on
the practical consequences and effects of the guarantees that have been
given. Unless they turn into properly funded, meaningful research
programmes, I fear that we will have heard little more than warm
words.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751001948" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751001948">We
very much look forward to seeing the draft regulations, which the
Minister has indicated will be available tomorrow. I hope that will
give us the opportunity to see some of the details of how the scheme
will be run, which remain to be teased out, even after our debates. We
particularly wish to scrutinise the detailed operation of the scheme,
because we know that the insurance industry hopes to create a vehicle
that can bid to administer the scheme. Understandably, there is a
certain amount of suspicion among victims’ groups about the
industry, which has so wronged them over so many decades, now becoming
the vehicle responsible for operating the scheme that is to give
victims some level of financial satisfaction.</hs_Para>

have discussed the Bill and the scheme with me have given me an
encouraging impression of how committed they are to operating an

However, as I am sure the Minister will expect, it is not enough that
we have a scheme run wholly in the interests of victims; the scheme
must also be seen to be run in that way. That requires a tendering
process that is entirely transparent. It requires transparency about
the costs of running the scheme and who is recouping what payments for
running the scheme, including details on a range of costs and fees that
we are still unclear about: the legal fees, the arbitration costs, and
the set-up and running costs. Those simply must not deplete resources
that ought to be available to make payouts to victims. I hope that when
the regulations are introduced, much more financial and operational
detail will be given about the running of the scheme.</hs_Para>

sort out some difficulties that lie outwith his control but which, none

We urgently need a resolution to the difficulties created for us by Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs’ new interpretation of
disclosure rules in relation to employment records. I hope, too, that
he will continue in dialogue with the Ministry of Justice about the
baffling correlation it makes between the Legal Aid, Sentencing and

is not for me to put words into the mouths of Ministers or to suggest
what Ministers think the connection is, but let me roughly paraphrase
the letter. It said, “We think the two are connected because we

that we will pass into law tonight is a start, but it is far from being
all we can do for the victims of mesothelioma. I am glad that
Parliament will keep close oversight of the scheme via the mechanism of
the four-year report. That must be an opportunity for the fullest and
most open scrutiny and should be taken as a genuine effort to develop
and expand the scheme. As debate on the Bill has proceeded, it has been
quite clear that it is the strong will of parliamentarians in both
Houses and across all parties to secure justice for sufferers of this
appalling disease, which was so often contracted by people who simply
went out to work to earn a living to support their families, and yet in
so doing were put under terrible threat. Today we have made a start in
securing some justice for those victims, but there is much more for us
to do. We can, we must and—as it is the mood of
Parliament—we will do better for victims than we have

not as good as it could and should have been if we were to provide fair

constraints that the Minister was under as a consequence of the

Crouch:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. My
constituency has high levels of mesothelioma because of its dockyard
history and the heavy industries that surround the Medway towns.
Earlier, the hon. Member for Barrow and Furness (John Woodcock)
expressed concern that I might be poacher turned gamekeeper as a
consequence of my time in the insurance industry before coming to this
place and trying to secure better compensation for mesothelioma
victims. My bosses from my previous life know that I was strong
campaigner for mesothelioma victims. Indeed I was proud of the efforts
that I took during my time in the insurance industry to try to improve
access to compensation. It just so happens that I was also elected to a
constituency that has high levels of mesothelioma.</hs_Para>

that we had a debate today, but, as I have said, I remain slightly
disappointed that nothing has happened to the Bill since it received
its Second Reading. I see that as a failure in the way that Parliament
works. Although I pay tribute to the Minister’s officials, who
have worked incredibly hard and been generous with their time, it is a
shame that the Bill that was prepared before our debate in Parliament
is exactly the same now despite the fact that there is a strong will on
both sides of the House to improve the legislation.</hs_Para>

tribute, as I did on Second Reading, to Lord Freud. He had a difficult
time in getting the insurance industry to the table. I notice from the
list of meetings that he met with the industry many times. Although he
has had fewer meetings with the asbestos working group, it has had
access to civil servants. He has done a good job, and would, I think,
share the Minister’s view that this is not a perfect Bill. In a
perfect world, he would have liked much better legislation.</hs_Para>

less, both Ministers, my hon. Friend the Member for Hemel Hempstead
(Mike Penning) and Lord Freud, are quite right when they say that this
legislation would not have happened had it not been for this
Government, and I welcome that. I remember the negotiations that took
place with the previous Government and it is quite right for the
Ministers to say that they are proud of where they have got to.
Mesothelioma victims will be better off as they will have access to
some compensation but, as I have said, I still think that the Bill is
flawed.</hs_Para>

to pay tribute to my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford
and North Hykeham (Stephen Phillips), who did a fantastic job in
Committee of raising many of the issues I would have liked to have
raised personally. He brought to the debate understanding of the issues
of mesothelioma and the concerns of the victims. Having met victims, he
understands how awful the disease is, that it is a fatal disease that
can be contracted only through exposure to asbestos and that victims
will, unfortunately, die an incredibly painful death. He did a

again to pay tribute to the right hon. Member for Wythenshawe and Sale
East (Paul Goggins). He and I have worked on this issue for many months
and years and it seems strange to stand up in this Chamber and discuss
mesothelioma without his being in the House. I hope that he recognises
that those of us who have tabled amendments and spoken in the debate

there will be a review of the legislation. Like the hon. Member for

even naively believe that we should be making legislation that does not
need to be reviewed in four years’ time and that it could be
better scrutinised and considered in this place and in the other place
before it passes into law. We are where we are, however, so I
congratulate the Minister on getting the Bill through the House on
time. I am pleased that many victims will secure some sort of
compensation for a disease that they got simply by going to

out there being able to see that this House can deliver such
legislation, and in an urgent fashion. The Minister said that his
imperative was urgently to produce legislation that could deliver, and
that is clearly what he has tried to do. We want fairness for these
sufferers to enable them to have some quality of life in their
lifetime, however short it might be. I always think of the families, in
particular, who watched their loved one deteriorate markedly in a very
short period. This Bill takes a massive step in the right direction for

although I understand that there is legitimate cause for concern about
the behaviour of some of them. I voted for the 80% compensation
amendment because I felt that the extra £6,000 was significant
and deliverable, and, like other Members, I could see no reason why
insurance companies would walk away from such a deal. That
£6,000 would have made a very significant difference to people
in my constituency who suffer from this disease and who often live in
some of the poorest areas.</hs_Para>

will be 15.6 million, of whom more than 3 million will be over 85.
Society has done much to prolong lives through a focus on helping

an ageing population, it is no surprise to hear the worrying prediction
that 1 million people will be living with dementia by 2021, up from
800,000 today. There is obviously a massive financial worry resulting
from the figures, especially when dementia is already predicted to cost
the UK economy £23 billion a year, which is more than cancer,
heart disease or stroke. It is therefore crucial to have plans in place
that are proven to deal effectively and compassionately with dementia
and that can be improved and expanded as necessary over the next 10
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751001995" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751001995">Aside
from the economic argument, the more pressing issue for me is that of
compassion, care and support. When my grandmother was diagnosed with
dementia 25 years ago, little support or information was available for
carers. Painfully aware that the last two years of her life were spent
with little memory or recognition of family members, I now wish that
she could have received an earlier diagnosis, so that we could have

earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751001996" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751001996">To
put the problem that we face in context, I will give some statistics
from the Alzheimer’s Society, which has been hugely supportive
during my preparation for this debate and has worked to raise awareness
of these issues in Parliament and throughout the country. One in three
people over 65 will die with dementia. Two thirds of care home
residents have some form of dementia. There are 600,000 family carers
of people with dementia. It is estimated that a quarter of hospital
beds are occupied by people with dementia. The most poignant statistic
for me when I was preparing for this debate was that dementia is now
the most feared health condition among people aged over
55.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010751001997" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751001997"><Member ContinuationText="Steve Rotheram" PimsId="5632" UID="14010751003787" xid="1123" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/debtext/140107-0003.htm#14010751003787"><B>Steve

Given what he has said about people living longer, which is to be
welcomed by everyone, does he agree that one of the most important
things that we can do is to ensure that there is better co-ordination

is obvious that dementia is on the radar of an ageing

prevalence at the end of life, I was horrified to hear that only 48% of
people who live with dementia receive a formal diagnosis, meaning that
many people are denied the care and support that they and their loved
ones need. Before the national dementia strategy for England was
introduced in 2009, the rate was 33%. If further proof were needed that
dementia care and services need to be improved as soon as possible,
those awful diagnosis rates should be enough to show that something
needs to

work out what was the best thing to do for his mother. He toiled over
the decisions that he had to make for a long time, such as selling the

about a number of areas. First, to continue making improvements along
the current trajectory, it is crucial that the national dementia
strategy for England is updated from the 2009 version. That strategy
identified 17 key objectives for the NHS and social services aimed at
improving the commissioning of dementia services, the quality of care
delivered in hospitals and care homes, developing a clear picture of
research and evidence needs, and providing support for carers. Will the

effectiveness of the NDSE, and say what plans he has for a formal

spite of the obvious benefits of the national strategy, so
far the Government have made no plans to renew it. I welcome the Prime
Minister’s challenge on dementia, which is ambitious in its
plans and places a welcome political spotlight on the issue. However,
that challenge alone does not provide the breadth of detail
needed to guide health and social care services to make
improvements, and neither does it carry enough accountability measures,
which a national strategy would do.</hs_Para>

President Obama published a dementia strategy that runs until 2025,
well beyond 
<?notus-xml column=270?>his own term as President. France has recently published its fourth
dementia strategy. The economic case for having a clear directive for
dementia is overwhelming. Dementia costs the UK £23 billion a

annual research spend into dementia is about £51 million, rising
to £66 million in 2015. That compares with

for his mother. He would be at work all day. His mother lived in
south-east London while we lived 20 miles away in Kent and he would get
a phone call at 3 am from her next-door neighbour saying, “Your
mother”—she was in her late 70s—“is out
walking the street in her nightgown.” Those are the pressures

gives me the opportunity to say something very quickly about the
initiative being taken by the Alzheimer’s Society. If someone
applies to be a dementia friend, they can go along to an hour-long
session on understanding dementia better. It is very illuminating to go
through that process. We got the initial idea from Japan, where it has
gathered enormous momentum. If we can get a million people across
society who better understand dementia, it could have an enormously
powerful impact by making our communities more dementia friendly and
understanding and giving people with dementia a better life. I would
therefore encourage my hon. Friend to become a dementia

does he agree that the best treatment is care in the home of the person

important thing is that the care and support should always be right for
the individual. Whatever they need they should be provided with. I
recently visited the most amazing GP surgery in Gnosall, Staffordshire,
which has managed—this demonstrates a point that my hon. Friend
the Member for Elmet and Rothwell made about the variability of
dementia diagnosis rates—to achieve diagnosis rates of close to
100%. That demonstrates what is possible. Most of the diagnosing is
done in the community within primary care without referral to a memory
clinic. What they have found is that by getting early diagnosis and
then having very good community follow-up and support—the
general practice is central to that—people are staying in their
own homes and maintaining a good life for far longer and the admissions
to care homes and nursing homes are significantly reduced. That
demonstrates what is possible and confirms the point that my hon.

to look at what has worked and what might not have worked quite so
well. My concern is that whatever comes next must find a way of uniting
the whole system. In proceedings on the Care Bill, we debated
integration and how important it was, particularly for dementia,
because it will save us money. When the Minister looks at the next set
of strategies, I urge him to bear in mind that the country must not
have in place a set of fragmented relationships that are not bringing
the system together to make things better for people with dementia and

Lamb:</Member></B> I very much agree with the right hon. Lady on that.
I think that what she argues for is developing. We are not there yet,
but it is important that we have developed this ambition to achieve a
diagnosis rate of two thirds, which encourages every part of the system
to focus on what it needs to do. It is not a nationally imposed
arbitrary target; it was based on getting every part of the system to
think about what it can achieve by setting ambitious objectives.
Collectively, that amounts to an ambition to achieve a two-thirds
diagnosis rate, but in itself, of course, a two-thirds diagnosis rate
is not good enough. We should not be satisfied when we achieve that; we
have to press on. We know that the community in Gnosall has a diagnosis
rate of close to 100%, so we should not be satisfied until everyone is
getting properly diagnosed on a timely basis. I agree with the right
hon. Lady’s point. Under the new system, with the health reforms
making clinicians much more involved in the commissioning of care
locally, there is a greater chance of getting the engagement of general
practice across the country than we perhaps had in the past through the
primary care trust route.</hs_Para>

once a person has been identified as needing a diagnosis, but in my

important for councils commissioning care to be absolutely clear with

amendment to the Care Bill which will require that commissioning takes
into account an individual’s well-being. Councils cannot
commission on the basis of 15 minutes of care when important care work
needs to be undertaken. They will not meet their obligation under the

Graham</B> (Gloucester) (Con):</Member> Today we are covering a subject
that in many ways is both dull and important. “Annuity”
is a difficult word, which lacks a simple definition, and it is not
something that a man or woman under the age of 50 would wisely bring up
in discussion with friends. However, 400,000 people this year will buy
an annuity. That figure will grow substantially over the years, and
anything that affects such a large percentage of our country’s
population is therefore worthy of the first Westminster Hall debate in
2014. Annuities are dull, but important, and absolutely ripe for review
and improvement. It is therefore timely that Mr Speaker has chosen the
subject for the first Westminster Hall debate of the year, and it is a
pleasure to participate in it under your chairmanship, Mr
Dobbin<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T09:31:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000007">I
will first outline annuities and their market as it is at the moment,
who buys them, for whom they are best and least suited, and whether we
need them, before looking at specific issues raised by recent
investigations and considering what more might be done to improve the
world of annuities.
Historically<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T09:39:24"></hs_TimeCode>,
pension structures have required individuals to bring certainty to our
savings, effectively by exchanging whatever pool of savings we have for
known income, by drawing an annuity or by having income
draw-down—two technical terms already, which are perhaps better
described as “income for life”. That is what an annuity
was designed to deliver, and it is derived from a complex calculation
that involves bond yields, longevity and charges. In due course, I will
return to discuss the last especially.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010730000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000008">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T09:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>
concept of an annuity is relatively simple: to provide older people
with the certainty of knowing what their income will be in an otherwise
uncertain world of costs and, perhaps, care. In a world of
defined-benefit pensions, we had such certainty, but that
world—outside the public sector—is going fast, so
certainty of income is a bigger issue than it was, and in
today’s world many people are searching for it. We might
therefore imagine that an annuity is the product for today. As
auto-enrolment expands, reaching about 8 million  new pension
savers, net of opt-outs, the number of new annuity customers will
surely grow. It will be a slow burn, because most of those
auto-enrolling over the next few years will not reach annuity-type age
for some decades, but eventually the figure used in the
media—the number of annuity customers doubling—will be
reached. As a result, instead of more than 1,000 new customers a day in
2014, before long there will be 2,000 new buyers of annuities every
day<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T09:33:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000009">The
annuities market will therefore soon have 500,000 customers a year,
predominantly in their 60s and 70s, making what for most will be the
second most important 
<?notus-xml column=2?>financial decision of their life—the first being their home. As
Ros Altmann has pointed out, as things stand with an annuity, unlike
buying a home, there is no going back: someone buys it and
that’s it—no change, no transfer, no flexibility and no
equivalent of renting out, moving on, selling or downsizing.
An<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T09:34:49"></hs_TimeCode> annuity
therefore best suits customers who know exactly what they are looking
for—because they are well versed in the language of annuities,
such as open-market options, enhanced annuities or comparisons with
income draw-downs—and perhaps already have a defined benefit
pension and are looking to convert a smaller defined contribution pot,
which is a modest percentage of their total savings.</hs_Para>

customers use the comparison tables of the office of the Pensions

They know that they will keep the same wife, husband or partner for
ever, that they will live long enough for the income draw-down to
exceed the capital exchanged and the commission charges, and that,
ideally, both partners will exceed the lifespan expectations of their
current health and the geography of where they
live—alternatively, perhaps they will buy their annuity in a
poor city and thereafter move to an idyllic village where people live
longer. Such a customer should do well in the current world of
annuities. Unfortunately, he or she is as exotic and rare as a sacred

advice on a complex product such as an annuity. For those who have a
relatively small pot of savings, such as £20,000, £30,000

of paying £400 or £500 for advice is not attractive. My

drew attention to the perfect customer for an annuity; let me now give
the other side of the coin. By contrast is the customer who is told by
the provider of their direct contribution pension—his or her
only modest source of savings—that they need an annuity, has no
idea what an annuity is and asks the pensions provider what they can
offer; who has no idea whether that offer is good, bad or indifferent,
goes for the cheaper of the options available, probably leaving out any
cover for his or her partner and certainly any provision for inflation,
and forgets to 
<?notus-xml column=3?>mention perhaps a hereditary heart weakness; and who moves from a suburb
to the inner city to be closer to shops and a hospital, lives for a few
years and then dies, having drawn only a small percentage of income
from a capital sum that has now disappeared, leaving their wife,

longevity the way it is, we might argue that such a customer scarcely
exists, as we would all hope, but the reality is that some of his or
her characteristics are a reality—as the Pensions Advisory
Service has confirmed—especially in the understanding of what
they are buying. Ros Altmann has estimated that insurers will often
keep between half and three quarters of a pension fund they take over
and convert it into an
annuity<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T09:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000015">I
did a quick reality check on the word “annuity” in a
Gloucester pub last weekend. Of the 22 people I asked, six said it was
a financial thing like a pension, one of those said it gave income and
most of the rest said they had no idea. I accept that it was a bad
weekend for Gloucester rugby, and trying to discuss annuities in a pub
was pushing my luck, but I do not believe that the people of Britain
know what an annuity is or that the average response would be any
different. Why is an annuity useful? Do people have to have one? The
answer is no. How do they go about getting one? An annuity is
potentially the second biggest financial purchase of our lives, so the
current state of information about them is
worrying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000016">In
any market that size—£12 billion a year is big—if
a customer feels that he or she has to buy something but does not
really know what it is, the definition of good value is elusive.
Customers need a lot of knowledge to pick the right product and the
market is dominated by a handful of big names, so there is a danger of
high charges, a lack of transparency and inadequate protection. The
annuities market more than lives up to all those risks. I rang the
Pensions Advisory Service yesterday to get some initial
advice—just one man in his 50s ringing in to ask questions about
annuities. I got good general advice on a whole number of issues, but
when I asked about charges, I was told confidently, “You will
never be able to work out what the charges are.” I asked the
helpful adviser whether he thought that was right. “Not for me
to say,” he replied, which was fair enough. However, it is right
for hon. Members to raise and challenge the situation on behalf of our
constituents, who ought to know what they are being charged for a
product as important as an
annuity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000017">Almost
20,000 of my constituents in Gloucester are between 50 and 64. For all
of those people, some understanding of annuities would be useful. It is
not good enough to have a product for which people will simply never
know the charges. The situation for annuities sits oddly beside that
for their stepbrother or sister, the pension. Huge efforts are being
made to clarify, and make as simple as possible, all the costs and
charges for pensions; to estimate a management fee that is neither
rapacious nor drives investment managers to the lowest common
denominator; and, above all, to make charges transparent to the client.
The status quo is tantamount to an insurance firm—everyone is
under the same roof, in the same organisation—saying,
“Right, over here is a team of investment managers managing
pensions: you 
<?notus-xml column=4?>need to be squeaky clean, work out all the costs and charges and report
them completely. Your margins will be tight. Over here, in this corner,
we have the annuities guys: your pricing is roughly what you want it to
be, and there is no need to explain or declare anything.” That
has to be wrong. When such efforts are being made to ensure
transparency about money coming into a pension, it is especially

today’s debate, we have the benefit of the detailed

commission charges vary by up to £1,000, which might, for the

what the charges

FCA found in general that the industry was “very
dysfunctional”, with “possible exploitative
pricing”—up to 6% of a customer’s pot could go in
commission. In a rebuke to any of us who thought that the answer might
simply be to provide more information, the consumer panel found that
customers are put off by the mountain of jargon and “information
overload”. Frankly, I am irresistibly reminded of the endowment
mortgage I was obliged to buy in the 1980s: however it was explained,
it was absolute gobbledegook, and there were high commissions, often
from one insurer to another. The consumer panel found that 3.5%
commission for an introduction from Zurich to Legal &amp; General
seemed to be the going rate for annuities today. In the 1980s, if
someone wanted to buy a house, they had to have an endowment mortgage.
Later on, of course, the fabulous projected investment returns did not
materialise, the mis-selling was investigated, fines were levied, the
product was binned and the financial sector moved on. Will we see a

now to what changes have already been made, and then move on to what
could or perhaps should be done next. I start by recognising what the
Government have already done. Some of the changes made by the Treasury
should have been made a decade ago. For example, it has removed the
default retirement age and the effective requirement to purchase an
annuity by the age of 75. That is a vital change: it means people no
longer have to buy an annuity, and, if they do not, they can take 25%
of their savings tax-free and draw an income from the rest. That is a
serious option for many people. The starting point of a debate on
annuities for every individual should always be whether an annuity will
be useful and helpful to them, and what the alternatives
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000022">There
have also been changes to the capped drawdown rules—more jargon,
I am afraid, but those rules have been reformed, and that matters
within the sector. The Treasury has also encouraged the ABI’s
new code of 
<?notus-xml column=5?>conduct for retirement choices, which has come into play and has made
modest steps forward on explanations and general advice, but
I do not believe that that is enough. At the same
time, the Department for Work and Pensions has promoted open market
options and obliged DC schemes to provide what it calls a
“wake-up pack” of information,
pre-retirement.</hs_Para>

changes that the Treasury has made do not in themselves answer the nub
of the issue, as highlighted so well by the FCA consumer panel. The
uncomfortable truth remains that very few people understand annuities

the right product for them, and they have no idea what charges are
being levied and whether they are appropriate. As the consumer panel
concluded, much more needs to be done. The fundamental issues that I
flagged up at the beginning of the debate remain unresolved. An annuity
is still something that is bought once and that lasts for ever;

change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000026">I
will finish by touching on some of the issues that could and should be
addressed. I do not want to make too much of the structure of the
market, but it would be interesting to hear the Minister’s
views. In a way, an annuity is an offshoot of the pensions
sector—it is what happens after a pension—but because it
is provided by the insurance sector, it is regulated by regulators that
are ultimately responsible to the Treasury. The Pensions Advisory
Service is DWP funded; the Money Advice Service is separately funded,
and the appointments of its chairman and chief executive are approved
by the Treasury, but it is answerable for its strategy to the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. There is therefore a
sense of different advice being offered by different agencies that are
responsible to different Departments. That situation does not seem
wholly satisfactory to me. It is interesting that the Opposition have
today chosen to put up their pensions spokesman rather than someone
from their Treasury
team.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000027">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T09:49:30"></hs_TimeCode>re
is the structural issue of how annuities are regulated and whether the
gap between increasing regulation on the pension side, especially in
the context of defined contributions and auto-enrolment, could be
mirrored by more regulation on the annuities side. I hope that the
DWP’s consultation on charges will also shed light on the
charges on annuities. Perhaps the Treasury will be able to absorb that

given specific advice to save and were given to understand that when
they took out an annuity at a specific age, the return would be
£10,000 or £7,500 a year, but they are lucky to get
£4,000 or even £3,000 now. That is difficult for people

Graham:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, who raises an
important point. There is no doubt that annuity rates have dropped
sharply from 10% to 5% over the last few years. Rather like charges on
pensions and on investment management generally, it is only when a
market becomes more difficult that it becomes more important to shine a
light on charges and commission structures, because they become a much
higher part of the total cost. If someone’s significant pension
pot does not generate a significant income, they want to know where the
money is going. My hon. Friend is absolutely right to raise that issue,
which has propelled the annuities issue on to the front pages of
newspapers from the business and financial
sections.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000033">I
must sound a warning to the Opposition. We have heard from them over
the last few weeks and months a sudden and dramatic cry that something
must be done urgently. That rather prompts the question why they did so
little during their long 13 years in office, with almost as many
pensions Ministers. Some of the issues have been around for a long
time. I am pleased that the FCA took up the issue of annuities
relatively soon after its birth, put its consumer panel on the case and

to be reformed,

industry. Otherwise, annuities will have no real role in future
financial planning. Secondly, the opaqueness of the market stands in
stark contrast with the increasing amount of light in the pensions
industry as a whole and is therefore more of an anomaly than it was.
Thirdly, the reports now coming in from regulatory bodies provide the
Government with a wonderful opportunity to do something that millions
of people throughout the country would be grateful for and reform an
imperfect market so that it works much more effectively than at
present. It falls to our Government to have that opportunity, and I

I want to make a broader point. Over the course of the past decade,
there has been quite a lot of focus on, to use another bit of jargon,
the accumulation phase—what happens when people build up their
pensions savings. The previous Government commissioned Lord Turner to
look at pensions. I think there was some dispute between Tony Blair and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:02:51"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) about whether Lord
Turner’s recommendations should be implemented, but they were,
with cross-party consensus. There is considerable consensus over the
introduction of the single-tier pension. One area that we have not
debated in enough detail today starts that process. What happens when
people spend their pension pot? What choices are available to
them?</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester talked eloquently about symmetry
of knowledge between someone seeking an annuity and an annuity
provider, and about the circumstances that people face. Alternative
products, such as income draw-down products, are out there, but that
transfers both the investment risk and the longevity risk to the
investor—the pensioner. We need to look carefully at the
products out there, recognising that this very polarised market, with
annuities on the one hand and draw-down products on the other, may not
necessarily be in the interests of consumers. Other alternatives might
be out there.</hs_Para>

a potential impact on gilt yields. However, let us leave that to one

the lifetime of this Parliament, we have discussed the pensions
industry a number of times. To date, the discussion has mostly been of
the accumulation part and not, to use the jargon, the decumulation
part, which we will talk about today. However, the issues are similar.
I am a little less sanguine than some hon. Members who have spoken
about the fact that we have fixed the transparency problems in the
accumulation part of the industry—I believe we have not started
to do so yet. The same problems of market failure, asymmetric knowledge
and lack of transparency exist in the industry. Whether hon. Members
represent the party of the cost of living or the party of hard-working
people—Conservatives seem to have won in terms of numbers, at
least in today’s debate—the issue really
matters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000054">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:07:54"></hs_TimeCode>
fact that annuities are talked about so little compared with, say,
energy prices, is a function of  the point my hon. Friend has
made. People understand annuities so little—annuities take
people outside their comfort zones. That is a terrible thing when
400,000 people a year sign up for such products. This
morning, during the time of the debate, 250 people will have signed up
for an annuity. By lunchtime, a constituent of every Member in the
Chamber will have signed up for an annuity. Approximately a third of
them will have bought the wrong product within the market, even by the
terms of the market. In my opinion, the market is inappropriate and a
great disincentive for people to be part of the pensions industry. It
is one of the reasons why so many people who should be investing in
pensions would rather bite their arm off than get involved in either
the accumulation or decumulation part of the
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000055">Let
us step back and think about the structure of the industry, because my
solution responds a bit to that. It is an artificial industry, fed by
tax relief. We have made the decision in the UK to have a pensions
industry that is predicated on the relatively low basic state
pension—it is low compared with the rest of Europe—but
one that 
<?notus-xml column=11?>is supplemented by tax relief and private sector provision, of which the
annuity is one of the final products. The tax relief that we pump into
the industry is about £30 billion a year, which
clearly behoves the Government to get involved. With auto-enrolment,
that urgency is becoming much greater. It is not acceptable for us to
leave it as an industry that has failed, on any measure, at any time
when it has been looked at. It is reasonable that the Government get
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:09:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000056">There
are two parts to the failure. The one that gets most attention is the
failure of people to shop around—the open market
option—notwithstanding the progress that the ABI has made with
its code of conduct. It is in that context that one third of people are
currently making the wrong choices. However, that is not the only
aspect of the failure. The industry is not subject to the market
pressures that would cause better performance. Within the context of
the industry, one third of people are choosing wrongly, but the whole
industry is failing to provide products that are competitively priced
and
transparent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:10:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000057">The
industry has fairly viciously applied the term “caveat

time before a Conservative Government or a Labour Government take the
matter more seriously and start to fix
things<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:10:43"></hs_TimeCode>. In
discussions of energy companies, in which I have also been involved, it
has been said that they operate a cartel. I do not like to use words
such as “cartel” lightly, but we have to look at the
return on capital employed in industries and at transparency. Anybody
who compares the pensions industry with the energy industry will know
where the evidence of a cartel, such as it is,
exists<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:11:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000058">The
National Association of Pension Funds and Cass business school report
estimated that about £1 billion a year was being
misappropriated, or at least was not going to the pension holder,
because about one third of people buy the incorrect product. We could
fix that through the application of the OMO—more attempts to
make the market transparent—but the view I took as I was doing
research for the debate is that that is not actually the solution for
annuities market. The solution is that the Government should offer
annuities. People will say, “You want to nationalise the
industry.” I do not want to nationalise the industry—I am
a free marketeer. I was about to say that I am as much of a free
marketeer as anyone in the debate, but then I saw

possibly would challenge that. However, I really do believe in the free
market. I believe that the free market is a panacea and a great
mechanism for allocation of capital and all that goes with that, but
the annuities market is not working. When a market does not work,
particularly a market that is at the centre of Government policy on
retirement and incomes in old age, and all that goes with that, it is
reasonable that we look at what we might do about

national savings organisation in Glasgow offers interest rates as the

complicated.</hs_Para>

because, in any event, the principal thing that annuity providers do is
match Government bonds. One reason why QE has been an issue is that the
industry is buying Government bonds in order to match income and
liability. It is a classic middleman thing. It is entirely reasonable
for the Government—a Government of either complexion—to
look long and hard at that suggestion. I believe that will happen,

the Member for Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns), who has left the
Chamber. It might be a disincentive, but it is no worse than a charging
structure that pays people to recommend products based on commission
and all that that means. That is not a solution in its own right, but I
agree that we should try to make the market work better. We should hold
the ABI to account on the application of the
OMO.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000072">We
could try other things. If one third of people continue to stay with
their existing supplier and buy inappropriate products as a
consequence, there is a case for enforced separation, meaning that
people buy the decumulation product from a different provider from the
one from which they buy the accumulation product. That is entirely
reasonable if the OMO code of conduct does not work better—it is
currently rather
patchy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000073">Another
thing we could do to make the market work better is enforce the
simplification of annuities, exactly as we have done in the energy
industry, with bands to allow the comparison of products from different
providers. The case for that is even stronger in the pensions industry
than in the energy industry. I want recognition that draw-down might be
used on smaller pots than at present, so that it receives wider
application. When I speak to anybody who is about to make a decision on
whether to use an annuity or a draw-down, I recommend that they think
long and hard before they go down the annuity route. We could do more
on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000074">We

it will be an incentive for reform in the industry. We could do the

couple of final points. It is interesting that a Treasury Minister is
replying to the debate and a pensions spokesman is speaking for the
Opposition. In a way, the issue has suffered because it has not wholly
been owned by either Department and has tended to fall between the two.
I hope that that does not continue. I also hope that people in the
industry listen to the debate—I see that a couple of them are in
the Public Gallery—because it is not right for the current
situation to continue. It is not right that the industry response is to
play it long. In the time I have been speaking, 40 people will have
signed up for annuities, 15 of whom will have bought the wrong ones. We
owe it to all our constituents to get that

McClymont</B> (Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East)
(Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr
Dobbin. I congratulate the hon. Member for Gloucester (Richard Graham)
on securing the debate, because annuities continue to rise up the
political agenda. I was struck by the hon. Gentleman’s speech,
which I interpreted as a clear message that the market is not working
properly. Indeed, I understood him to say that the annuities market was
broken and cannot be fixed simply through individual engagement by
consumers. The repeated references to the Financial Conduct
Authority’s consumer panel report were helpful, because the
whole thrust of that report was that the market cannot be fixed purely
by increased transparency.</hs_Para>

Government Members referred to mortgages. A big difference between
mortgages and annuities is that annuities are one-off products, so
consumers cannot learn more about annuities over time through repeated
purchases. I agree with the hon. Member for Fareham (Mr Hoban) that the
idea of tradeable annuities, which was floated over the weekend by the
Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member
for Thornbury and Yate (Steve Webb)—I was a little surprised
that the hon. Member for Gloucester repeated that
suggestion—will not get far.</hs_Para>

Member for Gloucester provided compelling evidence of the fact that the
market does not work effectively and cannot be fixed by individual
engagement. His speech might stand as a metaphor for the
Government’s approach, because there is general agreement that
the market does not work properly—the hon. Member for Warrington
South (David Mowat) made that argument eloquently. Moving from
diagnosis to solution, however, the Government’s cupboard is
pretty bare. I listened carefully to the solutions that the hon. Member
for Gloucester suggested at the end of his speech. He noted that the
Treasury had acted to remove default retirement age and that people are
no longer required by law to annuitise by 75. As the House of Commons
Library made clear earlier this year, however, someone with a secure
pension of less than £20,000 essentially has to annuitise by 75.
Draw-down works well for those with big pension pots, but the rest of
us still have to annuitise our defined contribution pot, so that is not
a
solution.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000079">The
hon. Gentleman was good enough to mention the Association of British
Insurers code, but he was absolutely right to say that that is
not enough. Let us be clear about what the ABI has
done so far. The open market option gives people more information about
their ability not to take an annuity from their existing 
<?notus-xml column=15?>pension provider. The hon. Member for Fareham was somewhat generous when
he suggested that the results were not in yet to show whether that will
deal with the lack of shopping around. It will not deal with the
problem. All the evidence in the market shows that inertia is a
powerful force on consumers that leads to excess profits for
providers.</hs_Para>

McClymont:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman referred to the Turner
commission. The thrust of its conclusions—and, indeed, of the
auto-enrolment pensions policy pursued by the previous Labour
Government and the current Government—was that inertia is a fact
of pensions markets. Auto-enrolment is an attempt to use inertia for
the good of the public and the consumer. That is the basis on which
pensions policy is developing under  the pensions
Minister—a process that began under the previous Labour
Government.</hs_Para>

massive lack of engagement and involvement in pensions. Leaving aside
the ABI, there is general recognition in the pensions world that the
open market option is simply not going to do the job. That is the
thrust of the FCA consumer report, which has been mentioned several
times. Having looked at the matter closely over two years, and based on
the Turner commission consensus, which we wish to maintain, I am
prepared to say that inertia in the annuities market is a reality that
leads to excess profits. That is not only my description, but the
description given by the pensions Minister, who said in a recent
television documentary that excess profits were being made by insurers,
which is a product of inertia.</hs_Para>

is precisely the context in which I recommended that a change be
considered to the current requirement for an individual to buy an

about which the hon. Gentleman is concerned, because it would enable
people to reconsider and change their annuity if circumstances demanded
that. Does he agree?</hs_Para>

diagnosed the problem effectively, but provided no solution. The
airy-fairy, half-baked suggestion that we should think about tradable

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T10:30:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

transparency will not solve it. The solution cannot be based on a
utopian hope for greater individual engagement; it must be like what
the OFT report did more widely for pensions. The demand side—the
buy side—is too weak; how can we strengthen consumer weight or
consumers’ ability to get a good deal? My view is that although
individual engagement is a good thing, and anything that encourages it
should be welcomed, it will not solve the problem, given that inertia

point. It bears positive comparison with the Government’s lack
of action. They have done nothing on annuities; there are no clauses
about them in the Pensions Bill. That may or may not be an indictment
of Government policy. No one says that the problem can be solved
overnight, but surely an amendment of the kind tabled by Labour is a
reasonable starting point.</hs_Para>

National Association of Pension Funds, which is represented in the

building up a pension pot is entirely part of the same process as
producing an income at the end. Pension schemes should have a role in
providing annuity brokering advice—that is what I mean by

that the market is fragmented. There are hundreds of thousands of
pension schemes, but the providers of annuities are four or five
insurance companies and three or four

compete with the giants. It is probably to do with the amount of
capital needed, and the fact that on the insurer side it is possible to
cross-subsidise products, because of being involved during the phase of
building up the pension pot, as well as in the creation of a retirement
income at the end. We need pension schemes to be involved as a matter
of course in ensuring that their members get the best possible annuity

face a broken market; the question is what to do about it. It seems to
the Opposition that the way forward is increasingly to involve pension
schemes in—I am wary about using this term, as I try not to use
the jargon—“decumulation”. Pension schemes are
involved in building up savings pots for members. They should also be
involved in turning those savings pots into retirement income, which is
what the process is all about, after all. Moving to a system in which
pension schemes ensured that their members got decent, well regulated
brokerage advice would mean bigger pension schemes, because many very
small pension schemes do not now have the ability.</hs_Para>

panel bids from annuity providers for each cohort coming to retirement.
That is not the whole of the market, because NEST must annuitise for
people with very small pots, as part of its public service objective,
but that is the road we must go down. The Royal Mail pension scheme is
another one that recently announced that it would provide an in-house
brokerage service for its members.</hs_Para>

with anything concrete. Until they do, the hundreds  of people
who are annuitising as we speak and the 400,000 people who annuitise
every year will surely look at the Government and ask when they will
end the rip-off and the excess profits. If the pensions Minister says
that insurance companies are profiting excessively from annuities, when
will the Government act? Surely it must be sooner rather than
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010730000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010730000105">I
make this point again to the Government, in the hope that they might
listen. Any solution that depends solely on increasing individual
consumers’ engagement in the process of buying an annuity will
not succeed. The whole thrust of Government pensions policy since
Turner, which this Government have continued, is that inertia is a
reality that we must make work in the public interest, rather than in
the interests of pension company shareholders. That has been the thrust
of pensions policy for a decade now. Any solution to the annuities
market dysfunction must start from that assumption. In the spirit of
the Turner consensus and co-operation on auto-enrolment, I urge the
Government to take heed of that reality in the annuities

retirement can determine what income they receive for the rest of their
lives. Undoubtedly, it is one of the most important financial decisions
that a person can make. As we have heard, more than 400,000 people
purchase annuities each year, and studies show that there can be more

ABI code has brought about an important change in how annuity providers
communicate with their customers, a point raised by my hon. Friend the

process of choosing their annuity type and provider, ensuring that they

providers to provide better information to retirees in their wake-up
packs, and new and improved tools such as the Money Advice

In addition to the ongoing work to help consumers make better choices,
the FCA is currently conducting a thematic review of the annuities
market and how well it is working to serve consumers’ interests,
a pricing survey of all annuity providers and a comparison of the rates
available to consumers through a range of distribution channels. The
review will consider whether firms create barriers that can restrict
consumers from shopping around, and what risks and potential for
detriment those barriers may present for consumers. I look forward to

it is imperative that the annuity market works in the consumer’s
interests as an effective option for retirement income, it is important
to consider the retirement income market as a whole to ensure that
consumers have income flexibility in retirement. To increase
flexibility, the Government have removed both the default retirement
age and the effective requirement to purchase an annuity by age 75.
Whether they annuitise or not, individuals are permitted to take 25% of
their accumulated pension savings as a tax-free lump sum before going
on to secure an income with the remaining savings. To ensure that that
income can best serve retirees’ needs, the Government have
reformed the capped draw-down rules and raised the annual withdrawal
limit from 100% to 120% of the value of an equivalent annuity. That can
help to raise the retirement incomes of individuals in draw-down
arrangements who may recently have experienced reductions in income due
to wider economic
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000012">There
is additional flexibility for those with a guaranteed income of at
least £20,000 a year. With income already secured, they have the
option of a flexible draw-down arrangement, in which they can withdraw
any amount from their pension pot. Those coming to retirement will
benefit from having more flexibility in deciding how to 
<?notus-xml column=21?>provide an income for themselves in retirement, and for those with small
pension pots, the Government have taken steps to
reform the trivial commutation pensions tax rules. An individual who is
aged 60 or over with total pension savings of less than £18,000
can withdraw the entirety of their savings as a lump sum. The first 25%
of that lump sum is normally tax-free, with the remainder taxable as
income. In addition, small occupational pension pots under
£2,000, and up to two small personal pension pots under
£2,000, can be taken as a lump sum for those aged 60 or over,
even when people have savings in excess of the aggregate limit. All

a decent retirement income is driven by two factors: saving enough for
retirement through working life, and making good choices at retirement
to secure a reliable and maintainable income throughout retirement. It
is important to remember that the biggest determinant of how much
income someone receives in retirement is how much they have saved
during their working life. With the introduction of auto-enrolment, the
Government have taken a huge step forward towards ensuring that

Auto-enrolment is the most important pensions change for a
century—around 6 million to 9 million people will make new
savings and increase savings for their retirement. It is estimated that
that will generate around £11 billion in extra pension saving by

look closely at how well the market is working. Just so we can be
absolutely clear, if there is evidence that it is not working as well
as it should and that there are hidden commissions, unnecessary charges

the market works more effectively to ensure that consumers shop around;
identifying conduct risks that prevent them from doing so; and ensuring
that they have the right tools and information to make informed choices
and provide competitive pressure on the market. However, as I said

health funding in Telford and

objective of all of us, across the political divide and in the health
community, is to strengthen the links between the formal national
health service and local authorities and care providers in the
community. That is the general consensus and I think everybody agrees
with that as an overarching policy. However, I am concerned about the
amount of resource available to tackle issues to do with continuing
health care in the community in Telford and Wrekin, and about how that
health funding integrates with the work that the local authority is
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:00:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000031">It
is pretty much acknowledged, across the political divide, that Telford
and Wrekin council is a good unitary authority. It performs well and is
working hard to ensure that it protects local residents as we move
through a period of budget restraint and cuts to
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:01:08"></hs_TimeCode>. That
is difficult and tough for the local authority and it has a major
impact on our community. The way we integrate health services with the
ongoing provision of front-line social care services is
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:01:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000032">The
council is undertaking a consultation on its budget. Real pressure is
emanating from Telford and Wrekin clinical commissioning group’s
stance on funding continuing health care cases in the town. Some 50% of
the council’s revenue budget—the money it spends on
day-to-day services, such as caring for the elderly, looking after
children and taking care of the environment—comes from the
Government, and in the last three years it has been cut by almost
£29 million.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010735000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000033">By the end of
2015-16, the cut in the council’s funding from the Government
will have reached nearly £50 million. These are cuts
to cash grants that the Government provide to the council. Clearly, if
inflation is taken into account, the real-terms cuts are much greater.
At<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:02:18"></hs_TimeCode> the same
time, the council is facing major challenges from the growing cost of
caring for increasing numbers of vulnerable people in our community.
The CCG<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:02:33"></hs_TimeCode> has
added to the financial pressure by shunting around
£8.5 million of costs that it would previously have
covered in respect of CHC cases to the local authority. That is being
done by the CCG’s taking a much harder line in the assessment of
CHC cases. That is impacting seriously on the council and its
budget<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000034">Today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:03:22"></hs_TimeCode>
is about exploring what more we can do to integrate health funding with
the work that the local authority is doing in its social care
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:03:15"></hs_TimeCode>. To
set this out fairly starkly, in 2009-10 the primary care trust spent
some £13.9 million on CHC cases. In 2012-13, the equivalent body
in Telford and Wrekin spent just £2.3 million
directly on care packages for CHC. I acknowledge that the CCG has
topped that money up this year, with an additional £2.4 million,
but that is a one-off payment. There is concern that such an enormous
reduction in funding for CHC cases is putting enormous pressure on the
health service and on front-line integrated health and social care
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:04:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000035">The
other important issue to consider is how the funding formula has been
calculated in respect of  the number of people receiving
continuing health care 
<?notus-xml column=25?>funding in our community, in comparison with  surrounding
locations. As at 30 June last year, there were 19.4 people per 50,000
population in Telford and Wrekin receiving CHC funding; in Shropshire,
the figure was 82.2 per 50,000 population. Considerably fewer people,
proportionately, are receiving CHC funding in Telford and Wrekin, but I
cannot for the life of me determine why. Some have said that it is
because Shropshire has an older population and because its structure is
different, but it might be imagined that, given the provision of
community hospitals in other parts of Shropshire, the figure would be
different and that Telford and Wrekin would be doing far
better<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:05:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000036">If
Telford and Wrekin is compared with similar local
authorities—what might be called its Chartered Institute of
Public Finance and Accountancy neighbours—we see that we are
struggling to match the numbers of people per 50,000 weighted
population who are receiving continuing health care funding. For
example, in Warrington the figure is 54.6, in Darlington it is 65.1 and
in Stoke-on-Trent it is 48.4 of weighted population per eligible 50,000
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:06:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I
reiterate that the figure is 19.4 in Telford and Wrekin and I cannot
understand why, in that context, so few people are receiving continuing
health care
funding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:06:25"></hs_TimeCode>. This
places enormous pressure on the local authority. As people move out of
hospital or into care, whether at home or in other settings, the
council is having to step in and try to provide care and support that
ought to be provided, in my view, by the health
service<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:06:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000037">Although
I accept that the primary care trust, at one time, was generous in its
CHC funding compared to national averages—I mentioned the
historical figures—the position now seems to have reversed. As I
said, the ratio of CHC cases per 50,000 population in Shropshire is
almost four times higher than in Telford and Wrekin. The council has
calculated that, if the CCG spent at the national average, it would
need to spend in the region of £7.65 million. That is
significantly different from our current funding
profile<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:07:36"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
concerned that the formula is not working effectively for Telford and
Wrekin—either that, or the assessment procedure is not being
undertaken in the same way as in other areas of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:07:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000038">The
Prime Minister made it clear in the Conservative manifesto for the last
general election that health funding would be protected. I am concerned
that costs are being shunted away out of the health service and on to
local authorities. The real concern is that these hidden cuts within
the health service are being fed through into the local authority
sector, so that nobody notices. Well, I hope that after today people
will notice. This dilemma will be faced by a range of local authorities
that will increasingly have to pick up costs that would previously have
been met by the health
service<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T11:08:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010735000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010735000039">The

health service works—understandably, given his
background—and I am sure that he agrees with my opening remarks.
We want to see better integration between the health service and social
care, as provided by local authorities. That is what I am calling for
today. I should like him to look at the formula for Telford and Wrekin
overall, in terms of  the work being done by the CCG, and at

reinforced the silo working, and it is often patients who have fallen
through the gaps and paid the price. That is why the Government are
determined to fix the situation and ensure that, not just through the

that following the ACRA recommendations exactly would lead to higher

budgets for areas with less good health outcomes. Given that, like NHS
England, we are all concerned about reducing health inequalities, the
important decision was made to maintain the substantial weighting in
the formula for areas of deprivation and health care inequalities. The
ACRA formula was not directly followed, an issue on which we have
touched in previous Westminster Hall

endorsement of the ACRA recommendations would have led to mass
destabilisation of local health care economies. NHS England was mindful

£187.8 million—the per capita allocation is £1,058

cash increase of 2.14% on the funding that the CCG received this year.
The CCG will also receive a 1.7% increase on its allocation for
2015-16, which means that its funding will go up to almost £191
million. Additionally, NHS England has announced that the Shropshire
and Staffordshire area team will receive a 2.38% rise in primary care
funding in 2014-15 to almost £342 million and a further 1.8%
increase in 2015-16 to more than £348 million. Those increases
are higher than average, which reflects the historical underfunding in
those areas against the primary care funding formula adopted by NHS
England. I hope that is some reassurance to the hon. Gentleman that, in

has been highlighted, continuing health care funding is the crux of
this matter, and it is relevant to mention NHS continuing health care,

sometimes quite a blurred line between where NHS funding and care end
and where local authority responsibility starts. The issue is not whose
budget is involved or which budget the money comes from, and that is
part of the reason why the Government set up the £3.8 billion
integrated care fund. This is about joining up budgets. The hon.
Gentleman and I, the doctors and nurses on the ground, and the local
authority are interested in the person, rather than who pays for
treatment. The fund is a recognition of that, and we are setting it up

we have to look at where we are now and why we have come to the place
the hon. Gentleman highlighted. He will be aware that audits were

point, the PCT was putting a lot of additional money into continuing
health care, but a similar approach was not being taken elsewhere in

is also an issue about how the money given to CCGs is spent. In a
knee-jerk reaction, perhaps, to the auditors’ findings and the
fact that the spend was not allocated appropriately, Telford and Wrekin
went from being almost one of the highest spenders on continuing health

£2.4 million on top of that, over and above what the council

increased emphasis on integration and joined-up care. It is in no

Gisela Stuart</B> (Birmingham, Edgbaston) (Lab):</Member> This debate
is about sustainable local authority funding. It is my contention that
it is neither sustainable nor local, and it certainly does not confer
any authority. I will focus on our cities, not because I want to set up
an argument between urban and rural areas, but because what is bad for
our cities is bad for our urban areas. If our cities do not do well,
rural areas will suffer.</hs_Para>

complicated; they are predictable and have predictable outcomes. Cities
are complex; their outcomes cannot be predicted, and the players are
not always rational. Above all, cities are systems that can come up

that, we require three elements. The first is more control over the
money received from central Government and—this is an important
point—a time scale that allows for proper planning. At the
moment, cuts are being imposed so quickly that local authorities,
whether in cities or rural areas, have not had the time to reflect
properly on how best to reorganise. In some areas, we even find
confusion over which duties are statutory, because some statutory
functions have been farmed out—councils have found that when
they cancel the contracts, they are in breach of their statutory
duties. The second element is greater freedom over the money raised
locally, and the third is the means to benefit financially from
investments and savings
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010746000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000032">However,
I do not believe that that will be sufficient. Something far more
radical is required. Relying on council tax to raise revenue will help
only affluent areas. Capping via referendum and the utterly out-of-date
banding system mean that, for authorities that rely heavily on central
Government grants, relying on council tax to raise revenue just makes
the situation worse. We need a more radical idea. We could raise a
local tax or look at a system of apportionment of locally raised VAT to
replace the grant. At this stage, I am simply looking for the Minister
to acknowledge that if he continues on the current trajectory, some of
our cities will go to the wall. I do not say that to be dramatic; the
statement is borne out if we look at the
figures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010746000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000033">I
also have a number of specific questions. First, on the better care
fund, am I right to assume that, although NHS transfers across clinical
commissioning groups, which start in 2015-16, will not overtly
redistribute funds from rural to urban areas, they will end up doing so
in practice, given the age profile of rural areas? The better care fund
is not new money, but a kind of 
<?notus-xml column=36?>redistribution. In Birmingham, almost 46% of the population is under the
age of 30, compared with 36.8% in England as a whole. In contrast,
Birmingham’s over-65s represent 12.9% of the population,
compared with 16.9% in England as a whole. If we focus on the older
population, therefore, we will be disproportionately hit.</hs_Para>

second question is about education. Education funding was not part of
the local government finance settlement, because it comes mainly
through the ring-fenced dedicated schools grant. However, the current
formula is historic, and a consultation is going on. When can we expect
the result? Will it include a minimum funding guarantee that protects
against losses at a per-pupil level?
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:00:07"></hs_TimeCode>Next year will
be a crunch year for our cities and local authorities. Unless they have
some indication of how not just the known grants, but the ones that
underpin them, will play out, they will not be able to plan.</hs_Para>

takes me to my final observation. The Local Government Association
already says some councils are not viable. How many councils does the
Minister think are in that category? Does he agree with the work done
by the Mayor of London, which suggests we should hand tax-raising
powers to England’s largest cities? Will he give English cities
control of the revenues from all property taxes, such as stamp duty,
council tax, land tax and business rates? One thing is for sure: they
will manage those funds differently and, I would contend, better. Will
he also lift the cap on local government capital borrowing?

I invite the Minister to come to Birmingham, because 2014 marks the

introduced the concept of good governance into our cities. If we do sit
down and talk together about some of these structures, I hope we can
come up with a way of maintaining the strength of our cities, rather
than marking the 100th anniversary of Joe Chamberlain’s death by
killing our cities with 1,000 cuts.</hs_Para>

people in the room have probably sat on both sides of the political
fence that divides local government from central Government, so they
will be familiar with the scenario many of us have had visited on us:
we listen to a statement about the local government finance 
<?notus-xml column=37?>settlement and think, “That’s not so bad,” but when
we talk to our borough treasurer, we find that the world has more or
less fallen in. I am very familiar with that scenario because my first
experience of Whitehall involved coming down to Richmond house to see
the now Lord Boateng, who was a Minister at the time. I was castigated
on behalf of Sefton council because he felt we had quite enough money
to deal with our problems, while we felt the money he was giving us
fell significantly short of what he should have given us.</hs_Para>

scenario is fairly familiar, and it is part of a very dishonest
conversation that has taken place decade after decade between local
authorities and central Government. It is a dishonest conversation
about local resources, central resources and their effect on services.
All Governments say that the funding settlement is fair and generous in
the circumstances and that councils surely have sufficient funding to
get by. If Ministers need a further defence, they will point to
occasional—or perhaps less than occasional—instances of
local authority inefficiency or profligacy. They will then point to
some local authority—normally one from their own political
party—that does things particularly well and set it up as an
exemplar for all others to
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:04:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010746000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000042">Local
authorities, in turn, talk about savage reductions, service impairment
and the new and sometimes unnecessary burdens that have been imposed on
them, but not financed, by central Government. Characteristically, they
will accuse the Government of deceitful sleights of hand, favouritism
and formula rigging. I think Members will
acknowledge—particularly those who have sat on both sides of the
fence—that those involved put their side of the case in a very
one-sided way.</hs_Para>

past few years have been no exception. It helps local authorities that
are making their case to their local populations to blame the
Government for the totality of their woes, whether those result from
demographic factors or unaddressed issues from years gone by. Most
local authorities worth their salt big up the cuts, blame all the
financial pressures they face on central Government and try as far as
possible to ignore their own failings.</hs_Para>

central Government help themselves by confusing the grant regime,
changing the names of the grant from year to year—from revenue
support grant, to formula grant, to spending power or
whatever—and presenting their case in the best possible way. The
Minister and I have had many interesting discussions about whether to
describe a local authority’s situation in terms of a fall in its
spending power or a fall in its grant. I prefer the latter; he prefers

Smith</B> (Penistone and Stocksbridge) (Lab):</Member> The hon.
Gentleman talks about authorities bigging up the cuts, but, taking into
account all the adjustments he has just spoken of, Sheffield will, by
2015-16, have seen a 50% reduction in funding since 2010. That is not
bigging up the cuts; it is the absolute fact. Sheffield cannot go on

in one particular year.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:06:21"></hs_TimeCode>That is par for
the course. Equally, central Government will  
<?notus-xml column=38?>find obvious scapegoats and point to the things such as assets and

things are all part of the toolkit or the argument, and most people are
fairly familiar with them. The public tend not to pay a lot of
attention to the debate, and they almost split the difference in many
cases, because they are not certain who is telling the truth. They do
get exercised when council tax goes up and certainly when services they
are particularly enamoured of disappear, but, by and large, they are
fairly agnostic on this issue, and they do not always know who should
be
blamed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:07:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010746000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000048">However,
the game has now got deadly serious. What has been a familiar scenario
over many years is now having a more severe effect. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:07:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Edgbaston suggested, the sustainability of local
services and, in some cases, local councils appears to be at
stake—there is a fair case to be made in that respect. If we cut
through what I described as the usual dishonest conversation, there are
four absolutely indisputable facts.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010746000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000049"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:07:52"></hs_TimeCode>First,
in terms of deficit reduction, councils have been hit first—that
is not particularly helpful, because they have to work within annual
budgets and cannot make plans over two or three years—and they
have been hit hardest, as has already been said.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:08:11"></hs_TimeCode>The second fact
is that the reduction in central Government expenditure is
considerable, and it may end up being something like £20
billion.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010746000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000050">Thirdly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:08:10"></hs_TimeCode>,
it is also an indisputable fact that the funding reduction for local
authorities is proportionally greater in the poor areas and
particularly the metropolitan districts. I take that as an unarguable
fact, which we can all acknowledge around the room, although we may
want to explain it in different ways. That fact is well documented, and
it is what the Rowntree research, the Institute for Public Policy
research, the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission report
“Tough Times” all say. It is an indisputable
fact.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010746000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000051">Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:09:02"></hs_TimeCode>,
one element in it was the initial loss of area-based grants. We could
argue that that happened because the previous Government were looking
after the local authorities that were most of their persuasion.
However, the fall in the less affluent areas, if I can put it like
that, is in no way compensated for in its totality by city deals or
regional growth funds. Those are often talked of as a compensating
factor, but they must be looked at in terms of the general decline in
regeneration funding in those areas as a whole. Taking the totality of
the issues, I would be prepared to—although I will
not—argue that case at length. There is nothing to suggest that
things are otherwise; the proportionate reduction in poorer areas is
greater<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:09:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010746000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000052">It
would be inappropriate for the Minister to respond, as often happens in
parliamentary debates, by saying that none the less Birmingham gets so
much per head, as opposed to some other area that he wants to nominate.
I assume that we all buy into the assumption that grant support for
local authorities must be based in some way on need. Therefore we would
expect per capita spending in Liverpool, for example, to be greater
than per capita spending in Surrey, and so

side for a moment. If I am right in guessing that the hon. Gentleman is
saying that spending must be maintained at local government level, will

the local authority settlement. I am mainly making a fair case for

fourth point, which has not been stressed in the debate so far, is that
local authority spending is now significantly unbalanced. Because of
the nature of the cuts, local authorities have had to concentrate on
their statutory services, which primarily means social services. Most
ordinary punters and electors do not ordinarily interact with social
services. That is a democratic problem as well as a financial one. We
have all heard of the graph of doom and the view that some local
authorities will end up spending on nothing but social services. If
that happens, neither electors nor the authorities will welcome
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:11:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010746000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0001.htm#14010746000056">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:11:46"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston is right about the situation. She
did not say that it was not sustainable; she said that the trajectory
we are on is not sustainable, and I agree. Various things could be done
about it, and she suggested some. I shall not cover the same ground
that she did. We can spread good practice and develop community
budgets—the Select Committee did some work on that. We can talk
about possible savings from the integration of health and social care,
which would be good, or about possible benefits from the repatriation
of rates, and accompanying incentives.</hs_Para>

shockingly, Liverpool city council was once again hit hardest. The
latest cut of 5.5% will have a devastating impact on a city that is
working tirelessly to pull itself up by its own economic bootstraps.
Even the Prime Minister has recognised the work that Liverpool has done
to cut out waste and restructure its services.</hs_Para>

not reflective of imbalances in deprivation funding at all. Let us take
an example that is completely open and known to everyone, which is the
scandal of the private finance initiative, in which 106 new hospitals
were built at enormous cost. The vast preponderance of them were built
around a model of funding that was for very large outpatient hospitals
in major cities, and it was deliberately targeted on those cities. The
result has been, at a time when health care has been moving to a much
more localised, technology-enabled solution, a disaster for health

applaud the measures that the Government have taken over the past

that local government was glorious in the 19th century, and one reason
for that was how autonomous it was. It is very important that we

remarkable that the Government have been able to do that in the
extremely difficult financial conditions in which we find ourselves. It
is extraordinarily hard to change embedded funding decisions and
disparities that have been left over from times past. In my county of
Herefordshire—although we are talking about cities and the wider
impact, I hope that we can strike a rural note, as the hon. Lady
acknowledges the differences between them and the effects that each can
have on the other—levels of funding have always been extremely
low. The culture is one of making do and mending. To take one example,
it was a minor miracle when we moved from having the third worst-funded
schools in the country to the fourth worst-funded schools in the
country, in the past year or two. I hope that we will continue to motor
rapidly up the tables thereafter.</hs_Para>

all, the issue is not only about local government, but about the
totality of public services, because, as I think all Members would
recognise, the services interlink with each other and the cumulative
and interrelated effect of them makes all the difference. I am perhaps
somewhat unusual in that I commissioned an independent study of
underfunding in Herefordshire in 2010, which concluded, based on a
comparison with other authorities, that it had been underfunded to the
tune of £174 million over the previous five
years—the period from 2005 to 2010. That is £35 million a
year or roughly 10% of local government spending.</hs_Para>

totals broke down across the public services as: police, £11
million a year; fire, £4 million a year; schools, £30
million a year; and health, £44 million a year. Each of those
sums, in turn, was dwarfed by the underfunding of local government,
which was £85 million over that period, or £17 million a
year.</hs_Para>

important to put that in perspective. It is not only about underfunding
in some of the leafy suburbs to which people like to refer, because
there are areas of deprivation in Herefordshire. It is not a rich
place; it is a county in which the average earnings are significantly
below the averages for the west midlands and for England as a whole. It
is well known to those who have studied the issue that public services
are harder, not easier to deliver, and more expensive, not cheaper to
deliver, in

reserves—indeed, large amounts of reserves that they have stored
up over many years against a rainy day. That is not true in
Herefordshire. Herefordshire council is only 10 or 15 years old. It

final point has to do with reserves. Herefordshire does not have huge
reserves. It has virtually no reserves and an embedded underfunding

welcomed, because that is doing a difficult thing in unusually
difficult circumstances. I am grateful to the Minister and his

is the reality facing cities such as Newcastle?
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:33:08"></hs_TimeCode>In the debate
last year, I outlined how in 2012 Newcastle city council had started to
consult on a three-year budget for the period from 2013-14 to 2015-16
in the light of the unprecedented funding challenges it faced. When it
began the consultation process, it believed it was looking at a funding
shortfall of £90 million over three years as a result of
disproportionate central Government funding cuts and rising cost
pressures, such as inflation, energy prices and the costs of providing
services to an ever-ageing population. That figure rose during the
consultation process to £100 million, following further cuts
announced in the 2012 autumn statement and the local government finance
settlement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, following the 2013 spending round and provisional local
government finance settlement announced in December 2013, Newcastle
city council now believes it faces a funding gap of £108 million
over the same
period<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:34:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000007">I
have no doubt that the Minister will again seek to dismiss concerns
about the scale of the cuts faced by cities such as Newcastle by
reminding us, again, of the “spending power” that
Newcastle has at its disposal—it is groundhog day, after
all—but I suggest, as other hon. Members and I have suggested on
several occasions, including today, that that measure is absolutely
meaningless if it is used simplistically to compare total spending
power without taking into consideration the completely different
spending pressures facing cities such as Newcastle and those facing
other parts of the country with totally different needs and challenges
to support.</hs_Para>

Minister repeatedly fails to mention the scale and the speed of the
change in spending power that is proposed for the next two years.
Newcastle may have a higher total spending power than certain parts of
the country, but it faces a cut in that spending power of £232
per dwelling over the next two years. In sharp contrast, Wokingham,
which my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:35:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston also referred to—I
appreciate the concerns of the friend to whom she referred—and
which the Minister often likes to cite, will see its spending power
rise by £60 per dwelling, and Windsor and Maidenhead’s
will rise by £32 per dwelling. Therefore, although the spending
power of cities such as Newcastle is being significantly cut, the
spending power of some of the wealthiest and least deprived areas of
the country is not only being protected but increased under this
Government. The straight fact is that the additional spending power of
cities such as Newcastle has not originated from some unfair funding
decision of the past, but reflects very real differences in spending
pressures and, in particular, differences in the requirement for
statutory
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:36:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000009">Newcastle,
as an urban and relatively deprived city, faces significantly greater
spending pressures than the two councils that the Minister frequently
chooses to compare it with. However, as Newcastle city council officers
have pointed
out:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14010755000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000199">“The
reduction in spending power of areas with higher needs and lower
resources and the increase in spending power in the wealthiest areas is
a trend that will continue each year if the Government continues to
operate the grant system as is currently proposed. It will
not just close the funding difference between these areas but in time
will potentially reverse
it...<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>This
effect is happening because the
Government’s funding system now focusses on self-sufficiency and
providing incentives for areas where economies
grow as opposed to applying the core principles
of providing sufficient funding to reflect the different needs to
provide statutory services across the country and to compensate for
very different abilities to raise money locally from a standard council
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:39:34"></hs_TimeCode>. These were
the core principles introduced…in 1993/94 by the Conservative
Government at that time. The principles were aimed at ensuring that
residents anywhere in England could receive a standard level of service
to meet their needs with a similar council tax charge for similar bands
of
property<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:39:34"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:39:34"></hs_TimeCode>.
Now that this no longer holds true the provision of statutory services
can and will only be achieved by councils in poorer areas with higher
services demands by charging a higher Band D council tax than wealthier
areas of the country. As the
Government is effectively restricting increases in council tax this
will in effect mean that similar levels of service (including statutory
services) can no longer be provided in poorer areas of the country or
those areas with higher calls on statutory
services.”<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:39:34"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14010755000010" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000010"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:38:02"></hs_TimeCode>Crucially,

proportionate. The Minister may decide to use his response to the
debate to continue to bury his head in the sand on this critical issue.

loudly enough, we will all just go away, but it is not just Opposition

which is that the state in this country is highly centralised. That

which accounts for some 25% of the spend on public services, without a
sustainable economy for the public finances as a whole. I do not accept

the longer term, we need to tackle the real problem, namely that local
government has historically been too dependent on central
Government grant for its finance. The Government have taken important
steps to address that, but the degree of the problem is highlighted by
the London Finance Commission. I represent a suburban London seat,
which falls somewhere between the two poles when it comes to the
matters that are being discussed. The LFC report, which the Mayor of
London commissioned and endorsed, points out that some 7% of all the
tax paid by London residents and businesses is retained locally, as

we come from different constitutional and historical traditions, but we
can move in that direction. In that regard, the Minister and the

the retention of business rates, particularly if we follow it through
in due course and increase the local share, has a real opportunity to
reduce dependency on central Government grant. Currently, for
understandable reasons such as deficit reduction, the local share has
to be constrained. The primary legislation is drafted in such a way as
to permit the local share to increase as the economy grows. I hope that
happens, and I think hon. Members would do better in the longer term at
finding financial sustainability for local government if they were to

that we are dealing with the situation we are in, which is that local
government is dependent on grant from central Government. Waltham
Forest council, which covers most of my constituency, has already faced
extensive cuts and will probably face further cuts in grant from
central Government of some 8% over the next two years. That reaches the
stage, as Sir Merrick Cockell has said, where it is unsustainable and
cracks start to appear. My local authority has wrought miracles in

analysis is that simply shovelling more money into the system that
cannot be paid for in a sustainable way is not, I regret to say, the
answer. A much more radical approach is needed to the way in which we
deliver services, which good councils of all political persuasions are
willing to undertake. We should move away from the high levels of

is worth recognising, as the LGA recognises, that in the autumn

the same long-term indicative statements as central
Government, which will provide more certainty. That is an important and
valuable step forward, on which I congratulate the Minister. We might,

are things that can be done, but it is not enough simply to talk about
a system and to have a needs-versus-resources argument that does not
recognise efficiency. We can do more in the system to recognise
efficiencies and past efficiencies. Although the cities are a pressure
point, it struck me when I was a Minister that we should not forget
that there are financial pressures on rural authorities as well. One
thing that concerned me when I first came into office at the Department
for Communities and Local Government was that the then formula grant
system did not recognise the cost of rural services or the particular
pressures that give rise to rural deprivation. I congratulate the
Minister and the Government on taking important steps to recognise
that. There are positive, long-term things that we can do, and I hope

my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) on
securing the debate. Reference has been made to the Local Government
Authority’s position. It is a good idea to take notice of those
who, day to day, have to deal with the problems we are discussing and
make decisions in local government. Sir Merrick Cockell, the
Conservative leader of the LGA, which has a Conservative majority, has
said clearly that the position of local Government finance is not
sustainable. I happen to agree with him, and there is cross-party
agreement in the LGA. That comes about because, as my hon. Friend has
said, local government has been asked to make twice the level of cuts
demanded of central Government Departments. Local government services
are more important than that, and the extent to which local government
services have been singled out for disproportionate cuts is
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000027">We
can argue about which authorities have had the worst deal, and I
certainly argue that those with the greatest needs and traditionally
the highest level of grants have had the biggest cuts in their grant.
That is not questionable—the figures are there to back it up.
Local government generally has a good record on efficiency savings. It
has coped with the cuts so far quite well, but we have already seen
across the country cuts to community services such as libraries and
changes to eligibility criteria for adult social care that are
affecting communities and individuals in local authorities of all
political
persuasions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000028">We
cannot continue on that basis, because it is not sustainable. Cuts that
are made one year cannot be simply repeated and enhanced the following
year. Every year it becomes more difficult because there is less room
for manoeuvre and a lower percentage of discretionary spend that can be
cut. That is not a steady state, because more pressure is being put on
spending for adult social care all the time. The graph of doom that the
hon. 
<?notus-xml column=50?>Member for Southport (John Pugh) referred to is already there. As cuts
are made in spending availability and extra demands are made on adult
social care, the amount left for other local government services is
squeezed until it becomes non-existent. Adult social care and care for
looked-after children ultimately benefit a minority of people,
important though those services are, and the rest of the population do
not know what they get from local councils because virtually nothing is
left. That undermines local democracy, which is very
worrying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000029">The

right that we have to look towards the longer term. The Government have
done some good things, such as abolishing ring-fencing, moving a little
on business rates—I would like to see more—and
introducing city deals. The most significant thing they have done,
however, is to undermine the basis of local government finance in this

contribution to the debate from the LGA with the “Rewiring
public services” document. There was a good contribution from
the London Finance Commission. The Communities and Local Government

the meantime, what will the Minister do when a local authority gets
into real difficulties? The National Audit Office has been highly
critical that the Government have not done an impact assessment on the
cumulative impact of cuts to local councils. The LGA has said that 56
councils will spend 15% above their income by 2015-16. What happens if
one of those councils gets into serious financial difficulties? Would
the Government insist on a council having a referendum if it needed to
raise council tax by 20% to make ends meet and to deliver its statutory
service? Will the public vote for an increase in a referendum if they
know that the Government have section 31 powers—civil servants
and Ministers revealed them to the Committee—to step in at any
point and give councils extra grant to stop them from going bust? Where
do we stand when an authority gets into serious difficulty, whether
that authority is Conservative, Labour or Lib Dem, rural or urban, a

local government is its contribution in cities such as Sheffield and
Birmingham to our housing, our schools, our leisure facilities and our
libraries. The green legacy, particularly in Sheffield, bears a heavy
debt to the 
<?notus-xml column=51?>history of local government in the area. She succinctly outlined the
declining powers of local government over many decades, which was

case for cities as economic motors was powerfully made by my hon.
Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston. I want to compare
Sheffield with Pittsburgh in the USA—she made comparisons with
Europe, but comparisons can occasionally be made with the USA.
Pittsburgh is Sheffield’s sister city and suffered the same
decline in its industrial base, but it is now motoring ahead. Why? It
is because Pittsburgh had the powers available to rebuild itself. It
has focused on life sciences and hydraulic fracturing—fracking
to most of us—and has rebuilt its economic base very
successfully. It has managed to tap in to resources made available by
the federal Government, but beyond that it has tapped into local
resources and rebuilt itself. It stands as a shining example of what
can be done when a city is given control of its destiny. It is not just
Europe we can look to for comparisons of what can be done; sometimes,
the US can teach us
lessons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000036">By
comparison, Sheffield will, over the lifetime of this Parliament,
suffer a 50% reduction in its grant. Barnsley, the other borough I
represent, will suffer a 41% cut over the same period. The contrast
between what is happening in some of the great cities of the world and
what is happening in the UK could not be greater. People living in
Sheffield and south Yorkshire more generally feel emotional and
strongly about the loss of their industrial base. Something has to be
done to rebuild the economy of south Yorkshire. Even the boroughs of
Barnsley, Rotherham and Doncaster would acknowledge that Sheffield has
to be at the heart of that
regeneration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000037">The
myth about the rural and the urban needs to be scotched. Some 70% of
south Yorkshire is rural, but it is within a metropolitan area. It has
suffered declines greater than Herefordshire, Worcestershire and other
areas in the country. I do not want to pitch south Yorkshire against
other parts of the country, but south Yorkshire and areas like it
helped to build the UK’s industrial base, and they have the
capacity to do that again. The role of local government in that is
critical. Local government as we know it is broken for ever. The model
has gone. Devolution has to be at the heart of the solution for
countries and regions such as ours. For Birmingham, for south
Yorkshire, for Greater Manchester, for Newcastle and for the
north-east, we have to have devolution and a different model for
delivering local government in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14010755000210" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000210">3.54

trusts and the improvement commissions; or the local Acts of
Parliament, such as in Newcastle, to ensure that houses had privies
attached to them, or those in the west midlands, where councils came
together to promote an end to animal cruelty, or those of many local
authorities who sought public health measures to tackle diseases such
as cholera and tuberculosis. There was also the invention and
confidence of municipalism in Birmingham, symbolised by Joseph
Chamberlain—he was mentioned by my hon. Friend—who
municipalised the gas works and the water supply. London blazed the
trail for the national health service. Some 40,000 of the 55,000

that and—to listen to the Chancellor yesterday—in the
five years that follow, if the Conservatives are in power, there will
be substantial further cuts to local authorities. The Chancellor has
said that 10% will be cut in the next two years, but I ask the Minister
to take this opportunity to correct the record. The Local Government
Association, a cross-party organisation, is clear that without
including NHS support for social care, which is not available for all
councils, the reduction over the next two years will be
15.9%.</hs_Para>

we do this better and quicker and faster?” They should start

local fraud that is still there; they could reduce the

18 December, the administrators of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation
Trust published their final report. It recommended the dissolution of
the trust as soon as possible and the absorption of Stafford and
Cannock hospitals into the University Hospital of North Staffordshire
NHS Trust and the Royal Wolverhampton Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust
respectively. It also set out proposals for the services that would
continue to be offered at both Stafford and Cannock. The total cost
over three years would be £220 million, of which
£63 million is revenue and £157 million
capital<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:15:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000082">Let
me first address the proposal to dissolve MSFT. I believe that is the
right thing to do. It will enable both Stafford and Cannock hospitals
to work much more closely with larger specialist teaching hospital
trusts. They will both then be able more easily to recruit clinical
staff who see greater opportunities for skills development within a
larger organisation working across two or more sites and overhead
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:16:05"></hs_TimeCode> will also
be
reduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000083">However,
the administrators’ proposals do not go far enough in ensuring
that the interests of those who currently use MSFT are fully taken into
account. Monitor and the Secretary of State clearly need to state that
the expanded trusts should immediately recruit suitable non-executive
directors from the areas served by MSFT, such as Stafford, Cannock,
Penkridge, Rugeley, Stone, Brewood and so on, to ensure that those
areas are properly

too great for that particular

Walley</B> (Stoke-on-Trent North) (Lab):</Member> I am most grateful to
the hon. Gentleman for giving way and I congratulate him on securing
the debate. May I point something out for the record, so that when the
Minister comes to reply he can, hopefully, give cast-iron assurances
about the financial input that will be needed for this reconfiguration
to take place, addressing the issue that 
<?notus-xml column=60?>UHNS has identified—that the additional expenditure needed for
service configuration is in the order of £28 million
or £29 million, whereas the trust special administrator has said
that only £13 million would be needed? Also, the trust special
administrator has proposed a cost improvement programme of 8.5%,
whereas Monitor has said that anything above 4.5% is dangerous. We need
a very clear, detailed calculation and input from the Government as to
how these extra costs will be met, also taking on board the issue about
PFI.</hs_Para>

administrators rightly place emphasis on the need for swift action, and
I believe that the dissolution of MSFT in the autumn of this year
should be possible—indeed, it should be possible even earlier.
In fact, I would go further. MSFT has improved greatly in recent years
following the huge failings brought to light through the vital work of
Cure the NHS and documented in the Francis report. Its recently
published hospital standardised mortality ratio figures were the best
in the west midlands, but it is fragile and finds it difficult to
recruit in some areas. We need the overall arrangements to take
immediate effect, even in shadow form.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:17:23"></hs_TimeCode> recent weeks

securing this debate and on the work that he has done in recent years.
He used the words “fragility” and
“uncertainty”. He understands the fragility and
uncertainty of the health care economy in Staffordshire. Queen’s
hospital, in my constituency, is a Keogh hospital, which has huge
financial debts and is struggling to survive. Does my hon. Friend agree
that it is essential that this reorganisation takes place and is
properly funded? If not, the knock-on effect on other hospitals, such

and have a domino effect, with other hospitals falling

patient safety and care since the publication of the Francis report.
The new expanded trusts have the opportunity to become national leaders
in zero-harm health care, so I urge Monitor and the Secretary of State
to seize the opportunity to support them in doing so at this time. Let
this administration not be a dry legal exercise. Let it be the chance

how this will be possible without a rota for specialists in critical
care. The critical care department at Stafford made its own submission
to the consultation, which suggested a reduction in beds and a
networked specialist rota. That seemed eminently sensible. Given that
the CCU at Stafford is a net contributor and supports several other
activities, I urge Monitor and the Secretary of State to determine that
this model is tried for a period, during which it will, hopefully, be
proven to operate well, clinically, operationally and
financially.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000109">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:27:23"></hs_TimeCode>
TSA’s final report also proposes, as my hon. Friend the Member
for South Staffordshire (Gavin Williamson) mentioned,
removing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:27:32"></hs_TimeCode> the
consultant-led obstetrics and maternity service and replacing it with a
midwife-led unit dealing with approximately 350 to 
<?notus-xml column=63?>400 births a year. That is a step forward from the draft
report, which proposed no childbirth at all at Stafford. However, my
constituents and I do not believe that it is
sufficient.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000110">Currently<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:27:49"></hs_TimeCode>,
Stafford sees more than 2,000 births a year and that is likely to rise,
with extensive house building, various new business parks being built
and the doubling of the size of MOD Stafford, to mention but some
developments, resulting, in the coming years—even with a
MLU—probably in some 2,000-plus babies being born in other
maternity units, mainly at Stoke and Wolverhampton. UHNS in Stoke
already sees some 6,000 a year and its population is also growing. With
at least 1,000 births, and probably more from Stafford, UHNS will
probably approach 8,000, which is the number currently born at the
largest unit in the country, in
Liverpool.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000111">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:28:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:28:17"></hs_TimeCode>
NHS rightly promotes choice for women about where to have their babies
and the Prime Minister has spoken out against the trend towards ever
larger units. Yet that is precisely what is being proposed here for
women who are unable to use a MLU, due to the possibility of
complications in childbirth.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:28:48"></hs_TimeCode> would also
be an impact on those who currently use UHNS and the Royal
Wolverhampton, as their local units will become even
busier—probably including Walsall as well—taking in women
from a much wider
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000112">My
proposal, and that of clinicians at Stafford, is to continue with the
current service, fully networked with UHNS, while the impact of the
current rise in both the population and birth rate is assessed. That
would also enable the special care baby unit at Stafford to continue to
support the regional intensive care network for babies, as it currently
does. An added benefit would be that women will continue to have a
local obstetric and gynaecology service, which I am sure the Minister
will appreciate as he comes from that specialty. Again, that would
relieve pressure on the larger University Hospital of North
Staffordshire and the Royal Wolverhampton
hospital<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:29:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000113">Thirdly,
the TSAs propose to reduce the paediatric assessment unit to 14 hours a
day from 24 hours a day and to do away with in-patient paediatric beds.
There will be no paediatric rota, although A and E doctors will receive
extra paediatric training and paediatric out-patient services will
continue. The principal reason given by the TSAs is the national
standards of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, which
state that such services should be provided by a full consultant rota,
which is usually between eight and 10 consultants, whereas
at Stafford it is between five and
six<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:30:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

clear about the consequences: if the proposal is allowed to happen, the
clear logic is that dozens of other paediatric units across the country
that have similar numbers of consultants, or indeed fewer consultants,
must be closed or have their activities drastically curtailed. Monitor
cannot use the argument that that must happen at Stafford but not at
other foundation or NHS trusts for which Monitor or the NHS Trust

understand why very sick

on making that argument, however, let it be open, let it be consistent
across the land and let it be agreed by all political parties. The

final point is that the children and families who will be most affected
by the paediatrics proposal are those on the lowest incomes. Such
families are the least likely to have access to private transport to
take their children nearly 20 miles to the nearest hospital at night.
For them public transport in the daytime is often poor, and a taxi fare
is beyond their means—certainly if they have to visit a sick
child several times. I believe that those on low incomes should have
fair access to health care, which both Monitor and the Secretary of
State have a responsibility to

surely it makes sense to work through the proposed clinical networks

the clinicians and I think they can be, we will have achieved the
objective of securing services that are financially, clinically and
operationally sustainable in Stafford, and indeed elsewhere, under the
expanded UHNS. Such services would be welcomed by my constituents and
would reduce the potential pressure on other hospitals, such as UHNS,

responding to some of the points that have been raised today, it is
important to talk a little about the trust’s background to
provide some context. The trust has been operating at a deficit for
some time, and certainly since 2009. In April 2013, the trust reported
a deficit of £14.7 million. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:37:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford alluded to, that position is expected to get
considerably worse. As a proportion of the trust’s turnover, the
deficit forecast for 2014 is higher than that of almost any other trust
in the country. For the past two financial years, the trust received
approximately £20 million a year in support from the
Department of Health. Without that funding to supplement its income,
Mid Staffs would have been unable to pay its
staff<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:37:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000129">The
contingency planning team sent into Mid Staffs in late 2012 concluded
that the trust was delivering services at a cost substantially higher
than most other trusts in the country. A key challenge faced by the
trust is the recruitment and retention of staff and the high cost of
temporary staff<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:38:07"></hs_TimeCode>,
which is no wonder, given that it must have been a very demoralising
time for those working in the trust when there have been ongoing
investigations into events that took place in the past. 
<?notus-xml column=66?>Additionally, some of the trust’s services are operating with
consultant numbers significantly below Royal College guidelines. The
2012 contingency planning team reported that, despite improvements in
clinical services, the trust is unlikely to be able to achieve the

the reasons why the special administration process has been set up, it
is important to take the initial report into account and to recognise
that we are where we are today because of that report. In cases such as
this, where a trust is facing substantial financial challenges, it is
crucial that action is taken quickly to secure services for patients
and ensure that high-quality patient care can still be delivered. The
special administration process for foundation trusts offers a
time-limited and transparent framework for resolving the problems of a
significantly challenged trust. Like the regime for NHS trusts, the
special administration process is intended to be used only in the most
serious
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000131">As
my hon. Friend the Member for Stafford is aware, Monitor made the
decision to place Mid Staffs into special administration on the basis
of the 2012 work. The CPT’s first report concluded that Mid
Staffs is not financially or clinically sustainable in its current form
and recommended the appointment of administrators as the best option
for identifying the changes required in the years going forward to
continue to secure high-quality patient care. Acknowledging the serious
financial challenges facing the trust, the Secretary of State wrote to
Monitor giving his support for the appointment of the trust special
administrators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000132">It
is worth touching briefly on the work of the trust special
administrators at Mid Staffs. The TSAs have been in place since April

with the trust’s staff, commissioners, providers and other local
stakeholders to develop a plan for services. The work undertaken by the
TSAs builds on the earlier conclusions of the CPT and only strengthens
the case for urgent change. If no action is taken, the TSAs estimate

working days to consider them against a set of requirements defined in

health care economy and on services for other local patients. I am
confident, however, given the interest from Members and the support
provided to the trust from other health care trusts and
hospitals in the area, that we will come to the right conclusion. We
all want to see a strong and viable health care service for patients in
Stafford and the surrounding areas, and I am confident that that is
what we will have delivered once the Secretary of State has considered

Government figures regarding Coventry’s spending power do not
make sense as they ignore inflation and include funding from council
tax and new burdens placed on the council. The council tax base is

Jim</B><B> Cunningham:</B></Member> I totally agree with my right hon.
Friend. I come back to something that Nicholas Ridley said many years
ago—about 25 years ago. He foresaw a time when local councillors
would meet once a year and give contracts out to the private sector. If
we look at the strategy of this Government and of previous Conservative
Governments, we see that they have slowly but surely taken powers away
from local authorities. They do so in a number of ways, in particular
by slowly but surely cutting budgets and forcing services out to the
private sector, and yet the private sector does not always know
best.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000153">Also<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:51:39"></hs_TimeCode>,
we have a big issue regarding pensioners, in particular caring for
them, that started under the previous Conservative Government and the
matter has never been resolved, as far as I can remember. We are still
debating changes that should have happened 25 years ago. Instead, 25
years ago local authorities were forced to hand over—or sell, if
people want to put it that way—old people’s homes to the
private sector. Five or seven years down the road, however, after the
private sector had made a profit, the homes closed down. That, too,
created a shortage of beds, but more importantly it forced the prices
up for care for elderly
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000154">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:54:57"></hs_TimeCode>
whole strategy can be seen. I have always said that this Government
think in generations: what the previous Conservative Government leave
off, the next Conservative Government pick up. At the end of the day,
in local government we will have only one or two little services, while
the rest is in the private sector. Mr Ridley’s
prophecy is becoming
true<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:52:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000155">I
move on to the impact. Support for Age UK and other local charities
will reduce by 22%; there are significant reductions to housing-related
support; the housing-with-care scheme in Coventry at Jack Ball house
and George Rowley house has ceased; a range of day centres and the
in-house, short-term home support service have closed; and charities
will no longer get the business rate support that they once had, even

Minister’s big society.</hs_Para>

2014-15 we face a 10.6% cut, and in 2015-16 a 15.2% cut. I am well
aware that that is not the entire income of the company, if we want to
regard the local authority as a company. Nevertheless, that is a
substantial and continuing sustained cut to its core budget, from which
it has to deliver the key services.</hs_Para>

the cuts from 2010 through to 2016 in Coventry, I think, come out as
something in the order of a 65% cut in the core budget—making
allowance for inflation and all the other things that the Government do
not necessarily allow for in their figures. I do not invite the
Minister to bandy her figures against ours—we all know that
local government finance is an extremely complicated and tiresome
matter, which can be twisted in any way and used to prove almost any
argument—because that would not be helpful.</hs_Para>

maintain its school buildings? The worst thing a school can do is
neglect its buildings. I remember that when we took office in 1997,
schools had buckets underneath the holes in their roofs where the rain
was coming in. Difficult though it was, the first thing we did was to
release £1 billion from the tax on utilities’ excess
profits to deal with that situation. It costs a lot more in the long
run to deal with such situations in that way. What I read out must be a
mistake; I am sure that the Minister will be able to reassure us on

specific point put to us by the Coventry local authority, to which my
hon. Friend the Member for Coventry South also referred, is that the
local welfare provision grant will end from 2015-16. That is worth
£1.4 million to Coventry. That is not a lot of money, but it is
a line in the budget until 2015-16. There has been a line in our budget

what we are seeing in our surgeries. People turn up destitute: they

with two young children and asked, “What am I going to
do?” I said that we had to release some funds from what I think

line in a budget disappears, we can bet our bottom dollar that the
money for that line in the budget has disappeared as well. We had a
temporary holding reply from the Government—I do not think that
is good enough—on this matter, which says that the money is
still there, but is simply in the whole total rather than being
identified separately. Nobody is going to buy that—if a line has
disappeared, the money has disappeared. We are facing a 16% cut in the
year. It is simply not possible to believe that that money is still
there. The money comes from core funding, and has gone down by 16%, yet
we are being asked to believe that the money is still there. It is
not.</hs_Para>

two fundamental errors in the settlement that we are discussing this
afternoon, and we need a reply on each. There are many other problems
in Coventry, of course, that are very sad. The hon. Member for Rugby
(Mark Pawsey) spoke of the small amount of help on business rates:
every help is welcome, especially from this Government, and so we
welcome the measure. But then one thinks of what could be done for
small businesses. We could get rid of national insurance for new small
businesses, or get rid of NI for businesses taking on new employees.
There are so many imaginative measures that could grasp the attention
of small businesses—particularly in the west midlands, where we
have not done so well and could do so much more. But none of that was
in the local government settlement in the autumn, and we did not
imagine that it would be.</hs_Para>

should say that the subject for this afternoon’s debate was the
effect on Coventry of the autumn statement. The points that have been
raised are partial and do not fairly reflect the impact on the city of
Coventry and the surrounding areas of Warwickshire of the
Chancellor’s autumn statement. Hon. Members have focused on
local authority funding as the main reason for the debate, but the
whole point was that local government funding was excluded from the
autumn statement and 
<?notus-xml column=73?>2013 Budget reductions to help local authorities to freeze their council
tax for 2014-15 and 2015-16. In fact, it is central Government

hon. Member for Coventry South started by talking about a cost of
living crisis. The best way to deal with the fall in living standards
is to deal with the economic crisis left to us by the previous

possibly ignore the fact that the economy at the end of last year was
7% smaller than in 2008. That will have an impact on every household
budget and every business in this country. My right hon. Friend the

There was certainly an issue with the banks that had to be bailed out.
I was not in the House when that happened; his colleague, the former
Chancellor of the Exchequer, the right hon. Member for Edinburgh South
West (Mr Darling), made the decision to do so—rightly, in my
opinion—but the point is this: from the early 2000s, the then
Chancellor, the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr
Brown), was running a deficit budget, which means that a huge gap now
needs to be plugged. The previous Government consistently spent more
than they raised, which means that the achievement of this Government
in cutting the deficit by a third—indeed, the Office for Budget
Responsibility is forecasting that the deficit will be halved by next
year—is an enormous one and should be welcomed by all people in

more within its remit than within the Treasury’s. He is right:
today’s debate is about Coventry. When I was handed the brief I
was amazed and impressed—although I should not be, as I am an
east midlands Member of Parliament and Coventry is in the west
midlands—at the amount of investment that both the Government

city deal that was announced recently, but I am also impressed by the

yesterday, I was reading an article in the <I>Coventry Telegraph</I>

global headquarters in Coventry, bringing jobs with it. That should be
welcomed and I am sorry that the hon. Member for Coventry South chose
not to make a single mention of job creation or of companies choosing
to locate in the midlands, a part of the country that I would agree is
a fantastic place for companies to
locate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010755000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/halltext/140107h0002.htm#14010755000181">I
will leave aside statistics on the autumn statement, and will talk
about ensuring fairness. The hon. Gentleman failed to mention the rise
in the personal allowance that came into force last April, and the
further rise that will come into force this year: from this April
people will be able to earn up to £10,000 without paying any
income tax. If he thinks that that is not making a difference to the
pockets of hard-working families in Coventry, he is very much mistaken.

understand the strength of feeling about this issue, particularly
amongst the constituents of Sutton and Cheam. It is clear that St
Raphael’s Hospice plays an important role within the community,
providing a dignified and caring environment for those with serious
illnesses. The British Government are committed to giving hospices the
support they need to carry out these vital duties and awarded an extra
£60 million in Government funding to hospices across England
earlier this year. We believe this investment is crucial as we face the
challenge of caring for an ageing population and supporting their
families. Hospices such as St Raphael’s play an increasingly
important role in delivering this care and

British Ambassador to the Holy See met Archbishop Jose Rodriguez

Consecrated Life and raised the concerns of the local community about
the future of St Raphael’s Hospice. The Archbishop confirmed he
was aware of the issue and assured the Ambassador that he would look
carefully at the case. He did make clear that the decision on the
future of St Raphael’s was ultimately one for the
Trustees but advised that he would give guidance to the Trustees on the
basis of the known preference of the Church that such good works should
continue to be run on Catholic
lines.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14010745000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/petntext/140107p0001.htm#14010745000022">The

Green:</Member></B> Police forces in England and Wales are required to
collect data on the use of section 60 stop and search powers, which
includes a breakdown by self-defined ethnicity. The monthly use of the
section 60 power is not, however, available as police forces are
required to collect only annual aggregate data. The latest figures for
England and Wales, covering the years from 2009-10 to 2011-12, are in

lie with the manufacturer or the importer placing them on the European
market. Local authority Trading Standards services in Great Britain and
district councils in Northern Ireland are responsible for enforcement.
They have powers to order a recall, but rarely use them. The majority
of recalls are undertaken by industry on a voluntary basis to address
their obligations. Recall actions are expensive and often complex;
manufacturers work with the enforcement authority to tailor the action
to the product and the specific
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010762000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140107/text/140107w0001.htm#14010762000121">The

ambitious and broad agreement under the Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership (TTIP) and to begin negotiations with all issues
on the table. The research that we commissioned highlighted certain
risks associated with including investor-state dispute settlement
(ISDS) in the TTIP. Negotiations are at an early stage and the UK is
pushing for an appropriate balance between protecting UK investors and
ensuring that the UK Government is not prevented from acting in the
public interest. It is too early to be definitive about whatever other
areas will prove to be challenging, but they may include public
procurement and agriculture.</hs_Para>

Korea's human rights record, which we assess to be one of the worst in
the world. The 2013 HRC resolution recommended that the UN establish a
Commission of Inquiry to investigate the most severe and systematic
human rights abuses in North Korea. The Inquiry was agreed without a
vote and will report to the 2014 HRC. In October 2013, the British
Government sponsored a visit by members of the Inquiry panel to the UK

impact of the Syria crisis on children. As part of our £500
million humanitarian response, the Government is funding a new
£30 million ‘Lost Generation Initiative’ to
provide protection, psychosocial support and education for children
affected by the crisis. The UK has led international diplomatic efforts
to protect children, including by securing a UN Security Council
Presidential Statement on 2 October that condemned violations committed
against children, attacks on schools, and the use of children as human
shields. The UK is working with international partners to ensure the
robust measures listed within the statement are fully implemented.
Ultimately, the most effective way of protecting Syrian children is to
end the conflict through a political settlement, and we are working
with partners, the UN and the Syrian Opposition to maximise the chances
of success at the upcoming Geneva II peace conference.</hs_Para>

need to grow at almost 2% per year more than the UK for the next 50
years to get back to the IFS's projection for the UK's debt position.
Over the last 50 years Scotland and the rest of the UK have grown, on
average, at an almost identical 2% per year. So it would be necessary
to double this rate. This would be at the same time an independent
Scotland's economy would be facing greater pressure from the decline in
North Sea production and an ageing population. No European country has

UK basis to provide high levels of protection and security for all
parts of the UK and its citizens at home and abroad. Decisions on
spending are based on meeting Defence requirements and ensuring value

apportioned on a regional basis. As part of the UK, Scotland benefits
from the full range of UK Defence capabilities and activities funded by
the Defence budget. The UK Government is confident that the Scottish
people will vote to remain part of the United Kingdom and is not

million people are in immediate need of humanitarian assistance. The

people in the Philippines, including women and girls at risk of sexual
exploitation and abuse. Risks to women and girls are addressed at all
levels of our response, and DFID's work with partners ensures that
those providing services such as food, water and shelter do so in a way
that safeguards women and children. During the recent High Level Event
on Protecting Women and Girls in Emergencies, which was held just as
the international response to Typhoon Haiyan was getting under way, the
