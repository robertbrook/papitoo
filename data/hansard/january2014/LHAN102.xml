Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, no one doubts the success of
the metal theft task force. The Government have provided funding from
January 2012 to 31 March 2014. With a new licensing regime in place
since October, we will take a view nearer the time as to how to take
forward our efforts to tackle metal theft in the

Faulkner of Worcester (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister is
right to say that the metal theft task force has been successful. The
British Transport Police, in particular, deserves a lot of credit for
the work that it has done. This has resulted in a 44% reduction in
metal theft-related crime in 2012-13 and, according to ACPO, has saved
the national infrastructure £339 million, an
incredibly good rate of return on the £5.5 million that the task
force has cost so far. Does the Minister agree that, with the
introduction of cashless transactions, which your Lordships added to
the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Bill, and the
passage of the Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013, we are at last turning the
tide against this awful crime? Would it not be extraordinarily short
sighted to cut off the funding of the metal theft task force at the end
of March and should we not be building on that success and not
jeopardising
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="14012368000685" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000685">Lord
Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> As I said, there is no doubt that the
task force has been very successful and, together with the legislative
change which this House assisted in bringing in, has made a great
difference in the battle against metal theft. A judgment needs to be
taken and the Government will consider this. The noble Lord might be
interested to know that we received a letter on Tuesday from Paul
Crowther, who is the ACPO leader on this
matter.</hs_para>

Greaves (LD):</Member></B> My Lord, I associate myself very much with
the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of Worcester, but the
Scrap Metal Dealers Act to which he referred contained one major
defect. Local authorities which license scrap metal dealing are not
able to do it through their non-executive licensing functions but have
to do it through their executive or cabinet, which is causing
difficulties and problems. When will this be
remedied?</hs_para>

task force has been of inestimable value in checking the epidemic of
lead theft from churches. Stripping of lead from church roofs has
caused extensive rain damage to historic interiors. Will the Minister
consult English Heritage, the Churches Conservation Trust and the
cathedrals and church buildings division of the Archbishops’

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I am very pleased to say that one of
the effects of the task force and the legislation has been to add
greater protection to our historic buildings. I have, myself, been on
the roof of Northampton town hall—I did not jump; I climbed
down—to see how encoding of the lead on the roof protects that
metal. I think the right reverend Prelate will admit that
ecclesiastical insurers are now looking at the premiums they have to
charge as theft from churches has been greatly reduced. I am pleased to
say that a gang of thieves in my own diocese of Lincoln was sentenced
very heavily for the damage it had
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Whitaker" PimsId="4578" UID="14012368000690" xid="1494" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000690">Baroness

peak at 80% of GDP in 2015-16 and will then begin to fall. Whether the

60%—walked free without even a custodial sentence and sometimes
without even a tag, while nearly 40% of those convicted actually served

sexual offences provided by the Sentencing Council, an independent

some offenders getting different sentences to others. Similarly, having

approach if we want to extend supervision to short-sentenced offenders.

of the difficulties that the Government have identified is that those

Care Information Centre cannot release data that could be used to
identify an individual without a legal basis to do so. As a result,
there are strict controls about how such information is released. As
regards the UK Biobank, the noble Lord is right to be concerned because
the proposed text from the so-called LIBE committee would rule out the
work of the UK Biobank, in that it would need explicit and time-limited
consent for any research project that it undertook, instead of being
able to support a range of research purposes, as it now can, using its
existing consenting mechanism. So there is cause for concern if this

ask the Minister why our embassy in Washington has part sponsored a

also need hard work on improving the UK’s grasp of foreign
languages, instead of lazily relying on English as the world’s
lingua franca. This is of the essence. The British Chambers of Commerce
has remarked that knowledge gaps and language skills hold back British
exporters. A rebalancing of the economy requires expansion of language
acquisition in our schools, colleges and businesses. However, we should
also mobilise the many pools of language expertise found among our
British citizens, especially among communities of recent immigrants.
How refreshing it would be if the Government coupled its insistence on
immigrants speaking English with a pledge to arm each current UK
citizen with the gift of fluency in one other language.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:39:28"></hs_TimeCode> our

exam question that the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, has set, the answer

pleasure of working with parliamentarians, including the noble
Baroness, Lady Symons, who is unique in her tireless work in the Middle
East, and with trade envoys who are appointed from all sides of the
House. They give<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:49:58"></hs_TimeCode>
of their free time to support the trade initiative. I pay tribute to
the noble Lord, Lord Green of Hurstpierpoint, who was an unpaid
Minister. It has been a pleasure to work with them all, trying to sort

rightly put trade at the centre of our economic recovery and, as the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, said, it is important, and incumbent on us
all, to put our shoulders to the wheel to make sure that that happens.
But it has been a significant challenge because businesses and
Government had been focusing their activities almost entirely on Europe
and the internal market. We had been a prosperous 
<?notus-xml column=750?>country for the past 15 to 20 years and orders were easy to secure both
within our own market and overseas. Moreover, the Government themselves
had failed to focus on the emerging markets of the world, instead
maintaining strong relationships with those countries that had been our
friends for ever. I think that the Government had become complacent
about their relationships. Not only has there been a huge overhaul of
UKTI and its focus, which was needed, but also an effort to tackle the
horrendous fact, in my view, that 60% of small and medium-sized
enterprises export only if someone comes and knocks on their door, and
60% of SMEs do not export at all. For a trading nation, those are
extraordinary statistics. Repositioning, regalvanising and leading the
way have all been very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:57:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

“The Government should be doing this and should be doing
that”, but from my experience since I started my first business
in 1982, which went on to become a global international insurance
broker, the last people we wanted working with us were Government. They
were slow and pedestrian, they taxed us, and they took too
long to make decisions. As business people we want to be able to trade
on our own. What we do want, when we get into sticky situations, is for
the Government to intervene at a senior level and to ease the path for
us. There are two or three things that the Government need to do in
terms of providing access to markets. We should not expect Government
to be the commercial, deal-doing arm of business, but we should expect
them to have access at senior levels and to understand the routes to
market: knowing who are the reliable partners in market that British
businesses can deal with and understanding the rules and regulations
within country so that businesses know about and recognise
the problems they may face when going to
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T11:58:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

found as a trade envoy and chairman of the business ambassadors was
that we could take the horses or businesses to water, but we could not
make those horses or businesses drink. We would offer endless
opportunities, but getting them to the table was difficult. That is
changing, but it is an area where progress still needs to be made. To
illustrate the degree of change, when I first went to Angola—I
was almost the first government Minister ever to visit the
country—I took five businesses with me. The last time I visited,
I took 30, and deals are now being done with that country. But we
should be taking 60 or even 90 businesses because today Angola is per
capita the wealthiest nation in Africa. The oil industry is expanding
enormously and there are going to be huge infrastructure changes. The
other frustration is: why are we three years behind the Chinese and the
Koreans in getting into Angola? It is because businesses have not
looked at the potential initiatives
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000082">The
most important thing from the point of view of British business and the
Government is that we spend a lot of our time criticising ourselves and
this nation but the truth is that in every country I visited we were in
the top three countries in the world that that country would want to
deal with. That is an extraordinary position to be in. It comes down to
three or four things. First, business here is underpinned by the rule
of law and we should compliment ourselves on that. 
<?notus-xml column=751?>The rule of law is fundamental to business practices and we are the
leading exponents of it.</hs_para>

transparent in the way that we do our business. I was very concerned
about the Bribery Act when it came through but I now recognise it to be
a very important and differentiating plank for British businesses when
negotiating in the world. Now we see Governments being overturned for
being corrupt by their people at the drop of a Twitter—or
whatever it is; I am not going to ask my noble friend Lord Cormack
because he does not know either—or the push of a button because
they are not transparent. That sets us apart from the
rest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000084">Thirdly,
I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Harrison: the reason people want
to do business with the UK is that we speak English, which is the
desired language of all nations now in terms of commerce. Fourthly,
London is a place that everyone wants to come to. I do not say this
without humility but for this short moment in our lifetime London is
the centre of the world to do trade. That makes it a fantastic place
for us to do
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000085">Finally—and
this may surprise noble Lords—we have an enormous bandwidth of
skills. We lead the world in e-commerce, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Lane-Fox, has led the world in e-commerce. We lead the world in
high-tech. We lead the world in low-tech. Our medical capability is the
envy of the world. Most importantly, our education system is the envy

when people go with the easy assumption that this will be the Asian
century, I do not think that is necessarily true at all. The assumption
that there will be an inevitable and significant decline in the West is
not necessarily true either. The same thing applies to the process of
deindustrialisation, which has perhaps been the dominant feature of the
western economies for the past 30 years or so and which has transformed

<?notus-xml column=752?>them essentially into heavily service-based economies. Although most
observers see this as a continuing process, I do not think it will be

run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000090">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:09:31"></hs_TimeCode>
would like noble Lords participating in this debate who are interested
in how we can produce a resurgence of global trade in this country to
take very seriously the discussion about reshoring which is going on in
the United States and several other advanced industrial countries
around the world. Reshoring, which I have mentioned in a previous
debate in your Lordships’ House, is the opposite of offshoring.
It is the idea that industry will come back to the advanced economies
and that there will be processes of reindustrialisation. It is very
important that the UK is at the forefront of such processes should they
indeed take place.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:06:08"></hs_TimeCode> can all see
that the “effort bargain” that has dominated the world
economy over the past three decades can no longer be sustained. This
now pivots on the role of China. Over that period there has been a kind
of odd coupling between the United States and China, and to some extent
Europe and China, based on the fact that the Chinese produce
manufactured goods for the United States and the industrial economies.
The United States cannot afford to pay for those goods so it has to
borrow, and the situation is much the same for Europe. How does the
United States borrow? It borrows from the Chinese, who invest in
American bonds. It is surely the case that we have come to the end of
that relationship now. It is also the case that China will move back
much more towards domestic demand rather than simply exporting. Wages
have also gone up significantly in the manufacturing centres in
China<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000091">When
we look to our trading relationship in the future, we should not
suppose that it will just depend on a continuing increase in the export
of services. Instead, we should be back making things, which is crucial
for the future. There is a kind of convergence between what is
happening in the world economy and the emergence of digital production.
Reference was made to the noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox. It is a matter
of the expansion of not just the digital world but digital production
in the form of 3D printing and things well beyond that now. These are
massive processes of change. With these localised forms of production
many things that used to be made thousands of miles away can now
be—and in the

we think about the resurgence of UK trade it is a mistake just to make
the simplistic assumption that we should turn our eyes to the east or,

China. For that reason, I would like to expand on the comments made by
my noble friend Lord Harrison about the significance of the free trade
system now under discussion between the United States and the European
Union. I see this as a kind of core of the possible pivot of change in
the global world economy. It could be a crucial source of
transformation for the whole range of industrial countries involved.
Looking at the potential impact of the EU-US Transatlantic Trade and
Investment Partnership, to give it its full name—it is usually

detail and think that they are pretty reliable. The Commission’s

consolidated western trading relationship will have adverse
consequences for the developing world. Actually, it is the contrary:

in establishing the free trade agreement; there are problems getting it
through Congress; there are problems at a state level in the US; and
there are problems within the European Union—for example, at
least some French thinkers and politicians are not as enamoured of free
trade as other parts of the European Union and have made perhaps not
terribly helpful comments on the process. Nevertheless, I think that
there is a strong will in the United States to push it
through—President Obama has made it a legacy issue for
himself—and there is also a strong will in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:11:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000095">The
free trade deal has been widely criticised from the left. It is said
that it will give more power to footloose corporations and have
negative environmental consequences. These criticisms are strongly
misplaced and quite wrong. For example, increasing collaboration
between the United States and the European Union is likely to be the
only way of having a significant impact on tax loopholes, eliminating
tax havens and creating greater corporate responsibility. I think that
the FTA will bring greater corporate responsibility, not less. There is
a sticking point around the precautionary principle environmentally,
but I think that the precautionary principle is not a principle and
that Europe should be encouraged to abandon it. Not taking a risk is
itself a risk; therefore I see a fruitful possible source of

Miller of Chilthorne Domer (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to
concentrate my remarks in this debate on the agricultural and food
sectors. I should begin by declaring an interest as a co-owner of
Vignobles Temperley, our family vineyard, which makes and exports
wine.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000098">I was
moved to speak in this debate because, with food production and the
trade in agricultural products, 
<?notus-xml column=754?>there are two very different and often conflicting goals. One is to
maximise trade and, in that case, big is certainly successful. The
other is to ensure that the people of the world are properly nourished.
In his excellent introduction, the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, spoke of
the lack of parliamentary scrutiny of trade. At national, European and
international level, there is a total vacuum when it comes to
reconciling these two, very different
goals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000099">Here in
the UK, the food industry is very important. It employs 2 million
people and has a turnover in excess of £70 billion.
Farming—primary production—employs around half a million
people but is just 0.7% of GDP. However, it supplies 60% of
the country’s food needs. Of course, our farmers share many of
the same issues with farmers throughout the world, whether that is
unpredictable weather, difficulty accessing capital investment,
cutting-edge science or markets without middle men taking so much of
the profits, or a younger generation who do not see agriculture or
horticulture as their ambition of choice. Consumers throughout the
world share a surprising number of problems in common, too. Although
there are enough calories produced throughout the world to meet the
population’s needs, they are incredibly unevenly distributed.
Noble Lords will know that roughly 1 billion people in the world are
malnourished, and many severely, and about 1 billion people are obese,
and some severely. Just this month, the Overseas Development Institute
report highlighted the fact that since 1980 the incidence of obesity
has almost quadrupled. Shockingly, almost one in three people worldwide
is now considered
obese.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000100">The
trade in agricultural products is massive but many of the poorest
people in the world are farmers. One part of the problem is that the
transnational corporations—the TNCs—that deal in
agricultural products are among the world’s largest traders. The
big four—known as ABCD—have an annual turnover bigger
than some countries but very limited accountability. Of those big four,
two are still private companies so especially unaccountable. They will
be familiar names to many noble Lords. Archer Daniels Midland has a
turnover of about $80 billion. All four have a lot in common but Bunge
Ltd is a good example: it operates in 40 countries with about 35,000
employees. The point is that it buys, sells, stores and transports so
much of the world’s foodstuffs, whether oilseeds or grains. It
processes oilseeds to make protein meal for animal feed and edible oil
products for commercial and consumers. These companies are also
involved in producing sugar and ethanol. They are involved in food,
fuel and often fertilizer production, too—so they are involved
in the whole chain. “C” stands for Cargill, which last
year had a turnover of $136.7 billion, and “D”
is Louis Dreyfus, whose annual gross turnover exceeded $120 billion.
Between them, these companies are said to control as much as 90% of the
global grain trade. Other players are emerging in the market, such as
Olam, Sinar Mas and Wilmar. Their presence varies from nuts in Africa
to palm oil in Indonesia, but they are busy diversifying,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000101">A couple

first question to the Minister is: how can it be constrained? What can
the UK Government do to address this? Clearly, there is a role for BIS,

sort of issue to be

a vacuum means that the ABCDs of this world determine where money in
agriculture is invested, where agricultural production is located,
where the produce is shipped and how the world’s population
shares—or fails to share—the food produced. As consumers,
we depend on a food chain that we neither understand nor have any power
over. This concentration of power is not building a resilient food
system—I could have spoken in the next debate—it is not
fair on producers, and it is certainly producing appalling outcomes in
terms of nourishing the world’s population, as I have outlined,
whether obese or malnourished. We need to address these
issues.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012368000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000104">The
food production system is highly vulnerable to weather—we have
seen many examples of that this year—and to lack of natural
resources, such as scarce water. We need to think about this and create
other models of greater accountability to create a balance between a
healthy trade that is bringing wealth to producers and their
communities and the need of the world for food and resources.</hs_para>

there. I shall mention one today. There was a sustained fall in
commodity prices in the second half of the 20th century, in which many
prices halved, and the Fairtrade Foundation was born from that unhappy
state of affairs. This year, it has been going in the UK for 20 years.
It now has a turnover here of £1.5 billion, so it cannot be said
to be a small, niche thing anymore. It has connected consumers
meaningfully to producers in the developing world. I welcome the
Government’s support for it. DfID Ministers have recently been
active in their support for the importance of Fairtrade. Fairtrade
farmers have explained to us that one of the problems that
multinationals produce for them is that they may buy large volumes one
year but not the next, when they need stability for investment. Price
volatility is a massive challenge. For example, the price of coffee
virtually halved between 2011 and 2013. Price volatility is perhaps the
biggest enemy of the smallholder farmer. Fairtrade tends to balance out
these issues and make life much easier for the investment we need for
future food production if we are to be sure of a food
supply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000106">Finally,
I ask the Minister about the bilateral EU trade agreements that have
rather taken the place of the failed WTO agreements. Decades of
policies weakened small producers in developing countries, and at the
moment there is not much in bilateral agreements about poverty
reduction. There needs to be some concentration on the content of trade
agreements so 
<?notus-xml column=756?>that the poorest people in those countries, who are often the people
producing the goods that we will eat, are protected. There is a
reconcilable conflict, but as long as there is a vacuum of governance
in this area it will not be
reconciled.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_23_PT_1/2BC8BC1B3A41ECC1B33AE52CE95C2F2DE874B6C8" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 January 2014">Thursday,

UK is dependent on international trade, which is why we have pretty
much always supported free trade in a largely protectionist world. In
no industry has free trade served us better than in financial services.
Of course, within the EU, we have from time to time had difficulty in
persuading our fellow members that free trade in financial services is
a good thing, as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, pointed out, coming as
they do from a more protectionist culture, particularly where
agriculture is
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000109">For
all that, one of our main global exporting industries is financial
services, which has come in for a lot of criticism, some justified and
some extreme. We need to help that industry to overcome is failures,
not to shackle it so that it cannot deliver economically for the UK.
The financial services sector employs between 1.5 million and 2 million
people, many, but by no means all, in London. The contribution to GDP
is well over 10% and the tax contribution is more than 12% of total tax
receipts, so there is no doubt about the importance of financial
services.</hs_para>

we do not need to build up other industries; of course we do.
Manufacturing has seen a resurgence in the high-tech and
high-productivity end of the industry and, of course, our software
design and cultural exports have been hugely successful. However, none
of these sectors is mutually exclusive. Indeed, a buoyant financial
services industry, if working properly, helps other businesses to be
even more successful, with innovative ways of providing financial
liquidity and risk reduction. I know from my own experience that one of
the greatest headaches in exporting is the foreign exchange risk, which

has been through a torrid time caused by the illegal, unethical and
self-serving actions of some banks and bankers. The reasons for this,
apart from human nature, have been examined in great detail, not least
by the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. Many proposals
have been put forward to ensure that this catastrophe does not happen
again. Hopefully, we are not making the same mistake that we have made
many times previously, of regulating now to stop the transgressions of
the past. It has been said that our banking sector is too big for our
economy. That is only true if we make the absurd assumption that all
banks operating in the UK are seeking business in the UK, and many do
not, and that they are a risk to the UK taxpayer in case of their
failure, which many are not. In any case, the changes to banking
supervision that we have introduced make that even less

battle continues to decide whether Hong Kong, Singapore or Shanghai

has been said that the assets of a bank go “up and down in the
elevator”; it is an American expression. It is the people who
work in financial services who make the industry a success or a
failure. They come predominantly from the home market, but we need to
ensure that the UK is welcoming to other nationalities coming here to
build our industries. We need to be open to skilled people coming to
live and work here, both for their talent in generating and closing
deals and for their local knowledge of the overseas markets our
financial services companies need to operate in. We need to continue to
be welcoming to the already successful but also to the
soon-to-be-successful, who will learn and work in London. That means
getting our personal tax regime competitive on an international level
and, because of the US dominance in these markets, coming to an
agreement on personal taxes with the USA, the federal tax regulations
of which work aggressively against employing Americans internationally,

financial services do not just need highly paid, international

well housed and well motivated labour force. That is why our reforms in
education and housing are so important. However, it is the regulation
of financial services which is the biggest challenge. There is always a
desire to regulate to a point where any risk banks take is minimised,
supposedly to the benefit of the consumer and the 
<?notus-xml column=758?>taxpayer, but there is a balance to be struck. Banks only make money by
taking risk and it is up to the shareholders, in the first instance, to
decide the acceptable level of risk, although, as we have seen, this
does not always work as shareholders do not have enough real-time
information to control their investment. This is where the Prudential
Regulation Authority and the Financial Conduct Authority come in,

think we have now got the level of supervision about right in the UK.
What is more worrying is the seeming intention of the EU Commission to
micromanage the banks operating in the eurozone, with the inevitable

right, as it is only because the market is well regulated and safe that

also a problem where capital is concerned. If banks are required to
hold too much capital in low-risk, low-earning assets, this will
certainly reduce the risk of bank failures but they will also be unable
to make an acceptable return on capital and so be unable to raise more
capital. Getting our regulation and capital requirements out of line
with the rest of the world would not be a problem if the financial
services industry were not able quite easily to move its

large number of people, makes good profits, pays a lot of tax and has
potential for even greater growth. It has had catastrophic failures,
caused by problems in its culture of personal reward, perhaps, and
certainly by its need to produce an unrealistic return on shareholder

the new regulator will be able to help the financial services industry
avoid them in the future.</hs_para>

which trade to make a surplus, just like any other business. There are
some 65,000 to 70,000 social enterprises in the UK. It is what they do
with those profits or surpluses that make them social businesses; that
and their governance and social mission, which express themselves in
many ways, including community and environmental interests, job
creation and support for people with disabilities. Hackney Community
Transport, which has bid in the commercial market for red bus routes in
London, is one example. Its profits go into supplying transport for the

context in which this debate is important for social businesses has
already been recognised by this Government. In recent times the British
Council, for example, has made social enterprises and support for
social entrepreneurs a key plank in its work. So when the Prime
Minister recently led a large trade delegation to China the chief
executive of Social Enterprise UK, Peter Holbrook, was part of that
delegation. Throughout this autumn and winter the British Council has
been running seminars and training workshops in China and Hong Kong. I
take this opportunity to commend the British Council for its programme
in support of social entrepreneurship, which is running not just in
Europe but in nine countries in east Asia—China, Indonesia,
Japan, Myanmar, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and Vietnam. It
has trained
thousands<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:34:59"></hs_TimeCode> of

opportunities that exist to help to promote social enterprises and
bring together social entrepreneurs and the investment that
they need to grow those businesses. My Government invested a great deal
in putting through legislation, creating community interest companies,
with cross-party support, and creating the circumstances for health
spin-outs and social enterprises, which has been followed through by
this Government. Indeed, we all supported the social value Act, more

have mentioned already China and south-east Asia. I now turn to Europe
and social enterprise, because last week in Strasbourg there was a
refreshing mix of policy-makers, senior politicians, front-line social
enterprises, academics, public sector representatives, and social
entrepreneurs, including commissioners and Members of the European
Parliament, from across Europe, to reflect on the progress and next
steps in developing a more social economy in Europe. The

the diverse mix of policy and practice that was on show. Indeed, I went

in social impact bonds and the social stock exchanges, which we have
been discussing and pioneering in this country for several years. That
demonstrated how enthusiasm for more social investment models is

Surprisingly, it was not completely written in Eurospeak; it is an
accessible document, which recognises the contribution that social
enterprise is making to Europe as a vehicle for social and economic
cohesion and to help to build a pluralistic and resilient social market
economy. Acting in the general interest, social enterprises create jobs
and provide innovative products and services, promoting a more
sustainable economy; they are based on the values of solidarity and
empowerment to create opportunities and hope for the future. They offer
a model for 21st-century businesses that balance finance, social,
cultural and environmental needs. Social entrepreneurs need to be seen
as agents of change, as individuals and groups who are passionate about
improving the lives of the communities in which they
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:39:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000128">Ten
recommendations came out of the declaration, but I shall point to just
one or two. The European work on support for social enterprises has
started already—with the social business initiative, through the

as I said, the balance of expert opinion seems clearly of the view that

addition to all this, there are some compelling examples of where the
absence of international trade damages both growth and employment. The
world uses sanctions as an instrument of persuasion precisely because
of the damage caused by constraint in external trade. There is a
compelling example in the middle of the Mediterranean: Northern Cyprus
has been effectively cut off from any significant internationa1 trade
for 40 years, and the consequences have been poverty,
unemployment, and low growth and
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000137"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T12:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>However,
the benefits arising from international trade may not be as clear or as
straightforward, or as equitably distributed, as a Panglossian reading
might suggest. There are, of course, two kinds of international trade:
goods and services—and financial services are a major component
of the second group. I do not think 
<?notus-xml column=762?>that anyone would argue that the collapse of 2007-08 has not damaged
growth and employment in very many communities. The connectedness
inherent in international trade can be a major cause of reversals in
growth and employment. That is especially true when regulation proves
inadequate, and I shall return to the theme of regulation a little
later.</hs_para>

even when international trade promotes growth and employment, as it
frequently does, it can also have other important consequences. It can
have cultural consequences that may be seen as
undesirable—France’s attitude to the Anglo-Saxon model,
mentioned already by the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, is a case in point.
The opening up of new markets may also have unpredicted cultural
consequences. For example, I believe that Prince Philip is still
worshipped as a god by a cargo cult on the island of Tanna in
Vanuatu.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000139">International
trade agreements may also significantly advantage large corporations
over SMEs and micro-businesses. They may act to reduce economic
stability via contagion. We have seen examples of that both in
sovereign debt and in the Asian markets. Finally, international trade
may act to reduce democratic oversight of the operations of the market.
This can take the form of simple distance from the transactions,
complexity and lack of transparency in trade agreements and
non-accountable dispute resolution procedures. In the time remaining, I
shall comment on just three of these areas.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012368000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000140">The first is the
question of whether international trade agreements should now
concentrate more on supply chains than on tariff reductions. The World
Economic Forum at its meeting a year ago focused on reducing supply
chain barriers, which it is estimated would give a bigger boost to GDP
than removing tariffs. Improving border administration and transport
and communications infrastructure could increase global GDP by 5% and
would have six times the effect of removing all global tariffs. I would
be grateful if the Minister could tell the House how the Government
currently see the proper balance between reducing supply chain barriers
and reducing or removing tariffs.</hs_para>

position of SMEs in all this. The CBI reports that, in the UK, only one
in five SMEs currently exports. It also notes that businesses are 11%
more likely to survive if they export. Perhaps part of the problem is
that SMEs are not properly represented in large-scale multilateral or
bilateral trade negations. In January last year, the WEF recommended
that SMEs be at the negotiating table when there is discussion of the
regulatory framework and environment. Does my noble friend the Minister
agree with that recommendation, and is it actually happening when the
UK negotiates bilaterally and multilaterally through the EU?</hs_para>

these negotiations. There is an alphabet soup of these things: FTAs,
WTO, TPA, TPP and TTIP. Much of what goes on in these negotiations is
complex, opaque and takes an awfully long time. Occasionally, it is all
punctuated by a dramatic announcement. For example, a year ago the EU
Trade Commissioner suddenly announced that he had personally saved the
WTO,</hs_para>

begins to illustrate a point. We need all our business communities to
understand and feel that they have a part in trade negotiations, but we
also need to make sure that Parliament has an effective oversight role.
This was a point made forcefully by the noble Lord, Lord Harrison. This
is currently a question in the TTIP negotiations which envisage, as
they should, dispute resolution procedures. This is obviously vital
when trading between different jurisdictions, but the question that has
arisen is whether these non-governmental arbitration panels will have
the power to override or amend local
laws.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000144">In the

exports of vehicles from this country in November were up by 10.7% on a

Huge investment has made a difference. Nissan in Sunderland is

however, still show some good news. Exports to China have doubled since
2009. That is not enough—it is still only 1% of the
market—but is certainly a creditable achievement. As we saw in
the recent trade mission, a great deal is being done to build further
alliances with China. The digital alliance, for instance, between UKTI
and China is aimed at providing up to £2 billion in extra
business for our creative industries. That trade mission did not just
accomplish big deals for UK businesses but brought investment from
China into this country. Chang’an Motors, for instance, is now
making a £60 million investment in a West Midlands R&amp;D
centre, which will create 300 jobs. It would be really useful if a
discipline adopted by the Government was to refer later to what has
actually been achieved by these trade missions in the longer term. To
hear what the follow-up 
<?notus-xml column=765?>has been would produce some interesting information for us, but would

main problems for us is that companies are not investing. I talked

Government have been energetic in providing support for exporters, with
the aim of doubling exports by 2020. That is a brave aim and one that
demands support. It is, however, a very big ask: it requires exports to
grow by 8% a year. We are not getting anywhere near that at the moment.
In part, to reach that target, there have been dramatic changes in the
way in which the support network overseas works. There is increased
reliance on British chambers of commerce abroad. This has created a
degree of concern among some companies and other business
organisations. Some chambers of commerce abroad are effective, strong
organisations but vary in quality. Can the Minister assure us that the
quality of those chambers is being monitored and that we are confident
that this is the best
method?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000161">Our
chambers of commerce differ from the German chambers, where membership
is mandatory. There are some concerns that we may be moving in that
direction, as smaller businesses of course want nothing which will
involve them having to pay subscriptions to organisations to which they
do not particularly want to belong. I understand the logic in taking
responsibility 
<?notus-xml column=766?>for small and medium-sized exporters away from our embassies. I believe
that the theory is that the embassies can then concentrate on helping
the really big deals go through. I am a great admirer of the skills of
our embassies overseas, which do great work. I would like reassurance
that we are making the best landscape for encouraging our exporters. I
have been particularly impressed, for instance, by the high commission
in Delhi and its work building exports in India. The people in those

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I add my
congratulations and my gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, for
this debate, which enables the House to focus on this very important
issue today. Standard economic theory tells one that economic growth is
a positive function of two variables: increases in factors of
production and increases in productivity. Increases in productivity
arise from the application of technology, changes in work practices and
specialisation. The three things go very much hand in hand.
Specialisation is what requires trade: trade within the local
community, within one nation and
internationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000165">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:03:40"></hs_TimeCode>
can all take pride in the fact that the central economic theory
breakthroughs in this area are all achievements of the great British
political economists. Smith first identified the importance of
specialisation with his memorable analogy in <I>The Wealth of
Nations</I> about the makers of pins, who suddenly became more
productive when one man ceased to make the whole pin and another man
added the head<I>.</I> Fifty years later Ricardo formulated the much
more counterintuitive theory of comparative advantage. This
demonstrated that a country with an absolute advantage in everything
still has an interest in trading with its neighbours, 
<?notus-xml column=767?>because if it concentrates all its resources on those areas where its
absolute advantage is greatest, it will so increase its output as to be
able to purchase anything else it needs from the world on very
favourable terms. Global output and global welfare will then be
maximised. Those theories are now just as embedded and well established
in economic science as Maxwell’s equations are in physics,
Mendeleev’s periodic table is in chemistry, or Darwin’s
theory of natural selection is in
biology.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000166">Over<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:04:37"></hs_TimeCode>
the past 50 or 60 years and the lifetime of most of us in this House,
there has been a remarkable phase of economic growth. This has been
cyclical, as one expects, but nevertheless it is extraordinary. I often
wonder whether it can be continued over the next 50 or 60 years. There
have been four very special, remarkable and unusual features to the
last 60 or 70 years, which have made possible that great
growth in output. All of those four developments can and should go
further. They should be pushed further, which I will come to in a
moment. However, it is not clear to me that they can be effectively
replicated or replaced in their totality. We should be quite worried
about that, and should not be complacent in simply extrapolating the
growth rates of the last 50 years—which in this country have
averaged about 2.5% per annum—into the indefinite
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000167">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>
first of those great developments and changes was the introduction of
the female half of the human population into the labour force of
developed countries. Obviously, that was an event of enormous social
consequences, but also enormous economic importance. That is a classic
example of an increase in a factor of production, of the major factor
of
labour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000168">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>
second great development of the last 50 or 60 years has been what I
call the economic emancipation—unfortunately not always
accompanied by political emancipation—on free market models of
countries in the Far East. The first of these was Japan, followed by
Korea, Taiwan and the ASEAN countries, and then over the last 20 years
by China and India. China and India alone account for more than 2
billion of the world’s 6 billion population. That is an
enormously important development for the future of everybody on the
globe. Can it be reproduced? Can an equivalent dramatic event occur in
the future? That is a classic case of the rise in productivity which
happens when people move from very low productivity activities such as
agriculture—sometimes at subsistence or near-subsistence
level—into manufacturing and into the cities. That has been the
history of Asia over the last two
generations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000169">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>
third factor, which I do not need to dwell on as everybody knows about
it, is the introduction of IT into the economy. Again, I do not doubt
that we have much further to go on this, but is it possible to envisage
that over the next 50 or 60 years there will be an equally dramatic
impetus to growth from new technology? I do not know, but I sometimes
worry about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:07:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000170">The
fourth factor, which comes down to the subject introduced today by the
noble Lord, Lord Harrison, is the growth in free trade. Since the
Kennedy round in the 1960s right through to the latest chapter—I
hope it 
<?notus-xml column=768?>is not the end—in the Doha process, there has been a steady
reduction in tariff barriers. This has been a great achievement, and a
great boost to growth. The establishment of regional free trade areas
or economic areas of co-operation is, in a way, the greatest success.
The European Union has been a model for the whole world. It has done
something which none of the others has succeeded in doing: addressing
the non-tariff barriers to trade just as effectively as the tariff
barriers. We all know that the non-tariff barriers are the most
difficult to deal
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000171">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>
is very unfortunate that the Doha round seems to have run into the
sand. Perhaps it can be pulled out, as we all hope. In the mean time we
must concentrate on doing what we can. The Government and the European
Union in partnership have been very sensible in putting the emphasis on
doing trade deals, particularly with other economic groupings around
the world. Quite the most important of those is the potential EU-US
trade
agreement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000172">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>
will spend the rest of my time asking the Minister about that
agreement, because it is so important that the House of
Lords—and, indeed, the House of Commons—are kept up to
date. We all know that the negotiations are taking place, and of course
practically they can only take place at the level of the European
Union. Clearly, this is one of the great things which the European
Union can do much more effectively than 28 different countries could do
separately. They could not even begin to think about it. I know that
mechanisms are in place for national Governments to keep abreast of the
developments. It is very important that they in turn keep us abreast of
developments, so perhaps I can ask one or two
questions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000173">We
should bear in mind that this is an enormous challenge and that the
United States does not have a good record as a free trader. On two
occasions in the 20th century, or, at least, in the past 130
years—first, with the McKinley tariff in 1890 and, secondly,
with the Smoot-Hawley tariffs in the interwar period—the United
States led the way in starting a world tariff war, with disastrous
results for everybody concerned. We also have to remember that the two
Democrat Administrations—the Woodrow Wilson and Kennedy
Administrations—reduced tariffs. Thank goodness, both Republican
and Democrat Administrations in the United States have been committed
to freer trade over the past two generations. However, we are going
forward into this negotiation, which I think is going to be enormously
complicated and take a very long time. Some of the great challenges are
very unclear, so perhaps I may ask the Minister some very precise
questions. If he does not know the answers to them, I should like him

question on the whole area of insurance. This seems to be an
extraordinarily difficult area in which to make progress because it is

no foreign insurers are allowed at all in the insurance market. Other
states let them in for what they call “surplus lines”,
where the local insurance companies do not want or do not have the
capacity to handle the business. Obviously in relation to certain
things, such as wind storms on the east coast and earthquakes in
California, they do not want their insurance companies to bear the
whole potential risk burden. What is happening on insurance? Is it
going to be opened up and are we going to be able to sell insurance

Purvis of Tweed (LD):</Member></B> It is a pleasure to follow the noble
Lord’s theoretical and practical contribution to this debate,
and I welcome the opportunity given to us by the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, to speak on this issue. I wish to pick up on a couple of
points that the noble Lord, Lord Davies, mentioned and to discuss two
export sectors that are of considerable significance 
<?notus-xml column=770?>to the Scottish and UK economies. I want to focus, in particular, on
rural Scotland. For skilled workers in difficulties in the recession
that has taken hold in the manufacturing sector in rural Scotland over
the past few years, there are two shining lights, but both need support
from the Government.</hs_para>

should like to address some areas where removing barriers to
international trade will allow whisky exports to continue to grow and
will also allow opportunities for the Scottish textiles sector. Unlike
other noble Lords, I have no interests to declare in this debate, other
than to point out that my title of “Tweed” relates to the
river rather than the cloth, although, incidentally, the latter was
named after the former nearly 200 years ago. These are iconic products.
“Iconic” is an overused word but I think it is
appropriate to describe these two Scottish products—whisky and
textiles. They are of the highest quality in both product and brand,
and they have a heritage that is surpassed hardly anywhere in the
world. They continue to represent key areas of employment and domestic
economic activity, and are areas known for their innovation and
creativity—the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, mentioned
innovation and technology. I am not resting on their laurels; they are
of significance for the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:15:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

supported by the Scotch whisky industry, including 10,000 directly
related to production. In textiles—medical textiles and
pioneering research for technical textiles—Scotland in many
respects leads the world. Often, as I indicated, the jobs are in rural
and remote Scottish areas, where there is little alternative
employment. Jobs supported by the whisky industry include those in
packaging, tourism, logistics, maltsters and cereal suppliers, and this
industry shares many of the attributes mentioned by my noble friend
Lady Miller. We are often told not to mix grain and grape, but I think
that in this context we share many
priorities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:16:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

textile sector remains a key employer in many parts of Scotland,
including the one close to my heart in the Scottish Borders. The sector
currently employs in the region of 9,000 people across 600
businesses manufacturing textiles, apparel and leather products. For
nearly 1,000 years, woollen and woven goods have been exported from the
Scottish Borders. Most noble Lords will have worn Scottish textiles and
most will have partaken of the occasional dram. Thankfully, few will
have drunk counterfeit whisky, but perhaps more will have worn textiles
that were either cheaper and poorer-quality products purporting to be
Scottish or were otherwise based on traditional Scottish designs but
were manufactured in areas where the quality is poorer and the labour
conditions even worse. We do not need to go far back in history to find
the awful example of the incident in Bangladesh. Such poor labour
standards in manufacturing textiles can make us proud of our standards
in the United Kingdom.</hs_para>

first area of concern. It is in our economic interests to protect these
exports. The current round of negotiations for the EU-US Transatlantic
Trade and Investment Partnership, or TTIP, referred to by the noble
Lord, Lord Harrison, gives the UK and its EU partners the opportunity
to address some of the areas where support is needed for these
sectors.</hs_para>

in particular woollen and woven goods, require protection to maintain
brand standards. The mislabelling, and therefore mis-selling, of goods
that are not made in Scotland is a continuing concern for the sector
and it is an area where the Government can assist in providing support.
Clear labelling of the country of origin for manufactured textile goods
is of significant importance given that some retailers in the
UK—even in Scotland—and around the world sell woollen or
cashmere products that claim to be Scottish or from Edinburgh or the
Highlands, or they purport to be of a Scottish design and therefore
give the impression that they are manufactured in Scotland, whereas
they are actually manufactured in other countries, typically China,
Pakistan, India or Vietnam. By ensuring that the Government use all the
powers available to their offices and agencies around the world, and by
encouraging domestic prosecuting authorities, whether it is the Lord
Advocate in Scotland or the authorities in England and Wales, we can
support and protect this important British product by making sure that
customers are aware of what they are buying.

the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Davies, about crippling tariff
regimes, there are continuing barriers for Scottish woven exports.
Noble Lords may be interested to know that in exporting a lambswool
sweater from the Scottish Borders to the USA, a 16% import tariff is
applied. That means that a sweater manufactured for $50 in the Scottish
Borders, with a fourfold retail mark up plus a 16% tariff, will cost
the US customer $232. That is a crippling tariff regime. While it is
less for cashmere at 4%, both are above the average tariff rates that
are currently being negotiated.

whether or not that was apocryphal but, certainly, when you drive
through central Scotland and you look over to the Ochil hills, you will
see miles of what used to be called bonded warehouses, where there is
stored cask upon cask of Scotch malt whisky. That whisky can be there

Union immediately. In the short term, we would be denied the services
of the European Commission in the opening of new markets. The
Commission has done a great deal to ensure what it calls the integrity
of the product. This includes a consistent minimum level of alcoholic
strength and that the “Scotch” name is protected. As my

success. The fact is that, were Scotland to vote yes in September, this
industry would be put at a great disadvantage for some time, and that
is assuming that in the end an independent Scotland would be allowed to
join the EU. However, much of the protection we enjoy at the present

Symons of Vernham Dean (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lord Harrison for his opening remarks, culminating as they did
in his almost impassioned plea for greater recognition of the
importance of trade. I declare an interest as chairman of the Arab
British Chamber of Commerce and so, perhaps unsurprisingly, I shall
concentrate my brief remarks on trade with the Arab Middle

upheaval, the Middle East is a region that is full of opportunity for
trade and investment—opportunities which are growing. But
increasingly our business partners in the region are seeking commercial
relationships based on partnerships and joint ventures; in short, based
not just on one-off trade deals but on long-term business relationships
with our Arab partners in the region. This is a fundamental point for
securing not only Government-to-Government business, as I am sure the
Minister is well aware, but business-to-business trade
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

problem in the region with the shortage of jobs for young people. That
shortage is really acute, given that more than 50% of the population in
the region is under the age of 25. Accordingly, in all the discussions
and trade negotiations that I have had in the past few years, there has
been a huge emphasis on two things. First, the transfer of
skills—whether those skills are in IT or project management,
whether they are specific to sectors such as the law or
whether they are manual skills—is very highly prized.
Secondly, the deals have to produce jobs, particularly jobs for young
people. Can the Minister tell us how we in the United Kingdom are
co-ordinating our efforts on those two vital elements as we try to take
forward our trading relationships for the future? How are we getting
those messages over to our business

Minister on starting his new job, and I am particularly delighted that
he is concentrating within UKTI not only on high-value business
opportunities, but also on trying to help medium-sized British
companies develop trading relationships. That is hugely important, and

that respect when he sums up the

to the Minister for more joined-up government on trade. My recent
experience is that Ministers and their civil servants all work
enormously hard but, my goodness, they still protect their turf. I know
that it has always been like that—indeed, it was like that under
the Government in which I served—but all civil servants still
patrol the borders of the silos of their relationships with their own
particular Ministers. That has to change if we are to do proper
relationship building that goes right the way across government. We
need joint initiatives involving UKTI, BIS, the FCO, the MoD, which is
also slightly on the silo side, and DfID, which has a real role to play
here, as do other government departments where there is enormous export
potential, such as education, health, transport and
agriculture<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:38:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
Relationship building is crucial to trade with the Arab Middle East,
but, to be effective, Government have to act as Government and not just
as individual
departments.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_23_PT_1/F336E10E89F85AE99B5A67744FA5D3FA7572F1AC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 January 2014">Thursday,

Liddle (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Harrison for taking the initiative in organising this debate and for
his very thoughtful speech. We have had many excellent contributions,
notably from my noble friend Lady Symons who is experienced in the
practice of trade promotion. Earlier we heard from the noble Lord, Lord
Marland, and various sectors have been discussed, ranging from the
challenge of UK wine by the noble Baroness, Lady Miller, to the
reputation of Scotch whisky by the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, and my
noble friend Lord O’Neill. The complexities of financial
services were considered by the noble Lord, Lord Carrington, while my
noble friend Lady Thornton talked about the potential of social
enterprise.</hs_para>

to welcome to his first debate the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord
Livingston of Parkhead. I think he has answered Questions before but
this is his first debate. He probably does not remember but I first met
him when he was part of a group of businesspeople whom my noble friend
Lord Mandelson, of Hartlepool and Foy, sought advice from when he was
Business Secretary. We all welcome him to the Front Bench and his new
role, and wish him every success in what is a vital national
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000214">I
start with the central point that one or two noble Lords have
mentioned: improving our trade is essential to the rebalancing of the
economy which the Chancellor set out as one of his key objectives in
2010. I will focus on trade policy rather than trade promotion, because
I think that the Minister has an important role in trade policy. Of
course, this all takes place in the context of globalisation. The noble
Lord, Lord Davies, pointed out the extraordinary change in economic
openness in the past 20 years. The figures I saw were that from 1960
until the end of the Cold War only one in five of the world’s
population lived in an economically open society. Now, on some
calculations, it is as high as 90%. That is a huge
transformation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000215">Of
course, for advocates of openness, this leads to a major political
challenge because people, particularly in the developed world, worry
about where their jobs are going to come from if we face all this
low-wage competition. The Government talk about a global race. I would
like to know how the Minister interprets this. Clearly, there are
causes for optimism in Britain’s economic and trade position, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, said, but among the general public
many people feel that the rewards of globalisation are being
appropriated by the few, not the many, and worry that instead of a race
to the top, we are actually seeing a race to the bottom.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14012368000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000216">One of the key
political challenges for all the political parties in Britain is how to
build public support for economic openness. Of course, we do not help
that if we get into a political race to see who can be the toughest
against immigration. When we talk about trade, we have to be prepared
to make the argument that it is not just our exporters who benefit from
more open trade, it is our poorest families—for instance, in
buying children’s shoes and clothes—who have greatly
benefited from the opening up of the world economy in the past 20
years.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=777?><hs_para UID="14012368000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000217">What is the
Government’s strategy for trade? How does the current emphasis
on regional agreements fit in with sustaining the
multilateral trade system? The noble Lord, Lord Davies, asked a lot of
very relevant questions about the transatlantic trade
initiative. I am not going to repeat them; it is
vital and a great opportunity but it also raises lots of difficulties.
The noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, talked about people’s fears about
how trade arbitration can overcome laws that we have agreed either in
the UK or at EU level. That is a legitimate concern. The points made by
the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, about parliamentary accountability at
both EU and national level are of great
importance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000218">Another
question is: does the Minister recognise the key importance of services
to Britain’s trade prospects? I am sure he does. But once we say
that we recognise the key importance of services, we get straight into
the question of migration. For instance, as I know from when I was in
the Commission, in the negotiations between the EU and India, a key
demand of the Indians was for a more liberal visa regime for their IT
companies. How do we handle these questions?</hs_para>

of Britain is in our higher education—I declare an interest as
pro chancellor of Lancaster University—medicine, culture and
sport. The Minister is a former director of Celtic. In all these areas,
British success depends on an open policy towards people from the rest
of the world. Where do the Government stand on
this?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000220">The key
question for trade is that of Britain and the European Union. I know
that this is a familiar theme, which I have spoken about many times in
this House and we will be debating again tomorrow, but does the
Minister accept the point made by several noble Lords around the
Chamber that Britain outside the European Union would be in a much
weaker position to make representations to China on intellectual
property, to countries that are marketing counterfeit Border textiles,
which the noble Lord, Lord Purvis, talked about, or to people marketing
whiskies that are not genuine Scotch whiskies? I know there has been a
problem with that in India. What strength would we have if we were
outside the EU? The Government have to come clean on this question. How
would we be able to participate in a transatlantic agreement if we were
not members of the EU? What would be our prospects for attracting
inward investment into this country if we were not members of the
EU?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000221">Since we
have such an interest in the EU trade agenda, it is vital that Britain
maximises its influence in Brussels. I know from when I worked in my
noble friend Lord Mandelson’s cabinet that a large part of what
the EU member states do on trade is actually negotiate with each other
on what the EU policy in negotiations with the outside world is going
to be. But we all know that as a member state, we cannot negotiate with
other member states if, as Herman Van Rompuy once put it in a very good
speech, it always seems as though we have one hand on the door handle
and are about to rush outside. This question of Britain’s
relations with the EU is not some fanciful political question; it is a
very real question for the Minister’s responsibilities and we
greatly look forward to his
reply.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_23_PT_1/097E7FBF839744D9C7D3FDBD4AA425723C2EBB63" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 January 2014">Thursday,

of course, essential to the world economy. It creates growth and
employment, and enhances consumer choice and value. It is not just
something for “rich” countries or big business. Trade is
the greatest single tool to bring hundreds of millions of people out of
poverty and set countries on the path of development. Trade is vital to
the UK’s economy. We have an open economy and seek to champion
that; we have a global outlook and a strong and proud history of
commerce. Exports are equivalent to over 30% of UK GDP and, in the last
financial year alone, FDI into the UK supported in excess of 100,000
jobs.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012368000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000225">The
noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Davies of Stamford, outlined their
support for free trade agreements, which I very much welcome. It is
important that the whole global community can benefit from trade, and
to do that we require a functioning global trade regime. It should
reduce or, ideally, remove the barriers to imports and exports and
provide convergence of standards so customers around the world can
choose the best of what the world has to offer. I hope that they will
choose “Made in the UK”, and it is part of my role to
make sure that they do that more
regularly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000226">This
Government are proud of their position at the forefront of European and
global efforts to facilitate free-trade growth. My predecessor, the
noble Lord, Lord Green, whose outstanding work in his two and a half
years as Trade Minister I commend, was a vice-chair at the World Trade
Organisation Conference in Bali in December, where the important trade
facilitation package was agreed. This agreement will cut red tape and
unnecessary processes and streamline customs procedures at borders. It
will benefit the UK by around £1 billion per annum. However,
crucially, most of the gain is global, with around $100 billion
accruing particularly to emerging nations such as those in
Africa.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000227">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T13:52:25"></hs_TimeCode>
noble friend Lord Sharkey asked how we balance reducing barriers with
supply-chain issues. Both are important, but I would also mention
convergence: in many areas we have already reduced or removed trade
barriers in terms of tariffs, but we also have to have convergence of
standards so that manufacturers can produce global products and
customers can enjoy them. Each and every one has its place and perhaps
a different emphasis, depending on which area and which country we are
negotiating
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000228">The UK
has used its influence with both our EU colleagues and a wide range of
other countries to help create a global consensus—we most
definitely have such influence while in the EU. However, it has to be
recognised that this was the first multilateral agreement in 20 years.
It is appropriate, in the mean time, that the EU and other economies
around the world have also 
<?notus-xml column=779?>pursued plurilateral and bilateral deals as well as regional routes to
trade liberalisation. As the noble Lord, Lord Harrison, pointed out,
those do not contradict each other; they can be mutually reinforcing
and help build overall a system of improved trade, with higher volumes
and
prosperity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000229">Again,
the UK has been at the forefront of efforts here. We were influential
in shaping the EU-South Korea Free Trade Agreement, which was
mentioned. This came into force in the summer of 2011 and was widely
considered the first of a new generation of EU free trade agreements,
in that it is genuinely deep and significantly more comprehensive than
previous agreements. It has eliminated 97% of tariffs and addressed
many of the non-tariff barriers. It makes doing business with South
Korea much more straightforward. The results and successes of this
agreement are clear, with trade between the UK and South Korea doubling
over the course of the year following the agreement compared to the
years before. Part of that is oil, but even excluding oil we saw a 40%
increase in trade with South Korea. It may surprise many noble Lords
that the UK now runs a £2.6 billion surplus in trade with South
Korea. Before the agreement, it was broadly
neutral.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000230">Negotiations
are also under way with a wide range of markets—east and west,
large and small, developed and emerging. The largest of these is of
course TTIP, which was mentioned by a number of noble Lords. This
agreement was described by the US ambassador to the UK
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14012368000615" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0001.htm#14012368000615">“an

has a point, but what is more important is that it could be worth up to
£10 billion to the UK. It is correct, as the noble Lord, Lord
Harrison, mentioned, that we helped to sponsor a study to show the
positive impact of the agreement in various US states. Why did we do
that? Because it is very easy to spot the losers, but it is important
that it is understood, on both sides of the Atlantic, where the winners
are. Within the UK we have a clear view of the winners: for example, if
we conduct a comprehensive TTIP, we expect the car industry to increase
by 4.1% and financial services by 1.1%. There are real benefits for UK
industry. However, critically, the point has been made previously in
this House, including in Questions I have answered, that it will also
benefit consumers, giving them better choice and lower

noble Lord, Lord Davies, raised a number of questions regarding TTIP,
which I will do my best to try to answer. First, audio-visual services
are initially excluded from negotiations at the behest of the French
Government. The negotiation mandate was, unfortunately, leaked, so the
US is of course already aware of it. However, we are just starting
negotiations and setting out initial positions, and we will have to see
how that is reflected and any interrelationship<I>.</I> The Jones Act
might well be one of the quid pro quos but discussions will almost
definitely continue and the UK will make its points. UK business is of

was more than to Russia and Turkey combined. But that is only a
starting point. Many more UK-based firms could be doing business in
Africa. There are opportunities in all sectors, particularly in energy,
infrastructure, healthcare, ICT, professional services, and education
and skills. We will work across government, particularly with DfID and
the FCO, to maximise our efforts in Africa, and help in the

Business success in international markets is central to our economy.
This is as true today as it was in May 2011 when UKTI launched its
five-year strategy. That strategy set out how we were going to improve
our trade position. We are targeting high-growth companies to encourage
more exports and help existing exporters penetrate high-growth and
emerging markets. We are winning business contracts for high-value
opportunity. These are often in excess of £250 million each. We
are delivering high-quality foreign direct investment to the UK, which

greater number, exports account for less than 10% of their trade. Only

but concentrate on hazards, natural accidents policy et cetera. This is
also an opportunity to thank emergency services personnel for their
magnificent work so far this winter. The statutory services have
delivered. Environment Agency staff deserve special thanks if for no
other reason than that they do not normally get the recognition they
deserve. Then there is the Royal National Lifeboat Institution, funded

Cabinet Office, which will answer this debate for the Government, has
published each year since 2008 an unclassified version of the national
risk assessment in the form of the National Risk Register of Civil
Emergencies. It is an incredibly useful tool, though it does not cover
all aspects of what I want to raise today, some of which includes the
resilience of society at large in a social sense. I am also well aware
from my time in government of the massive amount of planning and the
exercises that take place to prepare for emergencies and test our
resilience. The proof of proper planning and preparation preventing
poor performance is the 2012 Olympics, but we seem in some ways to be
scrimping along as a nation. That is a worry and why I want to raise
these issues today.</hs_para>

Ofgem says that if we get a 1-in-20 bad winter there will be real

today only to see that E.ON is about to close one power station and run
three others down—now, in the middle of winter. I accept that
that is not all the fault of the coalition but it does not demonstrate
the urgency that we need in this matter. The national risk register
almost boasts that we have never had a total power outage—a
point that it makes more than once. On gas storage, it remains the case

September, and I would cite Norfolk, Thurrock and Croydon. Very
substantial increases will be required in several other local
authorities by 2016. Can we deliver on that? Local authorities are both
a service delivery organisation for schools and a strategic education
authority for an area. However, they can only extend local authority
schools—they are not allowed to build or open any new schools
and have no power to direct academies or free schools to open in a
particular area. Who will spend the money on that? Surely we need a
single capital pot for an area, irrespective of who runs the school. We

council spending is invisible to the population because most people do
not actually use the services and only the vulnerable will feel the

the increase in malnutrition among young children? That is an
inevitable consequence of attacking the poor, both those in and those
out of work. We know that Ministers do not like food banks, which makes
matters even worse; yet the food banks are now under such pressure that
they have to supply cold boxes and kettle boxes for those who cannot
afford to use gas or electricity to cook food. There is also some
evidence—I do not have the details of this as I heard it vaguely
only yesterday—that more people are shopping day to day for
food. The supermarkets can track this very tightly in urban areas. That

had a laboratory close at the height of the horsemeat scandal last
March and many laboratory tests had to be sent out of the UK to other
countries. Our laboratories are the ultimate mixture of academic,
private, independent and local authority, and they are a vital UK
strategic national asset. In my view, the Government’s chief
scientist should lead on this. We need the laboratories for regulation
and investigation as well as for the assurances required by industry
for all kinds of events—that is, food, human and animal events
as well as chemical, nuclear and biological threat events, which I will
not raise today. We are on the edge of a real capacity problem as
regards laboratories and the numbers of public analysts. The president
of the Association of Public Analysts, Liz Moran, has on more than one
occasion told parliamentary committees that we are in serious trouble
in terms of our capacity. There were 41 analysts in 2007.

regional and intergenerational housing crisis, with millions of hidden

our problems for 20 years. The reasoning is simple. Urban developments
at present amount to about 11% of the land, national parks to 8%, areas
of outstanding national beauty to 16% and the green belt to 14%. That

was a key crisis. We have to think about the serious volatility of
changes in climate. The Thames barrier has a limited life. I had
already put this in my notes, and I was really worried when I heard
yesterday about the delay. The Thames barrier is sinking, and we are
going to wait until 2070 before we start having a look at it. Flood
defences are more than walls and dams: they should be environmental as
well. I commend to the Government—I am sure that someone has
read it—the major article by George Monbiot last week. It
appeared first on Tuesday in the <I>Guardian</I> and then on two pages
in the <I>Mail on Sunday</I>. True, the latter newspaper used it to
attack the EU but the article was the same in both. George Monbiot
highlighted the methods for preventing floods that UK scientists have
being using for years in the tropics—planting trees in the hills
to save and protect communities down stream from flooding. Here, we pay
farmers to grub up trees and hedges and plant the hills with pretty
grass and use sheep to maintain the chocolate box image, and then we
wonder why we have floods where we should not really have them and
which we could prevent if we took the advice. Monbiot says that water
sinks into soil under trees at 67 times the rate that it sinks in under
grass, so why are we not doing that in the UK in areas that we know
flood
unnecessarily?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000264">My
last point on floods is to express concern that the plan for
sustainable insurance known “Flood Re” has again been
delayed. I will not go into detail but the Swiss Re system for
terrorism insurance has worked incredibly well, and I do not see why it
cannot work for major floods. It could work for major animal disease
outbreaks. The taxpayer is protected because the system allows a market
in terrorism insurance to operate. If it is a good enough system to
cover buildings in the City of London for terror attacks, the principle
should be good enough to ensure that insurance is available for
householders in major floods. The pool 
<?notus-xml column=787?>system works at all times except the most catastrophic, which is when
the Treasury stands behind the pool. It is cheaper for the taxpayer in
the long
run.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000265">Did I
just mention the Treasury? I think for social resilience we have a
problem with the Treasury. Resilience is the process of being able to
return to the original state after being deformed, but we know that the
Chancellor wants a smaller state. He wants to cut the public sector by
making what he calls hard choices. His hard choices are the ones he
finds easy to make, and are only hard on those affected who, in the
main, are the weak and disadvantaged. His hard choices are to diminish
local authorities, set the old against the young and not even talk
about doing it in a fairer way. The young do not vote. Their turnout is
two-thirds the rate of the rest, so if they do not vote and threaten
him at the ballot box, why should he bother? I do not like this
approach, to be honest. One reason is the seeming total lack of
compassion and comprehension. It is not nice.</hs_para>

to explain the Chancellor’s approach to creating
intergenerational conflict and a breakdown in general of the resilience

Rumsfeld’s quote from 2002 about the three categories of the
known knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns. He did not
invent them—they had been around for a while—but there is
a fourth category highlighted by a psychoanalytical philosopher who I
am greatly familiar with, Slavoj Žižek: the unknown
known, or that which we intentionally refuse to acknowledge that we
know. That is a perfect fit for the Chancellor. He knows what he is
doing but refuses to acknowledge it and its consequences.</hs_para>

particular pleasure to follow and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord
Rooker, on having secured and opened this debate with such a bravura
performance. He is such a skilful and persuasive leader of opinion in
your Lordships’ House. One of my most vivid parliamentary

things he said at the end of his speech. First, I would like to advise
him in the context of the Treasury that I have been in gumboots down in

water. Some of it may have been moved since I was a Treasury Minister,
but I do not think it is likely that it has all gone. Secondly, I have
not read the piece which the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, quoted about
water cannon, but out of Northern Ireland experience, I can say that
water cannon is a remarkably inflexible weapon. You have to have a

macroeconomic, but after 24 years representing an inner London seat, I
now no longer live here, but in the east-west Nadder valley in
Wiltshire, which contains along its length road, rail and river, the
rail being sensibly elevated so that the river causes most of its
inconveniences to the roads. I am not proposing to dilate on climate
change, although of course I recognise its relevance in this context on
both sides of the argument, and I admire and applaud the surefootedness

of Lords Library for the admirable development of its policy of
furnishing speakers in general debates with Library briefing, I will
remark in passing that I daily read the <I>Times</I> backwards at
breakfast, starting with cricket, then using as a stepping-stone to
death, both obituaries and classified, the fascinating daily articles
entitled “Weather” which the <I>Times</I> now has before
proceeding to the stock market, leaving everything else to read at
leisure after 10 o’clock at night. Our Library produced an
excellent briefing for today, although I hope it is not going to make a
habit of one feature in today’s briefing wherein the Select
Committee’s examination of the Secretary of State for
Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, Mr Paterson, suddenly jumped
without warning from page 7, in the final line of which badgers
occurred twice, to page 11, on which deer appear in the second and
third lines. Establishing the connection in this instance is relatively
easy in terms of what has been recorded in the intervening four pages,
and it may have the makings of an ingenious pencil-and-paper game late
at night, but it later moves from page 12 to page 19, and some
scintilla of forewarning might be
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000273">The
value of the briefing, as of this debate, is the concentration on the
long term, to which the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, paid tribute. When in
the 1970s, I was running a multinational firm in the private sector, 
<?notus-xml column=789?>I used to take a day off once a year to attend an annual seminar
conducted by a futurological polymath from the Hudson Institute outside
New York, whose erudition can be briefly indexed by his reply to a
question about why the Japanese had settled occidentally more in Brazil
than in any other country. He said: “I have always understood
that it was because the Japanese found Portuguese easier to learn than
any other European language”. At a time when manufacturing was
beginning its long decline here, he reassured us that we were well
prepared for post-industrial society by the extent of our superiority
in education—especially higher education—government and
health. I have spent the past 40 years admiring his percipience, but
also wondering if we were making the most of our development in these

regretted that constituency pressures in the Commons encourage MPs to
enter the ranks of last-ditch defenders and protesters whenever small
primary schools or elderly hospitals were past their sell-by dates
while still dearly loved by constituents nearby. In this particular
era, when communities are threatened by economic or climactic
pressures, I can join the regrets of some that the big society has been
less than wholly successful in catching on, but that is not a reason
for the instincts of the big society not to be pursued by those who
favour them. Indeed, on what is, appositely, the “ill
wind” principle, flooding brings out the best in all of us in
terms of mutual aid. I live in a hamlet, the population of which does
not run to three figures, and which is sandwiched within the five miles
that separate two National Health Service surgeries, one in a village
of more than 600, and the other of more than 2,000. We use the former,
which has a high elderly component but, simultaneously, perhaps because
of its community vigour, a very low incidence of dementia. If good is
best done by stealth, some of us pay our savings from freedom from
prescription charges back into the practice’s coffers to be used
for the good of local collective health. In the same way, rural
parishes have the advantage of centuries-old charities into which,
again, some can discreetly feed benefits which they do not need, the
determination of need deriving, sensibly, from local personal
knowledge<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:31:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I hope that we can improve, is actual performance knowledge among

However, we do not, to my knowledge, have an equivalent of
<I>Which?</I> in the charitable arena. It would mesh in its
productivity component with Nesta’s estimate in the IPPR element
in the Library briefing that if productivity growth from 1995 to 2007
were or had been the same in the UK public sector as in the private
sector, the UK Government would be spending £63 billion less

there were a handful of parameters which variably put the weaker
councils in a minority from 10% to 30% in terms of their being able to
cope with the unexpected. Their evidence was the more helpful, in that
it effected comparisons between different categories of council. Since
I noted that unitary councils were only buoyant and afloat by 53% to
47%, the latter being the highest figure where anxiety was registered,
I must hope, as a Wiltshire resident, that we come in the former
grouping. That said, the fact that nine out of 10 councils are regarded

their staff the opportunity to do so. However, 31% of employees said
that they would be likely to give if the chance were afforded them,
which would increase charitable giving by £175 million. Nearly

one thing above all that we have achieved, which is where resilience

we have not had a revolution is that the Labour Party has been
democratic. We have believed in achieving our aims through democracy
and not through some form of uprising or revolution. In my own city of
Glasgow in 1919, there was a threat; people observed it as a threat and
the Government of the day thought that it was a threat, but it never
was—there was never a chance of there being a Russian revolution
in this country. We must be aware of that fact, but we must also be
aware that the world has changed very dramatically and we have helped
that change. We live in a world which is changing very fast indeed; it
has changed and will continue to do so. It is our job, in political
circles, to manage the change that is going on. It used to be when I

we do? We are talking about mending it, repairing it, changing it and
staying here. This building was built before the motor car was
invented, before television, before radio, before computers: it was
built for carriages and for a class society that no longer exists, I
hope. So why do we stay here? Who do we not build a brand new building
for the 21st century somewhere else, designed for the technological

importantly, we ought to look at how we carry out our democracy. The

mobile technology is part and parcel of their life. It is one reason,
only one, why our 
<?notus-xml column=792?>young people are put off the whole democratic process. They feel it has
nothing to do with them. They vote on “Strictly Come
Dancing” or “The X Factor” using their mobile
phones. I am not suggesting that that is how we proceed. I know well,

some form of ID, some form of smart card technology, to say,
“This is how you can vote, as long as you can prove who you are,

is a way to attract young people, a way of both stopping fraud in our
electoral system and expanding the numbers of those who are able to
vote. One would no longer be tied to going to a school. One would be
able to vote in a wide range of places. Eventually, one would be able
to vote in one’s own home and therefore the number of people who
would be able to vote in general elections should—and will, in
my view—increase quite considerably. It would also lead to a
greater respect for politics among the
young.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000289" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000289">I have
to ask both those on the Benches opposite and those on our own Benches
to accept that the compulsory introduction of some form of smart card
identification is going to be absolutely necessary in a modern world.
We cannot go on avoiding this issue. Someone once described it to me as
“a King Canute issue”, but I think that that is very
unfair on King Canute as he said that it will have to come back. At
some point we will have to have some form of identification, not just
for electoral purposes, but it will be essential for the poor and those
whom we represent in the Labour movement. All of us carry some form of
ID: our parliamentary pass, our bank card, our passport, whatever it
might be. It is the poor who lose out all the time from not having some
form of identification which recognises them—through their
social security or whatever it might be. We need to have some form of
ID card compulsorily introduced, and I hope that our Labour Party will
have that as part of its manifesto in
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000290">I turn
lastly to the issue of education. I accept that my own experience is in
a different education system, in Scotland, but I have a general point.
It is absurd that in this day and age, when nearly all the
world’s knowledge, philosophy and ideas are available on my
tablet—here it is—or one even smaller than this, that we
have a Secretary of State and a Government talking about returning to
the basic principles of numeracy and literacy, sitting children in
school, learning by rote. What sort of world is he living in? It is
absurd. We ought to be ensuring that every child has access to
learning, teaching them or showing them how to
learn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000291">I would
not dream of going to the library and looking up a fact. If I want a
fact I look it up on this tablet. If I want to know what a philosopher
thought, I look it up on this. I do not go running to a library or
expect a teacher to have to tell me; I want to learn. Therefore our
basic philosophy in education should be that education is about
learning; literacy, numeracy and the other things are tools by which
people learn. If they become redundant, as the wringer in the
wash-house has become redundant, as all sort of tools have become
redundant, then so be it.</hs_para>

Why is this not being made more readily available to our children so
that they, too, can get this benefit in full? Many of them do; they are
the middle-class children, the children of those of us who know how to
manipulate and use the electronic systems. We must look to turn our

children being able to use electronic devices to learn from, rather

Kirkwood of Kirkhope (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great
pleasure to follow my good friend the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, who made
a very powerful speech. He has convinced me of most of his ideas just
by bullying me incessantly on every occasion we meet, but he has not
yet convinced me about identity cards. However, the debate can
continue. I am also grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, who is a
wise parliamentarian. I have followed his career and, if he thinks that
this is an important subject, that is good enough for me. His
experience in government puts him in a very good position to take an
overview and we owe him a debt for the way he introduced his debate. I
confess that I share his sense of frustration and urgency and I hope
that this debate will start bringing some much needed focus to this
very important
subject.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000295" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000295">To
lighten his reading load a little, I suggest something for him apart
from reading his erudite philosopher. I picked up a very interesting
book by an American professor, Tim Morton, entitled <I>Hyperobjects:
Philosophy and Ecology After the End of the World</I>. It is about
ignoring knowns, and he makes a very important point. He describes
“hyperobjects”, some of which the noble Lord, Lord
Rooker, certainly identified. I have not finished it yet, so I do not
know if there is a happy ending, but I would recommend it to colleagues

suddenly became interested in the subject in autumn last year, when the
Grangemouth Ineos dispute took place. Noble Lords will remember that it
was a pretty tense moment north of the border. There was a lot of trade
union and party-political infighting, and it had a resolution that was,
thankfully, reasonably sensible. I was astonished to find that one
company was in control of 85% of the petrol distribution in Scotland, a
private company with some quite headstrong, controversial directors,
who were making personal decisions. I think that it was all part of the
war game. I am not completely naive; I think that there was quite a lot
of tic-tac going on in the press to gain advantage in the dispute with
the trade union. Some 800 jobs were at risk, and that is a very serious
blow. But I was completely surprised to learn that North Sea oil could
effectively be closed down for swathes of the northern part of the
United Kingdom, simply because of the local difficulties of an
individual commercial company.</hs_para>

made me think that we need to think more carefully and deeply about how
fast society is changing. The noble Lord, Lord Maxton, is right about
that. The rate of change that we have in this country is often
underestimated, and we do not think about it carefully enough. In
particular, I am concerned about the long-time effect of ageing; it is
good, because we are all going to live to 120, and I am making plans.
But the resilience of us individually, physically, will change society
really dramatically, not only in the dependency ratio in terms of
creation of wealth to pay for pensions but the ability to be able to
contribute to your local community. I have lived in the same village
for 30 years; I used to play football with my neighbours, but we now
have book clubs and meet for interest evenings. Intellectually,
everybody is as sharp as a
knife<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:52:13"></hs_TimeCode>, but we
all have new knees or shoulders, or whatever—and God bless the
National Health Service, which provides these things. But with the best
will in the world, if something dramatic and untoward happened, the
physical ability that we had when I first came to live where I do has
gone. That is a really significant change, which we have not bottomed
out
yet<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:52:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000298">On
top of climate change and the global integration of society,
specialisation is the order of the day and you all know a little bit
about the life you live but everything else is done by everyone else,
so if a bit of it goes wrong, the resilience of the system fails. The
rate of change is something that we must be concerned about in the
course of this

does not handle this particularly well. That is a statement of the
obvious, but the timeframe is too long for normal party politics. I am
in favour of party politics; I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Maxton,
by the way, that we need to invest some money in party politics. My 32
year-old son has raised exactly that question about the pencil cross
once every five years as being absolutely useless in terms of what he
wants to contribute. He is right about that. But the political system
considers capital expenditure as an easy target; if there is ever any
pressure on any budget, the first thing that goes is capital
expenditure—and nobody cares, because they do not really know
about it. I am getting much more concerned about the effect of
continually salami-slicing long-term plans; you do not see it from
month to month or from year to year, but over the distance, you
suddenly find that 85% of the petrol distribution in Scotland is in the
hands of one man. The political process needs to waken up to
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:54:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000300">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>
is also a bad thing that it is so cross-departmental. The noble Lord,
Lord Rooker, has had experience of many departments, and he is in a
very good position to have an overview of this. The Civil Service is
still in silos, and society does not live in silos as much as it used
to. The Cabinet Office does its best, and it gets high marks for doing
the important work that it is doing with big data, and trying to stay
abreast of technological issues. But somebody needs to give me
confidence that in central government there is somebody like the noble
Lord, Lord Rooker—there may be a job for him—who stands
back and can say, “In 15 or 20 years’ time we
will be thinking of whatever it is”. We have the expertise here;
we have the Meteorological Office, for example, which is a world expert
at looking at climate change as it affects the weather. We need to 
<?notus-xml column=795?>think about how the political process deals with this long-term problem,

Cabinet Office is the place where this whole issue is brigaded. It
would help me if it could try to co-ordinate across departmental
budgets the resources that are in play here. I do not blame Owen
Paterson, the Secretary of State, for getting slightly blindsided about
what was actually being spent on flooding, because some of it is
private and some of it is public. It is an easy thing to do. But I have
no sense of what is happening in the pockets of the other departmental
budgets, which are dealing with long-term planning for resilience,
climate change and the rest, and I do not know if the figure exists. I
am well aware of the national risk register, which I remind noble Lords
was drawn up in 2008. I know that it has been updated since then, but
2008 was a different world in the context of how we live these days. So
I have a plea to my noble friend on the Front Bench, if he can do it
today. It would certainly make me sleep more easily in my bed at night

applying to resources. I am talking not just of financial resources but
of the capacity of experts and the scientists in the labs. What is the
global spend across central government that
deals<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:57:22"></hs_TimeCode> with this

policy prima facie looks okay. I have looked at some of the

However, on the resources issue, how much operational weight is there
behind policy? The consultation that was conducted in Scotland found
favour with most of the respondents, but people did not actually
believe that the money was behind the policy to make it work in the way

untoward, unexpected environmental crises. There is what is happening
with cloud computing and the extra services that are available that are
internet-based, and the mobile nature of devices. If you have an
internet connection, you can speak to anybody in the world at any time,

importantly in the context of this debate, social media give people the
capacity to interconnect in a way that we have never known before. We

We will all have Google Glass, and go around wearing specs with cameras

they will be able to stream that to Hong Kong. No doubt there are
people in Hong Kong who would like to know what he is looking at. I am

Ridley (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble
Lord, Lord Rooker, on this debate, and on the ingenuity with which he
and others have stretched the description to cover all sorts of
subjects. It is turning into a bit of a Rorschach test, whereby we can
all read our own preferences into the shape of the topic of the debate.
I have not followed the good example set by the noble Lord, Lord
Brooke, of looking “resilience” up in the dictionary; I
wish I had. I was 
<?notus-xml column=797?>thinking of that word as meaning a combination of adaptation and
sustainability—in other words, the extent to which we can adapt
sustainably to changes that are likely to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:03:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000310">Over
the past three centuries, the UK has probably been one of the most
resilient countries on the planet—economically, socially,
politically, militarily, scientifically and intellectually. We have
been written off again and again, yet we have bounced back rather well.
Indeed, yesterday’s unemployment figures suggest that we are
bouncing back relatively well at the moment, although admittedly that
is in a much shorter-term
context<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000311">Why
is that? Essentially, it is because of two factors about this country.
One is trade; the other is innovation. The fact that we have been
connected to the world means that we have been interdependent on the
world and we have had mutual support from the world, in various ways,
over many centuries. That point was made by the noble Lord, Lord
Kirkwood. History teaches that reliance on trade, far from making
countries more vulnerable, actually reduces risk and increases
resilience. A good example of that is world trade in food, which means
that a bad harvest, such as we had last year, does not result in
famine, or even in hunger, because we are able to adjust through the
price mechanism throughout the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:04:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000312" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000312">In
the 1690s, there was a series of bad harvests in France and 15% of the
entire population starved to death, despite a famous victory in which
Jean Bart managed to recapture a convoy of 120 grain ships from Norway
that had been captured by the Dutch—even that was not enough to
prevent mass starvation. There was no such mass starvation in this
country, just 25 short miles away. In those days, there was
not enough trade to equalise the supply of food around the
world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:05:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000313">Resilience
means getting access to products, services and ideas wherever they are
invented. That is what world trade does for us—and, conversely,
it also gets markets for our own ideas, services and products. It is no
accident that countries that cut themselves off from trade suffer
terrible shortages and famines. We only have to look at North Korea for
a contemporary
example<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:05:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Another
point that I want to make, which relates to something that the noble
Lord, Lord Rooker, said, is that resilience also includes not borrowing

yesterday where the problems of crop protection were
discussed. The wet summer of 2012 was much talked about, where an
explosion of fungi and slugs devastated much of the wheat and rape
crops—I once again declare an interest as the owner of a ruined
harvest in that summer. The chemicals that farmers use to fight these
pests and other forms of invasions are getting less and less effective.
Resistance is growing rapidly. There is nothing particularly surprising
about that; it has happened ever since we developed crop protection
systems and is a perennial problem not only in conventional farming but
in organic farming. However, today the pipeline of new products is
drying up, which was the concern of the speaker yesterday. Innovation
in crop protection is failing, and that is making us less resilient. We
will face another wet summer at some point when fungicides will not
work well enough and the crop will be badly
damaged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000322">Why
is this happening? One of the big reasons is because innovators have
their hands tied behind their back. The European Commission is causing
the withdrawal of about 25% of the currently available active
agrochemicals, largely through using really rather feeble excuses about
the hazards that those chemicals have. This is causing farmers to go
back to older and less effective agrochemicals, and to lose more crop.
At the same time safer, more effective and more organic alternatives,
such as genetic modification, are being deliberately and directly
prevented. I am sorry to sound so uncharacteristically pessimistic.
Normally, I am an optimist but I am encouraged because the noble
Baroness, Lady Worthington, tells me that she will be optimistic today,

principle is behind a lot of these problems because, as presently
interpreted, particularly in Brussels and Whitehall, it counts the
risks of innovation but not the risks of not innovating. Funnily
enough, this point was made in the previous debate by the noble Lord,
Lord Giddens. He said that not taking a risk is also a risk, which was
kind of Rumsfeldian in its pithiness. So globally, we must embrace
change in this country if we are to be resilient. The least resilient
and most dangerous thing we can do is to stop innovating and leave it
to others. The world is a dynamic place: as the philosopher Heraclitus
said, you cannot step in the same river twice as nothing endures but
change. That is true even if the river comes through your front door.

That same solar storm led to a transformer failure in New Jersey and
200 less severe incidents across the United States. Effects like that
happen on average every seven years, in line with sunspot activity,
with much larger impacts resulting from more occasional massive solar

this Government’s callous treatment of those who rely on the

able to go from research and the fundamental principles of discovery
into commercialisation and help to build a business around it? It is
clear that graphene can be put to use in a number of different

higher living standards now mean that we are living longer, as the

and a number of noble Lords have alluded to the fact that
interconnectedness can help to strengthen us and make us more
resilient. Far from bowing to the scepticism and scaremongering about
immigration, we must celebrate and praise the resilience that it has

be a crucial issue. I think we will find that health and social care
are incredibly difficult topics. Of course, one method of helping to
alleviate the burden on the public purse is to spend more on
prevention. More needs to be done in looking at some of the commonplace
diseases that perhaps do not grab the headlines as much, such as
diabetes, heart disease and obesity. People with these chronic
illnesses and diseases can be helped through better education and early
intervention. A refocusing on prevention in our national healthcare

of our population must be brought forward together. Inequality is a
real problem but the answer, as my noble friend Lord Rooker said, is
not water cannons. There must be a much more sophisticated response
than that. We must address the fact that poverty is now found among
those in work as well as those out of work. I believe that the

closely at how we raise finance for public spending, there are a few
trends which I think this Government and all Governments need to think
about. One, in particular, is that we rely quite 
<?notus-xml column=810?>heavily on income based on fossil fuel taxation. Fuel levies make up 5%
of the revenue but the consumption of fuels is falling as vehicles
become more efficient, and North Sea revenues are also falling as
production declines. The question is: what will replace that as a
source of income? The noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, mentioned shale gas,
the impact that it has had in the US and how it has created a challenge
for Europe as a whole. I do not dispute that but it is not yet clear
that shale gas can deliver the same kind of revolution here as the US
has experienced or on what scale. There is also a great need to ensure

balanced approach: shale gas if it can be extracted safely and
affordably and carbon capture and storage, a technology which could add
value to and reinvestment in the North Sea infrastructure, extending
the economic lifetime of that investment and enabling us to return to

resilience if a higher proportion of our energy came from home
production rather than imported fuels. CCS is underexploited and given
too low a priority by this Government. I wish we could see as much
enthusiasm about CCS as we do about shale gas from our Ministers and

to, there are now technologies which are revolutionising everything.
From education to transport to you name it, a coming technology will
change how we do things currently. For example, smart homes: there are
now devices that you can put on your mobile phone which communicate
with your house so that when you are approaching your home it tells the
central heating to switch on and get it nice and warm ready for your
arrival. You do not need to do anything: it is simply based on reading
where you are using your mobile phone. With LED lighting, huge
efficiencies over the current lighting systems are possible. Every
local authority in the country should be investing in it, not only to
reduce their electricity bills but to improve the quality of services
that they offer. Smart LED lighting can adjust to the levels needed
automatically and can spread the provision of lighting to help increase

government money is going in than has previously been the case and it
appears that government plans for the future are a little
short-sighted. I am informed that the Government’s Flood Re

a result of climate change. We can debate climate change and where we

more evaporation, more precipitation and sea-level rise. Many factors

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, some debates are more
difficult to sum up than others, but this one is simply impossible. Let
me start by thanking the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and
Leeds for everything he has done as a Member of this House and for the
many contributions he has made. I hope that he will not be losing touch
with his diocese entirely, which I know well, having walked across
substantial parts of it, and having canvassed in such different areas
as the Gipton and Harehills estates in Leeds and the Duchy estate in
Harrogate—to take two extreme ends of the social spectrum. Only
those who have walked over the Yorkshire Dales know quite how
extraordinary are the boundaries between the different 
<?notus-xml column=812?>dioceses of West and North Yorkshire: Bradford, Wakefield, Leeds and
Ripon. I know that the retirement of the right reverend Prelate is
partly an adjustment of the boundaries of those dioceses, which will
relate more to the 21st century than to the early 20th century when
they were drawn
up<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:01:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:01:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the Government’s response to issues of resilience. I
stress that it is not just about this Government’s response
because we have inherited a lot from our predecessors. I hope that we
have improved upon it, although as has been said, we are all conscious
that Governments tend to think about the period between now and the
next election. However, good government apparatus needs always to think
about the long term. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat of the Cabinet
Office, with the horizon-scanning that various members of the Cabinet
Office undertake, always tries to look 15, 20 and 30 years ahead. That

came into office, I was struck by the list in the national security
strategy—a document produced mainly by the Ministry of
Defence—of what were thought to be the major threats to Britain.
What was most striking was how few of the threats identified were
primarily military. The first was international terrorism affecting the
UK, with hostile attacks against UK cyberspace listed as the second of
the really serious threats. It cited a major accident or natural hazard
such as flooding affecting three or more regions or an influenza
pandemic as the third threat, and an international crisis between other
states which might draw in the UK and its allies, as well as non-state
actors, as the fourth.
Under<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:02:01"></hs_TimeCode> tier 2
were listed the risk of major instability, insurgency or civil war
overseas that might create a surge of terrorists or asylum seekers, a
significant increase in the level of organised crime affecting the UK,
and severe disruption to information received, transmitted or collected
by satellite either as the result of deliberate attack by another state
or through the impact of space weather.
So<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:02:01"></hs_TimeCode> the
Government do try to think ahead, but the idea that any Government
could ever be entirely coherent in their response to every possible
contingency is asking for the moon, and possibly even for the sun as
well. As I struggle to come to terms with the many different things
that the Cabinet Office does, and which I find I am responsible for
reporting on to this House, I have to say that this Government are

UK policy on climate change has to contribute to European and global

unused hydropower available. I have just had to keep my head very low
in an argument within Saltaire village about whether or not you could
put in an Archimedean screw on our weir, which we are now doing, which
will provide a small amount of local hydropower. There are about 100
other weirs on the River Aire and if one were to harness all those
weirs that we used to use in the 18th and 19th centuries for power in
Yorkshire, we would provide a small additional contribution to
renewable energy from land-based fresh water, which incidentally would

deals and getting people back into local engagement are part of the way
in which we have to improve social and political resilience. I disagree
with the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, on the extent to which charities
should be as dependent on government funding as many became in the 13
years of the Labour Government. I have occasionally been shocked in
Yorkshire by just how intensely overdependent some charities are on
government funding. It is an unnatural dependence. That is a question

many ways, civil<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>
society more broadly has become too passive in Britain. I am a fan of
the big society partly because it says, “Government cannot do
everything for you. You have to help to do some of these things
yourselves”. I remember the shock that my wife and I had when,
during a very heavy snow storm some winters ago, one of the many young
people who have stayed in our house in London over the
years—because it is too large for us and we are away at the
weekends—said, “Why haven’t they cleared the
paths?”. We both turned on him and said, “Why
haven’t you cleared the paths?”. This is part of the
problem that we have across too much of our society. We need to get
people back into the sense that they share in citizenship and in their
local and national community. I will flag up a number of government
programmes which help with that. The national citizenship service
scheme pilots, as they still remain, have done a very encouraging
amount to show to some young people from the deprived sectors of our
society that they can, and would be happy to, help and work with others
in building local community initiatives. I have also watched the
arrival of the apprenticeship programme and have seen in Leeds and
Bradford the extent to which young people who thought they were never
going to work, have got themselves back into work and are finding that
it is an enormously valued part of their life within the
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000399" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000399">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T16:12:35"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Maxton, remarked how we have a coherent and cohesive
society and have never had a revolution. As he spoke, I thought of what
my 
<?notus-xml column=815?>father told me many times. When he was a sergeant in the Gordon
Highlanders in 1919 during the miners’ strike and was sent off
with a platoon to guard a Nottinghamshire mine, he was sure that the
Sherwood Foresters were probably there guarding a mine in the Scottish
lowlands—I think we got pretty close to it in 1919. The question
of social cohesion and social resilience is one which we cannot neglect
in Britain at present. A topic for another debate would certainly be

plain. That is part of the reason why we need the Thames barrier. Their

I may end by saying that government can never anticipate all risks.
When the great fire at Buncefield went up some years ago, my wife
reminded me of a conversation that we had had with the head of the
international energy programme at Chatham House when we both worked
there in the mid-1980s. He had said, “I’m not terribly
worried about civil nuclear problems; what I’m really worried
about is what would happen if one of those oil distribution depots went
up”. We had not a clue what he meant by it at the time, and
probably very few people even in government were thinking about the
potential for that. That was the largest fire in Europe since the
Second World War, and a major national emergency that I suspect that we
had not entirely prepared for. One of the problems that government
faces is how much you insure against risks which would be severe but
which are not terribly likely, and how far you insure against smaller

Rooker:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank everybody who participated in
the debate. I will make two points incredibly briefly. First, when the
Minister read out the list of things that he looked at when he came
into office, I was reminded of the 1931 essay by Churchill 
<?notus-xml column=817?>that I quoted from, “Fifty Years Hence”. It is almost a
modern-day version of that essay. Secondly, I will give him a new risk
that I did not raise before, one that comes out of something said by
the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley. I was at the launch last week by the
Crop Protection Association—which he mentioned—of a new
campaign against illegal pesticides. The association estimates that
currently between 7% and 10% of pesticides entering Europe are illegal
and that most of them start off in China. We could be more damaged by
those because they could poison our land if misused. That is another
risk to be going on with that needs to be added to the list. I thank
everyone for participating in the debate. It has been exactly as
intended—wide-ranging, in the sense that my noble friend Lord
Touhig
said.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14012368000805" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000805">Motion

two reports are unusual for a third reason. Reports from your
Lordships’ EU Select Committee are often based on legislative
proposals or communications from the Commission but in this case we
inquired into 
<?notus-xml column=818?>a decision to be taken by our own Government: whether or not to trigger
before 31 May 2014 the block opt-out from the pre-Lisbon justice and
home affairs measures, provided for in Protocol 36 of the Lisbon
treaty. Article 10 of Protocol 36 to the EU treaties, which was added
by the Lisbon treaty, enables the Government to decide whether the UK
should continue to be bound by the approximately 130 police and
criminal justice measures adopted before the treaty of Lisbon entered
into force or exercise their right to opt out of them all. If the
Government do not opt out, these measures would become subject to the
jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the
enforcement powers of the European Commission on 1 December 2014 in
relation to the UK, as they will to all other member states. If the
opt-out is exercised, all the measures would cease to apply to the UK
and it would have to negotiate to seek to rejoin any measures where it
wanted to do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000415" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000415">Some words
about process: it has been clear from the start that the 31 May 2014
final deadline for triggering the block opt-out left far too little
time before the cut-off date of 1 December 2014, when any opt-out would
become effective, to negotiate with the Commission and Council the
necessary decisions to permit the UK to rejoin any of the measures it
wished to, especially since the upcoming European Parliament elections
and changeover in personnel at the top of the European institutions
could complicate matters. Therefore, we have no criticism of the
Government for moving well ahead of the 31 May 2014 deadline; indeed,
we believe they should, if anything, have moved sooner than they did to
allow an adequate period for what will necessarily be complex and
substantive negotiations. Time alone will show whether we were right to
be concerned at the slowness with which the Government reached a view.
Nor did we, or any of the many witnesses from whom we took evidence,
question the Government’s unfettered right to trigger the
opt-out, a right which was accepted by all the other member states when
they ratified the Lisbon treaty. However, that, I am afraid, is as far
as harmony on process
goes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000416" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000416">During
the first half of 2012, both Houses were assured by Ministers in the
most unambiguous and unequivocal terms that before any decision was
taken on triggering the opt-out, there would be extensive consultations
with the relevant committees in both Houses, yet the Prime Minister
announced the decision in—of all places—Rio de Janeiro,
rather than in Parliament, on 28 September 2012, at a time when,
seemingly, no consultation had taken place at all. There had been no
consultation with the committees of either House; no consultation with
the Ministers of devolved Administrations, two of which—those in
Edinburgh and Belfast—are responsible for separate, independent
legal jurisdictions; and no consultation with the law enforcement
agencies and the professional bodies which would be directly affected
by any opt-out.</hs_para>

improve after the Home Secretary finally informed Parliament of the
Government’s “current thinking” by a letter and
Statement in October 2012. Explanatory Memorandums were promised in
November 2012 but did not finally appear until June 2013. An impact
assessment somehow went missing in action and has still not been
provided. No indication 
<?notus-xml column=819?>was given by the time of our first report in April 2013 as to which
measures the Government would seek to rejoin if they triggered the
block opt-out, and when that information was provided and the list of
35 measures was revealed in July 2013, Parliament was given
a few days only before being asked to approve the triggering of the
opt-out. The Government response to our April 2013 report arrived a
month beyond the two-month deadline for such a response and actually on
the day this House was being asked to vote on the opt-out. It is, I
fear, a sorry saga of disrespect for Parliament which speaks for
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000418" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000418">I will
not weary the House with too much detail from our first report but will
focus on six broad conclusions that we reached. First, we asked all our
witnesses whether they had any evidence that any single one of the
pre-Lisbon measures which fell within the scope of Protocol 36 had
actually been detrimental to the UK. Generally our witnesses—and
they included those such as Dominic Raab MP, who not only wanted the
Government to trigger the block opt-out but wanted them to withdraw
from those post-Lisbon measures to which the UK had already opted
in—were not able to identify a single measure that had damaged
this country. Some of the measures have had no practical impact because
the UK was already applying their provisions under our domestic law;
some were defunct and therefore irrelevant to the whole exercise; and
many had been of positive benefit to the UK, not least by strengthening
the fight against serious international crime. So it was clear that the
only matter at issue with respect to the pre-Lisbon measures was
whether the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the
enforcement powers of the Commission should be extended to cover them
from 1 December 2014 as the treaty
provides.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000419" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000419">Secondly,
it became apparent from our inquiry that the Government, quite rightly
in our view, had no objection of principle to the extension of the
European Court of Justice’s jurisdiction and the
Commission’s enforcement powers to other aspects of justice and
home affairs legislation. How otherwise can one construe the fact that
the Government have opted in to a substantial number of post-Lisbon
measures—49 at the last count and mounting—which
automatically involve the extension to cover them of that jurisdiction
and power? As the Home Secretary told us, the Government’s
approach was a pragmatic one based on their assessment of the national
interest. We applauded
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000420" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000420">Thirdly,
we considered carefully whether the existence of EU competence in the
field of justice and home affairs—this is an area of shared
competence—in some way undermined or weakened the system of
common law as practised in this country. We heard some assertions to
that effect, but no evidence was given to us to substantiate those
assertions. Indeed, to the contrary, we heard a great deal of evidence
on the benefits, most particularly from the professional bodies that
might have been expected to be most vigilant in that respect. It is, of
course, a simple fact that there are four member states with elements
of common law in their systems in the European Union: Cyprus, Malta,
Ireland and the UK.</hs_para>

full consideration to suggestions that, even if the UK triggered the
block opt-out and did not seek to rejoin, for example, the European
arrest warrant, our national interests could be secured in other ways,
by relying on Council of Europe instruments or on bilateral agreements
for co-operation with other member states. Our conclusion was that such
bilateral systems, even if other member states were prepared to
negotiate them, which is far from certain, would be slower, more costly
and a less sure protection for our citizens than they have under
existing EU legislation; and that the Council of Europe instruments
would be no equivalent substitute for that
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000422">Fifthly,
we looked more carefully than the Government initially seem to have
done into what I would call the Irish dimension: the massively improved
law enforcement co-operation that now prevails between the Republic and
Northern Ireland. While the Irish Government did not wish to give
evidence to our inquiry, we heard quite enough from other sources to
convince us that that the improved co-operation and the
de-politicisation of law enforcement activity on both sides of the
border depends largely on the underpinning of EU legislation. Remove
that underpinning—and here the European arrest warrant is of
central importance—and one would risk the unravelling of
structures of co-operation which have done so much to improve the daily
lives of our fellow citizens in Northern
Ireland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000423">These
five conclusions led us to our sixth and overarching conclusion that
the Government had not made a convincing case in favour of their
preferred option to trigger the block opt-out and to seek to rejoin a
limited number of pre-Lisbon measures. That sixth conclusion has
subsequently been overtaken by the decision of both Houses to endorse
triggering the block opt-out, but it remains the view of the two
sub-committees and of the EU Select Committee
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000424" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000424">Our
second report, for which the Government specifically asked in the
Motion that was agreed on 23 July, did not seek to reopen that debate,
but rather to focus on the situation following the Government’s
notification to the Council on 24 July triggering the block opt-out.
Here, too, I will spare the House too much detail and focus on a few
salient points. First, we carefully reviewed the 35 pre-Lisbon measures
which the Government had stated an intention of rejoining and which
this House, unlike the other place, had explicitly endorsed on 23 July.
We concluded that the Government had indeed picked out most of the
measures that it was essential for the UK, in its own national
interest, to seek to rejoin. However, we identified a small number of
additional measures, beyond the Government’s 35, which we
believed it was in the UK’s national interest to rejoin; and we
urged the Government to add these to their list when they sat down to
negotiate with the Commission. These included a number of implementing
Europol measures which we believed would be judged by the Commission to
be necessary to rejoin on coherence grounds, a view with which we had
sympathy. However, we also identified the European probation order, the
European judicial network and the convention on driving
disqualifications which we believed it was in the UK’s national
interest to rejoin; and the framework decision on racism and
xenophobia, withdrawal from which we believed would do the UK 
<?notus-xml column=821?>considerable reputational damage, even if our domestic laws were there
to give effect to its provisions. I can just imagine President Putin or
the Chinese Government rubbing our noses in that
withdrawal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000425" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000425">Turning
back again to process, we underlined the importance of the Government
giving Parliament regular progress reports on the negotiations, by now,
I assume, under way with the Commission and the Council; and of their
providing a full and detailed impact assessment in good time before
they seek the further vote in both Houses which it is their stated
intention to hold on the final package of measures that the UK will
rejoin. We expressed yet again the concerns that time is short between
now and 1 December 2014 to complete the negotiations for rejoining the
pre-Lisbon measures identified, which might necessitate putting in
place robust transitional measures to bridge any gaps. This would be
particularly important in the case of the European arrest warrant,
where any hiatus could lead to extensive litigation and perhaps to
suspected criminals escaping
justice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000426" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000426">The
Government’s response to this second report was full, detailed
and on time— just. It arrived on the day it was due; on this
occasion, sufficiently well in advance of today’s debate for it
to be properly considered. For that, credit should be given, but I have
to say that much of its content was deeply disappointing and it did not
seem to give a seriously considered reaction to the very modest list of
additional measures that we suggested should be included among those
the UK should seek to rejoin, and which our committees believed that it
would be in the national interest to do. The repeated assurance of some
negotiating flexibility over the Europol implementing measures is
welcome, but they should surely have been on this list from the outset.
The explicit recognition that a future Government might well wish to
rejoin the European probation order leaves us wondering why we are
planning to drop out of it
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000427" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000427">It is
good, of course, that the Government have at last recognised that there
could be some reputational damage following our withdrawal from the
racism and xenophobia decision. No doubt there will be. Only time will
tell whether it will be, to use the Government’s word,
“significant”. Why incur such damage at all when the
reason for doing so appears to be the rather far-fetched fear that the
UK might be put under pressure to criminalise Holocaust denial? The
reasons given for not rejoining the European judicial network are so
threadbare as to be almost laughable, and on the Convention on Driving
Disqualifications, it appears that we are going down the road of
negotiating bilaterally with the Irish a provision that will replicate
the EU measure while ditching all the practical benefits we get from
the EU measure vis-à-vis the other 26 member states. Would it
not have been an awful lot simpler and certainly more cost-effective
simply to seek to rejoin the EU Convention on Driving
Disqualifications?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000428" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000428">All
in all, I fear that it is hard to resist the conclusion that the
Government’s approach to calculating the national interest on
these measures is purely arithmetical one and not based on the merits
of the measures in question. That is why it is to be hoped that, as the
negotiations with the Commission and the Council 
<?notus-xml column=822?>proceed, the Government will think again about their possible inclusion.
It is also a reason to take more seriously than the Government
currently do our recommendation that there should be a commitment to
review the effect of the block opt-out some years—three,
perhaps—after it comes into
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000429" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000429">I

tell the House whether the negotiations started and, if so, when? Will
he say when the next progress report to Parliament will be made and
give an undertaking to provide the promised impact assessment early

a case under the previous Government involving Mr Liam Byrne, who took
over a year to reply to one of our letters. The then Leader of the

rebuke on the Floor of your Lordships’ House. I have been a

find out what was going on. We found almost immediately afterwards that
the Government had agreed the text, but we still had not had a reply to
our letter of a year earlier. When the noble Lord came to give evidence
to the committee, on 21 November last year, it seemed to the

to ministerial control over departments, “Have you ever heard of
Sir Thomas Dugdale?” He said that he had. Your Lordships will
remember that Sir Thomas was the Minister of Agriculture in the other

the outcome of the Government’s negotiations on rejoining

promised as long ago as November 2012, which is 14 months ago, and the
Explanatory Memoranda published last July do not fulfil that

extending the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the European
Union to the 130 measures to which the opt-out applies. We think that
the Government’s fears are misplaced. It is highly unlikely that
the 130 measures were drafted without thought as to this jurisdiction,
as the Government say, given 11 member states had agreed that their
courts could make preliminary references to the Court of Justice for
the interpretation of European Union police and criminal justice
measures from
1999.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000444" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000444">Of
course, there will be cases from time to time where the Government will
disagree with the judgments of any court of any jurisdiction. However,
we do well to remember that courts act as guardians for us all and the
Court of Justice ensures the common interpretation of European Union
law throughout the Union and prevents backsliding from their
obligations by member states. The United Kingdom has nothing to fear
from an extension of the court’s jurisdiction to these police
and criminal justice measures. It would otherwise hardly seek to rejoin
even 35 of
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000445" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000445">Unfortunately,
although the Government are saying that the reports were helpful in
informing their decision on the issues, I echo a remark of my colleague
on the justice sub-committee, my noble friend Lord Rowlands, that it
appeared to be something of “a dialogue of the deaf”.
However, the issue of whether to opt in is now 
<?notus-xml column=826?>water under the bridge, following the Government’s notification
of their decision to opt out in July of last year. We now have to focus
on the implications of having opted out of the 130 measures
concerned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000446" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000446">We
considered the Government’s list of 35 measures that they wish
to rejoin. They are set out in Appendix 4 to our second
report. These measures contain the most significance in the interests
of the UK and other member states. I am pleased that the Government
will seek to rejoin them, in particular the legislation on the European
arrest warrant and on Eurojust, both of which are particularly
interesting and important given evidence to our committees in the
recent past about the growing Europeanisation of crime. However, that
does not mean that the others have no significance—only that the
35 are the irreducible minimum. They may yet turn out not to be the
practical minimum. The Government must convince the Commission, in
particular, that the set of measures that we rejoin is one that, as
Protocol 36 requires, does not seriously affect the practical
operability of the measures and respects their coherence.</hs_para>

matters. Our second report considers this issue and suggests that some
other measures may have to be added to the list of 35. I ask the
Minister to tell us what the Commission have said on the coherence of
the 35. Do the Government envisage adding to the list for reasons of
coherence? It is vital that the decision on which measures to rejoin
takes account of the national interest, including the national interest
in rejoining a coherent set of operable measures. As our second report
says, we hope and expect the Government to respond flexibly to
adjustments that the Commission may propose to the list of measures
that they wish to rejoin. There should be no place for a numbers game

national interest is not confined to considerations of practical
effectiveness, as the Government seem to believe. Of course legislation
is about substance, but our approach to European Union legislation also
makes signals of our intent. Opting out risks signalling to our
European partners a lack of engagement on the part of the United
Kingdom in the application of standards, the operation of
investigations and prosecutions and the safeguarding of
citizens’ rights in the field of policing and criminal
justice—as important for our citizens when they visit the other
countries of the European Union as it is for their citizens when they
visit the United Kingdom. No matter how good our own standards are in,

the Government are successful in obtaining agreement to our rejoining

measures may be
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000450" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000450">One
gap is already apparent: measures for obtaining evidence in
cross-border cases will be greatly improved by the directive, to be
adopted very soon, establishing a single system for obtaining evidence
in cross-border cases, through a European investigation order. We
should remind ourselves of some high-profile cross-border 
<?notus-xml column=827?>cases that have been very much in the public mind in the past few years.
Three years will be allowed for member states to implement the
directive into national law, so the new system may not be fully
effective throughout the European Union until 2017. However, on 1
December this year, the UK will cease to participate in the current EU
convention on mutual assistance because we have opted out of it. The
Government say that this will not make much difference because there
are other available measures. Perhaps so; we shall see. But this
example illustrates how gaps may appear despite what I acknowledge may
be good
intentions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000451" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0002.htm#14012368000451">Finally,
the Government—this or another—may wish to revisit the
question of whether to rejoin other measures in light of future
developments. There is no time limit in Protocol 36 on opting back in,
as the Government have acknowledged in their response to our second
report. All the more important, therefore, is the last recommendation
in our second report that there should be an ex-post review of the
impact of opting out, in the same spirit as we support post-legislative
scrutiny. I hope that the Minister will give this a more favourable
reception than that given in the formal response to the

Sharkey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Hannay, on his incisive and analytical opening speech. It is a
privilege to serve under his chairmanship on your Lordships’ EU
Sub-Committee F. I do not intend to dwell on the rather convoluted
chronology of these two reports and the Government’s responses
to them. I intend to focus my remarks on the second, rather than the

with the first report and the Government’s response to it, I
simply remark that its conclusion that the Government had made no
compelling case for opting out still seems very strong. The
Government’s given reasons for opting out still seem
unconvincing. I also note that the Government have been less than
punctilious in their dealings with the House over the first report. In
particular, I point to the extraordinary delay in producing the
explanatory memoranda, and the fact that the Government’s
response was produced one month late, and only hours before the debate
on the government opt-out/opt back in Motion. The debate on that Motion
on 23 July produced a kind of clarity. As I said in that debate, I
thought that the Government’s selection of 35 items to opt back
into was well chosen and coherent. I still think that that is the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:03:01"></hs_TimeCode>, just as I
still think that whole exercise was completely
unnecessary<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:03:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government have chosen, for the moment, not to opt back into are all
harmless, and some are of real value to the UK. As the noble Lord, Lord
Hannay, said, the Government have presented no case that any of these
items operates against our interest or does any damage. However, we are
where we are, and I want to address the remainder of my remarks chiefly
to the government response to the committee’s second

to focus on some of the measures that we recommended be added to the
Government’s list of 35 opt-ins. There are four of 
<?notus-xml column=828?>these, which have already been mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay,
and other speakers. The first is the framework decision on combating
certain forms of expressions of racism and xenophobia by means of
criminal law. The UK has long been a leader in this area. Failing to
opt back in would abandon that leadership and would send out a
completely wrong signal about our commitment in this area. The
Government’s reasons for not opting back in, put simply, amount
to, “I’m all right, Jack”, with no real
acknowledgment of loss of leadership and reputation.</hs_para>

the rejoining of the European judicial network. Everybody except the

Government continue to decline to opt back in. Their reasons are to do
with the implementation, and with allowing the ECJ to have

irrational fear of the

fourth measure is the convention on driving disqualifications. This
enables member states essentially to prevent a driver banned in one
member state from driving in another. As the Government acknowledged,
our report contains strong evidence of the importance of this measure
in supporting co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. However, that
is apart from its clear, common-sense benefits in a more general way.
Instead of rejoining the measure, the Government propose to establish a
separate bilateral treaty with the Republic of Ireland. This is surely
a very odd way to go about things when there is a perfectly
satisfactory mechanism already on the table.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, who has spoken so clearly on these
matters. When I put my name down to speak in this debate I knew that I
must look back at what I said the last time we debated these matters,
to ensure that I do not say something different on this occasion. I
find that on 9 July 2013 I asked whether there was not an unjustified
risk in opting out of what is good, which is the 35 measures, in order
to get rid of the 95 pre-Lisbon measures, most of which are of no real

have heard—above all, from the noble Baroness, Lady

noble work that they do and have done since our last debate on our

is a great comfort to the rest of us while we get on with other things,
all of which are much less important than what we are discussing today,
to feel that they are looking after these matters on our behalf. Having
said that—and I really mean it—the only remaining service
that I can usefully perform today is to draw attention to those matters
in which I have the closest interest, on which the committee seems to
have made out a strong case and in respect of which the

that we will opt in to the existing European Council decision on
Europol, but I can see no good reason for not opting in now to the new

Government is that they want to wait to see the completed text in case
there is something that they do not like. That might be a good answer
if we were talking about some non-proven field but it is not a good

only answer given by the Home Secretary for not accepting this

me, this is no time for being inward-looking and thinking that these 28

populism and being rightly in touch with public opinion? I associate
myself with the big and uncertain question: where are we going? Are 28
disparate European countries to call for the end of the nation state? I
think not. Will the 
<?notus-xml column=832?>world benefit from an inflexible European bloc? There must be doubts
about that. We need, I think, a brand of political leadership of which
there is no sign at
present.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_23_PT_1/E91837B5F2290E0369D069F182FA95EA89D311B3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 January 2014">Thursday,

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a matter the
importance of which goes far beyond the individual sub-committees which
have been concerned with these reports, so without any hesitation I
feel it right to intervene in this particular debate. I am particularly
glad to be here today because I heard in the speech of the noble Lord,
Lord Hannay, what I think was the most devastating account of bad
government that I have heard in all my 27 years of service in this
place and in the other Chamber. I realise that those 27 years only just
pass the halfway point of the career of the noble Lord, Lord
Jopling.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012368000480" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000480">This
is an occasion when the Government would be well advised to listen to
what is being said about them. I am sure that the Minister will have
listened because I know him very well and he is the sort of person who
believes strongly in listening to Parliament and that it is essential
for Ministers to do that carefully. I also think I know him well enough
to know that he is more than capable when necessary of speaking
extremely frankly and effectively in private to his ministerial
colleagues. He may well feel the need to do that after this
afternoon’s debate. What has been quite extraordinary this
afternoon is the complete consensus among all speakers from all sides
of the House about the gravity of the situation that has been revealed
by the Select Committee’s reports.</hs_para>

anybody had any doubt about the Government’s lack of good
faith—I use that serious term advisedly—in this whole
matter or that the Government have never actually wanted to look at or
make a proper analysis of the national interest before reaching
decisions in this area, let me provide absolutely conclusive evidence.
The Government have been engaged in an exercise which has been widely
promoted as being a great attempt definitively to decide what is the
national interest in our relationship with the European Union: where we
should better do things on our own and where we can better achieve our
national objectives jointly by taking part in EU initiatives or by
becoming a party to EU directives. That is called a balance of
competences exercise and everybody in this House is extremely familiar
with it. The Government, knowing that this particular decision was
coming up, deliberately scheduled the examination of the criminal
justice and policing aspects of the balance of competences review to
start in spring 2014 and to come to an end only in 
<?notus-xml column=835?>the autumn of 2014—obviously far too late to influence decisions
about opting in and opting out over justice and home
affairs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000492" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000492">What<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>
an extraordinary thing to do. Is that because the Government thought
that the whole exercise was a waste of time? Is it because the
Government thought that it was not going to be a proper analysis of the
national interest and because it, too, was a farce? Or is it because
the Government thought that it would be a genuine analysis of the
national interest and that it might be embarrassing to have it come out
in time to influence a decision on opting in and opting out, because it
might well say, “Don’t bother to opt out. There is no
reason to opt out; it is not in the national interest to opt out;
you’re much better staying 100% in so that you have maximum
influence within the institutions and the decision-making
structures”? Or is it because it was completely irrelevant and
the Government were not interested in the national interest? I feel
that that is the only conclusion that we can rationally come to in this
House today. All the Government were interested in doing was buying off
their Eurosceptics. This has been a party political issue for the
Government from day one—100% party political. All they have been
concerned about is the minimum price to get the Eurosceptics off their
back and how much national interest had to be sacrificed in order to
satisfy them. That is what it has been about, and it is about time that
somebody honestly faced the facts and was prepared to say

During many debates that I have listened to in your Lordships’

the right approach to negotiation, facilitation, and concern to mediate

important to note that no national police sovereignty is ceded to
Europol. The role of Europol is purely supportive. Its effectiveness
centres round its database, to which the UK is the largest contributor.
Of its many successes in cross-border operations, Mr
Wainwright cited Operation Rescue over two years, which involved 32
national police forces in breaking up an internet child abuse crime
resulting in over 100 arrests. Another measure of its
success is the number of states outside the European Union queuing up
to join Europol, including the United States. A particular feature of
the Europol set-up is the establishment of national liaison offices
within its headquarters, staffed by police officers from each
particular member state. Most importantly, it is run on a very lean
budget of 0.8% of the total EU
budget.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000504" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000504">As I
have said, the Government have made the decision to opt in to Europol.
However, at our first meeting with Mr Wainwright in January
2013—that is, before the Home Secretary’s
announcement—both Sub-Committees E and F, because it was a joint
meeting, were left in no doubt of the adverse consequences there would
have been for the UK had we not opted in. Denial of automatic access to
the database would have been a huge handicap involving costly and
time-consuming negotiations between the UK, the union and other parties
to establish some form of substitute relationship, and it is reasonable
to assume that crime prevention with a cross-border element would have
been severely affected in the United Kingdom. Of course, none of this
will now be necessary so, so far, I have little to criticise the
Minister on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000505" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000505">I

fuller part in negotiations over a new Europol structure. The

is, therefore, extremely disappointing that we are debating these two
reports so late in the process, when substantive decisions have more or

the course of our initial inquiry, it was notable that the extensive
evidence we took was so overwhelmingly in one direction; that is,
opposed to opt-out. The most compelling evidence came from
practitioners. As something of a newcomer to the Select Committee, I
began to wonder whether the whole thing was necessary. I knew the
Government had the right to look at it, but I began to wonder whether,
before making the announcement, they should have consulted and saved
themselves a great deal of unnecessary work and the unnecessary anxiety
that has been caused.</hs_para>

evidence came from practitioners. At a seminar organised by the EU
Select Committee, Helen Malcolm QC, vice-chair of the Bar
Council’s EU law committee and chair of its criminal law
sub-committee, said that, as a lawyer and not a politician, she
considered it remarkable that every witness with experience in the

Government’s response to the two reports. They agree with the
conclusion of our first report that cross-border co-operation between
the UK and other member states on police and criminal justice 
<?notus-xml column=839?>matters is crucial. Furthermore, the Command Paper published in July
2013 assessed none of the measures as being harmful to UK interests or
having any negative impact on fundamental
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000512" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000512">The
Lord Chancellor and the Home Secretary say that the decision to rejoin
35 measures is based on what law enforcement agencies tell them works,
balanced against the Government’s principled concerns about
excessive European influence in these areas. A close examination of the
reasons why the Government do not intend to opt into some measures,
however, shows that concerns about excessive European influence are a
dominant factor, rather than the views of the practitioners and the
importance of the cross-border co-operation.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:50:35"></hs_TimeCode> grounds on
which the Government have made the selection of measures not to join
are not necessarily based on evidence or persuasively argued. In some
instances, their approach is inconsistent. In the words of the Lord
Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, they are
“philosophical”, and not based on evidence one way or the
other.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14012368000513" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000513">This
inconsistent approach is clear in the case of Court of Justice of the
European Union. Despite expressing concerns about the potentially
negative impact of extending the jurisdiction of the CJEU over the
measures, the Government have opted into most post-Lisbon police and
criminal justice measures, thus bringing with them the jurisdiction of
the CJEU. During our initial inquiry, we considered this matter in some
depth. We concluded that the CJEU, which has jurisdiction only over
matters of EU law, had an important role to play, alongside domestic
courts, in safeguarding fundamental rights and upholding the rule of
law. CJEU jurisdiction was welcomed by many witnesses as being helpful
in ensuring the consistent application and interpretation of police and
criminal justice measures, and this is accepted by the
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000514" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000514">The
Government cite the prospect of unexpected judgements, concerns about
the drafting of measures, and minimising the possibility of an adverse
judgment as reasons for not accepting the full jurisdiction. Any court
is liable to make unexpected judgments. Citing poor drafting of
measures as a reason for not joining is not convincing, given the
rigorous process of negotiation to which these measures were subject
and the fact that they were supported by the Government at the time of
their
adoption.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000515" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000515">With
regard to minimum standards in criminal law matters, it appears that
the Government regard participation in such measures as unnecessary, in
the sense that the UK could continue to act in such a way as to fulfil
the requirements of each measure even if it did not formally
participate in it. This argument does not take into account the fact
that any future Government could repeal decisions that made the UK
compliant with the current minimum standards. The Lord Chancellor sees
these measures as “the Europeanisation of” legal
“decision-making” and underplays their practical
significance.</hs_para>

Europol<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:52:54"></hs_TimeCode> said
that the minimum-standard measures act to level the playing field for
practitioners and eliminate arbitrary differences between
jurisdictions. Europol also said that UK’s withdrawal from these

<?notus-xml column=840?>measures would remove legal certainty and create a perception among law
enforcement practitioners and criminals that the UK is outside the zone
of co-operation—co-operation which the Government see as
crucial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000517" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000517">In
the long run, opting out of these measures would also affect the
UK’s ability to influence and participate in law enforcement
co-operation. It would diminish the UK’s position and
reputation, particularly in areas where it has been a leader. One such
measure, which has already been mentioned, is the framework decision on
xenophobia and racism. The UK is a world leader in this area and
deserves a great deal of credit for its commitment to, and strategy
for, tackling racism and xenophobia. We have set a standard, and
withdrawal from these measures will send a negative signal, not least
to the minority communities in this country, and will inhibit our
ability to influence other member states. I therefore urge the
Government to review their decision not to join this
measure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000518" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000518">On
the European Judicial Network, the Government are again at odds with
the view of practitioners. The Government say that the European
Judicial Network adds little or no value and state that while they
believe that the ideas underpinning the network have merit, they do not
consider that the network is a measure that underpins practical
co-operation. Practitioners argue the contrary. The Law Society of
England and Wales and the Law Society of Scotland say that the
Government should seek to join this measure as it could help to address
the lack of training and awareness of legal practitioners regarding
police and criminal justice measures. This view was supported by the
Bar Council and the Lord
Advocate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000519" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000519">We
were told that the network provides Scottish prosecutors with a rich
source of advice on national law in other member states and is a
valuable tool in the armoury of prosecutors. It is the practical
co-operation that is valued by practitioners and the Government should
pay heed to that. The Government’s reasons for not joining the
European probation order also deserve comment. They say they support
the principle behind this measure but do not consider that its benefits
outweigh its risks. They say that no evidence has been put forward that
outweighs their concerns. The Government’s concern that
offenders might not be properly supervised by other countries and that
there might be complications should their possible return to the UK
arise, can be resolved, as we stated in our report, at European level.
Furthermore, the Government have not dealt with the point put forward
by the Law Society of England and Wales and the Law Society of Scotland
that joining this measure could prove a useful alternative to a
European arrest warrant being issued for a sentence imposed in default,
thus reducing the potential number of European arrest warrants
issued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000520" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000520">In the
evidence that we heard, we were also told that this measure would be
helpful to offender management and public safety, between Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland in particular, and that because
there was no meaningful consultation, the unique relationship between
the two states has been ignored. This deserves further consideration.
Finally, I hope that the Government will take note of the points 
<?notus-xml column=841?>made in our report about coherence, transitional arrangements,
negotiating process and future engagement with Parliament, as well as
the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, and the noble

roles in chairing the sub-committees. Although this is the first
opportunity for a formal debate on the initial report, we have used
that document to inform other debates on this issue. It has been

often it seems to me that debates on anything to do with Europe become
pro/anti debates without any real regard for some of the very serious
issues involved. That must be very frustrating to many people who may
not themselves be intensely political but who want to know and
understand what the debate is about. I feel that many politicians would
do far better to deal in fact rather than just try to persuade others
of their own point of view. These reports clearly fulfil that function
of trying to deal purely in facts. They provide a forensic and
comprehensive examination of the Government’s decision to opt
out of all pre-Lisbon police and criminal justice measures and then
seek—and “seek” is the operative word, since there
are no guarantees—to opt back in to those that they consider to
be
essential.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012368000523" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012368000523">These
are not decisions to be taken lightly. A Government’s first duty
is to the security and safety of their citizens and, as the noble Lord,
Lord Blair, and others make very clear, that security and safety is
best served by European co-operation. The Government have to accept
that the process of opting out and then, perhaps, opting back in again
to some measures is a risk. I share the concerns that the
Government’s whole approach to this issue has been more
political than practical. No evidence has every been presented of any
harm to the UK from not exercising the permanent opt-out, but a great
deal of harm is possible from any failure and delay in opting back in
to the 35 or more measures in the analysis given by the committee. It
seems to me, as has been said by other noble Lords, that it has had a
lot more to do with placating the anti-European lobby inside and
outside the Conservative Party. We have had the absurdity of the
numbers game between the two government parties about how many measures
should be opted back into. Surely, it has to be about the substance and
value of the measures, not how
many<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T17:59:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The first

the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, I also looked at previous
debates, not so that I would not say something different but to make
sure that I was not 
<?notus-xml column=842?>repeating myself. However, I will repeat myself in this case, as in
previous years I have asked different Ministers the same questions but
never had a satisfactory answer. Those questions are: how many of the
measures that the Government want to permanently opt out of are
relevant to the UK? How many are currently being used? I should add,
how many are in any way harmful to the UK? If I can get an answer to
those today, it would be extremely useful. What I am trying to get to,
in an easily understood format, is what the precise impact would be on
UK citizens of the measures that the Government want to permanently opt
out of. The Government themselves claim that a number of the measures
are defunct, so have no impact. So was this ever a serious exercise, or
was it always political posturing on

want to turn to some of the detail of the follow-up report and the
specific measures referred to. As the report reminds us, your
Lordships’ House previously endorsed the 35 measures that the
Government will seek to rejoin as being in the national interest, and
the 
<?notus-xml column=843?>report welcomes the other opt-ins announced by the Government. Perhaps
the most significant and the greatest debate in your
Lordships’ House is on the European arrest warrant. We found it
inconceivable that the Government wanted to opt out, and I have
previously provided examples of cases in your Lordships’ House
where it had been invaluable. In a previous debate, I was also critical
of the Government’s refusal to implement the European
supervision order, which ironically had caused some of the problems
about which the Government complained in the European arrest warrant.

consider the Government's proposed reforms, as the Government have now
recognised that reform is the way forward and are not just dismissing
the EAW as worthless. We also welcome that the Government have now

shall now turn briefly to other areas in which the committee
recommended an opt-in. Its argument in each of those areas is that
there is a case for saying that the national interest would be best
served if the UK were covered by the measures. Clearly, the Government
do not accept those arguments, and I would find it helpful if the
Minister could expand on the reasons why they support a permanent
opt-out from those measures, particularly as there is a recurring
theme—from the committee, from noble Lords who have spoken in

opting back in, specifically referring to their view that it would help
address lack of training and awareness. The network was supported by
the Lord Advocate as frequently being used to seek assistance with
overseas European arrest warrants. I would welcome a response from the
Minister on this subject, because I am not clear whether the Government
are saying that it is not valuable, or that the points are being fully
addressed in other ways. I would like some clarification of why the

with another country? It is of interest to hear the detailed arguments

regulations, penalties and offences between the two jurisdictions. I
welcome the fact that the Government are committed to introducing

important for that border but not for those between other European

necessity, this debate has been a great deal about process and
technical detail and someone listening to it from outside might think
that it was confusing. However, I wish to conclude by making a couple
of remarks about the wider picture here. The internationalisation of
crime is proceeding apace, and nowhere more so than in Europe. We may
not have a perfect single market but the criminals have a single market
from which they are not hesitating to benefit. We need, therefore, a
far greater degree of international co-operation than we have ever had
in the past. The legislation we have been discussing on which the
Government have triggered the opt-out, the 133 measures, was not
designed by a mad group of federalists in 
<?notus-xml column=851?>Brussels: it was designed by the Justice and Home Affairs Ministers of
the member states and every single one of them was agreed by unanimity.
We must get away from the mindset which says, “This is imposed
on us by Brussels and we should get out of it if we possibly can and if
it is not going to be too costly to do so”. That is not a good
mindset<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T18:36:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012378000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-0003.htm#14012378000038">The
hard fact is that the security of this country neither begins nor ends
at the water’s edge any more: it goes far wider than that. The
justice and home affairs part of the European Union’s activities
is of great value to this country, and it is likely to be of even
greater value if we do not wreck it in the process of this tricky
negotiation which we have now undertaken. It is an odd negotiation
because, in all my years of dealing with the European Union, it is the
first time a British Government have deliberately put themselves at a
disadvantage and then asked to get back into many things.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T18:37:23"></hs_TimeCode> is a fairly
odd state of affairs for which, as I said in my opening statement on a
personal basis, I do not entirely blame the present Government, who had
that mechanism foisted on them by the previous Government.</hs_para>

whatever it was, it is an uphill task. I end with the following. I am
sure that all noble Lords wish the Minister and his colleagues the best
chance of success in the negotiations they are undertaking. I was
shocked to hear that six months after the Prime Minister
notified the other member states of our decision to opt out of these
measures, we still had not begun negotiation. We have all been around
long enough to know what exploratory talks mean—and they do not
mean negotiation. I hope the noble Lord and his colleagues will shortly
come to the House and tell us that we have begun
negotiation. Six months out of the 16 available
have now passed and they have not led to very much.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T18:38:31"></hs_TimeCode> wishes are
with the Government that they have success in this negotiation. It is
in none of our interests that they should be blocked or fail, but that
may require more political involvement and effort and energy than they
have shown so far. I beg to

Davies of Oldham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that the
Committee’s affairs will not be too protracted today, as we
clearly have a consensus from the House that the Bill is a pretty good
thing. As the Minister already knows, it is the Opposition’s
view that in general terms the Bill pursues a good policy and is vastly
superior to the sad instrument that was relied on for the first three
years of this Administration with regard to the holiday on
national insurance contributions—which of course failed dismally
in both its reach and its general effectiveness, with every conceivable
expectation that the Government expressed before that Bill became law
being disavowed by the process over the following three years. We are
now in the business of recognising that the principle behind the Bill
is far superior and is a position that we broadly endorse. However, it
is incumbent on us to ensure that the policy works effectively and that
the Bill that is the basis of that policy is fit for purpose in every
respect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:01:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

require the Government to carry out and publish a post-implementation
review of the employment allowance, including HMRC’s assessment
of its impact on jobs and wage levels, the overall take-up, the
geographical spread of businesses that take it up and the effectiveness
of HMRC’s strategy to promote it. I emphasise all these points
because on every single one of them the previous policy instrument on
NICs failed conclusively, and it is important that 
<?notus-xml column=350?>all those targets are effectively hit. That is why, although I am not
underestimating the difficulties of these demands in some areas, we
want to see an assessment, as far as the Government are able to provide
one, of job and wage levels as a result of the measure.</hs_para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:03:18"></hs_TimeCode> previous
Bill had a geographical element to it, which we the Opposition never
understood —but we did not have to understand it because
the Bill had such a limited impact for good anywhere that those who
were left out had missed very little indeed. For obvious reasons, as
the Minister will appreciate, we are concerned about significant
regional disparities in the employment figures, particularly with

the expectation is that the beneficiaries will be small and

businesses inevitably have a problem with legislation. Part of the
difficulty with the previous legislation was the conspicuous failure to
promote the concept widely enough for take-up to be at the level for
which people—certainly Ministers—had hoped. We want to
see that rectified as far as this measure is concerned. The amendment,
therefore, establishes the necessity for a report that would guarantee
a review to provide early indications of the success or otherwise of

three years before the previous amendment to the legislation on
national insurance contributions was finally written off as being
unsuccessful, which shows how slow the Government can be, and how blunt
their antennae, in picking up the responses of people who are meant to

Government outlined in the Commons the complexity of some of these
issues, but we think it is worth trying to measure the impact of this
measure on employment and wages. It seems sensible at least to consider
the relationship between the employment allowance and job and wage
levels. The Minister will recognise that we have seen the benefit of
some of the responses in the other place to this major proposition, but
I hope that he has had time to reflect, that his officials have

amendment focuses on the number of jobs created by the employment

the cost of taking on new staff for small businesses and charities, it
will be up to those businesses and charities to decide how they use the
resulting NICs savings. I remind the Committee of the comments made by
the Institute of Fiscal Studies and by the Federation of Small
Businesses at the evidence session in the House of Commons on 19
November last year, to the effect that it is impossible to get precise
numbers. We cannot conduct the equivalent of a randomised trial with
tax policy to determine the number of jobs created because of the
allowance. As the IFS pointed out, there are a number of factors in the
economy simultaneously influencing the number of
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000013">The

be created, although survey evidence from the FSB suggests that 28% of
small businesses will use the savings to employ additional staff. It
would not, therefore, be possible to provide information about the
number of jobs created as a direct result of this measure. Similarly
with wage levels, the same research from the FSB suggests that 29% of
small businesses would use the NICs savings to boost staff wages.
However, it would be difficult precisely to quantify that effect, given
that wage levels are subject to many different pressures, varying from
business to

new clause also requires an assessment of HMRC’s strategy to
promote the employment allowance. HMRC has already been proactive in
promoting the allowance, having spoken to various
stakeholders—including representatives of software providers,
charities and small and medium-sized enterprises—about the
design and operation of the measure. There is continuing engagement
between HMRC and those stakeholders on guidance for employers and
publicity. As a result of these discussions, communications to raise
awareness of the allowance will begin more widely in February and March
this year to maximise impact in the crucial period running up to the
introduction of the allowance in April, using a range of HMRC
publications and products and the department’s national network
of 
<?notus-xml column=352?>local Working Together groups. As a result, we are confident that
employers across the UK will be ready to claim the allowance in April.
These efforts will continue after April to support take-up from
companies that have not done so at that point.</hs_para>

crucial part of this work has been discussions with software

HMRC website and specified that an employment allowance indicator would
be needed on the employer payment summary. There is ongoing engagement

reassure the noble Lord that the difficulties that he is rightly
concerned about are likely to be minimised by the fact that the
allowance is very easy to claim. Employers will receive it through
their routine operation of PAYE. They will simply need to confirm their
eligibility via their regular payroll processes. Enabling the
employment allowance to be claimed by employers through their payroll
software will ensure that it is straightforward to claim. They will
simply have to indicate yes, once, in their employer payment summary.

improvements are up against a colossally difficult situation for young

adjustment to rejection. We recognise that the Bill represents a
contribution towards helping young people. We do not think that it is
bold enough. It does not go far enough to tackle the great problems
that we have with youth unemployment, but the situation will be greatly
improved if we can measure progress. That is what the amendment would

probing amendment. I have no intention of taking it further, but I am
asking the Minister to put on record as much as he can about the likely
positive impact of this proposal. He will appreciate that we are
concerned that many months will elapse before it starts to take effect.
As I enumerated in discussing an earlier amendment, the
Government’s record in this area is not good. They produced a
policy that we severely criticised at the time and thought was destined
to fail, but they seemed to take an inordinate amount of time to
recognise that its failure had occurred. That is why the Government are
in this position. On the national insurance contribution dimension to
employment issues, these were wasted years and there is not much time
left in the present Parliament for the Government to show real
achievement.</hs_para>

the other place about crucial issues, but we did not feel that we got
answers that totally satisfied us. On one question we got no answer at

that. It also raises the issue of how tight the timeframe is for
employers. I recognise that they will have to move with some dispatch
to take advantage of these proposals, but that is what the country is
expecting. In circumstances of youth unemployment being in such a
critical state, we are expecting employers and the Government to act
with dispatch, and
effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000036">Will
the Minister comment on an aspect that was emphasised in the other
place—namely, that we have to take care what demands we place on
IT systems as regards the ability of receiving bodies to get their

The Treasury ought to be light on its feet in these terms. If it is
slow, that may be occasioned by the number of disasters that have
befallen other departments in this context—for which I am sure
the Treasury disavows any responsibility. However, given that this
policy is urgently needed, it ought to recognise that responses which
blame the amount of time needed to get IT systems squared up look a
little—I will not use the word “evasive”, as it is
a pejorative term in the tax context, but they suggest that the
Treasury is trying to excuse a lack of drive at the centre. I hope that

like to explain to the noble Lord why I believe that the amendment is
unnecessary. The Government are committed to increasing employment
levels for all parts of the working-age population. Employment is now
at its highest ever level and unemployment is lower than when the
Government came to power. The Government recognise the challenges posed
by youth unemployment, and dealing with them has long been a priority
of ours and of the predecessor 
<?notus-xml column=357?>Government. For example, around 370,000 young people have been supported
through the Work Programme since June 2011. Furthermore, the Youth
Contract provides almost £1 billion in funding to support up to
500,000 young people into employment and education
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000039">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>
employment figures published yesterday showed another significant fall
in youth unemployment. Although it is not enough, it is not the first
quarter in which we have seen such a fall, and now the overall
aggregate of youth unemployment is falling significantly. As we have
already debated, it is extremely difficult to say what proportion of
the fall is attributable to one cause rather than another. However,
overall, the improved economic environment and the Government’s
policies taken together are clearly having a significant beneficial
effect on youth
unemployment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000040">The

I see little point in the Treasury publishing a review of the level of
youth unemployment. The Office for National Statistics is responsible
for publishing statistics on employment, and these regular releases are
available to the public through the ONS website. There is a limited
case for the Treasury intervening and also publishing a

addition, I do not think that there is any value in attempting to
estimate the impact of a policy introduced at a theoretical date, and I
am not sure that the noble Lord is pushing this element of the
amendment particularly hard. The Autumn Statement announced that
employer NICs would be abolished for those under 21 years of age from 6
April 2015. Attempting to deliver this a year earlier on 6 April 2014
would increase the administrative costs to business, and rushing the
measure through in this manner would be likely to lead to cost,
confusion and the failure of many employers to take it
up.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000042">Such a
tight timeframe would not give employers, payroll software developers

there would not be enough time to ensure that the policy was

the Government being complacent or lacking in energy and drive; it is
simply that I do not want to be at the Dispatch Box under the lash of
the noble Lord because the Government have not implemented a policy
with the maximum possible efficiency and effectiveness. The timetable
that we have adopted, in our view, will enable us to do it in due time,
so that employers and HMRC can prepare and, when the policy comes into
effect, it will be well prepared for by all who need to implement it.

its first year, it is expected that it will cost £465 million,
rising to £530 million by 2018. Although the policy obviously
carries a significant cost, overall, the Autumn Statement in which it
was introduced was fiscally neutral and reinforced the
Government’s commitment to reducing the deficit. It is worth
repeating that this policy represents half  a billion

employment—so it is very significant and, we  hope, will
have an equally significant impact on youth

grateful to the noble Lord for giving us those facts and am reassured
by them. On the question of delay, I sometimes think, on the issues
that we have raised with regard to the compatibility of IT operations,
that in the wonderful world in which we live, the magnificent speed
with which computers can bring huge advantages to society have to be
balanced against the fact that the introduction of legislation seems to
be tied up in a computed timescale which all pen-pushers would regard
as unacceptable. After all, what is the Minister saying to me? He is
saying, “We recognise that the present policy that we are
operating on the role that insurance contributions can make to improve
employment is a dead loss to the country. It has such marginal utility
that no one will weep for its passing”. But that policy has
dominated three years of this Government’s life, and he is
saying that its replacement will see the light of day virtually on the

course the Minister is right to say that proper consultation has to
take place, that we must not add to the burdens on business
unnecessarily and that computer systems are mightily complex and vastly
costly when they go wrong. The Government are in quite a good place to
assess the costs when computer systems go wrong, because they have a
few instances on their doorstep at present. However, the implication is
straightforward: the policy of using national insurance contributions
and elements of alleviation has failed for three years, and it will
make only a marginal impact over the duration of this
Government’s life. I beg leave to withdraw the

Davies of Oldham:</Member></B> My Lords, we have taken the strategy of
objecting to the clause because as a matter of principle we want to
discuss with the Minister what is going on. Of course, it is not that
we are objecting to the application of GAAR to this policy; we want to
address some issues with regard to tax avoidance. I must say that I
will make a note for any succeeding Labour Ministers whose path happens
to cross mine in the future that when we produce concepts that will be
abbreviated down to four letters, they might like to produce a somewhat
more attractive word than GAAR. Life is difficult enough. We do not
often speak the language of Shakespeare in the House, but to constantly
use initials that grate on the mind the moment they are introduced is a
misfortunate. However, it is GAAR that we will be talking about and
that is the word I shall use throughout my contribution. I like to
think that I am giving the Minister due notice that I shall think of
something more felicitous for the Government 15 months from
now—but that is probably wishful thinking on my ability rather
than a prediction about whether we will have a different Government in
15 months’
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000050">GAAR is
not an answer to all tax avoidance, as is freely recognised. In fact,
when looking at the returns thus far, we are all too well aware of how
little they measure up to the massive challenges presented by those who
seek to avoid tax with dextrous moves and huge resources. We know the
ability of multinational organisations to indicate, in any
administration that has an effective tax scheme, that very little of
their operation is ever tax-worthy and tax-liable. Of course, a great
deal of their activity is carried out in administrations that have
precious little in the way of ability to abstract tax from them. That
is to say nothing of the transfer of tax out of a significant country
in which they operate: for example, the UK, which is a very significant
market. The loss of tax revenue to any country is to be deplored when
the activities of these companies are so significant in this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000051">GAAR,
as it stands, is so narrowly defined that the number of occasions on
which it can be usefully deployed is obviously limited. The scale of
the concept that the Government are working on at present is ludicrous
in relation to closing the tax gap that we have all exemplified and
identified. It will not go anywhere near closing the tax gap of any one
multinational whose figures have come to light in recent years, let
alone the totality of the position. We want to prevent that kind of
abuse being extended. There is no doubt that the public reaction to
those who avoid tax in an extensive and often blatant way is to regard
it as utterly
unacceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000052">The
GAAR is in danger of becoming a bit of a fig leaf for the Government in
that, when a difficult issue about tax abuse and avoidance is raised,
reference can be made to the GAAR and everything will be resolved.
However, the figures utterly and totally belie that fact. That is why I
am asking the Minister to reassure the Committee that he will keep in
mind the effectiveness of the GAAR. A government scheme for closing
down tax avoidance should do more to close a tax gap than they suggest

action might be possible. That is another way of getting to the next
general election without answering a significant question about a
feature of legislation. We thought that the response in the other place
was wholly unsatisfactory. I know that the Minister will make strenuous

tax rose last year. The much-vaunted agreement with Switzerland
produced an absolutely minute amount in comparison with what the
Chancellor had indicated. I say a “minute amount”

Indeed, they did not, they did not do anything in this area. The fact
that the noble Lord finds this inadequate is slightly sad, given their
failure to act in this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:50:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000060">The
noble Lord raised a number of points of failure, as it were, but one of
them was in respect of the agreement with Switzerland. The agreement
with Switzerland has not brought in as much as was expected, but the
Exchequer has received almost £800 million via that agreement.
That is £800 million that we would not have had, £800
million that the previous Government showed no inclination to pursue.
That is only one of a large number of measures that we have taken to
ensure that people and companies who are avoiding or evading tax do not
get away with it. In terms of personal taxation, the Lichtenstein
disclosure facility has yielded a lot more than was ever envisaged and,
along with the Swiss agreement, is part of driving down the ability of
those with large resources to avoid
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T14:52:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000061">The
new automatic information sharing agreements, which have followed the
FATCA legislation in the United States, are revolutionising the ability

British nationals, whether those are held in the Channel Islands or
some Caribbean tax havens. Along with the Swiss and Lichtenstein
démarche, that will make a big difference to our ability to get
the money to which the Government are entitled. On companies, as the
noble Lord knows, the work being done in the OECD, particularly on
base-erosion and profit-shifting, is aimed to deal with the

HMRC published, <I>Levelling the Tax Playing Field</I>, alongside
Budget 2013 to provide an update on the strategy and to set out the

argued that because GAAR is tightly focused, it will not hit many of
the targets and almost gives a green light to other forms of tax
avoidance, but if you look at the whole raft of measures that we have
taken in Budgets and Finance Bills—most recently, some
announcements in the Autumn Statement—it becomes apparent that
we have taken measures to protect several billion pounds of Exchequer

one I can summarise briefly. I could read out what the Delegated Powers
and Regulatory Reform Committee said, but that may detain us unduly.
The Minister knows of its concerns about the legislation, and we share
those concern. The committee is concerned about retrospectivity and
whether there are two concepts relating to two different dates. It is
concerned about regulations under new Section 4AA in existing
Section 4B of the 1992 Act. It indicates that it recognises
the value of the retrospective position but it is having
difficulty squaring it with Section 4B(5), which appears to constitute
retrospection going back for a very long time to December
2004.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000074">I have
no doubt that the Minister and his department have been much exercised
about this, because the committee drew this to the attention of the
House. It would be remiss of me if I did not give him the chance to
respond to what is an analytical piece of work on its part, which I
cannot hope to match. I know that the Minister has been busy in this
respect and I apologise if I have not been able to assimilate all the
responses. I am sure that I have given him a clear enough steer for him
to indicate why the Government are either secure about the framing of
the Bill, or if not, will take steps to effect an amendment that we

Razzall:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord has proposed that
Clauses 13 and 14 should not stand part of the Bill. The clauses relate
to tax avoidance and the abuse of limited liability partnerships. The
Minister will be aware that there is concern among professional
organisations, particularly the Law Society—not in relation to
the Bill itself, but about what will happen in relation to the
regulations that will be brought forward. Noble Lords will have
received a briefing from the Law Society, because limited liability
partnerships were introduced some time ago for professional
partnerships, not primarily for tax purposes but to limit the liability
of what were previously general partnerships to actions for negligence.
That was the major driver for the creation of limited liability
partnerships. Most significant law firms and firms of accountants now
operate as limited liability partnerships, so there is clearly concern
among them that the definitions of employees and partners should be
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000076">I
received representations from the Law Society this morning, but the
basic thesis is that the consultation exercise to determine how a
limited liability partner should be properly treated as a partner, or
how they should be treated as an employee, was based on the 
<?notus-xml column=364?>wrong assumptions. The consultation went out on certain
assumptions and the proposals on the implementation of the regulations,
which I have not seen, change that basis. Therefore, the consultation
itself is
ineffective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:04:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000077">I
appreciate that this does not go to Clauses 13 and 14 of the Bill,
because they simply provide for the regulations to be brought in.
However, between now and Third Reading the Government ought to respond,
saying either that the Law Society in its representations is wrong, and
why, or alternatively explain how they propose to deal with what I
suspect the Law Society is asking for, which is further consultation
before the regulations are brought in. I do not know which of the two
is correct and I have not had time to form my own opinion on that. This
is an important issue because the limited liability partnerships are
important structural mechanisms for professional partnerships. We
clearly need to get this right before we change the law in this
respect<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:05:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000078"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="14012362000122" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000122">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to both noble Lords for
their contributions to the debate. I apologise to the noble Lord, Lord
Davies, for the fact that he has only just received the letter. As he
pointed out and knows very well, it has been a somewhat unusual week in
terms of my ordered conduct of business and the letter was sitting on
my desk for rather longer than it should have been. It is only fair to
point out that this is no failure on the part of officials to respond
in a timely manner; it is my failure. I am sorry that the noble Lord

points have been raised. The second was raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Razzall, with regard to consultation. He asked whether the legislation
had gone beyond the proposals set out in the consultation document. The
Government believe that it does not go further than
originally proposed or go beyond the original policy
intention. In fact, as a result of the consideration of the
consultation responses, the Government dropped the first of the
original two conditions which were broadly in line with the employment
status tests, which would have meant that even senior partners in major
professional firms might have been reclassified as
employees<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:06:38"></hs_TimeCode>. The
second condition, which contains ownership or economic interest or risk
tests, has been slightly broadened because of this change, but it is
still a narrower measure than if both conditions had been implemented
as originally proposed. The Government also made clear in Budget 2013
and in the consultation document that the proposals will apply to
higher-paid staff in the professional services sector and the lower
paid if they are LLP members who receive a largely fixed reward and
carry little economic risk or
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-23T15:07:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14012362000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140123-gc0001.htm#14012362000080">As
regards the status of the secondary legislation and the issue of
retrospectivity, the noble Lord referred to two sets of secondary
legislation. The first, in Clause 13, had already been published in
draft and the second, in Clause 14, was, I believe, enclosed
with the letter to the noble Lord and has been put in the

have this Bill before us. 
<?notus-xml column=365?>The relevant identical provisions relating to income tax will be in the
Finance Bill, which will be introduced later in the year and will
become the Finance Act 2014. The intention is that the provisions in

am told that the use of the earlier date in the primary legislation
follows precedent in respect of other pieces of legislation and does
not mean that the Government will introduce this measure going back a
decade or, indeed, going back at all. There are technical arguments for
putting that earlier date in the legislation, but the secondary
legislation, as I said, makes it absolutely clear that the provisions
will come into force from this coming April. Therefore, there is no
question of an undue degree of retrospection. I hope that the letter
which I sent to the noble Baroness, Lady Thomas of Winchester, set that
out clearly and, I hope, satisfies the committee and the noble

exercise on Report and at Third Reading. I think that I can go 97% of
the way to promising that, but this issue concerns the 3%. I cannot
