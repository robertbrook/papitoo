more green deal finance plans would have been taken out by this stage,

measures have been. There have now been more than 117,000
green deal assessments, and new research published this morning shows
that only 5% of people are not installing green deal measures as a
result. If people choose to pay for

climate change scientists are reluctant on this because the evidence
does not suggest that particular weather events are connected with
climate change, but the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change fifth

Government to agree with the Prime Minister. Shale gas is one of the
greener fossil fuels, and the hon. Lady certainly ought to support its
extraction rather than that of coal. We need to reduce our dependence
on volatile wholesale international prices for gas and oil, and we need
more home-grown energy here under our own

First, may I thank the Secretary of State and the Minister for their
kind words about our friend and colleague, Paul Goggins, whose funeral
takes place today? He was a regular contributor to these questions, and
he was as assiduous in standing up for his constituents in fuel poverty
as he was on so many other issues during his time in the House. As you
will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Don Valley (Caroline Flint) and my hon. Friend the Member for
Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds) are absent this morning, along
with many other Members, in order to attend the funeral mass. I know
that the whole House will join them in remembering Paul’s
tremendous record of public service, and in sending our deepest
condolences to his family and loved ones at this very sad
time.</hs_Para>

Fallon:</Member></B> The survey conducted by the Institute of Directors
estimated that more than 70,000 jobs could be created by the shale gas
industry. We are in the initial stages of the industry, and we expect
to have two to three years of exploration, so it is not possible at
this stage to make a firm forecast of the number of jobs, but that is
the Institute of Directors’ best estimate. In other countries
where shale gas has been successfully extracted, however, there have
been huge benefits to the economy and reductions in household and
business bills.</hs_Para>

Greatrex:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that reply, repeating
the figure that was used by the Prime Minister, by Tory central office
and by others earlier this week. Does the Minister understand that
addressing the legitimate environmental concerns about shale gas will
require the Government to be careful, proportionate and responsible
regarding what they say about a yet unrecovered energy source? In that
context, will he explain why neither he nor—as far as I am
aware—his Secretary of State has referred this morning to the
findings of the detailed strategic environmental assessment undertaken
by AMEC on behalf of his Department? Those findings put the likely
figure for full-time equivalent jobs at between 16,000 and 32,000
during peak construction in the next licensing
round.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Michael Fallon" PimsId="3183" UID="14011656000966" xid="195" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656000966">Michael

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Mr Edward
Davey):</Member></B><B> </B>We are very concerned about rising energy
bills, so we are helping consumers in three ways: with direct help with
money off their bills; with stronger competition; and through energy
efficiency programmes. Last month, we secured an agreement with the
energy companies for an average £50 cut off this year’s
bill, and I am pleased to tell the House that my Department’s
own work for greater competition for consumers will be enhanced
following the appointment of Clive Maxwell, the current chief executive
of the Office of Fair
Trading.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656000088"><B><Member ContinuationText="Paul Farrelly" PimsId="3191" UID="14011656000971" xid="196" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656000971">Paul
Farrelly:</Member></B> Frankly, the autumn statement was a great
disappointment. Will the Government accept that they could do far more
to help businesses and consumers who are facing crippling energy bills?
The limited changes to green taxes are far too little, too late. Bills
will still rise, and simply telling people to shop around is not a
proper answer.</hs_Para>

Davey:</Member></B> I have to disagree with the hon. Gentleman. People
are switching providers very effectively. In November last year, the
month after the price rises were announced, 614,000 people used the
benefits of the competition that we have enhanced to get better deals
and save hundreds of pounds. When it comes to records on bills, the
provisional 2013 gas and electricity figures have now been published
and we can make a comparison between this Government’s record
and that of the last Labour Government. Between 2000 and
2010—the last Parliament—gas bills rose by an average of
12% a year; in this Parliament, they have risen by an average of
6%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Glindon" PimsId="5558" UID="14011656000973" xid="1213" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656000973">Mrs
Glindon:</Member></B> A new report by the Children’s Society
says that about 5 million families are likely to turn down their
heating because they cannot afford it, and children will suffer because
their homes are simply too cold. Given that 3.6 million children last
year thought that their homes were too cold in winter, does the
Minister agree that it is now time for a price freeze to ensure that
parents can keep their children warm during the cold winter
months?</hs_Para>

Davey:</Member></B> No, I do not think it is time for a price freeze,
because I do not think that will help the children the hon. Lady is
talking about. We all know that Labour’s price freeze is a con
and the energy companies will shove up the bills after the price freeze
has ended. We want to give people permanent help, which is why the
£50 average cut to people’s energy bills is welcome. In
addition, we are ensuring that the warm home discount delivers
£135 off bills for the most vulnerable people. That is a good
record. We will be coming to the House later this year with our draft
fuel poverty strategy, because we want to do more for the most
vulnerable households in our society.</hs_Para>

that not only did he have nothing to eat, but he had no heating or
electricity at all in his

about, but the Government are as concerned as anybody about energy
prices, energy bills and the impact on people around our country. That
is why we have been hyperactive in this area; we have done far more
than the previous Government. I mentioned the comparisons we can now
make between energy bill rises under the previous Government and under
this one. As I said, gas bills went up twice as much under the previous
Government, but electricity bills increased by an average of 9% in the
previous Parliament whereas in this one they have increased by 4%. We
know that that still means bills are going up and we need to help
people, but Labour’s record in this area was

implemented now, with simpler and clearer bills, and fewer tariffs. We
are also working with the industry to reduce the time involved; I

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Mr Edward

competition in the wholesale energy market led by Ofgem, which we have
underpinned with new powers in the Energy Act 2013. First, Ofgem has
worked with the industry to increase the amount of electricity traded
in the “day ahead” market, with very encouraging
progress. Over the past 12 months, over 50% of electricity has been
sold on the day exchanges, compared with just 6% in 2010. Secondly,
Ofgem’s new reforms—most notably, the market maker
obligation—should be rolled out from 1 April 2014, which will
force the big six to publish prices and require them to buy and sell
electricity at those prices in the forward markets. That will increase
liquidity, transparency and
competition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656000132"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Robertson" PimsId="401" UID="14011656001015" xid="504" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0001.htm#14011656001015">John

power are getting 20% profit on generation, selling the electricity to
themselves and then selling it on to customers in retail and getting
anything between 4% and 6% profit. Surely that cannot be right. Is it

Friend will recall that when we came into office, under the previous
Government’s Building Schools for the Future programme no school
construction had started. It is the experience of many Members that
considerable reductions in costs and an acceleration in process have
been achieved under this Government through the new Priority School
Building programme. The Secretary of State recently announced that
260,000 schools places had already been created under this Government,
and additional substantial funding has been announced that I think
takes the funding over this four-year period to about two and a half to
three times what it was under the previous Government. All that is
positive news. We want to ensure that plans put in place are
cost-effective and achieved in as timely a fashion as possible, and I

least those captured in the OECD’s statistics on educational
attainment. Those statistics, which make comparisons between countries,
including England and Wales, show a worrying lack of attainment in
reading and mathematics in Wales, and it is important to deal with
that. In my view, this is not an intrinsic criticism of devolution, but
much more a criticism of the policies pursued by the devolved
Administration in Wales. We

the shadow Leader of the House. As soon as the Prime Minister was aware
of the issue, he took action and asked for a review, which is fair
enough, but it is not our practice to say that we are going to make a
statement until we are in possession of all the facts. It is reasonable

questions that there will be a strategic environmental assessment
through which we might be able to find out what the licences cover.
There is an important difference between the shallow fracking that
currently takes place and deep fracking, which will send shock waves

brought forward—and the right hon. Gentleman has already
announced the date on which we go into recess as 22 May,

our present relationship with the European Union and opposed to an EU

reduction of salt. This is not something we can unilaterally impose,

is unhelpful in this context; any consumption of tobacco is harmful,

Lansley:</Member></B> I think we all agree that it is important that
recorded crime statistics are as robust as they possibly can be. One of
the first things we did when we came into office was to transfer
responsibility to an independent Office for National Statistics. It is
doing its job, and that is a reflection of an important step that the
coalition Government took. The Home Secretary asked the inspectorate to
carry out an audit in June of the quality of crime recording in every
police force, and only last week she wrote to chief constables
emphasising that the police must ensure that crimes are recorded
accurately and honestly. It is worth noting that the separate and
wholly independent crime survey for England and Wales, endorsed again
yesterday by the ONS, also shows a more than 10% reduction in crime
over the same period from 2010. Crime now stands at its lowest level
since that survey began in 1981. The evidence is clear that police
reform is working and crime is falling.</hs_Para>

is clearly tremendous potential, previously unrealised, for pharmacy to
contribute to public health and prevention, taking the load off the
NHS, for example by dealing with minor injuries and medicines
management. There is every prospect that NHS England, through its
framework pharmacy contract, and clinical commissioning groups have a
tremendous incentive to use pharmacies, as do local authorities in
relation to some preventive measures. I hope that they will do that.
One of the blockages that he rightly refers to under the previous

Nationalist party and various coalition parties were proceeding with an

years in the wilderness or from the grievances expressed against the
previous Government. The Government led by the Awami League carried on
with an election but there was not full voter participation, to

non-participation by the leading opposition. There were all the similar

other Members with an active interest in the issue. The reason the
caretaker Government were introduced was that neither party trusted
each other. During the 2006 election, the then Opposition—the

collapse of the Rana Plaza and other infrastructure deficits associated
with the Tazreen fire and other garment factory fires and collapses. We
raised the issue with both leaders and with businesses, asking them
what their concerns were about the current unhappiness, debate and
instability surrounding the change from the caretaker
system—which, despite the fact that it was regularly disputed,
was understood—to the leap into a future without such a system.
People can have confidence in one system over another only if they
truly believe that a caretaker is neutral. I believe that towards the
end of the process, as the election loomed, Sheikh Hasina and the Awami
League suggested a move towards a version of a caretaker system with
Ministers from both sides, but it was not
accepted</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000331">This

do not believe that we should be giving them 30% of the aid. We should
give it to the charities and NGOs that are doing a great job and that

long-term interest in countries such as Bangladesh, not least because
of his interest in climate change but also because of his interest in
the economic development challenges that he rightly mentions. Britain
is one of the top investors in Bangladesh, and we have major

that investment at risk, as the all-party delegation found when we

highlighted today, the lack of stability and the lack of focus on
investment and on achieving the conditions needed for trade will
undermine economic and social development in Bangladesh. It is
scandalous and unforgiveable that those in positions of power, of
whichever political party, cannot put their differences behind them and
focus on the interests, both economic and social, of the country and
its people. All political leaders in Bangladesh must face up to that
responsibility. That is not about us wringing our hands. Everyone
understands that the history of Bangladesh is marred with bloodshed and
sacrifice across the political spectrum. The point is that that cycle
of violence must stop. Too many lives have been lost and too much is at
stake, not only for Bangladesh, but for all of Asia and the

However, the political dimension to the challenges facing Bangladesh
stand to undermine those achievements and the country’s

debate reflects the traditionally strong cultural, political, business
and diplomatic ties between Bangladesh and the UK. We are fellow
sovereign states within the Commonwealth, we are allies in the battle
against climate change, in the UN framework convention talks and
elsewhere, and there remains the strong relationship fostered by the
work of the British Government as part of their historic
achievement of spending 0.7% of national wealth on overseas development
assistance. The £238 million that DFID spent in Bangladesh in
2013-14 has had an enormous impact: 205,000 more births attended by
skilled carers who would not have been there otherwise; 295,000 women
giving birth more safely and with better care for their infants; 24
million people benefiting from better protection against floods,
cyclones and the impact of climate change, thanks to early-warning
systems; and millions benefiting from better water and sanitation. This
is a proud record and a demonstration of this country’s
commitment to the success of Bangladesh. I should also mention our
assistance with transparency and anti-corruption measures, supported by
the Bangladeshi Government, and championed by the previous
Secretary of State for International Development, the right hon. Member
for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell). It is right to pay particular
tribute to his commitment to getting value for money for the British

right to point out the contribution of the Bangladeshi community to
this country. About 500,000 people of Bangladeshi origin live in the
UK, employing millions and contributing massively to the British
economy and, in particular of course, contributing to British digestion
and cuisine. My constituency does not have a huge Bangladeshi
community, but its presence in the restaurant trade is still
significant. We have the Krori family’s Curry Corner, which rose
to national fame through Gordon Ramsay’s television programme;
we have Mohammed Rahman’s Spice Lodge, which was a national
finalist in the British curry awards and the Tiffin cup, organised in
this place; and we have Abdul Mannan’s Brasserie Group, which
owns 20 businesses in the Gloucestershire area, employing many people
and contributing massively to the local economy. Those people are
active members of the local area, supporting communities not only in
Cheltenham and Gloucestershire, but back home in
Bangladesh—remittances are an important part of the relationship
between the two countries. Mr Rahman contributes to primary education,
helping students to remain in education, while another constituent, Mr
Arosh Ali, has founded a charity to help the Nowder district, and only
recently, the wonderful new Koloshi restaurant hosted a fundraising
event for victims of the Rana Plaza disaster and advocacy for their
rights—another important aspect.</hs_Para>

education; reduced under-5 mortality; contained HIV infections through
access to antiretroviral drugs; reduced the prevalence of under-weight
children, which has nearly halved from a staggering 66% to 36.5%,
virtually meeting the 2015 target of 33%; seen increasing enrolment in
primary schools; reduced the infant mortality rate, and so on. Many
challenges remain—the incidence of poverty is still enormous;
hunger and poverty reduction, primary school completion and adult
literacy rates are still a challenge; and the creation of a decent wage
economy, particularly for women, is also an enormous
challenge—but much has been achieved.</hs_Para>

Members have rightly said, this progress will be threatened if a
fundamentally peaceful and democratic environment is put at risk. There
is no simple solution to this problem and no simple blame to be
attributed—I have been lobbied by constituents with views on all
sides of the debate between the political parties—but I am
afraid that the current election situation fits into a pattern of
distrust bred by worrying developments in Bangladeshi democracy. The
Foreign Office’s latest human rights report emphasises that
politics is still done in a violent and confrontational atmosphere, as
has been true for many years, as the hon. Member for St Albans said.
The situation has echoes of 2006. Human Rights Watch makes it clear
that the Awami League Government have many questions to answer, not
just about the controversial decision to abandon the system of
caretaker Governments during elections, but about press freedom and the
imprisonment of political opponents. The decision to suspend the system
of caretaker Governments at election time might have been technically
justified—after all, there is an independent electoral
commission in Bangladesh supported by the British Government—but
it clearly further undermined the confidence of civil society and
political parties that the elections could be conducted freely and
fairly.</hs_Para>

Bangladeshi Nationalist party and other opposition parties have to
tread carefully too. Boycotting elections, abandoning the democratic
high ground of participation and calling for the overthrow of elected
Governments is a dangerous path to tread. Opposition groups and
activists have clearly been involved in violence, and there have been
accusations, particularly against some of the most controversial
members of the opposition, including parties such as Jamaat-e-Islami,
of violence against Christian and Hindu minorities, which is
particularly concerning. However, hon. Members should avoid taking
sides too clearly. I spoke to a Bangladeshi constituent this morning
who said that the provision of a caretaker Government was no panacea
and not necessarily a solution, as the hon. Member for St Albans
pointed out. In a lovely phrase, he said that the two ladies, Khaleda
Zia and Sheikh Hasina, held the future of Bangladesh in their hands. It
is for those two women to come together and try to overcome this
history of hostility and distrust. He said that dialogue was the only
solution and that all the progress and potential would be put at risk

by asking the Minister a couple of questions about what practical steps
the UK is taking to put pressure on both sides to get that dialogue
going and to engage in meaningful negotiation. In particular, are we
collaborating with the Government of India in trying to exercise that
kind of pressure? Given its success in negotiating issues between
Serbia and Kosovo—almost equally unpromising at the
time—will we use the offices of the European External Action
Service to exercise that pressure? What more can be done for us to make
some practical impact on the situation? It would be a tragedy if a
country that has suffered so much, yet which has such potential and has
achieved so much in many ways, descended into violence yet

believe that there should have been an interim caretaker
Government—a point I made to Sheikh Hasina when 
<?notus-xml column=1030?>we visited Bangladesh in September last year, but she was clearly not in
favour of that. I believe that was a mistake. I understand why the
Bangladesh Nationalist party boycotted the elections, failing to
contest 147 seats. In a Parliament of 300 seats,
the incumbent Awami League and its party allies now hold 232 of them.
It is the first time in 23 years that there has been no political

that voting booths were set on fire and that mob intimidation was
commonplace. It is not surprising that the electoral turnout was

have three main worries for Bangladesh at this time. The first is the
impact on the country’s democracy. We are extremely fortunate in
this country that we have a relatively peaceful political culture. That
has grown over many years and generations, not by accident but through
co-operation and the determination to have peaceful elections. We
accept that the winner of our elections has the right to govern.
Bangladesh is a young country—it was created in 1971—and
it has been steadily making progress on building democracy. We should
celebrate that, but I am concerned that this particular election may
well derail democracy there. The irony is that the people of Bangladesh

major concern about Bangladesh is the violence. I am worried that
violence could escalate even further in the coming weeks and months. We
have seen from around the world that when opposition groups are

final worry concerns economic development. In recent years, as has been

what next? The first thing that needs to happen is an end to the
violence by both sides and the reopening of dialogue, at least between

current uncertainty. Hon. Members will be aware that other countries in
the international community—the United States, Canada and the

other countries to follow, but it must first leave behind the

ordinary people in Bangladesh are tired of the bickering and the
violence; what they want is a better life for themselves and their

democracies require good governance, and good governance requires not

Constitutions are not dry documents on which the ink settled many years

better outcome for their constituents and their countries. If
politicians are to operate effectively, a discourse must take place
between the leaders of political parties. Beyond the clash of
personalities and the partisanship of party labels, there must be a
fundamental understanding of the operation of politics to which both
political parties acquiesce, and that requires compromise. It is clear
that such a situation has not existed in Bangladesh in the recent

final point is about political arrests and detentions. In circumstances

of a political party is detained in their own home, how on earth can an
effective election be held? People might say that locking up some of
our political leaders here might help our election chances—my
hon. Friends might think it could help them in the 2015 election.

finally talk about some actions that I would like to see. It is
appropriate for the Department for International Development to review
its expenditure in Bangladesh, but I urge the Minister to ensure that
our response to the political turmoil in Bangladesh does not harm the
interests of ordinary Bengalis who need support through the alleviation
of poverty. Secondly, despite what I have said, I urge the UK
Government to continue to work with the Government of Bangladesh to
pursue a solution to the current turmoil. Four steps are required,
however: the full release of political detainees; the installation of a
caretaker Government; the disbanding of the Rapid Action Battalion and
an external investigation 
<?notus-xml column=1036?>into its activities; and more work and more investment from the UK to
strengthen business and trade with Bangladesh, in order to promote
entrepreneurship and the growth of business, because that can be the
strongest bulwark in the defence of freedom in countries around the
world. If we can achieve those four things, they will provide a more
effective transition to a peaceful future and a new election in
Bangladesh than hoping that somehow, after decades of hostility, the
two political leaders themselves will miraculously come up with the
solution through
discussions.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/C1711224D2ED009CD7F8419E235DCB9529E0E173" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 January 2014">Thursday

play into the hands of those who have tried to sabotage the recent

League, and in creating a climate in which elections can take place. I
cannot see the Awami League staying in power for a full five-year term;
that would be against the spirit of what has happened so far, and

the principle that we should exercise caution when commenting on
another country unless we have had a chance to visit it and see the

Bangladesh some 18 months ago, as part of a trip organised by the
Conservative Friends of Bangladesh. My hon. Friends the Members for St
Albans and for Enfield North (Nick de Bois) and I saw at first hand
many of the issues that have been raised today. I have to say that the
Parliament in Bangladesh was bizarre. We three Members were greeted
almost like visiting royalty. We were presented to the Parliament,
which was half empty, and witnessed its Prime Minister’s
question time. It was a far cry from what we experience in this House
each week. Questions to Government Ministers were scripted and

there was complacency from the Government of the day. I remember their
Chief Whip telling us, “Don’t worry, when we come to

election. They expected not only that they would win that election, but
that the BNP

great courage for her to carry out that act—I am not sure she
was aware of what was going to happen when she was put into the winch

infrastructure, however, is horrendous. Dhaka’s traffic is
probably the worst in the world, as the city is permanently gridlocked,
and the condition of the roads is a disgrace. I cannot forget the
12-hour trip we took by rutted road from Sylhet to Dhaka—my body
has not recovered since. The key point to make is that there is a great
opportunity for investment in the country’s infrastructure,
which will improve the ability of farmers and industrialists to produce
the goods that will drive forward the country’s major
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000475">DFID
funding must be at centre of our thoughts, because it is where we can
bring pressure to bear. We saw how DFID and Government funding has
enabled cataracts to be treated in the outlying communities in a way
that shamed our national health service. People who have the first
signs of blindness as a result of cataracts can be spotted and then
treated quickly for the princely sum of £27 per eye. That shows
that when a good project is implemented it can be done properly and
effectively, and is a demonstrable example of what can be done
elsewhere.</hs_Para>

funding—to the tune of £5 million a year, I
believe—has also gone towards community workshops to build
community capability. Clearly that has not worked, because if it had
the parliamentary elections and democracy in Bangladesh would be far
better. I hope that DFID will review that funding. When we returned 18
months ago, we questioned whether the money was being used in the best
way possible, given that other projects could clearly be organised
through NGOs to provide a better future for the people of Bangladesh.
Those issues must be addressed and the funding needs to be reviewed, so
that we bring pressure to bear on the Government in Bangladesh. We need
to say, “If you do not make sure that the rights of minorities
and of the country are protected, we will have to reconsider whether
that funding continues.” I must add 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>a word of caution, because the money that goes to the NGOs is being
spent extremely wisely, well and effectively; it is the money given to
the Government to spend that is of great cause for concern, for not
only our taxpayers, but the people of Bangladesh.</hs_Para>

persecution of minorities, with the murders of Hindus, Christians,
Sikhs and other minorities, is an absolute disgrace. We should condemn
those murders outright. I hope that the Foreign Secretary will take up
the issue, and make sure and demonstrate to the Government of
Bangladesh that these things cannot be allowed to continue, in
any shape or form. Any representations should be made through our
Foreign Secretary and our embassy. The rights of those individuals are
paramount and they must be allowed to continue to celebrate their
religion, their ethnicity, their background and their
history.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000478" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000478">Finally,
I think that there is a potential way forward for the future. I was a
bit disturbed to receive an e-mail from the BNP about the situation in
Bangladesh—I differentiate the BNP of Bangladesh from the
pernicious, evil organisation that exists in this country, but I was
not sure at the time which had sent me this e-mail. The leaders of two
major political parties in Bangladesh hate each other and will not
co-operate in any shape or form, but surely there is an opportunity for
the Commonwealth and for the British Government to play a role in
bringing together the disparate parties in Bangladesh and hammering out
a deal. Such a deal would allow a caretaker Government to proceed; and
it would allow us to move towards free and fair elections in the near,
but not necessarily immediate, future, in order to allow the fledgling
democracy of Bangladesh to flourish and to encourage and promote a
Parliament in Bangladesh that mirrors how we operate in this country.
That would entail free and frank exchanges, an opportunity for the
Opposition the criticise the Government and the opportunity of saying,
“That will be done in a fair way” It would also entail
the freedom of the press.</hs_Para>

moment, press freedom is seriously threatened, because politicians and
journalists disappear and nobody knows where they have gone, whether
they have been arrested or whether they are still alive. A situation of
fear breeds uncertainty and the worst case scenario. I ask our Foreign
Secretary and our Ministers to make representations to the Bangladeshi
Government, asking them to come to their senses and reach a negotiated
settlement, so that there can be a bright and prosperous future for the
people of Bangladesh, because the young people there deserve
it.</hs_Para>

we cannot change the tragedy of the history of Bangladesh, but it is
worth recalling a couple of highly significant points in its history.
It was originally created as East Pakistan during the tragedy of
partition 
<?notus-xml column=1042?>in 1947, and there was a tragic loss of so many lives during the wars
that followed. To divide a country called Pakistan by 1,000 miles of
another country was inevitably going to lead to an unstable
relationship and problems. The many uprisings in what later became
Bangladesh against Pakistani rule and the abuse of power by the
authorities in East Pakistan led to the war in 1971, and eventually the
success of the Mukti Bahini forces, which brought about the
independence and recognition of Bangladesh.</hs_Para>

that disgraceful atrocities were committed during that war and that
very large numbers of people died. It is also absolutely correct that
those who commit atrocities should be brought to justice however long
that takes. That surely is what we believe in when we hold
international war crimes tribunals. In that sense, it is right that the
Government of Bangladesh, led by Sheikh Hasina, set up the war crimes
tribunal. My concern, and that of many others, was over the
difficulties that international observers faced in observing those
trials. Concerns were expressed about them and the execution of one
very prominent person that followed the tribunal. Apparently, there was
indifference by the Government of Bangladesh to universal concerns
around the world about the use of the death penalty. Let me reiterate
that I for one cannot accept the death penalty in any circumstances or
on any occasion. The message has to be that justice and the judicial
system must be seen to be independent. However, I endorse the point
that Governments are entitled to operate a war crimes tribunal and use
their judiciary to look at atrocities that have been committed. They
should also ensure that all witnesses and legal representatives are
secure and safe, that there are international observers and that
international norms are
followed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000483" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000483">The
more recent history of Bangladesh is about the economic problem that
the country faces. It has a large population and is one of the largest
countries in the world. It faces enormous environmental challenges from
water supply—either over-supply or under-supply of fresh
water—and the problems of managing a river system that emanates

also has an economic model that is difficult to sustain. It wants to
become part of the world trade system by exporting garments, and I
applaud that, but the problem is that with the beggar thy neighbour
policies of the World Trade Organisation, the garment industry quickly
moves itself from one low-wage economy to another, to another and so
on. We now have the prospect of Chinese companies opening factories in
Bangladesh because wages in China, while very low, are relatively high
compared with Bangladesh. If Bangladesh then raises its wages to any
decent level, the danger is that the garment industry will up sticks
and go somewhere else. We have to think about the cheap clothes that we
buy on the high streets of this country, and indeed of the United
States and the rest of Europe, and the appalling working conditions
that are behind all
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000485"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Main" PimsId="4829" UID="14011656001226" xid="890" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656001226">Mrs

increase the basic minimum wage, and that was welcome. None the less, I
have attended meetings with the International Labour Organisation and

I conclude, let me turn to the violence that has been committed against
human rights activists and religious and ethnic minorities, and to the
numbers of people who have disappeared over the last few months and
years. There can be no acceptance anywhere in the world that it is
legitimate to persecute people. In the case of Bangladesh, the
persecuted happen to be Christians or Hindus, but it would be no more
correct for any other society to pursue and persecute people because
they are Muslims. Surely the norm of the United Nations universal
declaration of 1948 was that one accepts and respects religious and
ethnic diversity in any and every society. I welcome the fact that
Bangladesh’s constitution of 1971 is a secular one and
guarantees rights of religious assembly and religious freedom, but the
reality is that forces and gangs—in some cases funded elsewhere,
and in some cases parastatal—have been killing and persecuting
religious minorities, which is simply not acceptable. We must send out
a strong message to that
effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000488">My
final point is about how a democracy works. A democracy works if there
is an open, free and fair electoral system. It also requires an
independent judiciary, an independent media, security for those who are
reporting, and the right of assembly and of free speech. All those
things have been challenged in Bangladesh, and the violence and the
deaths that we have seen are simply not acceptable.</hs_Para>

election took place, the Awami League was inevitably going to win it,
because the Opposition simply did not participate. I have read the
Awami League report on the elections, and I can kind of see the point
that it is making, but it hardly confers legitimacy on a Government
when the Opposition do not take part, so we can hardly say that it was
a democratic representation of the will of the people. Indeed, I have
had it said to me by people in the London Bangladeshi community that
the BNP might well have won the election had it taken part. I do not
know whether that is the case, but we do know that the current impasse
has to be broken in some way. There have to be talks with all the
parties and there has to be freedom of movement of all political
leaders and an acceptance that that is really not a credible way for
the Government of Bangladesh to continue to behave. It is not for us to
say what should happen, but if there are to be legitimate talks with
all political parties and representatives, there is likely to be a call
for fresh elections.</hs_Para>

Parish</B> (Tiverton and Honiton) (Con):</Member> It is good to follow
the hon. Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn), who gave a good
résumé of the history of Bangladesh. I am pleased to be
able to take part in this debate, and I thank my hon. Friend the Member

in the country stems from the fact that I was an EU election
observer in 2008, along with Dr Charles Tannock, Nirj Deva and
Koenraad Dillen from the Netherlands. What was interesting, and perhaps
depressing in many respects, was the great hope that came after those
elections. Before them, there had been a huge amount of electoral fraud
in the country. In 2008, we saw one of the best electoral rolls ever
seen anywhere in the world. There were 80 million photographs of the
individuals who were to cast their votes. I expected the electoral roll
to contain rather fuzzy pictures from which one might not be able to
recognise the voter, but I can assure the House that, although the
photographs were quite small they were recognisable.</hs_Para>

was carried out in a pretty free and fair way, resulting in a landslide
for the Awami League. In a way, that is what brought about many of the
problems we see today. I find it depressing. In 2008, Sheikh Hasina was
under house arrest under the then military Government. She was released
to take part in the election, and there was talk about whether the
military were going to back off from the government of Bangladesh. All
those things came about and there was a transition to a form of
democratic Government. As other hon. Members have said today, when we
are in government we are not always delighted to get a lot of
opposition from the Opposition, but that is how democracy works and how
we are held to account. Once a party has 80% or 90% of the seats, there
is no opposition. It becomes a dictatorship, albeit by a different
route. That is what is fundamentally wrong with what is happening in
Bangladesh today. It is ironic that Sheikh Hasina is treating her
opponents in exactly the same way as she was treated.</hs_Para>

it is not always easy to find the Nelson Mandelas of this world in
every country, but there comes a time when it would be lovely if
someone could stand up and say, “Let’s learn from the
past, let’s forgive and let’s have some
reconciliation.” The trouble is that that is not happening.
Members have clearly made the point today that Bangladesh needs a
Government who can rule on behalf of all the people. We want Bangladesh
to remain a secular country; we do not want to see the persecution and
even perhaps the murder of Christians and Hindus. Those are things that
we cannot accept.</hs_Para>

difficult for us, as I am sure the Minister is
aware—particularly if we are seen in some ways to be the old
colonial power—to say that we will tell people how to run their
country and how to run a democracy. We have had a form of democracy for
500 or 600 years —or even, one might argue, for nearly
1,000 years, although that is not to say that I think that William the
Conqueror was particularly democratic. It has taken us 
<?notus-xml column=1045?>a long time to get to where we are and some might argue that our
democracy is not entirely perfect even now, but younger countries with
huge divisions find it more difficult to have a democracy. However
difficult it is for us to intervene, what we can say is that we give a
great deal of money to help Bangladesh and we must consider how the
money given to the Government is spent. We expect the Government of
that country to show some recognition of human rights, recognition of a
free press and respect for opposition. The Minister has the wisdom of
Solomon and will, I am sure, be able to provide all the ideas we need,
but we need to put the pressure on.</hs_Para>

remember, as other Members have said, that the people of Bangladesh are
very hard working. They are very poor yet they will work hard to bring
themselves out of poverty. We must help them by targeting the areas
where we want the Government to change rather than targeting the
people. That is always difficult.</hs_Para>

almost one huge river valley, so the soil is very fertile but also

individuals boycott clothing made in Bangladesh? I do not believe that
we should, because it makes the situation worse, but we need some
checks and balances on where those clothes have come from, what the
factories are like, how the workers are treated, how they are paid and
what sort of conditions they are in. We are right to debate that in the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000499" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000499">I
agree with the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick)
that it is not our duty in this House to tell Bangladesh when the next
election should be, but we should not ignore the situation. We cannot
ignore a Government who were not elected in a free and fair way in the
recent elections. If fewer than half the seats are being contested,
that is no way to run any form of democracy, and if vengeance is then
to be taken on political opponents, that is no way to run a country.
Let us put the pressure on where we can and say to Bangladesh that it
has to change its ways and go back to the ballot box. The timing is for
Bangladesh to decide, but we and the international community must add
to the pressure.</hs_Para>

delighted to have been able to make this speech although I am
disappointed that the great hope of 2009, with the landslide and Sheikh

that we in this country, in all humility but with an active sense of
participation, should work for the peace, stability, good governance
and prosperity of the people of Bangladesh, not just because of the
great warmth felt towards the Bangladeshi community living 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>in this country but because Bangladesh has a fantastic series of
opportunities to succeed in the forthcoming years. If we get the
governance of Bangladesh right, the generation that is growing up there
now could see its nation pushing towards becoming a middle income
country and tackling many of the issues that will arise as a result of
climate change.</hs_Para>

today that the transition to a democratic system is not just about how
people vote but about all sorts of other forms of civic engagement and
processes. Becoming a democratic country does not just require majority
rule; it also requires minority rights. It requires a political system
that emerges, respects differences and tolerates alternative opinions.
At its heart, it should require people to come together in a way that
does not ignore difference but says that there is a future available to
a country that would not be birthed without people coming together to
achieve those
aims.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000504" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000504">Today,
our thoughts are dominated by the concerns about the 10th general
election, held on 5 January. The lack of widespread support for it from
the world community and from the parties that would have participated
in that election is troubling, and rightly so. I think that it was
right for the US and the EU not to send observers, which would have
lent legitimacy to a process that has clearly been discredited. Indeed,
only four international observers participated in the
election.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000505" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000505">The
tension between the Awami League and the BNP led to around half the
seats going uncontested. Of course, it is a feature and not a bug of
the Bangladeshi political system that the first-past-the-post system
further accentuates the disconnect between the proportion of people
voting for one party and the number of seats it wins. It has led to a
pendulum effect, with power going backwards and forwards between the
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000506" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000506">I
associate myself with the sentiment expressed by the hon. Member for
Bedford (Richard Fuller) when he warned against falling into the trap
of thinking that it is six of one and half a dozen of another, because
it is not about choosing sides. Fundamentally, it is about saying that
our political leaders have a responsibility, when given the
opportunity, to set the conditions. It is not just about what benefits
us in our parties; it is about the long-term prosperity of a
nation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000507" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000507">Setting
the right tone is incredibly important. That is something we need to be
aware of in this House, which is why I hope that today’s debate
will be welcomed by all those with a genuine interest in the future of
the Bangladeshi people. We offer it in a spirit of humility,
acknowledging that in no country are democratic processes
perfect—we are all trying to improve things. However, where
attention can be drawn to human rights abuses, where, as hon. Members
have said today, concerns point towards a system in which injustice can
be institutionalised, and where the abuse of power can lead to large
groups of people feeling completely frozen out of the democratic
process, it is right to point that out and condemn the situation that
allows it to come
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000508" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000508">It
has been asked today whether it was right to press on with the election
or whether it would have been better to have an interim Administration
until such time as full and free democratic elections could be held. I
think that it was right that, as a nation, we chose to put out a series
of statements making it clear that we did not believe that the election
was free and fair, but surely the time ahead will be vital.</hs_Para>

debate is taking place in the Parliament of a country that has strong
links with the Bangladeshi nation, not least through the diaspora in
our constituencies and communities. If we ever needed a statement
on the incredible strides that that young nation—young
demographically and young given its date of birth—can make, we
need only look to the entrepreneurial spirit of the many people of
Bangladeshi origin in our nation. They are a fantastic group of people
and a fantastic work force. They are working incredibly hard,
delivering the kind of growth that Bangladesh will need to see in the

people in our communities will rightly say that for the world community
to look on Bangladesh as though it should not have to live up to our
expectations of democratic nations is deeply offensive to its people.
Sometimes we view parts of the world as though they should not step up
to what they could be—true participants in the world community,
with processes and systems that reflect their leadership
role.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000511" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000511">Our
partnership with Bangladesh involves not only business links, but
international aid, development and support. I believe that there is a
strong story to tell about our involvement, but there are also strong
expectations. Bangladesh is one of the top five nations that we support
through DFID. There are a number of figures available, but roughly
£250 million of UK taxpayers’ money is spent in
Bangladesh, and around 10% of that goes to big programmes aimed at
strengthening political participation and safety and justice. I for one
would never argue that we should go around the world with a big stick,
trying to increase leverage in places where that is inappropriate, but
surely it must be right, in the light of recent deeply concerning
events, for DFID to review not the viability of those programmes, but
their effectiveness.</hs_Para>

direct funding for the Bangladeshi Government, and the NGOs and
multilateral agencies are, by and large, very successful in their
much-needed work, and in strengthening governance and participation in
the political process and civic society. However, we must ask how we
can make those programmes more effective to ensure that the leverage
that is rightly being exercised by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office
is backed up with participative support from
DFID.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000513" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000513">Finally,
I want to say a few words on the international trade links with
Bangladesh. The all-party group’s report has rightly been widely
welcomed by Members on both sides of the House for its instructive
message. I think that we have a fantastic trade relationship. We must
acknowledge that there is an economy coming through—the garment
industry and other industries—that benefits us as well as them,
and that is vital. That is why I believe that it was so short-sighted
for the Government to defund the work being done by the International
Labour Organisation, the body that ensures decent standards and working
practices in those places. I welcome DFID’s approach in
acknowledging that the ILO was an important participant in the process
of raising standards in Bangladesh and urge it to increase the amount
of money once again going into the ILO’s work.</hs_Para>

relationships with Bangladesh are obviously political. They cross
diaspora communities. They come from a deep-rooted sense of values and
a shared history. But the future of those relationships relies upon us
treating Bangladesh as a country that can step up to the requirements
of being a modern world economy. Through 
<?notus-xml column=1048?>our participation and all the ways we can exercise our agency here in
the UK, we should work with a clear sense that majority rule, minority
rights and true shared decision making will create the only future path
for the people of Bangladesh. In that light, I hope that this debate
will go a long way towards pointing out the future direction for the
people of that fantastic
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/86039466CBCBB5423B3F3B6535F01A7452C27ADE" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 January 2014">Thursday

has the pleasure of having not only its first Muslim lord mayor, but
its first lord mayor of Bangladeshi origin, Councillor Faruk Choudhury,
who has made a real impact as a role model for younger people in the

the elections were held on 5 January. We have heard already about the
widespread concern that has been expressed by the international
community and the condemnation of shocking acts of violence and
intimidation. I want to focus my remarks mostly on the elections, given
that they are so recent. As we have heard, more than half the 300 seats
were uncontested. Some candidates from other parties, I
understand, tried to withdraw their names from the ballot
paper. Some from smaller parties were elected, but more than 100
candidates from the ruling Awami League were elected unopposed, and 48
million registered voters out of 92 million could not vote. Indeed, it
is reported that people could vote in just two of the 20
constituencies in Dhaka, so it is no surprise that the turnout
was disappointingly low. The Government’s official turnout
figure was 39% to 40%, but that has been queried, given that there was
no turnout at all in many parts of the country because the seats were
uncontested.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000519" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000519">Furthermore,
election day and the weeks preceding it saw deplorable acts of
violence. There were arson attacks on polling stations, including more
than 120 schools. There were reports that an election officer was
beaten to death on polling day, and that 440 polling stations closed
early due to security concerns. Human Rights Watch reported that 120
people lost their lives in pre-election violence, and at least 18
people died on election day. Media reports have said that many were
shot by
police.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000520" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000520">The
reasons for the violence and the failure of the elections to proceed as
we would have hoped are varied and complex. The Bangladesh Nationalist
party, along 
<?notus-xml column=1049?>with several of the smaller parties, decided to boycott the election in
protest against the Government’s decision not to allow a neutral
caretaker Government to take charge in the run-up to the elections. As
we heard from the hon. Member for St Albans and others, such a practice
had been in place since the 1996 elections. Meanwhile, there was a
court order preventing the Jamaat-e-Islami party from participating.
There were also reports that some candidates tried to withdraw, but
were prevented from doing so, and that party representatives were
arrested or forced to leave Bangladesh. After the BNP’s leader
called for a march for democracy in late December, hundreds of
opposition supporters were arrested, and demonstrators were prevented
from reaching Dhaka. There were reports of arbitrary arrests and the
indiscriminate use of force. Ms Zia was, in effect, placed under house
arrest, with security forces preventing her from leaving her home.
Those are all deeply troubling human rights violations.</hs_Para>

me turn to the human rights situation. Last year, as a result of
political violence, Bangladesh was added to the FCO’s human
rights report as a case study. It is estimated that 500 Bangladeshis
were killed in political violence in 2013, with injury caused to
thousands of 
<?notus-xml column=1051?>others, predominantly associated with the international crimes
tribunal’s investigations into the 1971 war. I have seen
harrowing reports. Human Rights Watch has documented evidence that the
security forces were responsible for some of the deaths during the
protests. It is imperative that those responsible are held to account.
The incidents provided further evidence of the need to promote freedom
of expression and association in Bangladesh. People in Bangladesh and
some external observers have argued that the tribunal process is
flawed, and there are troubling reports that at least one witness has
been attacked and
killed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000531" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000531">The
verdicts have led to the death penalty. As my hon. Friend the Member
for Islington North said, most of us are united across this House in
condemning the use of capital punishment in all cases. I know that that
is not a unanimous view, but I think I am right in saying that it is
probably a majority view. Labour Members regard the death penalty as
inhumane. As in the case of the execution of Abdul Quader Molla of the
Jamaat-e-Islami party last month, it serves only to heighten tensions
and spark further violence. The Government therefore have our full
support in calling on Bangladesh to implement a moratorium on the use
of the death penalty and to uphold the international covenant on civil

members of the Human Rights Council, that the abolition of the death

production to Bangladesh because it is even cheaper to produce garments
there than in China. How do we tackle the issues involved? How do we
raise terms and conditions, wages and living standards in countries
such as Bangladesh in such a way that production is not displaced to
another country that will undercut it even further? The only way that

provided in investment projects to date, and with 100 UK
firms operating successfully right across Bangladesh. Our bilateral
trade in goods doubled between 2006 and 2011, and we are now the third
largest destination for exports from Bangladesh, with garments and
seafood accounting for the bulk of total
sales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000548" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000548">The
aid relationship is, however, very important as well. The United
Kingdom is the largest donor of bilateral grant aid to Bangladesh. It
will amount to £275 million in the 2013-14 financial year. The
aid programme is focused above all on the relief of the chronic and
desperate poverty of far too many millions of people in Bangladesh, as
well as on programmes to improve the quality of drinking water and
sanitation, and to help Bangladesh to adapt to the risks posed by
climate change. I say to the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow that
we estimate that about 15 million people in Bangladesh have been helped
directly by UK aid funding for extending flood early warning
systems.</hs_Para>

Kingdom aid is channelled through non-governmental organisations and
none is paid directly to the Bangladesh Government. It is true that
about a third of our total aid programme ultimately goes to the
Bangladesh Government’s health and education systems because, as
we all know, help with primary health care and education are key to
promoting the economic development and sustainable growth of a
developing country. However, that one-third share is channelled via
reputable NGOs, such as the United Nations, the World Bank and the
Asian Development Bank, and money is paid out by our Government only
once we have been given clear, accountable evidence that a project or
programme in the education or health sector has been delivered. That
aspect of our aid is delivered on a reimbursement
basis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000550">Roughly
12.5% of United Kingdom aid goes to matters related to governance,
although I again stress that it does not go directly to the Bangladesh
Government or any individual political party. That element of our aid
programme includes measures to enhance the taxpayer base in Bangladesh,
which indirectly contributes to 
<?notus-xml column=1055?>anti-corruption work in that country. The number of registered taxpayers
has risen by 480,000, in part as a result of that element of the UK aid
programme, and improving the technical side of the electoral

aspect of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000551" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000551">As

granting this debate at such short notice. The slot became available
because of the unfortunate circumstances of the death of Mr Paul
Goggins. Although they are participating at short notice, many hon.
Members and colleagues from the all-party group have spoken with great
knowledge and depth. If the debate shows the world outside this Chamber
anything, it is the House of Commons at its best. We are completely at
one in our disappointment at Bangladesh’s situation and in our
hope that some solution and way forward can be found even at this late
stage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000554" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000554">The
reason why the interim period lasted for two years, despite that being
far longer than is allowed for under the constitution, was that the
2006 to 2008 interim Government had to fix so many problems that had
been left unfixed. For example, a credible voter list was needed,
because millions had been left disfranchised. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Tiverton and Honiton (Neil Parish) said, when such a voter
list was brought in, hopes were high that the country would be led by a
party with a true democratic mandate, because so many people were
enfranchised who had previously been left off a voter list that could
in no way be considered free of corruption.</hs_Para>

hopes expressed at the 2008 election, which the Awami League won with a
landslide vote and a true democratic mandate, it is a shame that in
such a short time Bangladesh should find itself in its current
position. So many colleagues who care so much about the country and who
have spoken so knowledgeably—indeed, some have large Bangladeshi
diasporas in their constituencies—are united across the House

better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000556" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0002.htm#14011656000556">I
concur with the shadow Minister that the hon. Member for Cheltenham
(Martin Horwood) will probably have curry for life. I am surprised that
the hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) did not
break into the mother tongue of Bangladesh that he seems to speak so
well, albeit with something of an accent. His wife runs the Sreepur

the people who ask what APPGs do, I say that this debate shows what
they do at their best. They take an interest in a niche subject and
unite colleagues in the House across party lines. I am truly grateful
that this debate has been participated in so fully. I am only sorry
that the hon. Member for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk) could not take the
limelight, as he was going to do, because of pressing engagements that
meant he could not stay until the end. He would have done a brilliant
job of opening and closing the debate, but I have had to fulfil that

honestly hope that those who are watching this debate—some of
whom are very close to us—have taken on board our earnest hope
that they will go back and say, “Put your differences
aside.” The two-lady solution that was being talked about in
2006 would have been a disaster because there can be no way to run a
country through violence. We want Bangladesh’s political leaders
to keep their arguments and debates within their Chamber, and to allow
their electorate to come forward freely with a strong voice and say who
they would like to represent them. The people should then be able to
hold them to account. That is what this House does. We hold the
Government of the day to account. Every Government who are in power
must feel that they have to deal with the issues and that they cannot
just keep looking back and blaming the Opposition, saying, “It
all happened then.” <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> That
goes right the way back to 1971. Let us end on that note of

will set the scene by defining some of the concepts that we will
discuss, because this is a complex area. Nuisance means different
things to different people. The term “nuisance call” is
used to capture a wide range of types of calls from silent calls to
live marketing calls and from harassment to financial scams. By
definition, nuisance calls are a problem for consumers. They interrupt
family meal times or are received wearily after a hard day’s
work. They often demand that elderly or vulnerable people answer the
phone when it is an effort to do so. For some people they are a mere
irritation, but for others they cause significant harm or distress, and
they can even make people feel intimidated when answering their phone.
Not all nuisance calls are illegal. Consumers sometimes term legitimate
contact a nuisance, for example if a call comes at an awkward time of
the day. Nuisance is often in the eye of the
beholder.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000568" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000568">For
the purposes of this debate, we will focus on marketing calls, whether
silent or live and whether over a fixed line or a mobile, that are made
without the consumer’s consent. We will also consider the
problem of nuisance spam texts, although the consent mechanism differs.
Marketing calls operate on an opt-out basis. Until a person says
explicitly that they do not wish to 
<?notus-xml column=1058?>receive marketing calls, companies that are engaged in direct marketing
are able legally to contact them by telephone. In contrast, marketing
texts operate on an opt-in basis. They can be sent legally only if a
consumer states that they are happy to receive
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000569" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000569">The
definitions of terms such as live marketing calls and marketing text
messages follow those that are used by the main regulators, which are
Ofcom and the Information Commissioner’s Office. The definitions
focus on the type of call and do not cover situations in which,
although the individual call may be legal, the pattern, frequency or
time of the call should classify it as a
nuisance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000570" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000570"><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="14011656001240" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656001240"><B>Guy

My right hon. Friend the Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan
Beith), who is unable to be here, outlined a very worrying set of
circumstances to me, which may well have affected the hon.
Gentleman’s constituents. In the last week, a large number of
automated calls have been made at those sorts of times in the morning,
starting with the phrase, “The Government want you to know
that—”. The time at which the calls are made indicate
that it will almost inevitably be bad news. Those calls can be very
worrying and cause immense

the regulatory framework for nuisance calls is complex. That is partly
because it has emerged through historical accident, rather than by
design. Ofcom regulates silent and abandoned calls. The regulations
state that when using automatic dialler equipment, which must have been
used in the cases that I have just outlined, no more than 3% of
answered call attempts should be abandoned because no live agent is
available at the call centre. That means that if 1 million calls are
made, 30,000 nuisance calls can be made
legally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000573" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000573">The

data protection regulations, including the Privacy and Electronic

the two main regulators, a number of other organisations, with or
without regulatory powers, have an interest. Claims management
companies, which are responsible for the vast share of calls, are
regulated by the claims management regulator. The Financial Conduct
Authority will shortly regulate debt management and payday lending
companies. The National Fraud Authority and the police have a role to
play when nuisance calls pertain to fraud, scams or other forms of
illegal activity. PhonepayPlus regulates premium rate phone numbers and
services in the UK. That is by no means a full

Crockart:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and
there are two issues raised. Of course, the vast majority of calls
coming from outside the UK are made on behalf of companies operating
within the UK, so they should be covered by the regulators. The
difficulty is that there are all sorts of problems with identifying
where those calls have come from and getting the calling line identity
to ensure that they can be traced. I hope that the Minister will have
something to say later about how he is looking to deal with the various
difficulties.</hs_Para>

complexity of the regulation leads to a lack of focus and, therefore,

the all-party group’s inquiry, we made a number of
attempts to come to a final assessment of the scale of the
problem, but the vast array of inconsistent data makes that difficult.
The regulators receive about 6,000 complaints a month about
nuisance calls. Ofcom reports that it receives about 3,000 relating to
silent calls, and since setting up its online reporting tool in March
2012, the Information Commissioner’s Office has received about
240,000 complaints about unsolicited calls and texts. There is no
evidence that the problem is decreasing. The ICO, Ofcom and the
Telephone Preference Service all report an overall growth in the number
of complaints over the past three years, but complaints data alone fail
to tell us the full story. As part of its “Calling Time”

there is a serious problem and that there is no confidence that the

Crockart:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a good point, although
I am not sure whether it is just a lack of confidence. Part of it may
well be a lack of knowledge and a lack of willingness to commit time to
go through the process of making a complaint. However, I was about to

from the portal that Which? set up showed that only about half the
people who used it went on to make a full complaint to the regulators.
As the hon. Gentleman says, the number of nuisance calls received far
exceeds the number of official complaints. BT estimates that its
nuisance call bureau receives about 50,000 calls a month— 
<?notus-xml column=1060?>that is the figure I have, which is bad enough. There are also nuisance
texts, and in the evidence that the all-party group received, the
technology company Pinesoft estimated that about 8.7 million are sent

omnibus survey is generally considered to produce the most accurate
estimate of the number of nuisance calls that people receive, because
it involves people making a diary of the calls that they receive for a
certain period. It has resulted in an estimate that consumers who
experience unwanted calls receive an average of about two a week, with
four out of five participants receiving at least one nuisance call
during the four-week research period. About a quarter of people
recalled receiving more than 10 calls in a four-week period. However
one calculates it, the annual number of unwanted calls is almost
certainly more than 1
billion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000584" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000584">Another

is that the telephone is taken out of the use of people who would
otherwise regard it as a normal service in their home. It is manifestly

and that the Government need to do more to give the regulator and
others teeth, so that we can stop
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000586" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000586"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mike Crockart" PimsId="5531" UID="14011656001247" xid="1057" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656001247">Mike
Crockart:</Member></B> Absolutely. That is a good point, and that fear
is concentrated among certain groups, such as the elderly, who are at
home during the day more, and those who, as StepChange found, are
hounded by companies encouraging them to take out payday loans and so
on. Just over 26.3 million British adults have been offered
high-interest credit such as payday loans via unsolicited marketing
calls or messages, and 83% of British adults feel that consumers need
greater protection from them.</hs_Para>

people who get a high number of nuisance calls tend to be elderly, and
a recent trial of call-blocking technology by trading standards in
Angus, in Scotland, found that about 40% of phone calls received by
elderly and vulnerable residents were nuisance calls. It also found
that older people were the victims of 40% of all nuisance calls. As I
said, that is partly because of the timing of nuisance calls, with 78%
being made between 8 am and 6 pm, when most people are at work. The
trial found that without call-blocking technology, participants were
extremely concerned about scams, the risk of a fall when answering the
phone, feeling helpless to stop calls and feeling intimidated by
callers. Once call-blocking technology was installed, all those
concerns were reduced
considerably.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000588" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000588">I
decided to carry out a trial in my constituency by installing
call-blocking technology in the homes of two constituents who were
being particularly bothered by nuisance calls. The results were quite
shocking and bore out what has been found elsewhere. Mrs Moffat is a
constituent who is deaf and has to use a textphone, and her husband
suffers from early dementia. Since 27 August, 65% of her
incoming calls have been nuisance calls. Since 11 September another
constituent, Mrs Manchester, has received 212 calls, a third of which
have been 
<?notus-xml column=1061?>nuisance calls. Interestingly, the figure is down from 43% two months
ago, which seems to indicate that the use of call-barring technology
alone is reducing their
instance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000589" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000589">The
argument is strengthened by examining StepChange’s research. A
particular problem is nuisance calls targeted at indebted people, which
are causing tangible stress and anxiety. Some 65% of respondents to a
website poll said that they were afraid to answer the phone as a result
of nuisance calls or texts. That stress and anxiety risks exacerbating
existing mental health difficulties. According to the World Health
Organisation, the more debt people hold, the more likely they are to
suffer from mental health problems. That further serves to illustrate
why it is essential to ensure better protection for financially
vulnerable consumers from the potential harm of nuisance calls or
messages. Yet there is clear evidence that those people are being
targeted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000590" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000590">More
than 26.3 million British adults say that they have been offered
high-interest credit via unsolicited marketing calls. For those who do
not need it, that is annoying, but it is easy enough just to delete
messages. However, financial difficulties can lead to poor economic
choices, and 6% of respondents said that as a result of a nuisance call
or message, they had taken out a financial service or product that
actually worsened their financial position. The lure of a
no-questions-asked loan is difficult to pass up when someone can
justify to themselves that it is only for a week until they get back on
their
feet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000591" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000591">The
problem of protecting vulnerable consumers is the most pressing, since
that is where consumer detriment is most significant. Whatever actions
are taken to address the problem of nuisance calls in the longer term,
that issue must be dealt with now using whatever available
means.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000592" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000592">The
difficulty of coming up with an agreed figure for nuisance calls is not
merely academic, because it reveals two issues that go to the heart of
the problem. First, it suggests a lack of coherence in information and
data about nuisance calls. Data are being generated and collected, or
discarded, over a large number of organisations and are not effectively
shared or centrally stored. For example, the all-party group was
surprised to learn in its inquiry that BT does not share with the
regulator data generated by its nuisance calls services. Similarly,
trueCall, a manufacturer of call-blocking technology, reported that it
had not been able to interest the regulators in the data generated
through the use of its products. In addition, the TPS does not share
data with the Direct Marketing Commission, but both are arms of the
Direct Marketing
Association.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000593" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000593">The
discrepancy between the number of initial reports received by
consumer-facing organisations such as Which? and BT, and the final
number of complaints received by the regulators, suggests that not all
consumers who receive nuisance calls follow through the reporting
structure. That could be for a number of reasons, but the most likely
are that the complaints mechanisms are too onerous; the complainant
lacks the necessary information to make a complaint, such as the name
of the company or its telephone number; or, as has been said, people
believe there is little point in making a complaint. The 
<?notus-xml column=1062?>result is that we see only part of the picture at any one time, which
makes it all the more important for us to
act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000594">On
the economics of nuisance calls, I am not saying that we must ban all
direct marketing. The direct marketing industry undoubtedly contributes
financially to the UK economy. Call centres alone employ more than 1
million people in the UK. Direct marketing techniques are used by a
huge number of companies from a wide range of sectors to generate
business. At its best, direct marketing can be informative and useful
to consumers, helping them to find the best deal and the most suitable
product for their
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000595">On
the other hand, nuisance calls cause such a high level of irritation
that it is easy to forget that there is a market for them. They are
made to generate sales. Their continued existence means that we can
assume only that they are at times successful. The claims management
industry is consistently responsible for the largest share of
complaints, but nuisance calls originate from a wide cross-section of
industries. In live calls, the top topics of communication are payment
protection insurance reclaim, accident claims and energy. The top
topics for automated calls are, similarly, debt management, PPI and
energy. Other topics include research and surveys; so-called sugging,
when the caller pretends to be from a legitimate market research
organisation; Government grants, such as for loft insulation; and
insurance and
telecoms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000596" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000596">The
inquiry heard evidence that an outbound live marketing call can be made
for as little as 20p—the cost drops to just 1p for automatic
dialler equipment. The average PPI claim is for around £2,700,
with claims management companies receiving, on average, around 25% of
that. The economics of the industry are clear:  a single win
can cover the cost of 3,125 live calls or  62,500 automated
calls. That helps to explain the market in lead generation. We do not
know the underlying figures, but it seems reasonable to assume that a
significant proportion of calls are made by lead-generation companies,
which work to collect data and potential leads for other companies,
which then make the final sales
call.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000597"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="14011656001248" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656001248">Guy

all-party parliamentary group report published in October contains 16
recommendations. Ministers have a copy of it, but I should like to make
the case for four areas in which urgent action is both necessary and
possible, the first of which is a basic one relating to consent to
receive calls and TPS registration. There are around 25 million
land-lines in the UK, of which 19 million, which is around three
quarters, are registered with the TPS. There are 71 million mobile
phones—more than the number of people in the UK—and many
are similarly registered with the TPS. Each and every day, however,
there are more than 2 million nuisance calls and

consent should override TPS registration. Maintaining a direct
relationship with customers is key to any company and is valued by many
of those customers. Nothing in the report seeks to limit contact when
it benefits both sides and is properly consented to. However,
third-party consent is a grey area. It is commonly referred to as,
“Carefully selected third parties or trusted partners,”
which could just as easily mean, “Any company that is willing to
pay for your details”. Sometimes, if people say, “I am
TPS registered,” it is enough to end the calls. Even then, a
breach of the regulations has happened. However, companies often argue
that people have given permission at some point in the dim and distant
past. In all conscience, who can ever say completely confidently that
that cannot be

be or when the change will be implemented. By reducing the level of
detriment from “substantial damage or substantial

reason for slipping in that recommendation is that when we took
evidence from payday lenders I had put them on the spot and asked them
whether they 
<?notus-xml column=1066?>engaged in this sort of direct marketing. They said,  “Oh
no, of course not. We wouldn’t do that.” I went back
through my texts, therefore, and found nine  directing me to a
website offering payday loans: www.text4payday.com—don’t
go there! On that website, I filled in details asking for a £200
loan over a month and pressed the button, “Get your
cash”—not “Apply”, but “Get your
cash”—expecting to be quoted a £50
charge, as advertised on the payday lender sites. Instead, I was
directed to the QuickQuid website, which was one of the companies that
gave evidence, where I was offered £400 over three months at a
total cost of £754.</hs_Para>

that, because I did not think it was a particularly good deal—I
did not even press any buttons on the second website—but I then
received e-mails and texts as follows: Tuesday 5 November, 1.16 pm, an
e-mail saying there was one more step to take; same day and time, an
e-mail giving me pre-contract information; half an hour later, a text
urging me to sign the contract; 15 minutes later, a call from America
urging me to sign up, which I declined; 20 minutes later, another
e-mail giving me pre-contract information; the next day, at 6.32 am, an
e-mail saying, “Hurry, application expiring soon”; at
7.59 am, another e-mail with pre-contract information; at 12.9 pm,
another e-mail with account log-in information. That was worrying
enough, but I then thought, “Well, is this website just a front
for QuickQuid?” so I went on again, only this time I made up
details. I called myself Boris Peep and made a further application. I
put in my constituency address and immediately started getting texts
saying “Hi, Boris. Your application has been approved.”
So a made-up person ended up being approved for a payday loan. It is
very worrying and needs urgent action.</hs_Para>

to Warren Buckley’s comments, I presumed it was difficult

block has called. It sounded remarkably similar to BT, so I went to Sky
where its calls feature summary says that Sky has last caller barring,
but it costs £3.55 a month. To bar a number following a call,
one has to dial—gosh!—14258 followed by **. Exactly what
I want is already here; it is just that the telecoms companies are
doing it independently and charging for it. It should not be that
difficult to take this issue forward. I say to Ministers that some in

we seem content to stand by and make excuses—excuses such as
“All moneys collected from fines must be returned to the

I mentioned, pilot schemes on trading standards in Angus, East
Dunbartonshire and East Renfrewshire council areas saw call-blocking
technology installed on vulnerable consumers’ domestic phone

their lives and their safety. In its report, “Mind the
Gap”, Age Scotland has called for this scheme to be rolled out

people or a huge sum of money, so I issue a challenge today— and
not just to Government, but to local authorities, telecoms providers 
<?notus-xml column=1068?>and manufacturers of call-blocking technology. Surely together, we can
find the resources to protect these most vulnerable people in our

sympathy for Ministers—I do not often say that—because
this issue is undoubtedly a complex one that covers many areas and for
which there is no simple solution. As has been said, the scale of the
problem is huge and the data appear to be contradictory. The regulators
told the all-party group that they receive 6,000 complaints a month,
yet BT told us that it receives—the hon. Gentleman corrected the
figure I cited in an intervention—about 50,000 calls a month to
its nuisance calls bureau, so clearly there is a disconnect. The reason
why people are calling BT but not the regulators might be that many
still identify BT as the national phone operator, or it might be that
the regulators have failed to get the message across that they are
responsible for dealing with the problem. The situation is further
complicated by the fact that there are two regulators for different
aspects of the issue, although their websites direct to each
other’s as required. Part of the problem is that this situation
has gone on for so long that people have simply got fed up and no
longer trust the regulator to deal with it. That is serious, because we
need the regulators to work with the Government and get things
done.</hs_Para>

Preference Service for years, but I still receive many nuisance calls,
which are clearly targeted at specific times. In my house, we usually
receive them in the early evening. Often the person who has made the
call will start by uttering the immortal words, “We are not
trying to sell you anything,” to which the appropriate response
is to say, “Aye, right,” before putting down the
receiver. Sometimes, however, we receive so many calls in quick
succession that we do not answer the phone and leave the answering
machine to pick up the calls.</hs_Para>

up that I invested in one of BT’s fancy phones that allow people
to screen out such calls, but they are only a partial solution, because
they can screen out only certain types of call or specific numbers. For
example, it is possible to block all international calls or calls with
no caller identification, but that obviously presents difficulties, as
many organisations—including Parliament—withhold numbers
automatically, and many of my constituents have friends or family
members overseas and therefore cannot use the international facility.
The only other option is to block individual telephone numbers, but the
number that can be entered is very limited, so given the volume of
calls that can be received, that will not deal with the problem. It is
also difficult to find out what callers’ numbers are without
caller line identification, and many of the numbers appear to be bogus
in any event. Increasingly often, the CLI number turns out to be bogus,
especially if voice over internet protocol is used to generate a false
number.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000646" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000646">Of
particular concern is the number of elderly people who receive such
calls. Many of those who contact me feel that they are being
specifically targeted. That might well be true, although it is also
possible that they receive more calls because they are in during the
day. A recent trial of call-blocking technology by my local authority,
Angus council, found that 40% of calls received by the elderly were
nuisance calls. There is a serious problem that many elderly people who
receive such calls are persuaded to sign up for specific services or
contracts. In some cases, elderly people have signed up to numerous
contracts to insure the same washing machine, for instance, and found
themselves in a very difficult
position.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000647" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000647">Elderly
people are especially upset by silent or abandoned calls—when
they answer the telephone and no one is there. Unlike marketing calls,
which are the responsibility of the Information Commissioner, those
kinds of calls are the responsibility of Ofcom. Many elderly people
feel threatened and fearful when they receive such calls because they
do not understand that they are simply a marketing device. Regulations
under the Communications Act 2003 were intended to limit the number of
calls that are abandoned because no live agent is available to answer
them. They set out that a recorded message must be delivered when that
happens, but my experience of receiving such calls is that the line
often simply goes dead, with no recorded message, which is a clear
breach of regulations. Given that most nuisance calls are made during
the day, elderly people are more likely to receive silent calls. The 3%
limit for which the regulations provide still allows a huge number of
calls to be received by the elderly so that needs to be
tackled.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000648" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000648">Elderly
people may experience more specific problems. One of my elderly
constituents who had difficulty with her hearing received a call that
she thought was her energy company offering the renewal of a contract
involving her gas boiler. She was persuaded to provide her bank
details, and it was only later, when she thought about it, that the
call seemed a bit strange to her. A check with her energy company
confirmed that it had not made the call—indeed, it said that it
never made such calls—and my constituent had to go to the
trouble of rearranging her bank account to ensure that she was not a
victim of a scam. Luckily, no money left the account on that occasion,
but many people may be taken in by such calls.</hs_Para>

receive regular scam calls—emanating, I think, from
overseas—in which an agitated individual claimed that he was
from Microsoft. He said that my computer was sending a message that it
was under attack from a virus and urged me to enter codes to stop it. I
would not claim to be especially computer literate, but I am not that
daft, so the caller was given short shrift, but again it was impossible
to get details of who was actually phoning. That sort of scam might
well take in people who are not confident with computers but use them
for things such as internet shopping.</hs_Para>

such a call originated from overseas illustrates one of the huge
difficulties with this issue. The hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)
talked about calls coming in during the early hours of the morning, and
I wonder if the real reason is that an automated caller from overseas
has not correctly accounted for the time difference, because no one in
their right mind would try to sell something at 1 am. Whatever Ofcom
and the Government might do in this area, it is unlikely to have much
impact unless they can get co-operation and action from other
Governments and
regulators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000651" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000651">When
the all-party group asked BT whether it could block overseas nuisance
calls, it said that the vast majority of such calls do not carry caller
line identification, so it would not know what to block. It apparently
can block all calls without CLI, but it made the point that many
overseas networks do not support CLI, meaning that it would be blocking
all calls from certain parts of the world, which would clearly be
impractical.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000652" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000652">As
the hon. Member for Edinburgh West pointed out, many UK companies
operate overseas call centres that phone into the UK, which adds
another dimension to the problem of blocking overseas calls. These
companies must take some responsibility for the overseas call centres
that they operate—or, more likely, to which they give business,
as in some jurisdictions there are huge call centres that work for many
companies. Companies must have some responsibility to look at who they
are employing and to ensure that they are complying with
regulations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000653">Such
a huge international dimension can be dealt with only through
international agreement and action, so I will be interested to hear
from the Minister what progress is being made to tackle the problem,
and especially about what discussions have been undertaken with the
Governments and regulators in overseas countries such as India, which
host many of these call
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000654" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000654">The
all-party group also made it abundantly clear to BT that we thought
that it was inappropriate, to put it mildly, that it was in the process
of introducing a charge for its caller line identification service,
which had previously been free to many users. Of course it is true that
some companies, such as TalkTalk, do not charge, so consumers may wish
to consider that when they are arranging a service. However, it is also
the case that BT, through Openreach, operates far and away the largest
part of the network, and it probably still has the majority of
customers. What discussions has the Minister had with BT about that
issue and what pressure he can put on it to reconsider its decision? As
has been said, telephone companies can generate a great deal of revenue
from this practice, so some responsibility on their part would not go
amiss.</hs_Para>

many of us were quite surprised about some of the evidence about the
TPS. Clearly many people, including some members of the all-party
group, did not fully understand the terms of the system, especially the
fact that if someone ticks a box saying that they will be happy to
receive information from a company—or, indeed, that that company
may pass information on to other companies—that is treated as
overriding the terms of the TPS and can, it seems, open a huge new
range of companies that can legitimately telephone people. Clearly some
companies were using that loophole which, it seems to me, brings the
whole of the TPS into
disrepute.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000656" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000656">Indeed,
it appears that many companies are acting as phishing agents by
operating specifically for the purpose of obtaining information that
can be sold on to other companies—so-called lead generation.
That is an abuse of the regulations. We recommend action to clean up
that part of the industry through an accreditation scheme, but I feel
that we need to look at the situation much more closely and, in
particular, at how information about what will be done with the details
gathered is given to those targeted by such companies. Again, people
who take on services should be given a clear statement. The hon. Member
for Edinburgh West pointed out the difficulties about wording, but a
statement saying simply, “If you tick this box, your data will
be passed on and you may receive marketing calls,” would make it
clear to people what they were signing up to or not opting out of,
which would be a great step forward. Much of the problem could be dealt
with by giving people such clear statements.</hs_Para>

believe that any consent should be given for only a limited period. It
has been pointed out that when people give consent, it seems to last
for ever. Why should it not have to be renewed at regular intervals?
Someone might not remember ticking—or failing to tick—a
box when buying something on the internet in the distant past. They
might not realise that they had given their consent, and they will
continue to receive calls without realising why. We should reverse the
system to ensure that that consent had to be actively renewed. I wonder
how many people would do that, having received such calls for a
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000658" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000658">I
know that the Minister has been working on a strategy to deal with the
problem, and I would be interested to know what action the Government
are considering. I said at the outset that I had some sympathy with
him. I would not like to be the one who had to come up a system that we
could all work with and that satisfied everyone in the Chamber and in
the industry. However, this issue of huge concern to our constituents
needs to be tackled. Like the hon. Member for Edinburgh West, I
appreciate that an economic argument is involved. Some of my
constituents work in call centres. We have to strike a balance but, at
the moment, the balance seems to go against the people receiving the
calls, rather than those who are making them, and that needs to be
addressed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/61CE81811A83723A7439C722A2489413EB997096" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 January 2014">Thursday

John Whittingdale</B> (Maldon) (Con):</Member> I congratulate the hon.
Member for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart) on securing the debate. This
matter is clearly the cause of great annoyance and anger, and it
results in complaints from a large number of people. I suspect that
Members of Parliament are no different from any other member 
<?notus-xml column=1072?>of the public in this regard. I started getting calls some time ago
asking me whether I wanted to make a claim for having been mis-sold
payment protection insurance. I found that a little puzzling as I had
never had PPI, but I then discovered that the calls were made
indiscriminately and bore no relation to whether the recipients had
actually bought the product. That is probably the most common kind of
nuisance call, although it is not exceptional.</hs_Para>

to congratulate Which?<I> </I>It has been very effective in raising
awareness of this issue and has mounted a good campaign. I went on to
Radio 5 Live to debate the issue with some of the main regulators, and
the extent of the problem and the strength of feeling about it became
apparent from the calls to the programme. It was then that I suggested
the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport might investigate it.
The hon. Member for Edinburgh West and my hon. Friend the Member for
Vale of Glamorgan (Alun  Cairns) also founded the all-party
parliamentary group on nuisance calls, which has held its inquiry in
parallel with ours. All those investigations have contributed to the
recommendations that we will be debating.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000661" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000661">It is
important to point out that there are perfectly legitimate reasons why,
in principle, there should be cold calling. Some people have said that
we should just ban it, but, early in our inquiry, the National Autistic
Society pleaded with us not to do that, saying that cold calling was
one of its most effective fundraising methods. There are legitimate
reasons for cold calling, including fundraising and using it for
political purposes. We had an interesting debate in the Select
Committee when the right hon. Member for Exeter (Mr Bradshaw), who
cannot be here today, told us that about once a week he rang up a
number of his constituents at random to ask them their views and to
discuss whatever was going on at the time. We debated whether that came
under the definition of nuisance calling, and we decided that it did
not, because it was part of the job of a Member of Parliament to keep
in touch with his constituents. There are reasons why people should
make unsolicited calls, and I certainly would not want to ban
them.</hs_Para>

to assume that it is of some benefit to some people that they receive
calls to ask whether they have been mis-sold payment protection
insurance. One has to assume that these companies would not be making
these calls unless some people said, “I am so glad you rang.
Yes, I was mis-sold PPI and I would like you to help me.” If
these companies had got no custom and simply annoyed every person they
called, the exercise would seem fairly pointless. One therefore has to
assume that some people will welcome these calls, but that does not
justify the scattergun approach whereby these companies appear to be
calling millions of people across the population and identifying
perhaps one in 1,000 who welcome the call.</hs_Para>

was presented with compelling evidence—the hon. Member for
Edinburgh West referred to some of it—about the scale of the
problem: 85% of the population had received a cold call in the previous
month, with the average number of calls being about seven a month. That
is an enormous amount, and it is not surprising that the number of
complaints about this issue has increased dramatically in the past few
years. Some 62% of the unsolicited calls relate to PPI, so that
specific driver has led to a large number of the complaints.</hs_Para>

to repeat the hon. Gentleman’s comprehensive speech, as he went
through the various component parts of the problem and possible
solutions in detail. The Committee concluded that there was no single
magic bullet to deal with the problem; it could be broken down into a
number of different parts and in each case there was an argument for
strengthening the regulation and increasing the protection available to
consumers. I will briefly go through the four relevant areas, which
have been covered by him and by the hon. Member for Angus (Mr
Weir).</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000665" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000665">Like the hon.
Member for Angus, I understand why people who have gone to the trouble
of registering with the telephone preference service, having been told
that by doing so they will be sending a message that they do wish to
receive calls, are deeply irritated when they go on receiving them. We
were concerned to be told that even though somebody may register with
the TPS, that expression of their wish can somehow be deemed to have
been overruled because they happen to have ticked a box at another
time, often when they are buying a completely different product and are
asked whether or not they wish to receive marketing calls relating to
products from that producer or, indeed, from third parties. I was
interested to hear the results of the research that the hon. Member for
Edinburgh West had done on various companies’ practices as to
whether the default is to say that people want these things. That is
part of the problem: people register with the TPS, think that they have
made sure that they will not get any of these calls and then tick a
box, perhaps a few days or weeks later, which results in the expression
of their wish expressed through the TPS being overruled and in their
starting to get these calls again.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000666" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000666">One thing we
talked to the Information Commissioner’s Office about was the
extent to which companies should be able to claim that a TPS preference
had been overruled by a subsequent action. The ICO has already begun to
take on cases relating to that area, arguing that the consumer’s
wish has been improperly overlooked. There may be scope to do more,
particularly through the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC
Directive) Regulations 2003, which I am sure the Minister will mention.
The Committee also looked at whether there should be an expiry time:
where someone gives consent to say they are happy to receive these
calls, is that for time immemorial or should a renewal be required
after six months?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000667" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000667">The Committee
thought that the simplest solution, which I would like to see applied
more widely, is that where a complaint is made against a company for
making unsolicited calls, that company should be required to show the
consent—it should show why it has called that individual. The
company should be able to produce evidence to show that the individual
had given consent to be called, particularly if they were registered
under the TPS. That would be a simple requirement for the ICO to
enforce to deal with some of this confusion over whether consent had or
had not been given.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000668" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000668">The next
component is the technological opportunity to obtain information about
who is calling or to block people making calls. Ofcom published a
useful table that goes through all the various services offered by
different operators, such as caller display, incoming call 
<?notus-xml column=1074?>blocking, anonymous call rejection and last-caller identification. It
also shows whether the major providers offer those services and whether
they do so free or charge for them. As this has become such a matter of
public controversy and concern, it is healthy that operators are now
beginning to compete, as part of their own marketing, by telling
consumers the protections they offer.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000669" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000669">Yesterday,
TalkTalk announced that it is to become the first and only internet
service provider to make all landline privacy calling features
completely free. There may be some argument over whether other
operators offer free services or charge for them, but the fact that
TalkTalk clearly thinks it is in its interests to market its services
by offering such protections free to its customers can only be a good
thing. We were concerned when BT, having told us about the services
that it offers, particularly caller line identification, announced that
it was changing the terms of its contract and that some people would be
required to pay for that feature. That seemed a retrograde step.
Although it is a matter for BT, we none the less expressed a very
strong view that BT and all other telecoms providers should provide
that kind of service to their customers free, and that there are clear
market advantages in so
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000670" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000670">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh West also talked about the ease with which it
is possible to report a nuisance telephone call to one’s
telephone service provider. As it happens, I got one yesterday by text
message and I used the 7726 service, which is easy to use on a mobile
telephone. It was suggested to us, as it was to the hon. Gentleman,
that that was much more difficult to do with landline calls, but, as he
said, similar services are already available. For example, people can
dial a number as soon as they have received a call to ensure that it is
blocked next time. A reporting system of that kind should be relatively
simple to operate. I accept that there may be greater and different
challenges as we move towards more internet protocol telephony, but I
have every confidence that the telecommunications companies in this
country have the ability to overcome the challenges and develop
protections should they choose to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000671" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000671">The
Committee also looked at the confusion that undoubtedly exists over
where responsibility lies. There are different bodies, all of which
have some role in accepting complaints and enforcing regulations.
Although we did not agree with some people who said that there should
be a single regulator, we did think that there should be a single point
of entry for the consumer, so that the consumer does not have to sit
down and think, “Should I ring up Ofcom or go to the Information
Commissioner’s Office or the telephone preference
service?” There should be a single front-facing telephone number
for consumers, so that if they get a nuisance call, they can report it
and then the people at the other end of the phone can work out which is
the appropriate body to pursue the complaint.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000672" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000672">Finally,
there is the question of enforcement. It may well be that more
resources are needed to deal with the sheer volume of complaints. I
agree with the hon. Member for Angus that the number of people who
bother to make a complaint are a small fraction of those who suffer
nuisance calls. For every person who complains, there are at least
another 10 who feel that this is one of the irritations of life that
they can do 
<?notus-xml column=1075?>nothing about, and so do not bother to make a complaint. There is a case
for Ofcom and the ICO to concentrate more on this area and to deploy
more resources. To help them, it may also be necessary for us to lower
the threshold for enforcement action. It has been suggested that rather
than having a threshold that requires substantial damage and distress
to be proven, all that should be required is the ability to show that
it has caused annoyance, inconvenience and anxiety. Once that has been
demonstrated, perhaps there should be higher penalties. When there are
repeat offenders, repeat penalties should be imposed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000673" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000673">A large
number of different measures can be taken. No single one will sort the
problem out, but taken together they should have a real impact. They
were set out, very well, in the report by the all-party group. That
suggestion was repeated by my Select Committee, which made a number of
similar recommendations and one or two different ones. I hope that both
reports will have helped to inform the Government and we look forward

apologising to the House, as I will have to leave at 4 o’clock

congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart) on the
excellent campaign he has run and on his work on the all-party group on
nuisance calls, which I was pleased to support and contribute to,
albeit in a minor capacity. He has done well to bring the matter to the
attention of colleagues and it is also good that the Backbench Business
Committee understood how many complaints Members on both sides of the
House were receiving.</hs_Para>

the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport is also extremely
useful and I congratulate the Chair of the Committee, the hon. Member
for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale). Outside this House, excellent work has
been done by Which?,<I> </I>by David Hickson and by Ofcom. We debated
the issue about a year ago in Westminster Hall, but this
afternoon’s debate is better informed because of all the work
that has been done.</hs_Para>

the Select Committee is, of course, right that marketing calls are a
necessary means of reaching consumers in the modern world, but the
number of nuisance calls has exploded and seems to be up threefold
since 2010. The calls range from irritating spam texts to distressing
hard-sell calls for so-called services such as payday loans. As Mr
Speaker might say, the public do not like it. Which? has secured
109,000 signatures in support of its campaign. Such calls are the No. 1
complaint received by Ofcom and, as hon. Members have said, are a
particular issue for pensioners.</hs_Para>

survey found that 80% of people were affected by the problem and more
than half the people who sign up to the Telephone Preference Service
continue to receive nuisance calls. That brings into question the
effectiveness of the TPS. This is the sort of practical issue that any
competent Government ought to be able to sort out. There are no big
political issues here. It is a shame that the Government have not
introduced the communications Bill that they have been talking about 
<?notus-xml column=1076?>for more than three years, which could have dealt with the issue
speedily, and I am pleased that the House is taking a lead this
afternoon.</hs_Para>

key underlying issues is the Government’s failure to take
seriously the privacy of individual citizens and the protection of
personal data. Let me quote the second paragraph of the Select
Committee’s report, which expresses this extremely well. It
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14011656000880" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000880">“A
significant underlying feature giving rise to nuisance calls is the
unfair processing of personal data, something that is proscribed by the
Data Protection Act 1998. Such processing includes obtaining a
customer’s ‘consent’ to receive unsolicited
marketing calls in ways that are at best opaque and at worst dishonest.
It also includes trading personal data with companies lacking in
scruples.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14011656000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000680">The
problem runs far wider than nuisance phone calls. A key modern
marketing tool is the collection, use and selling on of personal data.
The Minister and I have debated that previously, because the Government
are currently resisting European Union proposals to give people more
effective control over their personal data. We still have not had a
proper explanation. Are they adopting a Eurosceptic posture, or are
they being lobbied heavily by big business? Neelie Kroes, the
commissioner responsible, proposes that an individual must give their
explicit consent for the use of personal data. It is significant that
the Select Committee has now reported that the current law is being
evaded and that new legislation is
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000681" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000681">The
Secretary of State for Justice described the EU proposals as
“mad”. I would like to ask the Minister whether the
Government have yet changed their mind and whether they will commit to
new legislation on the matter. It was good to see the right hon. Member
for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes), who has just been
appointed as a Justice Minister, here earlier. I have corresponded with
his predecessors on the matter but, frankly, found that rather
unsatisfactory. I hope that the officials in the Box will draw that
correspondence to his attention and ask him to look at the matter
again. I have high hopes that he will take a fresh look at it and place
greater emphasis on the importance of protecting people’s
personal
data.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000682" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000682">We
believe that new legislation is needed for explicit consent on a wider
definition of personal data, and we are attracted to the idea, put
forward by Which?, that there should be a time limit beyond which that
consent expires. Three months might be a little on the short side, but
I think that some sort of time limit would be a good idea. In the
meantime, as the Select Committee has said, the Information
Commissioner should use his existing powers more
energetically.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000683" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000683">A
key tool for people to make complaints and to protect themselves by not
answering unwanted calls is calling line identification. The privacy
package introduced by TalkTalk this week shows some of what is
possible. Furthermore, both the Select Committee and the all-party
group were right to criticise BT’s introduction of charges on
1571 calls and on caller display. At a time when the public are facing
a cost of living crisis, a monthly charge of £1.75 for CLI is
just another bill that people cannot afford. A bill of £21 a
year is quite unjustified. During the all-party group’s evidence
sessions, I asked what the cost of doing that across the board would
be, and the industry was unable to tell us. I have since learnt that,
depending on the technology, costs might range
between  
<?notus-xml column=1077?>zero and a one-off set-up cost of £1. For BT, therefore, it could
not possibly cost more than 0.4% of its total annual profits of
£2.5
billion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000684" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000684">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart) pointed out the full
range of charges currently being made by all the companies, from
£3 for this to £4 for that, and the numbers really add
up. Will the Government now act to require the provision of calling
line identification for free? We support the recommendation of the
Select Committee and the all-party group to do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000685" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000685">Prevention
is better than cure. Currently, the marketing sector is incentivised to
exceed the 3% abandoned calls rule and the withholding of caller ID,
even though that is part of the Direct Marketing Association’s
code of practice. The Select Committee recommends putting that code
into legislation. Will the Government now commit to doing
that?</hs_Para>

previous debate, we discussed the need for one single complaints portal
and a seamless operation, with data sharing between the ICO and Ofcom.
When will the Minister bring forward legislation to facilitate such
information-sharing between the two regulators? For the public, there
must be a one-stop shop, and obviously this must not be solely an
online service. It could be based on the co-regulatory model, funded by
industry, as proposed by the all-party group and the Select Committee,
not least because co-operation among the telephone companies would
facilitate the tracing of more calls. It would also be sensible to
lower the threshold for action from “substantial damage and
distress” to</hs_Para>

Information Commissioner. It is also worth ensuring that fines are
imposed on and paid by those exceeding the 3% abandoned calls
limit—and, as the Select Committee has said, persistent
offenders should be repeatedly
hit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000688" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000688">It
is absolutely clear from this debate that nuisance calls are a very
serious problem, especially for vulnerable and elderly people living at
home alone. People are upset to be offered so-called services they do
not and hope never to need, such as accident claims. They cause anxiety
and distress. Simple solutions that do not add to bills and the cost of
living crisis are needed. There seems to be an emerging consensus that
the Government need to toughen up the legislation. DCMS Ministers have
delayed in bringing forward a Bill, and I hope that the Minister will
now commit to doing so. The time  for research and reflection
has been fulfilled; the time for action is
now.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_16_PT_1/5956492E4605F9799F7007070A5504FE3F5F3ECC" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 January 2014">Thursday

in the late 1980s, when, as duty officer at the British high commission
in Nairobi, I was woken at 3 am by a gentleman on a crackling line from
the Indian ocean coast assuring me that he had a vital issue on which
he needed my help—he wanted to know the result of the previous
day’s Liverpool-Manchester United game, on which he had a small

about an issue that concerns Members in all parts of the House. The
hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman), in an otherwise
interesting speech containing two ideas on which I share her views, had
a brief go at trying to make it a party political debate, but it is not
that. Nor is it only a Scottish matter, as was somewhat suggested by
the hon. Member for Edinburgh West (Mike Crockart) being swiftly
followed by the hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir); it happens in all
parts of the country. I want to highlight a couple  of specific
issues and then outline three or four recommendations, at least one of
which has already been mentioned, for the Minister to mull over during
this important
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000691" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000691">In

as all hon. Members will know, the issues that Jill Smith raised with
me after she changed her telephone number and registered with the
Telephone Preference Service by no means represent an isolated case. If
we quantify her problem around the country, we see that it has
increased enormously. Statistics revealed by a written question to the
Minister at the end of last year show that the number of calls where a
recorded voice was heard increased from 1,640 in 2009 to 59,447 in
2013-14, and that the number of calls where a consumer spoke to a
person increased from 1,735 to 40,231. The increases in both cases were
very similar and there was an enormous, gigantic increase—a big
leap forward—in the leap year of
2012-13.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000693" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000693">The
situation has got worse and the hon. Member for Edinburgh West, whom I
congratulate on securing the debate, has highlighted that regulators
receive about 6,000 complaints a month. BT estimates that it receives
about 50,000 calls a month to its nuisance calls bureau, including, no
doubt, a large number of nuisance-like calls complaining about
significant nuisance calls, so the number of nuisance calls and
nuisance calls about nuisance calls becomes an increasingly circular
frustration and irritation for all involved. We all agree that the
worst affected are the elderly and the vulnerable. When it comes to
dealing with nuisance calls, the Ofcom online guide will not
necessarily help many of those worst affected, because they are not
online.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000694" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000694">During
the course of my research for this debate, I discovered—I am
sure many other Members found this, too—that regulatory
responsibilities are split between several agencies: Ofcom is
responsible for taking action on abandoned and silent calls and for
maintaining the TPS; the Information Commissioner’s Office takes
action against companies that breach the TPS and follows up on consumer
complaints; the claims management regulator has a responsibility,
because the vast majority of calls are from claims management
companies; the Office of Fair Trading regulates debt management
companies; the National Fraud Authority and/or the police are
responsible for taking action on scams and fraudulent activities; and
PhoneplayPlus is responsible for premium rate
numbers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000695" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000695">One
cannot help reaching the tentative conclusion that six different
bodies—seven, if one includes the TPS—is too many. It is
time for the Government to consider who is ultimately responsible for
tackling the 
<?notus-xml column=1079?>problem, which is a problem of practical politics rather than party
politics. It relates to implementation and reducing the number of
people who have some responsibility to a much smaller number with
complete responsibility. That is my first point, having looked into the
business of nuisance
calls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000696" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000696">My
second point relates to the TPS, which, in concept, is a brilliant
idea. There are 19.5 million numbers registered with the TPS and it is
free. It has to be a good thing, but the question is whether it is
still fit for purpose. The June edition of <I>Which?</I> said that the
TPS is failing to cut off nuisance calls—we all know that that
is true: Jill Smith’s letter makes that clear—which
leaves 57% of those registered with the service unhappy. The head of
the TPS, John Mitchison, told <I>The Guardian </I>last
year:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14011656000883" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000883">“It
has eradicated lots of unwelcome calls…But the rules are

priority.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14011656000697" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000697">Numbers
registered with the TPS have to wait 28 days before a breach counts,
which raises a practical question: could not the TPS be updated in real
time? On market research, perhaps it does not behove a politician to
suggest that it should be banned—legitimate opinion pollsters
have a role to play—but there is an
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000698" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000698">An
ICO review of the TPS was due this spring, but Ofcom has said that it
will now be released this summer. The definition of summer sometimes
stretches out during the course of a year, so the Minister will no
doubt want to comment on when he expects the review to be delivered. It
is important and I think it will lead to other opportunities, which I
will touch on in a
moment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000699">Another
point is about possible conflicts of interest. BT, which is keen to
block persistent offenders, is concerned about being in breach of the
universal service agreement. That area could perhaps be tightened
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000700" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000700">I
turn now to the whole business of trying to make recommendations about
how things could be improved. First, we can all agree that there are
too many nuisance calls and that the number ought to be reduced. We
know that our constituents want them to be eliminated or reduced as
much as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000701" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000701">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh West referred to the fact that some telephone
companies charge for services that ban numbers from ringing us,
particularly at home, which is disconcerting. I am encouraged, however,
by the fact that my hon. Friend the Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale)
mentioned a change in policy by TalkTalk, which suggests that it may
lead the way to other telephone companies recognising that such
services should be provided to consumers free of
charge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000702" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000702">Secondly,
on rationalisation of the regulators, there are too many bodies with
different responsibilities, and there is a need to simplify and clarify
the system. Thirdly, there is a particular opportunity to look at
whether the TPS should be a separate organisation or effectively merged
with the ICO. Fourthly, as a couple of speakers have mentioned, the ICO
currently has the ability to fine offenders, but the reality is that
one was fined in 2012 and three in 2013. I think that we all therefore
want the threshold to be lowered. Whether the change is a legal or a
practical one, nuisance callers should be fined on the basis of anxiety
and stress as defined by the consumer. That gives the Minister four
opportunities on which to respond.</hs_Para>

Glass</B> (North West Durham) (Lab):</Member> Nuisance calls are
probably the thing about which I receive most complaints over the year.
If I look at the number of contacts I get from my constituents, I
probably get more calls only in relation to badgers. Every time I go to
a luncheon club or a supported living scheme, or anything where elderly
people gather together, it seems as though getting nuisance calls is
the No. 1 thing that they want to talk about. Two elderly constituents
contacted me this week to tell me that they get such calls on average
about once an
hour.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000708" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000708">We
heard earlier about the very worrying trend of calls that are made
during the night. I do not know what it is like in other
Members’ houses, but at 10 o’clock at night,
if I am not in the Chamber for a debate or to vote, I am in bed. I am
an early riser, and I like to be in bed at 10 o’clock. If I get
a call after 10 o’clock, I am alarmed—I think,
“Oh, what’s wrong? It’s my mother. It’s the
grandkids.” That is how most of us feel if we get calls after 10
o’clock, so calls at 2.30 or 3.30 am involve an alarm factor. We
have also heard about elderly constituents’ concerns about being
confused or perhaps subject to falls after getting up in the middle of
the night, so if people are getting calls at that time, it represents a
worrying
trend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000709" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000709">My
elderly constituents tell me that they do not like marketing calls or
unsolicited texts, but that it is the silent calls that cause them the
greatest alarm. Quite honestly, if people are living alone, such calls
frighten them. I have received one or two silent calls myself and they
are not
pleasant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000710" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000710">I
sympathise with the Minister because the legislation is extremely
complex, although I did not realise quite how complex it was until I
heard the detailed speech made by the hon. Member for Edinburgh West
(Mike Crockart). I thought that I had a reasonable attention span, but
I could not follow his description through to its conclusion. I intend
to get hold of <I>Hansard</I> tomorrow because his contribution was
incredibly helpful, not least because he gave the numbers to which
people can report these matters. He gave a masterclass in how to take
the House through a complex area of legislation and regulation. Until
today, I was not entirely clear about who people should complain
to.</hs_Para>

asked constituents to get hold of a phone number so that I can refer it
on, they often tell me that it is withheld. We also have to remember
that people have incredibly busy lives. The Chair of the Culture, Media
and Sport Committee, the hon. Member for Maldon (Mr Whittingdale), said
that for everybody who makes a complaint, there will be 10 people who
do not have the time to do so, but I think that the figure is probably
closer to 50. When I receive these texts and get irritated by them, I
think to myself that I will complain, but then life piles in and I find
that I do not have the
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000712" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000712">There
appear to be problems involving enforcement and deterrence. The right
hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Sir Andrew Stunell) said that the people
who commission nuisance calls are “careless”. He was
absolutely right, as they could not care less, but they are not stupid,
so they are clearly making a profit out of the practice. Even if the
calls are illegal, they could not care less, because they continue to
make profits. There does not seem to be any deterrent or enforcement
that will make them
stop.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000713" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000713">We
have heard good suggestions of what the Government could do to deal
with this problem, including from the Chair of the Select Committee and
my neighbour, my hon. Friend the Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen
Goodman). However, I do not think that the problem will stop, so if it
does not, we simply have to hit the companies hard in the pocket. We
could name and shame companies. We saw what happened to companies such
as Starbucks when the public heard about their attitude to paying tax
in this country: people simply walked past and bought their coffee
somewhere else. Naming and shaming companies in a way that would have
an impact on their profits might be how to deal with the problem. If
this is to be taken seriously, we need to hit the people at the top of
these organisations and make an example of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000714" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000714">The
current situation is complex and what we are doing is not working. Our
constituents are being harassed on a daily basis. I am encouraged by
the body language of the Minister because he is indicating that he will
do something—that the time for talking is over and now is the
time for action. I hope that the debate will give the Government the
impetus they need to take action to prevent nuisance calls and protect
our constituents, especially our elderly
constituents.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14011656000908" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000908">3.58

got out of my hon. Friend’s contribution and those of other

troubling issue for my constituents. When my hon. Friend the Member for
Cheadle (Mark Hunter), my neighbour in Stockport, started to deal with
this matter for his constituents, he asked me whether we could have a
combined approach to support our constituents. We both organised
petitions for residents of our constituencies to make their case to us,
and the response that we got was overwhelming. People were fed up with
nuisance calls—whether automated recordings, calls from foreign
calls centres or silent calls. Whatever time of day or night they come,
they are overwhelmingly unpopular. They create trouble and difficulty,
and my goodness me, our constituents in Cheadle and Hazel Grove were
ready to tell us about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000718" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000718">Last
autumn, my hon. Friend and I presented to the Prime Minister at No. 10
a petition from the two constituencies asking for action to be taken. I
understand that it is in the gift of No. 10 as to whether the
Government will make a statement. I do not know whether the Minister
will disclose that decision to us today, but I hope that the petition
that we submitted will contribute to a positive answer from No. 10 very
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000719" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000719">I
wish to give the House a brief illustration of how pervasive nuisance
calls are. During the conference season, I was away from home for five
days. When I returned, my answer machine had 17 calls on it. On
examination, 16 of them were nuisance calls—silent and
pre-recorded calls. Some had a calling line identification, but
universally, if there was CLI, it was a spoof or incorrect. Half those
16 calls were silent, and I can well understand that for people more
vulnerable than I am, such as older people for whom the telephone is
still something of a new contraption, such calls must be a really
frightening experience. The Minister needs to take account of the
evidence that exists, both anecdotal and in
surveys.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000720" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000720">The
all-party group’s report—I perhaps should declare that I
was a member of the working party that produced it—said that,
looking at all the evidence, there could not be fewer than 1 billion
nuisance phone calls each year. My hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh
West cited another figure: according to the evidence that we received,
1 million people are employed in call centres. Taking those figures
together, it means that each call centre operative makes 1,000 nuisance
calls a year, which is a very small number—20 a week. I cannot
believe that any call centre employs people to make only 20 calls a
week, which prompts the question of whether that figure of 1 billion
nuisance calls is right and how many calls made from such centres are
not described as nuisance calls but instead produce a good
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000721" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000721">When
the group took evidence in our inquiry, I had the opportunity to speak
to a representative of one of the major network operators, who offered
me his estimate that at some times of day, a quarter of all the traffic
carried on his network consisted of nuisance calls. I have no way of
knowing the validity of that information, but it gives some idea of the
industrial scale of what is going on and the impact that it can have on
our constituents. It certainly has a big impact on the elderly and on
my constituents, who have been keen to say
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000722" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000722">In
case it has not already become evident to the Minister, I want to tell
him that there is a huge gap between best practice and normal practice.
For instance, the rulebook states that if a silent call has
inadvertently 
<?notus-xml column=1083?>been made to a number, no subsequent silent call should be made to that
number for another 72 hours. I do not believe for a moment that any
call centre operates that 72-hour ban. It is
incredible that they can, bearing in mind how many silent calls people
receive on the same day, one after another. Silent calls are supposed
to be not more than 3% of the total calls made by operators or call
centres. It is difficult to believe that that is being complied with.
If all call centres operated the 3% rule, 97% of calls would not be
silent, but that is transparently not the case. The 72-hour rule and
the 3% rule are not being
obeyed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000723" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000723">Calling
line identification is verging on useless. Some companies phone with no
identification and some have spoof identifications. I have had endless
calls on my phone from 012345, 00000 and so on. Clearly, the system is
not working in that
respect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000724" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000724">As
other hon. Members have said, reporting problems is a nightmare. There
is no simple system and there are multiple ways to complain. Who people
phone up and what they are supposed to do depends on what kind of call
they have suffered. Understandably, my constituents either do not know
who they should call or have no confidence that anything will happen if
they call. In evidence to the Culture, Media and Sport Committee, ICO
staff said pretty much that there was little likelihood of an
individual complaint resulting in any action against an
operator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000725" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000725">Several
hon. Members have mentioned problems with TPS, which is widely bypassed
and ignored by those who phone up. It is certainly not effective. I am
on TPS, but that did not prevent the calls I received in that
conference week. Essentially, it is a commercial service run by the
Direct Marketing Association that operates on the basis of trust,
without any practical teeth that will produce an outcome. It is also
based on extremely old-fashioned technology, which means that it
takes 28 days for the system to click and become effective
after people have registered. That does not help large numbers of
people, even assuming that the system works properly when it is
activated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000726" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000726">By
way of conclusion, I want Government action. I want to see the action
plan in spring—in civil service terminology, it is due shortly.
When I was a Minister, I once asked for the definition of

hope that, when we have the action plan, the Minister will say
something about bringing the regulators together. The all-party group
report makes the point that we could waste quite a lot of time
physically uniting them in one organisation, but we need a joined-up
regulatory system, with all the sources of information going into one
place and with one group of people looking at whether there is a
pattern in an area of activity so that we do not have the current
fragmentation at the operating end of the regulatory system.</hs_Para>

Government to say that the CLI service should be provided by all
operators for free. I also want the Minister to say that Ofcom will be
permitted to allow the blocking of rogue numbers by telecoms firms.
That seems to me to be how to teach those people a lesson. The industry
can get TPS working properly and quickly. There does not seem to be any
reason why some of the better technological solutions should not be in
place very quickly and working well. We also need a short code that

it turned out simply to be information he could have received from me,
the business gateway or someone in the local authority’s
economic development department, without parting with any cash. In such
cases, as when elderly people and others sign up for things over the
phone, when people discover it is a scam, they are often embarrassed to
admit to it, and so do not come forward. I am sure there are many

subject to a range of marketing from several different companies, not
just the one company they are dealing with. Also, there is the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (Mr
Edward Vaizey):</Member></B> I am grateful for the chance to respond to
the debate, which I congratulate the hon. Member for Edinburgh West
(Mike Crockart) on securing. It is worth noting the contributions of
three hon. Members who are not present. My hon. Friend the Member for
Vale of Glamorgan (Alun Cairns), whom the hon. Member for Edinburgh
West mentioned, is co-chairing the all-party group on nuisance calls.
When the date of this Back-Bench debate was changed, it meant he could
not be here, but he has put a huge amount of work into the issue and
would have liked to be present. For good reasons, the hon. Member for
Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) cannot be here for the debate’s

of the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend the
Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes), who was in his
place earlier, was significant, because it showed that one 
<?notus-xml column=1087?>of those rare, almost unheard of events had taken place—joined-up
government. When the new Minister was appointed
over Christmas, I reached out, made a nuisance call to him out of the
blue and told him that I would be very pleased if he would engage with
me on this issue. He certainly has engaged with me, and I look forward
to working with him more, as he gets his feet under the desk. Joined-up
government between the Ministry of Justice and the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport is highly important. As many hon. Members have
pointed out, this is a complex regulatory landscape, involving two
regulators—Ofcom, for which my Department is responsible, and
the Information Commissioner’s Office, for which my right hon.

put an end to any speculation from the outset—I know that hon.
Members are on tenterhooks—let me say that the strategy document
is ready to go. It was originally due to be published on 31 October. I
discovered that if a Minister tells officials that a document will be
published on a certain date, the work starts to crank up exponentially.
I congratulate my officials on their excellent work over the period to
hit that deadline. We were ready to publish then, but we decided to
wait for the all-party group on nuisance calls to conduct its report
because a lot of hard work had gone into it. We said that we would also
wait for the Select Committee report, which came out at the beginning
of December. Once those two reports had been published, we incorporated
their findings in our strategy document, which then began its meander
around Whitehall for clearance. One thing that we inherited from new
Labour is the grid—the grid that sits in Downing street: the
holy grid—and we are waiting for a slot in that grid, which, I
assure Members, is harder than finding a slot at Heathrow. However, the
document is ready to go, and I shall now reveal to Members what,
broadly speaking, is in
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000750" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000750">We
all agree that nuisance calls are a menace. I was extremely grateful to
some Members for saying that they sympathised with my position and
recognised that I was working hard in trying to make an impact on the
problem. They did not need to say that, and it was very kind of them to
do so. I was also grateful to the Members who pointed out that the
direct marketing industry is valuable to the UK economy. We must not
throw the baby out with the bathwater—we must recognise that a
legitimate industry is doing a legitimate job—but make no
mistake: as is clear to all Members who have done so much work on the
issue, nuisance calls are a scourge that needs to be tackled.</hs_Para>

Member for Bishop Auckland observed that the number of such calls
seemed to have increased significantly. That is partly because it has
become easier to report them, but I suspect that it is also due to the
increase in the number of calls relating to payment protection
insurance, which has, in a sense, been a unique phenomenon, in that it
has provided an opportunity for—perhaps—the more careless
members of the industry to seek ways of making an income.</hs_Para>

three categories of nuisance call. Both live, unsolicited marketing
calls, when someone—a real person—rings up out of the
blue, and automatic pre-recorded calls are covered by the Privacy and
Electronic Communications (EC Directive) Regulations 2003, and fall
within the scope of the Information Commissioner. Silent and abandoned
calls—automatic calling machines repeatedly make the calls, but
when one picks up the receiver no one is there—are covered by
Ofcom, which can tackle them by means of its powers to oppose the
persistent misuse of networks under the Communications Act 2003. We
have increased the maximum fine that Ofcom can impose for silent and
abandoned calls from £50,000 to £2 million, and have
given the Information Commissioner’s Office the opportunity to
impose a fine of up to £500,000 for unsolicited calls and texts.
My hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester mentioned my letter to him, in
which I referred to the need for enforcement. The powers are there to
make an impact, and since January 2012, Ofcom and the ICO have issued
fines amounting to £2. 5 million.</hs_Para>

more can we do? As a number of Members have pointed out, the legal

order to improve the working relationship between Ofcom and the ICO we
also want to make it possible for Ofcom to share the data it has with
the ICO, which is not possible at the moment. We will introduce a
statutory instrument. That order will be brought into force by the
beginning of April. We will look at consent. That will be in the
strategy document as well. Members have rightly pointed out that there
is frustration with the telephone preference service but again the
frustration 
<?notus-xml column=1089?>partly arises from the fact that consumers may not realise they are
giving consent and therefore effectively allowing the marketer to
override the

PECR states that a marketing call cannot be made to a consumer who has
registered with the TPS unless consent has been given. The ICO has
updated its guidance on this issue, but I accept there is scope for
greater clarity to help consumers make informed decisions. We are
considering the scope for action in this area and once we have
published the strategy document we will launch a hands-on consultation
working with consumer groups, particularly Which?, which has been
excellent in the area of nuisance calls, and our regulators to look at
a practical way forward. Incredibly complicated regulations could
inadvertently be brought in were we to introduce detailed regulations
about when informed consent is given. If we are to change the
regulations, it is important that we get them absolutely right and that
they are clear and not
confusing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000760" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000760">Many
Members have made the point that there is no silver bullet and I
thought the Select Committee report was excellent on that. For example
it is easy to say we should just merge the regulators, but when we look
into the issues, we see the situation is much more complicated than
that and we are much more likely to make more rapid progress by simply
making the regulators work together.</hs_Para>

and fast-moving environment, it is also important that we look at what
measures we can take without legislation. With developments in telecoms
technology, it is now easier and cheaper than ever before to make
calls. That is good news for consumers, but rogue companies can also
utilise the same technology to circumvent regulation and bombard us
with unsolicited calls and texts. We therefore need to look at not just
legal measures, but industry collaboration, technical standards, and
support from telecoms
providers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000762" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000762">We
also want improved information and guidance for consumers, to enable
them to register complaints on regulators’ websites more easily
and also access information about steps they can take to deal with
nuisance calls. This information is available, and the guides have been
viewed more than a quarter of a million—or perhaps I should say
250,000, as I think that is the new parliamentary expression pioneered
by the Leader of the Opposition yesterday—times and are clearly
proving to be a valuable tool. Additionally, as a result of our
engagement with the consumer organisation Which? it has now developed a
user-friendly page on its website whereby consumers are automatically
directed to the right place to access information as well as to make
complaints. In addition to issuing fines, the ICO “names and
shames” persistent offenders on its website so that consumers
are better informed about those who break the
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000763" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000763">I
mentioned earlier the upswing in the number of nuisance calls. I think
that has been generated by the payment protection insurance sector.
There is an alphabet soup of regulators with a role in this area, and
that sector is regulated by the claims management regulation unit.
Through our engagement with it, it has put more resources into tackling
the problem of unsolicited calls and text messages to ensure that it
can move more quickly to investigate and take enforcement action. It is
working actively with the ICO, Ofcom and other relevant 
<?notus-xml column=1090?>bodies to detect and punish those involved. I welcome the action it has
taken and continues to take against claims management companies that
fail to comply with the rules. From June of last year it started to
publish the names of companies under investigation or subject to recent
enforcement action. Between July and September 2013, it conducted 41
audits, issued 25 warnings, commenced 11 investigations, cancelled 109
licences and visited 407 claims management companies.</hs_Para>

introducing measures it is important that Government start to think
about what impact they might have on nuisance calls. For example, the
ban on referral fees in personal injury cases appears to have had the
knock-on effect of reducing the volume of marketing calls to potential
clients, because claims management companies can no longer receive a
fee for referring client details. The claims management regulation unit
is actively policing the ban on referral fees, in addition to the ban
on claims management companies offering financial
rewards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000765" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000765"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Lazarowicz" PimsId="1440" UID="14011656001274" xid="351" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656001274">Mark

consumers will be charged for services that could help them to tackle
nuisance calls—in particular, caller line identification, call
barring and anonymous caller rejection. This is clearly a commercial
decision for companies, but it is important that consumers are aware of
whether those services are being charged for and how much they cost, so
that they can look into which telecoms companies are offering the best
deal.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000770" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000770">In that
regard, I am pleased that, at the end of last year, Ofcom published a
table setting out the cost of such services provided by the main
telecoms companies. I hope that that will make the companies realise
that this is a service that their consumers value. I welcome
TalkTalk’s announcement yesterday that it is to become the first
company to make all its landline privacy calling features free of
charge, and I hope that the other telecoms companies will have noted
the clear, strong steer from Members in the debate today that charging
for those services is not a good idea.</hs_Para>

have also mentioned international calls. It is particularly frustrating
when nuisance calls are made from abroad, and it is therefore good news
that we are working with BT on finding a way to display incoming
international numbers, enabling consumers to make informed decisions.
Hon. Members might be angry with BT for charging for caller line
identification, but I hope that they will congratulate the company on
updating its telephone exchanges to enable that service to encompass
international calls. That update is expected to take place after the
summer of this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000772" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000772">We
have also been working with the telecoms providers on call tracing. It
is sometimes difficult to identify who has made a call, perhaps because
the number is unavailable. But we have asked the Network
Interoperability Consultative Committee, which brings together all the
major telecoms companies, to develop new industry standards for call
tracing between networks, as well as revising the current rules on how
caller line identifications are passed between networks and presented
to consumers. The new call tracing standard was published at the end of
last year, and it will simplify and increase the likely success of the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000773" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000773">We
also face other technological challenges, for example, from technology
that allows numbers to be “spoofed”. Companies may wish
to give customers a local number to call rather than the number of
their national centre and so this technology can be used for legitimate
reasons, but it can also be misused for nuisance calls. So, again, we
are working with regulators and industry to see how that can be
addressed. We are also working with the regulators and telecoms
providers to explore technical opportunities to make it more difficult
to misuse caller line identification in that way, and to help identify
companies that are doing so. The spoofing issue has an international
dimension, and last autumn Ofcom and the Information
Commissioner’s Office announced that they would be joining
forces with regulators from Australia, Canada and the United States to
tackle
spoofing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000774" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000774">The
issue of nuisance texts has been raised during the debate. Mobile
operators, the Global System for Mobile communications
Association—GSMA—and the ICO are working together to
allow mobile operators to share 
<?notus-xml column=1092?>their information to help block nuisance texts, no matter which network
they emerge from, as well as to enable the regulator to take more
effective enforcement action. The GSMA spam text reporting service
enables consumers to make a report by using a short code,
“7726”. Such reporting makes a difference. To give just
one example, we have been told by the mobile operator Three that it
suspends thousands of pay-as-you-go accounts each month in its efforts
to tackle nuisance texts. As in many cases, the expertise to tackle
such issues lies in the industry, which is why it is so important that
we continue to work with it. The marketing industry also needs to play
its part. Last October, the Telephone Preference Service launched its
accreditation scheme, “TPS assured”, which focuses on
improving the best practice of companies using these techniques. That
is, in effect, a kitemark for call centres; it allows companies that do
adhere to the Direct Marketing Association guidelines to get an
industry accreditation that they are TPS assured and to use it in their
marketing material.</hs_Para>

Members have mentioned their concerns about the effectiveness of the
TPS. As I said at the beginning of my remarks, some things were beyond
the control of the TPS and it is up to the Government, working with
consumer groups, to look at the issue of consent. We need to have clear
and specific information to guide our thinking on the effectiveness of
the TPS. The TPS is governed by Ofcom, although Ofcom has contracted
out its management to the DMA. Ofcom is undertaking research on the
effectiveness of the TPS and that work will conclude in the spring. We
expect Ofcom to publish its recommendations in the
summer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000776" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000776">Let
me touch on some of the other actions being taken. Regulators, the ICO
and Ofcom sent a joint letter to about 170 organisations reminding them
of the need to ensure compliance with the rules. The ICO has engaged
with more than 20 organisations responsible for making nuisance calls
through compliance meetings and has monitored their progress over a
period of three months. As a result, there was a substantial reduction
in the number of complaints about those 20 companies. Ofcom has also
taken informal action against 25 organisations. As a result,
complaints linked to  telephone numbers used by 16 of them
stopped and  the number of complaints against five others fell
significantly—four cases are ongoing. Again, I wish to assure
hon. Members that although the fines get the headlines, a lot of
behind-the-scenes work is going on, with both Ofcom and the ICO
engaging with organisations that attract a persistent and high number
of complaints.</hs_Para>

very aware of the concerns raised by the StepChange Debt Charity in its
October report “Got their number”, which highlighted the
serious consequences that can arise from nuisance calls for people who
are financially vulnerable. That report notes that there are many
factors that feed into this issue, including the apparent ease with
which people’s personal data can be gathered and sold on. The
hon. Member for Bishop Auckland also mentioned her concerns about
personal data. Again, the issue highlights the need for my Department
to work more closely with the Ministry of Justice. There should be a
joined-up approach to data management in this
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000778" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000778">I
share the concerns that regulators should be able to take greater
action, and I hope that the information-sharing legislation that we
will introduce as well as the proposals 
<?notus-xml column=1093?>in the joint action plan published by Ofcom and the ICO will lead to
more action in this area. I take this opportunity to welcome
StepChange’s efforts to provide clear advice for consumers and
also its willingness to promote Ofcom’s guidance on nuisance
calls.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000779" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000779">As
I said at the beginning of my remarks, I welcome the interest that has
been shown in this issue. We have an excellent report from the
all-party group on nuisance calls. Both Backbench debates today have
highlighted the effective work that all-party groups can undertake. We
also have an excellent report from the Culture, Media and Sport
Committee. We have also had a number of private Member’s Bills,
parliamentary questions and sustained and helpful interest from a whole

hope that we have shown that we have some clear proposals, which we
will publish once they have received clearance in the Whitehall
write-around. We expect that to involve two pieces of minor
legislation, which should make a significant impact in terms of
allowing Ofcom and the ICO to share data and of reducing the threshold
for what constitutes a nuisance call. Further work will commence on the
complex issue of consent, which is a live issue. It is an important
matter. Indeed, the chairman of the all-party group challenged me at a
meeting yesterday about what action would be taken after the report was
published. I made a twofold commitment to him. I will continue my wider
round-table discussions every three months, bringing together all the
relevant stakeholders, telecoms companies, Members of Parliament,
regulators and others. I also committed that the Minister of State,
Ministry of Justice, my right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and
Old Southwark and I would meet him once a month for an update on where
we are on making progress on action against nuisance calls. As has been
said by several Members during this debate, the time for talking is

play a significant role in all our communities—80% of people in

Robertson:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right, and I shall come
on to some of those points as we move on. There is no doubt that larger
post offices—and even sub-post offices, for that
matter—are shutting. When I spoke at a conference for
sub-postmasters from Glasgow and Ayrshire, they let me know exactly how

transformation, we still will not have an attractive model for current

than to make the network sustainable in the long term. That is of great
concern to the many people

sale of Royal Mail was of course resisted by the Opposition. Last
week’s news that its share price was
£5.67—£2.37 above the Government’s offer

It was an ideological move, not a financially sensible or
thought-through one. The separation of the Post Office and Royal Mail
has added millions of pounds in costs to the Post Office due to loss of
synergies. No other postal administration in a developed economy has
separate letters and retail
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000800" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000800">The
sale has now been done, but we must still consider Royal Mail in our
strategy for the future of the Post Office. Just under 40% of Post
Office revenues come from mail, so it is a significant part of the
business. I was glad that, in January 2012, the Government caved into
pressure and signed the 10-year inter-business agreement between Royal
Mail and the Post Office, but there is no guarantee beyond 2022. The
position is also not secure for the next 10 years, as the
Minister’s own Department has said that the contract allows for
changes in commercial circumstances and contains provision for a review
of the agreement terms after five years. The 10-year agreement would
therefore appear to be for only five years, but hopefully the next
Government will be of a different colour and will put right some of
these short-term ideological
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000801" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000801">It
is a real concern that Royal Mail might not continue to support the
post office network. The loss of that contract would seriously
undermine the Post Office’s integrity as a mail delivery
service. Were that to happen, people would lose confidence in the
institution and the future of many post offices would be at risk,
especially the largely loss-making ones in rural areas, such as the one
represented by the hon. Member for Angus. Privatisation is a risk to
Post Office services and we need more guarantees for the decades to

post office is a place where people can go to fill in Government forms
or to pay for Government services. It is important for both customers
and employees that the Government continue to give the Post Office
sufficient work. This Government announced in 2010 that post offices
would become the “Front Office for Government”, but
actions speak louder than words. They promised to give post offices

that the Minister will say that the Post Office has won all the
Government contracts it has bid for, but those were contracts it
already had, not new ones. No new major services have been awarded to
post offices, and the National Federation of SubPostmasters has stated
that the few that have been introduced are for one-off transactions
that are available in only a small number of post offices. Dangerous
precedents have been set by not awarding Government contracts, and the
future of the Post Office is in jeopardy as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000804" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000804">Linked
to that, we need to ensure that post offices are not disadvantaged
compared with other methods of using Government services. For example,
if I wanted to pay my road tax online, I could bring up all the
details—whether my car had its MOT and insurance, for
example—via an online portal. I would not need to go looking for
documents, as the information would already be on the system. However,
until very recently, post offices could 
<?notus-xml column=1097?>check only a car’s MOT, so people would have to bring in their
insurance documents. It is clear that those who could choose to use
the internet over having that
inconvenience would do so. After all, who wants to have to carry around
their documentation to ensure that they get their road tax? Thankfully,
in this case, somebody has seen sense, so post offices can now check
insurance as well, but the internet was well ahead on that, and that
should be lesson for future online services. Post offices do not need
to have an advantage—in fact, sub-postmasters tell me that they
do not want it—but they should have at least
a level playing field. People should be able to use the post office to
access Government services with the same ease as on the internet. The
decision not to award the green giro contract to the Post Office was
another example of how the future of the

a thing is also relevant when we talk about the Post Office’s
announcement last year that it is to franchise several Crown post
offices. There is a lot of concern, particularly among the vulnerable
people I have mentioned, that certain services will no longer be easily
available to local people, leading to an inferior service for our
constituents and the loss of one-to-one help from specially trained and
committed post office staff. We must also bear in mind the livelihoods
of hard-working staff in Crown post offices. Post Office Ltd appears to
have handled this very badly through a lack of consultation with staff,
unions and key stakeholders, which resulted in a strike. About 800 jobs
are at risk due to franchising, but that does not seem to have been
considered during the decision-making process. Have the Government
learned from this and how will the Minister proceed with franchising?
Can she explain why the Crown branch section of the network should
receive no public funding at all and yet hit break-even by April 2015
when other sections of the network will continue to receive public
funding after this date? Many Crown branches are
in  
<?notus-xml column=1098?>the poorest and most disadvantaged parts of the country. A more
realistic timetable would balance the need to protect services and jobs
with financial
sustainability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000813" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000813">We
should be thinking about how we could increase the number of Government
services available in post offices. Many people prefer to carry out
transactions with the UK Government, devolved Administrations and local
authorities online. Crucially, however, those who do not have the
internet are the most vulnerable. Some 53% of people who have never
used the internet have a disability. Around 37,000 people on low
incomes in Scotland have never used the internet, while only 33% of
adults over 65 have the internet in their home. These people need
another option, and post offices are a clear choice: 43% of over-65s
use a post office at least once a week, as well as 37% of people with
disabilities and 31% of those in the D and E socio-economic
groups.</hs_Para>

much more difficult for such people to move on to other ways of
accessing services. The post office could act as a one-stop shop for
people to sort out all these services in one go. Post offices are the
natural home for local government services, and that approach could
save money, improve public services and increase post offices’
footfall, although it would require co-ordinated work between local
authorities and devolved Administrations. If the Government are so
committed to making the Post Office the front line of Government, what
is the Minister going to do to encourage councils and devolved
Administrations to transfer their contracts
over?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000815" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000815">We
should also look at widening the range of services provided by post
offices. We were hugely disappointed that our plans for a
people’s bank were abandoned in 2010. Post offices provide local
access to cash and banking services, and that is particularly important
in rural areas and areas such as those in my constituency with high
levels of elderly people. The potential of such services is not being
realised. Post offices should have full access to all high street bank
accounts, but some banks have not been
forthcoming.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000816" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000816">In
the long term, the possibility of a state-backed bank at the post
office should be explored. There is evidence that that could be of
great benefit to the Post Office, as New Zealand Post has seen its
profits surge by nearly 70% thanks to its financial services arm,
Kiwibank. Such a bank could also be massively beneficial in combating
payday loan companies and high-cost doorstep lending by being linked to
credit unions and providing affordable credit directly to the
communities that our post offices
serve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000817" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000817">The
post offices of our communities need to be saved. They provide vital
services, the reduction of which is of great concern to workers and the
vulnerable people who rely on their post office. Action on the idea of
a front office for Government is lacking when we need it most, and
there has been no initiative from this Government to widen the impact
of post offices. We need action, and we need it fast if we want to save
this national institution, rather than let it be sold off for a quick
buck like Royal
Mail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000818" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656000818"><B><Member ContinuationText="Madam Deputy Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="243" UID="14011656001284" xid="484" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0003.htm#14011656001284">Madam

congratulate the hon. Member for Glasgow North West (John Robertson) on
securing this debate on an important subject. Despite the lack of
Members present, the issue comes up regularly, and on most occasions a
significant number of Members want to discuss the critical role that
post offices play in all our local communities. The post office is much
more than just a commercial entity. As the hon. Gentleman has said, it
is important to hundreds of thousands of small businesses, which rely
on it every day, as well as to the millions of customers who use the
network for a range of services. I agree with the hon. Gentleman that
post offices are particularly crucial to elderly residents, those on
low incomes and the disabled, who make particularly good use of them in
our
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000821" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000821">In
November 2010, we announced a funding package of the historic amount of
£1.34 billion to guarantee the size of the network until 2015
and to end the closure programmes run by the hon. Gentleman’s
Government, which led to the closure of 7,000 branches under the
previous Administration. In November 2013, we announced our continued
support of the network with a further £640 million to secure and
continue its modernisation until 2018. That makes clear the
Government’s commitment to the post office and its future
success. Contrary to what the hon. Gentleman has said, that recent
investment is a vote of confidence in the post office network and it is
helping to move it to a more sustainable and secure long-term
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000822" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000822"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Weir" PimsId="4556" UID="14011656001286" xid="626" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656001286">Mr

the Post Office, which is a separate entity, but the Government are
very clear that we want to maintain 11,500 branches in the post office
network across the country. That means ensuring that we maintain a
branch in all communities that currently have branches, and the level
of knowledge and expertise that exists among many sub-postmasters, who
are extremely well embedded in their communities and extremely well
known and trusted by members of their local community. That is one of
the elements that make the post office so important in many of our
communities, especially in rural or more deprived areas, where many

Gentleman. The vast majority of services available in post office
branches across our communities will still be available. I cannot
remember the exact figures—I hope that he will forgive
me—but well over 90%, perhaps even 95%, of the services that
people can currently access in their branches will still be available
under the new models. There will still be every reason for people to
carry on using their post offices, which will serve their communities
in exactly the same way: the model will be slightly different, but they
will provide just as vital a service to members of our communities as
they currently
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000829" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000829">The

the hon. Gentleman said in his speech, the new models are attractive. I
understand that he and the hon. Member for Angus (Mr Weir) both have
concerns, but the models are attractive to those running post office
branches. Some 2,500 sub-postmasters have already converted, or have
signed contracts to convert, their branches to one of the new operating
models. They have received investment to modernise and improve their
branches, which will bring benefits not just to them in running their
businesses, but to the consumers they serve and the communities in

network, there are an additional 34,000 opening hours a week, which is
equivalent to 700 more traditional post offices. The programme of
investment will see the modernisation and protection of all branches by
2018, ensuring that every community and customer that relies on access
to a post office today will continue to have access to post office
services in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000833" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000833">The
Government have ensured that all sub-postmasters can benefit from the
investment. For the first time, a dedicated fund has been set up for
post office branches that are important to the communities they serve,
but where one of the new models would not be viable. That is an issue
in large, remote rural areas, such as those in Scotland, where the post
office is often the last shop in the village, as it were. The community
fund to ensure that those post offices are kept open is a real
departure. It will protect those branches well into the future and
ensure that people have access to post office services. That is
particularly important in areas where the post office provides an
important service to more vulnerable
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000834" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000834"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Weir" PimsId="4556" UID="14011656001294" xid="626" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656001294">Mr
Weir:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for giving way yet again; I do
not want to push my luck too far. I remember taking this matter up with
the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) when she announced
the fund. The fund is for doing work on the post office to make it
better, but that is not the difficulty in many of these very small post
offices. The difficulty is that the postmaster’s income is
simply insufficient. Postmasters want to keep going, but there is
nothing in the fund to give them an uplift in their income to help the
post office survive. The fund is for physical changes to the post
office, which is not the issue at most of the post offices we are
discussing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000835" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000835"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jenny Willott" PimsId="4848" UID="14011656001295" xid="818" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656001295">Jenny
Willott:</Member></B> I will come on to talk about income and the
services that we are supporting in post offices to ensure that they are
viable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000836" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000836">The
hon. Member for Glasgow North West spoke about Crown post offices. As
he mentioned, the funding package that was set out in 2010 required the
Post Office to eliminate its substantial losses. In 2012-13, 
£37 million of losses were incurred by the 373 branches 
<?notus-xml column=1102?>that made up the Crown segment of the network. It is a key part of the
Post Office’s strategy to make the network sustainable in the
long term. The Government support the business in delivering that
strategy. The current losses of the Crown network contribute a third of
the losses incurred by the network as a whole. That is clearly
unsustainable. No business, including the Post Office, can maintain a
situation in which its high  street branches cost substantially
more to run than they bring
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000837" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000837">As
part of its strategy to eliminate the unsustainable losses, the Post
Office identified about 70 branches where there is no prospect of
eliminating the losses at a local level under the current structure. In
those locations, it is seeking a suitable retail partner to take on the
operation of the branch under a franchise arrangement. The Post Office
has made it clear that under each franchise proposal, the full range of
current post office services, including the more complex transactions
such as passport applications and identity services, will continue to
be available in close proximity to the existing Crown branch. In the
event that a suitable retail partner cannot be found, Post Office Ltd
has given a commitment that a post office service will be retained in
the area. I hope that what I have said reassures the hon. Gentleman
that communities will not lose these vital local
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000838" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000838"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Robertson" PimsId="401" UID="14011656001296" xid="504" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656001296">John
Robertson:</Member></B> The hon. Lady has not reassured me at all, I am
afraid. Some of the Crown post offices that are closing are in areas
where people simply cannot get about. There is no transport to get to
where the new post office is because the bus services have been cut.
How are those people supposed to get to the facilities that they need?
They cannot go online because they do not have a computer and they
cannot afford
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000839" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000839"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jenny Willott" PimsId="4848" UID="14011656001297" xid="818" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656001297">Jenny
Willott:</Member></B> The Post Office operates to the strict criteria
that 90% of the population must live within a mile of a post office and
95% within three miles. Although there may be some changes to the exact
buildings in which branches are provided, as I said, services including
the more complex ones available at Crown branches will still be
available in the area. We are maintaining the access criteria so that
more than nine out of 10 people will live within a mile of a post
office. We recognise that more vulnerable members of the community in
particular will find it hard to travel longer distances to access
services, so we are ensuring that they are maintained
locally.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000840" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000840">The
investment that is being made is helping to ensure that an independent
Post Office will remain a strong and long-term partner for Royal
Mail—that is another issue that the hon. Gentleman raised. A
transformed network will offer Royal Mail and the many companies,
Government Departments and agencies with which the Post Office works
better access to customers than ever before, which is crucial to
winning new contracts and retaining existing
ones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000841" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000841">The
hon. Gentleman referred to the decision to separate the Post Office
from Royal Mail. Far from being a mistake, it has allowed the Post
Office to focus on its own priorities and needs. It is important to
recognise that the two companies are very different. Royal Mail is a
logistics company whose business is collecting, sorting and delivering
mail. Although we can access Royal Mail services at post offices, the
Post Office is different. In 
<?notus-xml column=1103?>addition to mail services, it provides access to a wide range of
Government services, from pension and benefit payments to passport
check and send services and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
motoring services, all the way down to fishing rod licences. It also
provides access to a wide range of financial services products, from
savings accounts to mortgages, insurance and foreign exchange. It is
now piloting a range of current accounts. Separation is allowing the
Post Office to focus on its business and make the right decisions in
the long-term interests of its staff, sub-postmasters and
customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000842" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000842">I
recognise, as I think we all do, the importance of the Post
Office’s relationship with Royal Mail. As the hon. Gentleman
mentioned, prior to separation the two companies negotiated and signed
a long-term commercial agreement. It was a 10-year agreement, the
longest permissible at the time, and ensured that Royal Mail services
would continue to be offered at post offices until 2020. That cemented
the long-term relationship between the two businesses. As the post
office network modernises and the parcels market continues to grow, the
relationship will only get stronger. Indeed, Royal Mail’s chief
executive has said that it is “unthinkable” that the two
companies will not always have a close relationship. I am reassured
that the relationship will be maintained long into the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000843" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000843">It
is important to remember that the relationship is equally important for
both businesses. The Post Office benefits from a continuing commercial
relationship with the largest postal operator in the UK, and Royal Mail
benefits from exclusive access to the largest retail network in the UK
and the millions of customers who use post offices every
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000844" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000844">Alongside
its work for the Royal Mail, the Post Office is making good progress on
its ambition to become a front office for government. As the hon.
Gentleman pointed out—slightly dismissively, if I may say
so—the Post Office has won every Government contract that it has
bid for in the past two and a half years. That is a notable achievement
that should not be underestimated. The contracts have been secured in
highly competitive markets against fierce competition, and the Post
Office’s success represents a vote of confidence in the
business, in the Government’s funding and, more importantly, in
the thousands of highly skilled postmasters and post office staff who
deliver the services every day. That shows the regard in which they are
held.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000845" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000845">The contracts
that have been won include the vital cross-government front office
framework contract, which was led by the DVLA and won by the Post
Office in 2012. It has extended the Post Office’s contract with
the DVLA and broadened it into new areas. Because it is a framework
contract, it also means that other Government agencies can contract
more easily with the Post Office and deliver value for money to the
taxpayer. The contract is already in use by Her Majesty’s
Passport Office, which sees in it an opportunity to modernise the
passport check and send service. With a stable and modernising network,
the Post Office is well placed to build on those
successes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000846" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000846">I
hope that the hon. Gentleman and all other Members who are in the
Chamber will support me in encouraging Government Departments and
agencies, local government bodies and, as he said, the devolved
Administrations to seek out new opportunities to work with the Post
Office. 
<?notus-xml column=1104?>That includes new and emerging digital and identity markets, but also
counter services. As he has said, branch security is important to so
many Post Office and Government
customers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000847" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000847">The
Post Office has shown time and again the benefits it can bring to the
Government in driving value for money for the taxpayer and in improving
the accessibility of Government services, including to vulnerable and
disadvantaged groups across the UK. That has brought many benefits to
the Post Office. Additional new work will be crucial in helping to
ensure the network’s long-term future.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14011656000848" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000848">However, I
want to be clear that, in accordance with EU procurement regulations,
the Government cannot simply award contracts to the Post Office or, for
that matter, to any other company. We must secure suppliers through an
open and competitive tender process. That ensures fairness, drives
innovation and delivers value for money for taxpayers, which is
important in these times. That the Post Office is winning contracts in
such circumstances shows that it meets those competitive criteria and
does an excellent
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000849" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000849">There
is more to the Post Office than mail and Government services—the
hon. Gentleman highlighted that. The company has been growing well in
new areas in recent years and is now one of the leading providers of
financial and telephony services in the UK. Growth in the Post
Office’s award-winning financial services business under this
Government has made it one of the leading challengers to the high
street banks. Post Office’s 3 million customers have deposited
more than £17 billion in a variety of savings
products. Customers rely on the Post Office for insuring their homes
and holidays. It also helps them to get on or move up the property
ladder with the range of mortgages it has available. Recently, the Post
Office’s current account pilot was extended and is now available
in more than 100
branches.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000850" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000850">The
Post Office acknowledges the important role its network plays in local
communities. The business is already in conversation with the
Association of British Credit Unions and the credit union sector to
explore how they can work together to reach more families and give
access to credit union services in more communities. I am sure hon.
Members welcome
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000851" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000851">The
Post Office remains committed to ensuring that communities continue to
be able to access cash and banking services—the hon. Gentleman
highlighted that important issue. Ninety-five per cent. of UK current
accounts are available over the post office counter. With the support
of the Government, the Post Office is continuing to work with the one
remaining high street bank—Santander—that does not offer
this service. Those services are important in ensuring local convenient
access to cash, particularly, as he said, for the communities that have
been left with no high street branch. Unfortunately, that is many of
our communities in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000852" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000852">In
conclusion, I am confident that the hon. Gentleman can see that the
Government believe strongly in the future of the Post Office and that
we are working hard to ensure its future success. We are investing in
modernising the network. Under this Government, the Post Office is
flourishing. Customers are benefiting from longer opening hours at
improved branches. The company is winning new contracts and providing
its customers with an increased range of services. The
Government are laying the  
<?notus-xml column=1105?>foundations for the long-term, sustainable and successful future of the
Post Office. Hon. Members agree that it is essential for our
communities that the Post Office continues to thrive in the years to
come.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011656000853" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/debtext/140116-0004.htm#14011656000853"><I>Question

Alan Beith</B> (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD) <I>(Select Committee
Statement)</I>:</Member> Thank you, Mr Bone. It is a pleasure to have
you presiding over these proceedings, which as you say are a
parliamentary first. It is one of three reasons why I am particularly
pleased to be presenting the Justice Committee’s report
“Crown Dependencies: Developments Since 2010”. I am also
pleased to be doing it because the nature of the historically fruitful
and evolving relationship between the UK and the Crown dependencies is
not always understood, even in some Departments, and we can shed light
on it. The Isle of Man, Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey, including
Alderney and Sark, have a unique status, which we describe. Thirdly, it
is a good thing for Select Committees not merely to publish reports but
to look back on and evaluate their results. In this case, we think that
we can report a success story on the implementation of our 2010
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011653000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011653000009">In
order to review our 2010 report, during the course of this year
Committee members visited the Isle of Man, Jersey and the Bailiwick of
Guernsey, including Sark. Although fog stopped us from landing in
Alderney, we had a telephone conference with representatives there. We
took oral evidence from the then Minister, the noble Lord McNally, and
received written evidence. We are indebted to our then second Clerk,
who has just moved on to become Clerk of the Public Accounts Committee,
for her excellent work throughout the inquiry, and to all the Committee
staff.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=348?><hs_Para UID="14011653000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011653000010">The report we
are publishing today goes point by point through all
the recommendations we made in 2010 and shows how
in almost every case, they have been successfully implemented by the
Minister, Lord McNally, and the very small team of civil servants led
by Cathryn Hannah. Much credit is due to them for what they have done,
and that view was expressed to us in all the
dependencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011653000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011653000011">To
give the House a few examples, we argued that if the Ministry of
Justice concentrated on those things for which it had constitutional or
international responsibilities and relied more widely on the
preparatory work done by the Crown law offices in each of the
dependencies, delays could be avoided and island legislation could
achieve Royal Assent more quickly. That has been done successfully.
Secondly, we argued that the Ministry of Justice should encourage
closer co-operation, better understanding and timely consultation
between Whitehall Departments and their counterparts in the
dependencies. There have been significant improvements as a
result of the Ministry of Justice’s efforts to implement
that recommendation, although there are still some examples of
where policy changes with a significant impact on
the islands could have been the subject of more timely
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011653000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011653000012">The
only area where the Government disagreed with us was in respect of our
view that when the UK takes part in international negotiations, such as
those following the Icelandic banking crisis, and there are differences
between the UK’s view and the dependencies’,
there should be a clearer mechanism for ensuring that the

not have time to make in my statement. Letters of entrustment are one
indication in the Government’s response that they are willing to
enable the islands to reach international agreements that fit within
the framework of their responsibilities. It is a necessary process,
because the islands have trading links around the world. Given that so
many of the United Kingdom’s trading links are now through the
European Union, of which the islands are not members, it is often
necessary for new treaties to be put together and agreed, and letters
of entrustment are a way to achieve

of the European Union. That is a decision that each has made
separately. It is quite a complicated situation in some ways, because
so many of their links are with the United Kingdom, which is in the EU.
They are signatories to the European convention on human rights and

responsibilities is to ensure that the treaties are complied with. In

dependent in the sense that Britain subsidises or props them up in any
way; on the contrary, the financial centres, especially Jersey,
Guernsey and Isle of Man, provide benefits to the United Kingdom in
many ways, particularly via the City of London. Is
“dependency” the correct word for the Crown dependencies,

in the affairs of the Crown dependencies. The term “Crown
dependency” is an important way of distinguishing the
territories I have described and the United Kingdom’s overseas
territories, with which they should not be confused. The constitutional
relationship is different and in every case they have a high level of
compliance with international, financial and other regulations, which
they are keen to emphasise. The Crown dependency territories are a
distinct group with a special relationship to the Crown. Any regular

Gentleman’s comments a moment ago about membership of the

interest in being members of the Commonwealth, under that

give the example of the Remembrance Sunday parade and service in
Whitehall. The Crown dependencies are still, to this day, denied the
right to lay a wreath alongside other members of the Commonwealth. Not
only that, but there is the importance of ensuring that the flags of
the Crown dependencies are flown for state occasions

earlier, because both of the points he mentioned are not matters that

what happened in the second world war. All the dependencies, but
especially the Channel Islands, have every reason to

liberation—and we in the United Kingdom have every reason to be

Alan Beith</B> (Berwick-upon-Tweed) (LD):</Member> I rise rather
apologetically to my feet again, but taking the two reports together at
least spares the Chamber a third speech from me this afternoon. I shall
present the two reports in this speech. I do so with a heavy heart in
one sense, because one or two Members who would have spoken in the
debate are not able to do so, as they are at the funeral of our late
colleague, Paul Goggins. He took such a close interest in criminal
justice and had so much experience of it that I regularly tried to
persuade him to join the Justice Committee, but he was already
committed in a number of other ways, including as a member of the
Intelligence and Security Committee. Our Committee missed out on having
the benefit of his considerable wisdom, which we would have greatly
appreciated.</hs_Para>

is on two reports that we produced this Session on groups of people who
are minorities in the criminal justice system, but whose circumstances
and needs place particular demands on that system, which is really
geared towards dealing with young men. We wanted to examine the extent
to which policy and practice are responding effectively to the needs of
women offenders and older prisoners.</hs_Para>

prisoners are the fastest growing group in the prison population, and
our inquiry focused primarily, but not exclusively, on their treatment
in prison. In our inquiry on women offenders, we looked at provision in
the custodial state, where there are 3,845 women in a total prison
population of 84,000, and more widely, including community provision
for offenders and ex-offenders, and for women and girls at risk of
offending. The Minister, whom we are glad to have here, will respond to
the debate and cover both subjects. I shall return later to ministerial
responsibility, particularly for women offenders, because that has been
an issue.</hs_Para>

this goes back to 2006, when Baroness Corston was commissioned by the
Home Office to examine what could be done to avoid women with
particular vulnerabilities ending up in prison. That was prompted by
the death of six women in Styal prison. Her report, published the
following year, identified three categories of vulnerabilities for
women: those relating to domestic circumstances and problems, such as
domestic violence, child care issues and being a single parent; those
relating to personal circumstances, such as mental illness, low
self-esteem, eating disorders and substance misuse; and socio-economic
factors such as poverty, isolation and employment.</hs_Para>

report made 43 recommendations. I shall not go through all of them, but
they included improvements to the way in which the issue was dealt with
at Government level, the reservation of custodial sentences and remand
for serious and violent women offenders, and the use of small local
custodial centres within 10 years. They also included improvements to 
<?notus-xml column=355?>prison conditions, making community sentences the norm, and improvements
in health services and support for women offenders.

is much common ground on policy on women offenders. There appears to be
fairly wide, although not universal, agreement that the majority of
women offenders pose a limited risk, or no risk at all, to public
safety, and that imprisonment is frequently an ineffective response.
That is not about treating women more favourably or implying that they
are less culpable, but about how to respond appropriately to the kinds
of problems that women bring to the criminal justice system, and about
what action is required to be effective in addressing their offending
behaviour. In many cases, that is different from what is required to
achieve the same thing in men.</hs_Para>

should be recognised that important progress has been made on the
Corston recommendations. As has been illustrated by reports from the
Howard League, the Prison Reform Trust, the prison and probation
inspectorates and the all-party parliamentary group on women in the
penal system, that includes better prison regimes, the ending of strip
searching, reduction of self-harm, the establishment of a network of
women’s centres, and acknowledging the need for differential
treatment. However, levels of imprisonment for non-violent female
offenders remain high, as do levels of self-harm by women. A study
published before Christmas showed that there is still 10 times more
self-harm among women prisoners than among their male
counterparts.</hs_Para>

Davies</B> (Shipley) (Con):</Member> I wonder on what basis the right

are either not violent or not dangerous. Let me give a snapshot of the
prison population. There are 3,477 women in prison, and murder,
manslaughter, other violence against the person, sexual offences,
robbery, burglary, arson, blackmail and kidnapping account for half the
female prison population. Which of those categories is he saying is not

Alan Beith:</Member></B> I chose my words carefully. I said not that
women were put in prison for offences that were not
serious—courts would normally regard either the offence or the
fact that they are repeat offences as a serious matter, underlining
their decision to give a custodial sentence—but that many of the
women, if they were not in prison and were otherwise effectively
supervised, would not constitute a danger to the public. That is not
true of them all, which is why there will always be some women in
prison, some for very long periods, but those numbers will be
relatively small.</hs_Para>

older prisoners are and will continue to be a growing group. This
population is added to, of course, by prosecutions in relation to
historical sex offences. Older prisoners present a real challenge to
the Prison Service. Some prisons are making substantial efforts to
adapt their facilities to meet the needs of older prisoners, but of
course for some prisons that is almost impossible because of the nature
of their buildings. They may be multi-storey buildings. There may be a
cell in which two beds cannot be put, but there are two prisoners,

thought that NOMS needed to ensure that all prisons have a policy that

without necessarily segregating them entirely. We found problems with
older prisoners’ access to health care services. We found, as in
other areas of prison life, a large unmet

wanted prison and community health care IT systems to be better
connected to minimise disruption. There was one really serious problem,
which the Government have tried to address: the lack of provision for
essential social care for older prisoners, and confusion about who
should be providing it. We had a situation in which it was not clear
whether a prisoner with acute social care needs was the responsibility
of the authority from which they came, if that could be identified, or
the authority in which the prison was located. The Government have
dealt with that in clause 75 of the Care Bill, but we still need
clarification on what happens to local authorities with a large prison
population, because meeting that requirement will place considerable
demands on their social work provision. Some places, such as the Isle
of Wight, have gone some way to recognising that, but they will have
total responsibility in this area under the new legislation.</hs_Para>

liaison with local authority social care teams. In the Isle of Wight,
we saw that there had been good experiences as a result of placing
social workers in prisons. That is not a luxury; serious problems can
result from prisoners with serious personal care needs and limitations

have other responsibilities to carry out—or other prisoners.

looked at issues that arise when prisoners are terminally ill. We found
that perhaps too little discretion had been given to experienced

found problems with resettlement. Many long-term prisoners will be
released at some point, and by the time they are released, they may
have no contact with their home at all. The nature of their offence may
have led to a complete break with their family. Where should they be
placed if they are not to be at risk of committing further offences? We
have asked the Government to do further work on a number of aspects of
that problem. It was alarming to find that older prisoners were still
being released to no fixed abode, which is neither acceptable nor in
the interests of public safety and the community. The growth of the
older prisoner population suggests to us that there ought to be a
national strategy, but the Government did not accept that

given to improving health care. There is an acceptance of minimum
social care needs and the care passport system. However, the response

worked its way through the prison system might be of considerable

point, namely, that sentencing a woman to custody has profound
consequences that may not arise in cases involving men. There are
questions about housing and care for children; there is the possibility
of children being taken into care; and, overall, a huge wave of anguish
surrounds such families. It should be noted that those additional and
serious consequences will present even when a woman is given a very
short sentence. As the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed has

women required a distinct approach from those who engaged with them in

to be the subject of shorter community orders and were less likely to
be sentenced to custody than men. In 2011, 3% of females were sentenced
to immediate custody, compared to 10% of males. That is partly to do

Quite honestly, the work in some of the centres was so good that it was
astonishing. I well remember the visit to Liverpool—I have had
some contact with the manager since then, as it happens—as well
as the experience of Belfast and other places. What is vital, of
course, is that whatever the structure for the immediate future, such
centres are brought into the core of the delivery of services. They
make it possible not to send young women away, to keep them with their
family units and to turn them around in the most remarkable way. The
problem we have—I probably speak for all members of the Select
Committee on this—is that there are so few of them to rely on.
Alas, at this stage, some centres are suffering from financial
pressure. However, there is no doubt at all that if the new landscape
is to work, those centres must be major players in providing such vital
services, whether on their own or in concert with others. I agree

shall make a few comments about how our recommendations about the
resettlement of older prisoners were received. In our report, we
praised the resettlement services in HMP Dartmoor and Isle of Wight,
mainly because they provided comprehensive resettlement and care plans
for older prisoners. We suggested that NOMS should roll out such
services in all prisons where there is an existing population of older
prisoners. The Government again said that, in light of the passing of
the Care Bill, local authorities would have a responsibility to provide
a care plan in those circumstances and that NOMS would work with local
authorities to support that process. Again, I would like clarification
about how that will work with regard to Welsh older prisoners, whether
they are incarcerated in England or in
Wales<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:37:42"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:37:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011653000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011653000144">Finally,
we said that it was imperative that older prisoners were registered
with a community GP after release into the community to ensure
continuity of care. It is vital that services are linked up in that
fashion. In their response, the Government once again referred only to
NHS England, and I seek further information about what discussions the
Government will have with the Welsh Government to ensure that adequate
information is given to GPs in Wales about older prisoners when they
are released, whether—as I have already said—they are
incarcerated in Wales or in England.</hs_Para>

justice system, so I would looked into it in greater detail. The
Minister will confirm that, as will all his predecessors. I praise the
Minister, because I probably bombard him with parliamentary questions,
seeking out lots of information and the statistics on all these things.
I must put on the record that, to my mind, the Ministry of Justice is
probably the best Department for providing relevant information. Far
too many Departments will say that it is too difficult or expensive to
find information. The Ministry of Justice never does that; in my
experience, it always provides the information that is

are reams of statistics and information out there, so there is no

my colleagues in Parliament go no further than reading briefings from
the Howard League for Penal Reform or perhaps, at a push,
sometimes, from the Prison Reform Trust. Those organisations have their
own, perfectly legitimate, reasons for producing figures and statistics
in a particular way. They have an agenda: they do not like people being
sent to prison; they particularly do not like women being sent to

him to pursue. I do not necessarily agree with it, although I may agree

fact is that, at any time in recent history, about 5% of the prison
population has been female. In 1900, according to the Library, 17% of
the prison population were women, but since the 1950s onwards, it has
hovered around 5%. Therefore 95% of the prison population is male. That
might surprise many, given the focus on female offenders. What might be
a bigger shock to people, if they follow these debates as I do, is
that, according to the Library, in the past 10 years the female prison
population has decreased by 3%, whereas the male prison population has

Davies:</Member></B> I suspect that I have already had it as bedtime
reading, because I seem to have read almost every report going on these
matters. We can have an argument on the effectiveness of prison per se
at another time. I am a big fan of sending more criminals to prison:
for example, each year some 3,000 burglars with 15 or more previous
convictions are not sent to prison, which is a national scandal, and I
suspect that most of my constituents think so too. We can discuss that
on a different occasion, and perhaps the Select Committee might want to
consider why so few persistent burglars are sent to prison. My
constituents would welcome
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:50:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011653000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011653000162">One
point that crops up time and again is the idea that women offenders
are, by definition, more vulnerable than male offenders and therefore
need special protection. I want to address that first because I believe
that much has been made of the special case of women offenders, but
next to nothing has been said about the problems that men face. I have
been interested to discover that some of the facts show that much of
what is being said could apply equally to men. The House of Commons
Library, for example, says that almost the same proportion of sentenced
male prisoners as of sentenced female prisoners ran away from home as a
child—47% compared with 50%. The Library also states that,
although a third of female prisoners were excluded from school, a
larger half of male prisoners were excluded from school. A quarter of
both male and female prisoners are thought to have been in care when
they were growing up. Although 
<?notus-xml column=370?>about one third of female prisoners admit to hazardous drinking, it
seems that the figure for men is more like two thirds.</hs_Para>

we talk about those figures, we have to bear in mind the overall prison
population figures. For the record, as of last Friday, 10
January, there were 3,845 women in prison and 80,413 men. Clearly half
of the male prison population is a very large figure and half of the
female prison population is a relatively low figure, so if campaigners
are really concerned about the personal circumstances and
vulnerabilities of individuals, they perhaps ought to be clear that far
more men than women are in the position they describe of being
vulnerable prisoners. On sheer numbers alone, one would therefore think
male prisoners would be given far more attention than women
prisoners<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T14:52:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011653000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011653000164">Of
course, the favourite subject among some campaigners is mental health,
which is also mentioned prominently in recommendations 1 and 2 of the
Select Committee report, and it is addressed in the Government
response. Of course the figures in the report are only for women
offenders, so in the interest of ensuring that we have the real
picture, and not the one that some would like us to be left with, I
will compare female offenders with such problems with male offenders in
the same position.</hs_Para>

2011, two women committed suicide in prison. I do not know the
circumstances of those cases, but one might conclude that they were
clearly vulnerable individuals. In the same period, 55 men took their
own life. That is a stark example of the most serious end of the
argument and it shows why it is unbelievable that so much time is spent
compiling reports about vulnerable women, yet so little time is spent
considering the hard facts about the deaths of male
prisoners.</hs_Para>

more recent figures show an alarming trend of which I hear little
mention. Although the number of female self-harmers decreased from
1,429 in 2005 to 1,065 in 2013, the number of male self-harmers
increased in that period from 5,692 to 6,823. Perhaps more starkly,
over the same period the number of female self-harm incidents decreased
by half, from 12,014 to 6,236, while the number of male self-harm
incidents increased from 10,109 to 16,741. Again, according to the
Ministry of Justice, 145 female offenders who self-harmed in 2013
required hospital treatment, whereas 10 times as many male offenders
who self-harmed had to be taken to hospital. If people are
concerned—and it may well be a legitimate concern—that
women are vulnerable in those circumstances, surely men in such
situations must be of equal concern. If that is the case, why do we
have Select Committee reports simply on female offenders? Why do we not
have the same reports on male prisoners, which we never seem to

That is an absolute myth. According to the prison population figures,
just under 16% of women in prison have sentences of less than six
months. That is clearly quite a minority. If some do not class six
months as a short sentence, I will be charitable and go up to a year; a
further 6% of women are in prison for between six months and a year, so
22% of female prisoners are sentenced to less than a year in prison.
Some 78% of female prisoners are sentenced to more than a year, and who
can say that they are not serious offenders, when we already know that
they are given shorter sentences than men? These are clearly serious or

the point made by the right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd on why
he believes it is right that men are more likely to be sent to prison

of the debate. It is said that 17,000 children are separated from their

special case at that point, when the children have already been taken

thought there was a growing acceptance that a father was just as
important to a child’s upbringing as a mother. Why are we
treating mothers as a special case in all these cases? I do not see any
justification for that when we know for a fact, thanks to the Ministry

to prison, but that, again, is not true. Even when they are not sent to
prison, men are more likely to receive a community order than women.
You would think it was the other way round, Mr Amess. So few women are
sent to prison, one would think that most of them would get a community

prison than women. Men are more likely than women to get a community
sentence, and to have a community sentence that lasts for longer, and
they are likely to have more requirements added to it. It is a full

gender, race, religion or sexual orientation, so why should that not be
the case when it comes to sentencing people for committing the same
crime? We are dealing with the “equality when it suits”
agenda. The argument is that women and men should be treated the same,
unless we can get better treatment for women, which we are all in
favour of. That is not equality. It is very selective, and in my view

committed, not gender, that should count. If we were considering the
same phenomenon in relation to race, religion or sexual orientation, it
would be considered an outrage. I consider it an outrage that women are

relatively brief, Mr Amess. I want to ask a few questions about the
Government’s response to the report, but first, as I raised the
issue of detention centres earlier, I hope that the Minister will pass
on to his Home Office colleagues the importance of addressing the
report today from the chief inspector of prisons. I raised the
Harmondsworth detention centre incidents in the debate on the
Immigration Bill on 22 October, and referred to the visitors’
report published last year. I continue to be concerned; we need to deal
with the concerns regularly expressed by the visitors. There was also a
separate report on mental health in particular, published just before

that one of the biggest obstacles for social care services for older
people was the ordinary residence rule. What is the ordinary residence
of a prisoner? Is it where they come from, the location of the prison,
or where they will go after release? Local authorities can play that
card to avoid responsibility. That needs to be

am conscious of your guidance on time, Mr Amess, so I will not digress
too much, but does it really matter whether someone is young or old, or
male or female? A victim of crime who has suffered wants to see someone
punished for that crime. The facts show, however, that male offenders
are more likely to be sentenced to immediate custody than a female
offender. Taking robbery, for example, 61.7% of male offenders but only
37% of female offenders are sentenced to immediate custody.
Furthermore, when they are sentenced, the average sentence length for
men is much more—34.1 months on average, compared with 25.5
months for female offenders. That is the same across the board,
whichever sector we look at, for all offenders: thus, for burglary,
44.9% of men receive immediate custodial sentences, but only 26.6% of
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011675000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011675000083">Whichever<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:38:18"></hs_TimeCode>

was brought up in difficult circumstances, but we were all taught the

to steal from a neighbour or to hit someone else. We need to get back
to a society in which, from an early age, people are taught the
difference between right and wrong and that offenders are punished, and
punished severely, so that they do not want to commit more crime or go
back to prison. That is how we will cut crime in this

want to discuss why we use prison and the impact of prison on women. I
have always thought that prison was there for risks of harm, and in
particular for those people who are a risk to public safety. If we look
at the figures from various research establishments, we will see that
the majority of women prisoners are themselves victims. Many have been
the victims of domestic violence or sexual abuse. Many are serving
short, rather than long, sentences for the offences they have
committed. Many are sentenced to community-based alternatives, with
lower levels of expectation in those sentences, because the crimes they
have committed have been less violent. To give some figures
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T15:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>to show how
violent offences among young girls have fallen, in 2006-07, there were
just over 17,000 convictions for violent offences committed by young
girls; in 2009-10, that figure was down to 13,000. It is also
interesting to drill down into the figures and see the reasons why
women’s offences are committed: for example, 48% of
women’s offences were committed in support of someone
else’s drug use, often a male partner’s.</hs_Para>

be aware that I have been concerned for some time about how we are
using the criminal justice system instead of the mental health system
to deal with people with mental health problems. A woman in prison is
nearly twice as likely as a man to have had depression—65% of
women in prison had depression before they were there, as opposed to
37% of men. The incidence of depression among women who have been
convicted of offences is three times greater than among women in the
general population. If we look at what the public want for women
offenders, we find that they want more drug treatment, alcohol
treatment and mental health treatment, and more debt advice, because it
is generally accepted that those are the drivers of a large percentage
of crimes committed by women.</hs_Para>

were 1.2 million convictions, of which 24% were of women. According to
the figures for why men and women have been convicted, 52% of the
convictions for theft and handling of stolen goods were of women, and
33% were of men. Women are often engaged in petty theft—they are
more often the shoplifters, and are more often shoplifting as a way of
supplementing their household income or supporting a member of their
family. It is not done for self-gain; it is a way  of dealing
with domestic and personal circumstances.</hs_Para>

24,000 women in prison were self-harming. That rate was 10 times higher

30% of women had had a psychiatric admission before going to prison;
63% of women had been diagnosed with a neurotic or personality
disorder, as opposed to 40% of men; and 14% of women had a psychotic
disorder, as opposed to 7% of men. We are using our prison system to

seen as too violent or have a learning disability or drug or alcohol

alcohol causes her behaviour and personality to change. Some time ago,

so institutionalised now that prison is the place where the boundaries
are there to contain her mental disorder. Just before Christmas, things
went very badly wrong again and she went back to court. Everyone went
to court to beg that she not be sent back to prison again, and she was
sectioned. On Christmas day, she rang her parents and said, “I
want to say goodbye.” She was in a psychiatric ward. Her parents
got through to the main switchboard there and said, “For
God’s sake, get to our daughter—she is going to kill
herself.” When the staff broke into her room, she was
unconscious, with a rope around her neck. Only by a miracle did they
bring her back. A few days later, the psychiatrist decided that she had

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Amess. I am
pleased to speak on these two excellent reports following inquiries
conducted by the Select Committee on Justice. The two reports,

offenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011675000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0001.htm#14011675000096">Six
years after Baroness Jean Corston’s report, which made 43
recommendations to drive improvements in the women’s criminal
justice agenda, I and the Justice  
<?notus-xml column=385?>Committee are concerned that we do not have strong leadership in the

weakened in the Ministry of Justice since 2010. It also identified a
two-year hiatus in efforts to implement the Corston recommendations.

concerns that the Government’s “Transforming
Rehabilitation” agenda may pay little regard to the needs of
women offenders. I believe that there is now general agreement that
women should not be dealt with in the criminal justice system in the
same way as men. Women end up in prison for different reasons than men
do, and women often find themselves in prison for non-violent
criminality. There also seems to be general agreement that although
prison is absolutely right for some crimes committed by women, for the
majority of women offenders, imprisonment is frequently an ineffective
response. The very personal story told by

states that such recognitions are not about treating women more
favourably or implying that they are less culpable, as hon. Members who
have spoken in this debate have pointed out; rather, they are about
accepting that women face different hurdles from men in their journey
towards a law-abiding life, and that the justice system needs to
respond appropriately. Again, I fully support those views. It is
therefore worrying that the report has found little evidence that the
equality duty has had the desired impact of systematically encouraging
local mainstream commissioners to provide gender-specific services,
tackling the underlying causes 
<?notus-xml column=386?>of women’s offending, or consistently informing broader policy

the first two years of the coalition Government, there was no Minister
responsible for this area. I respectfully submit that that has been a

to the Committee, Baroness Corston referred to the previous
Government’s abolition of routine strip searches and praised the
fact that dedicated funding had been made available to establish
community-based women’s centres. Again, I and other Opposition
Members are concerned that those centres, which are making a difference
in our communities, have suffered funding cuts under the coalition
Government. There are now serious concerns about funding to local
authorities, which use some of their moneys to fund other centres. I
can think of one in my constituency, the Purple House on Preston road,
which has done a lot of work with women offenders. It has done a
massive amount of work, saving the taxpayer vast amounts of money by
preventing people from going into custody.</hs_Para>

set out in the Government’s strategic priorities for women
offenders is truly integrated across Departments. The Chairman just
intervened on me to say that the damage is probably less than I was
suggesting, but that is a matter of opinion, and frankly, I disagree.
It seems that work on the Corston report’s key
recommendation—improvements to high-level governance and
cross-departmental working for women offenders—has stalled and
is in fact being dismantled. Six years after Corston, we still have far
too many women in our prisons, and we need to reduce that number

Turner:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a valid point that was made
in the report of the Committee, of which he is a serving member. The
idea of elderly prisoners trying to clamber into bunks to sleep is
clearly unsatisfactory, but there is no magic wand, and we must address
the issue. We must accept that the prison population is getting older
and deal with that. Society generally has an ageing population, which
is making us reassess health and social care provision, end-of-life
accommodation and older people’s living needs. Although it will
not be popular, we must also reconsider the needs of older people in
prison.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011675000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0002.htm#14011675000114">We
welcome this inquiry, and the resulting excellent report, which
highlights the exact issues facing older prisoners. It makes some key
recommendations about how to address those issues. Prisoners over 55
are the fastest-growing age group in custody, and in the last eight
years, there has been increasing evidence of the needs of older people
in prison. That has led to a developing awareness among prison staff
and prisoners of the difficulties facing older people, and a greater
understanding that the response is often inadequate. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) said, it seems that
prisons are ill-equipped to meet their needs. There are various reasons
why our prison population is getting older. Prisoners are serving
longer sentences, and they may even be convicted and sentenced at an
older age for historical sexual offences; a number of cases of that
kind are being reported on in the
media.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011675000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0002.htm#14011675000115">There
is some debate about what age constitutes  an older prisoner.
Some people argue that due to the early onset of health issues in
prisoners, that should  be defined as anyone over 50. Others,
including the 
<?notus-xml column=388?>Government and the Justice Committee, argue that it is not sensible to
impose a rigid age classification, whether we are talking about those
who are 50, 60 or 65. It is worrying that the
report states that many older prisoners are being held in
establishments that simply cannot meet their needs. We accept that for
operational and practical reasons it is not always possible to allocate
older prisoners to entirely suitable prisons, but we support the view
that NOMS should, as a rule, not allocate such prisoners to an
establishment that cannot meet their
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011675000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0002.htm#14011675000116">The
report also raises concerns about fragmented provision and barriers to
health care for older prisoners, which is particularly worrying. I
support the view that cancelling hospital appointments because of lack
of communication between health care providers and prison officers is
entirely avoidable; that issue must be addressed
urgently.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011675000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0002.htm#14011675000117">Mental
health care needs are also widespread in prisons with higher levels of
depression among older prisoners. It is reassuring that services are
being commissioned to address mental health issues in prisons, and that
organisations such as Age UK and the Alzheimer’s Society are
running specific dementia services in prisons with large populations of
older prisoners. However, clearly we need to do more, and awareness
training in prisons should be increased. We should consider integrating
training packages into standard prison officer
training.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011675000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/halltext/140116h0002.htm#14011675000118">The

concern is the release of older people to no fixed abode. It is deeply
worrying when older prisoners are released to face homelessness. Around
85% of prisoners who are released find, or are helped to find,
somewhere to live on release, but 15% do not receive help. That is not
good enough. Release to no fixed abode undermines any progress that has
been made towards resettlement, and will do nothing to help older
prisoners to reduce

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-16T16:11:48"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bury North that the sentencing regime should not treat
women more leniently than men. It should pass the appropriate sentence
in each individual case and that is what we expect sentencers to do,
but sentencing in each case is a matter for the judiciary and for
magistrates; it is not a matter for politicians. However, what we are
concerned with is ensuring that, when the courts decide that someone,
male or female, needs to go to prison, they do not go back to crime
when they are released. On rehabilitation, which is I think where the
burden of the Committee’s report was concentrated, it is right
to recognise that different things work in the rehabilitation of
different people. Distinct things can be done to rehabilitate female
offenders, perhaps more so than male
offenders.</hs_Para>

right hon. Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd) asked whether
up-tariffing would be the result of that, and whether some sentencers
would pass custodial sentences in the hope that offenders would receive
the type of the support that they needed. It is important to remember
that the supervision of community sentences will be delivered by the
same providers under the same terms as the supervision provided for
those 
<?notus-xml column=391?>released from short sentences. There will be no difference, if that is
what the sentencer is interested in, in the level of support provided
for someone receiving a short custodial sentence and someone placed
under a community order. The sentencing guidelines will remain clear,
as they should, that only when it is appropriate to do so should a
custodial sentence be passed in any case.</hs_Para>

that all future providers under our reforms take into account the
specific needs of female offenders, we are amending the Offender
Rehabilitation Bill to require the Secretary of State to ensure that
contracts and service level agreements for the rehabilitation and
supervision of offenders identify services intended to meet the
particular needs of women. We will assess providers’ plans for
female offenders and the plans will be placed in the public domain to
ensure transparency. If providers are not delivering those
requirements, they will be subject to contractual remedies. We will
publish data on the effectiveness of those services in the autumn of
2016. That aligns with the way in which the competition process will
work: providers are to be incentivised to work with all offenders, and

£5.8 million through probation trust contract and partnership
arrangements on those services. We expect existing providers of
women’s services to continue to receive funding from community
rehabilitation companies until March 2015, assuming that performance
and demand is sufficient. That sets the groundwork for the expansion of

experience over eight years of similar colour coded schemes by most
domestic retailers had not caused any disruption to the internal
market. However 17 member states supported Italy. The Commission in its
response made clear that such voluntary schemes were left to the
discretion of individual member states and that it would take action in
any cases where the internal market did become seriously disrupted. The

we will continue to press the Sri Lankan Government for credible,
transparent and independent investigations into alleged war crimes. We
have made clear that if a credible domestic process has not begun
properly by March we will use our seat on the UN Human Rights Council
to call for an international investigation. We are regularly discussing
Sri Lanka with a range of international partners in the run-up to the
next session of the Human Rights Council in March. The High

Lewis:</Member></B> The Civil Contingencies Act 2004 and the Fire and
Rescue Services Act 2004 detail the roles and powers of fire and rescue
authorities in respect of both emergency response and rescue in a wide
range of situations, including from flooding. Fire and rescue
authorities are expected to produce Integrated Risk Management Plans
which identify the full range of risks that an authority's service is
expected to respond to and is subject to consultation. This approach is
enshrined in The National Fire Framework which was given statutory
effect in August 2012. When it comes to rescuing people from floods
there are a number of agencies involved, particularly in coastal areas,
where, as well as fire and rescue authorities, the Royal National
Lifeboat Institute and Search and Rescue helicopters can become
involved. In any area, individuals and agencies with boats may also
volunteer to help. Usually 
<?notus-xml column=611?>the fire and rescue authorities take the lead in co-ordinating the flood

is important to note that the notional pay disparities at certain
levels stem from differences in how long individual staff have been in
their grade, and therefore how far they have progressed up their pay
scale at the relevant point in time. When a female member of staff has
been in a particular grade for the same period as a male they will be
at the same pay level—so they do have equal pay. The same
principle applies to ethnicity. It would be incorrect to suggest that
there is a systematic bias or discrimination based on gender or
ethnicity from the correlation of these figures, rather it is a
reflection of historic recruitment
patterns.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14011679000023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/text/140116w0001.htm#14011679000023">Planning

benefit withheld due to sanctions as we do not know what would have
happened had the sanction not been applied. Some people would have
flowed off benefit in the period of the sanction and they might have
flowed off benefit had they not received a sanction. Furthermore we do
not have reliable data on duration for sanctions of variable

McVey:</Member></B> The Government has decided that universal credit,
which replaces means-tested benefits and tax credits for working-age
people, will not recognise polygamous marriages. Instead, the husband
and wife who are party to the earliest marriage that still subsists can
make a joint claim for universal credit in the same way as any other
couple. Any other adults living in the household would each have to
claim as a single person on the basis of their own circumstances. This
process already happens where a polygamous marriage is not recognised

specify that train operators should run trains on Christmas day, it has
specified a limited number of services on Boxing day on some
franchises. The UK rail industry has in recent years used the Christmas
period to undertake major disruptive engineering work on the rail
network. If a franchised train operator can agree access to the rail

on Christmas day or Boxing

investment in that site is protected for the duration of the lease

agreement with Kings Science Academy. These prevent the disposal of
assets without the Secretary of State for Education's approval and

terminated: Under the terms of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954, Kings

bullying, including racist bullying, a top priority. All schools must
have a behaviour policy with measures to prevent all forms of bullying
among pupils. Schools have the freedom to tailor their anti-bullying
policies to address local issues, such as racism, which may vary
geographically. Under the current Ofsted framework school inspectors
consider how well schools prevent bullying, harassment and
discrimination. Inspectors consider how well teachers manage the
behaviour of pupils to ensure that all pupils have an equal and fair
chance to thrive and learn in an atmosphere of respect and
dignity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011686000770" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/text/140116w0002.htm#14011686000770">In

treatment support site for other prisons in Kent and Sussex,

support offenders before they get to treatment. SOTP is long (six
months plus); resource intensive in terms of specially trained staff
resources (including psychologists) and often emotionally demanding of
staff who run these programmes. For these reasons (as well as others
such as the numbers of sex offenders who deny their offence) SOTP has

Willott:</Member></B> Currently, our best estimate of non-compliance is
from the Annual Survey of Household Earnings (ASHE). However, findings
from the survey do not take into account the fact that some workers are
not entitled to receive the national minimum wage for example, students
undertaking work experience as part of their UK higher or further
education course. The ASHE figures may therefore overestimate the level
of non-compliance with national minimum wage (NMW)
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14011688000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140116/text/140116w0003.htm#14011688000219">The
Office for National Statistics low pay release in December 2013
suggests that in April 2013, non-compliance was not a growing problem.
The trend is fairly stable for adults with a slight increase in
non-compliance for younger workers over the last three years. The

forms of industrial action should be regarded as a last resort after

workshop was held to scope the research. Participants included
representatives from academic research groups in the UK
working in this area and from the main industry players. The university
participants were from Leeds, Sheffield, UCL, Imperial, Manchester,
Loughborough, the University of Central Lancashire, Strathclyde,
