does he agree that there is no real need for another crossing on this

bridges within half a mile of the proposed bridge, on either side, not
to mention Waterloo Bridge and Blackfriars Bridge? Secondly, supposing
that there is a need for another crossing, why not have a simple
bridge, such as the Millennium Bridge between St Paul’s and Tate
Modern, at a fraction of the £150 million cost? Why waste

regular source of ongoing income for this imaginative project, and
gardens can be high maintenance. Will the Minister expand on his

Deighton:</Member></B> The issue with a garden bridge is that it is
more about gardening than it is about painting, which is the case with
the Forth Bridge. The initial plan for maintenance is that it will be
assumed by Transport for London along with its ongoing maintenance
responsibilities around London. Of course, if, as part of the capital
fundraising campaign, the Garden Bridge Trust can also persuade
somebody to take on the ongoing maintenance responsibilities, that
would be particularly
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Davies of Oldham" PimsId="2862" UID="14010944000256" xid="1735" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000256">Lord
Davies of Oldham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the House will have
noticed that the Treasury is answering this Question because the bridge
can scarcely be defined as a means of transport. It is a very expensive
piece of public art, a vanity project of the mayor—and we know
where his vanity projects have gone and what they have cost the
country. The cycle hire scheme is in trouble, his Emirates gondola
crossing down at Greenwich carries so few passengers that it is
risible, and, of course, the taxpayer will have to pick up the bill. It
is true that the Chancellor has committed only £30 million at
present. The question is: with a deficit, still, of
£60 million, is the Treasury still in the
game?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deighton" PimsId="7002" UID="14010944000257" xid="2168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000257">Lord
Deighton:</Member></B> I am not sure what the deficit of
£60 million refers to. I will run through, very
quickly, the benefits of the project and how its value for money will
be assessed. First, there is the pedestrian connectivity that it will
give. It will switch people out of cars and on to their feet and make a
very important connection. Secondly, it will increase London visitor
numbers, which is very important. It will be a great visitor
attraction. Thirdly, it will have significant development value,
connecting the South Bank and its creative centre to the Aldwych and
Covent Garden. The development it will bring on each side will have
significant value. Finally, it will be a great showcase for UK
expertise. Our brilliant designer, Thomas Heatherwick, is designing it,
Arup is engineering it and Dan Pearson is landscaping the garden, so it
will generate other future business for London through that
showcase.</hs_para>

I take the point of the question. That is why, before we commit the
£30 million, we will ensure that it passes a strong business
case and why, before we go ahead with the project, the Garden Bridge

along the same lines. Just as this project still needs to pass the
business case to be allocated the £30 million that is
pencilled in, similarly we will do our work on other projects in a
sensible way and respond to priority needs as they occur. I should just
point out that the reason that the Treasury is putting in
£30 million is that it is the sensible way to
kick-start a fundraising effort. It is much easier to fundraise when
people can see that the Government are behind a project and that it the
first part of the funding has already been
raised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000020"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:14:49"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall" PimsId="1817" UID="14010944000264" xid="1765" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000264">Baroness

still worryingly high, although I believe that even that is falling.
Can I encourage him, on behalf of the Government, to endorse the work
of the non-profit-making organisations that do such effective work in
getting young people into work, particularly Tomorrow’s People

Deighton:</Member></B> I absolutely agree with my noble friend that the
good news on employment leaves us no room for complacency. Of all the
segments of unemployment, youth unemployment remains just a little
under 1 million, even though it has been coming down in the past
quarter. Remember that about one-third of young people who are
classified as unemployed are in full-time education. However, I
absolutely endorse the point that my noble friend makes that the work
done by the voluntary sector—supporting not just the unemployed
youth back into jobs but, frankly, anyone for whom it is difficult to
get back into the workforce, such as prisoners needing
rehabilitation—is enormously valued and will get this

Deighton:</Member></B> My Lords, I will apply that question to youth
unemployment. In particular, we have tried to get young people into
apprenticeships. The youth contract did that by providing additional
support for up to 500,000 young people. Jobcentre Plus will provide
support for 16 and 17 year-olds who want to find an apprenticeship or
traineeship scheme. That is being phased in from this April. We are
doing good work on apprenticeships. I spent yesterday in Liverpool
talking 
<?notus-xml column=1623?>about how we can use the HS2 project as a way of defining future
work opportunities and to line up training and
apprenticeship schemes in anticipation of the work that will flow. I

Deighton:</Member></B> I absolutely endorse the work of the technical
colleges and my noble friend Lord Baker. If we are looking at how to
continue to improve the employment situation, on the one hand the
recovery of the economy is providing the demand to support it; on the
other hand, there are longer-term, structural things that we need to
do, which are essentially about investing in people so that the skills
they have match the jobs that will be created in the competitive
economy that we are developing.</hs_para>

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, although the OBR’s estimate
for future employment is clearly very welcome, it slightly exaggerates
the picture. I ask the Minister  to check why the Government no
longer produce employment statistics on a full-time-equivalent basis,
which would show some improvement but by no means so much. In that
context, can he explain how we rate the employment take of the many
young people who are on zero-hours or near-zero-hours contracts? The
figures are seriously distorted, particularly at that end of the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Deighton:</Member></B> Employment statistics are not as simple as the
headline numbers. I absolutely accept that point. There has clearly
been a discussion about how much of the increase in employment is taken
up by temporary jobs and how much is taken up by part-time jobs. The
simple fact is that the majority is taken up by an improvement in the
full-time picture. In the past year, the proportion of full-time jobs
making up the increase has substantially increased, and that tells us
that the quality of the recovery in the past 12 months is
stronger<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:21:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the schemes that we have put in place are focused on helping people
to develop basic skills in maths and literacy, which have often been
found lacking. However, on a practical level, I could not agree more
that in many cases the softer skills make a huge difference, as do the
skills involved in what it takes to go to work every day—how to
get into a routine and how to behave in the

first set of reports, which
looked at legal competences and how they were being exercised. Many of
the areas were non-contentious and it was felt that the balance of
competences was right in those areas. However, even where those areas
of competences were supported, suggestions were still made by a number
of organisations and individuals about how they could be improved. For

reform is an ongoing process and we can have a better Europe. For
example, one of things that came out of the balance of competences
review is how different competences and different regulations were
being implemented by member states. There were concerns about the
UK’s gold-plating, for example, of much that was coming out of
Europe. We feel that that is an ongoing process. I think that the noble
Lord and noble Lords opposite will accept that there is a great
democratic deficit at the moment in support for the European Union.
Therefore it is not only about making the case for whether we need to
be in or out of Europe but about making the case for how we can have a
better Europe, renegotiating a new settlement and then going to the
people and saying to them, “You have the final

My Lords, the employee-shareholder employment status came into force as
recently as 1 September 2013. Companies are not required to
register or apply to government to use it, and no qualitative
assessment of levels of interest has yet been made. However, since 1
September, the online detailed guidance was viewed nearly 15,000 times,
with people spending, on average, more than seven minutes on the pages.
This clearly shows an initial level of interest in the

Stevenson of Balmacara (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I wonder, when the
history of this period is written up, whether this rather shoddy
episode might not be taken as representative of the very low quality of
policy-making by this coalition Government. This policy was
commissioned from a party funder—though not, as far as I know, a
hairdresser. It was based—by his own admission—on his
private views and published without supporting evidence. It was
announced by the Chancellor as the centrepiece of an otherwise empty
and vacuous Budget, foisted on the Business Department and pushed
through this House by the plucky noble Lord. It is widely derided in
this Chamber and openly rubbished by the deputy leader of the
coalition, but—and people will remember this—it was voted
through by these people on a whipped vote. So I ask the Minister: what
is his next
trick<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:32:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:32:48"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="14010944000299" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000299">Viscount

noble Lord opposite on that. We are doing more than the previous
Government did to encouraging employee-stakeholders in businesses. This
particular scheme is one of several that are geared towards helping,
and giving some flexibility to, young, innovative companies starting
up. I am pleased to say that there were 270,000 business start-ups in
the UK in 2012, the highest annual figure since 2007. In 2012, there
were 15,000 more business start-ups than business closures—the
second year in succession that this has occurred. Clearly, there is
some success coming through, so I do not agree with the tenet of the

referring to the Royal Mail rather than the Post Office. I can say that
around 150,000 eligible Royal Mail employees have been given shares
under the free shares offer. Only 372 employees opted out of the
scheme, which means that approximately 99.75% of eligible employees
received the free shares that they were offered. This is the largest

vital safety net in protecting the low paid. We have already said that
we need to do more to make sure that the benefits of growth are shared

asked the Low Pay Commission to extend its expertise to look at what
economic conditions would be needed to allow the national minimum wage

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:38:42"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I will
say a few words about the fourth report—not the third one, but
the one about speakers lists. I welcome the recognition by the Chairman
of Committees and the Procedure Committee that there is a serious
problem here, which is exacerbated by the increased number of Members
of this House who quite reasonably and rightly wish to participate
in<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:38:42"></hs_TimeCode> its debates.
The problem has reached critical proportions. As the Chairman of
Committees knows, we do not bring much credit on ourselves
when—for example, in the debate on the Middle East originated by
my noble and gallant friend Lord Boyce—we give a couple of
minutes to everyone to discuss a problem that is not, frankly,
susceptible to being properly dealt with in that amount of
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000070">I fear
that that is where the good news ends, because the change introduced by
the Chairman of Committees, to which I have no objection at all, is
simply tinkering and is unlikely to produce any major change to the
problem that the Procedure Committee has identified. I hope that when
the noble Lord replies to this point, and to any others that are made,
he will assure the House that the door is not closed to a more radical
look at
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:40:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000071">There

appreciated by the House. Returning to the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Hannay, I think it is important to understand that we have
made great strides recently in increasing the opportunity for
Back-Bench debates and contributions in your Lordships’ House.
Cutting off a speakers list at a particular time was considered by the
committee before it reached its current recommendation, but the
difficulty is—dare I say?—that it creates the opportunity
for rather mischievous behaviour in terms of flooding the list. That is
one of the reservations that we

I recognise, and have some sympathy with, the general point that the
noble Lord made. Having a very short speaking time is not a pleasant
arrangement at all but is a product, in part, of the increase in the
size of the active House. One thing that is happening is that the
active House is getting larger and larger, and the proportion of our
membership that is relatively inactive is declining. On the whole, it
is a very good thing to have an active House rather than a largely
inactive one—but, from time to time, we come close to the point
where the House can operate only if a significant proportion of its
membership is inactive. That is not a happy position to be
in.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14010944000337" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000337">Motion

child development should surely be at the heart of this discussion. It
is an issue that often gets lost, yet research is clear about what
children need to thrive—security, attention to physical,
emotional and intellectual needs, and love. The long-term impact of
early years care is well known. In today’s world, parents may be
caught in the conflicts of what is best for their child. The situation
has certainly changed from when I had young children, where it was
usual for one parent—usually the mother—to be at home
looking after the child or children until they went to school. I was
fortunate in being able to do and enjoy that. Some women said that they
were better mothers for having their children looked after by others
for at least part of the day and being able to
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000077">Pressures
on my—our—children’s generation are different and
more complex. The pressures of the cost of living, the workplace
environment and taking time out have increased, even though maternal
and paternal leave after birth has thankfully improved. Parents want an
alternative to the family situation where their child or children will
be well looked after. As I and I am sure others have seen, most parents
go to great lengths, whatever the cost, to decide what that care will
be, whether it is with a childminder, including a relative, a
nursery—either private or local authority—or other
arrangements. I know many young parents feel guilty about this but for
many reasons childcare has to be the way forward for them. How does
that work out? Is high quality childcare affordable?
Governments—any Governments—need to ensure that parents
have affordable, high-quality choices about what happens to their
children at a key stage of
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000078">Some
facts are clear. Since the last election, the cost of nursery places
has risen by 30%—five times faster than pay. The average cost
for a part-time nursery place of 25 hours a week has gone up to
£107. There are 576 fewer Sure Start centres with three lost
every week. There are 35,000 fewer childcare places. The Government
offer of childcare for disadvantaged two year-olds is struggling
because one in three councils do not have enough places. Some 60% of
local authorities 
<?notus-xml column=1632?>in England have sufficient childcare for working parents and in 36% of
local authorities parents have reported lack of childcare to their
family information service. Only 30% of English local
authorities—16% in Wales—can provide sufficient holiday
care for working parents, despite the obligation to do so under the
Childcare Act 2006. Six local authorities report an average cost of
holiday childcare exceeding £175—the maximum amount of
help that a parent on low income can claim through working tax credit
support for childcare costs, leaving many parents out of
pocket.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000079">Some
91% of nursery care, 94% of sessional and pre-school care, and 67% of
after-school care is delivered by the private and not-for-profit
sector. It has been estimated that 7% of childcare costs in group
settings is due to rent or mortgage costs. A parent buying
50 hours of childcare per week for a child under two now
faces an annual bill of almost £11,000 per
year—£14,000 in London. Many colleagues will know such
parents and how they struggle to make ends meet.</hs_para>

support is welcome for those families on universal credit who

Joseph Rowntree Foundation highlighted late last year that more than
half of families living in poverty are in work. The cost of childcare
is a significant contributor to their problems, particularly due to the
way that income support works, with a taper sharply reducing support as

concludes that parents are no happier with their work-life balance and
attitudes to family-friendly working appear to have gone backwards

a recent conference of the Family and Childcare Trust, issues of
childcare were discussed in depth and many questions asked. The keynote
address states that it must be remembered that only one-third of
children attending formal childcare are aged three or four and
therefore qualify for the universal element of the free early education
offer. Although the number of childcare places has risen, parents still
have difficulty finding affordable childcare at the times they need it.
More staff are qualified, but childcare is still a low-wage profession
and the annual turnover of staff is three times the average of that of
a good school. That will clearly impact on quality and availability.
Quality of staff in early years settings and recognition of the
profession’s impact and importance is an issue that has often
been raised in your Lordships’ House and needs to be an ongoing
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000087">I
turn to some of the responses to the issue of affordable childcare.
Many professionals in the field of child and family welfare have raised
several key points. First, childcare is a fragmented sector, with the
expansion in the private and voluntary sectors. In a fragmented sector,
there are challenges in achieving profitability without an impact on
quality. There is potential for isolation and there are weak links to
quality support.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010944000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000088">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:50:05"></hs_TimeCode>,
vision, direction and long-term strategy from political parties must
not be lost in competing on policy, whether it be from the expansion of
the free offer or tax-free
childcare<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Thirdly, the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:50:05"></hs_TimeCode>
free offer is at the heart of childcare and hugely popular with
parents, but problems remain. Many parents are not in control of when
and where they access free childcare. Around 20% of parents are not
happy about being able to access a good provider.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010944000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000089">The key to affordable
success, it has been suggested, lies in a simpler funding system.
Multiple funding streams directed separately into a market environment
lacking coherence will not achieve high-quality and flexible access for
parents. Such a system also leads to administrative deficiencies. Those
funding streams must be brought together. The Scandinavian model gives
power and funding to local authorities to plan local provision and
gives parents legal access to services. Interestingly, the Institute
for Public Policy Research has produced an interim report on childcare
as  a strategic national priority. This report states
that  
<?notus-xml column=1634?>a wide-ranging expansion of childcare would pay  for itself over
time. It estimated that attracting 280,000 mothers back into
the workforce would generate an extra £1.5 billion in tax
revenues and make savings in benefit payments. We await the final
report of the IPPR, which will indicate possible ways forward. I hope
that they will be noted by
policymakers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000090">I
have tried to show that this is a complex area and needs simplifying.
What is clear to me is that the Government do not seem to have policies
on long-term strategies which are compatible with providing quality,
accessible and affordable childcare for the majority of working
parents, particularly those on lower incomes. I hope the Minister will
reassure us that this is being thought through with all parents in mind
and that we shall see greater clarity, simplification and understanding
about the welfare of children and

Jenkin of Kennington (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey, who speaks with so much experience and
expertise, for providing us with the opportunity to debate this
important topic. In thinking about this debate, like the noble Baroness
I inevitably cast my mind back to my own experiences, 20 years ago, and
to how we coped and managed with two small children. My sister, who
lived nearby, stayed at home and was a fantastic support. My sons had
two loving and committed grandmothers who lived close enough to help
and did more than their fair share. The children went to a great
nursery and later I was lucky enough to have a flexible job. Housing
costs were considerably lower, with a decent family home costing three
times a salary. Many parents today have to work longer hours for what
I, at least, took for granted. I now appreciate more than I did at the
time how easy I had it compared to many parents today but even then I
felt guilty, and at times stressed and under pressure.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010944000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000092">A quick trawl through
the Mumsnet forums on this subject shows no change and no agreement.
From the comments of stay-at-home parents who feel that they have to
justify their choice to working parents who feel guilty for working
long hours to keep on top of their careers, it is clear that whatever
it is, there is no silver bullet or one-size-fits-all solution.
However, without flexibility, affordability and good quality childcare
what is really quite a short period of one’s life can, instead
of being a fulfilling and exciting time filled with love and adventure,
become a stressful and miserable experience for both parents and
children. Needs change for babies and pre-schoolers, of course,
compared with school-age children. Families are different and,
obviously, childcare needs should be as flexible as possible to cater
to the many individual circumstances and challenges that families face.
All these families need to be supported in the choices that they make
and I welcome the introduction of flexible parental leave so that
parents, not government, can decide how to manage their lives when they
have a
baby.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000093">Whether
it is the ability to find a childminder,  a nursery in the
right location with available places, a work-based creche or a school
that can offer after-hours care, we know that too many parents cannot
get that 
<?notus-xml column=1635?>mix of childcare that they need. It is lack of flexibility that can lock
many parents out of the workplace. This is why affordable and
accessible childcare is so important in our society, not just for the
well-being and success of future generations but for the well-being and
success of parents. Data suggest that more than half of stay-at-home
mothers, one-third of the total, would prefer to be in paid employment,
but in the UK one-quarter of women who go on maternity leave do not
return to work, resulting in a significant cost to companies in
recruiting and training their replacements, as well as the loss of
knowledge, skills and
expertise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000094">Let
us look for a moment at the costs. The UK has reached Nordic levels of
public expenditure on childcare but has come nowhere near reaching
Nordic levels of coverage among low earners. Public childcare
subsidies, at 1.1% of GDP, are among the highest in the world, yet the
average cost of childcare is still 28% of household income. In Sweden,
where they also spend 1.1% of GDP, childcare costs are 6% of household
income while in Germany, where they spend 0.4% of GDP, the
out-of-pocket cost of childcare is 14% of household income. As I read
those figures, even though I know I have checked them, I still find
them very hard to come to terms with.</hs_para>

the OECD average on childcare, yet British parents are still paying
some of the highest costs in Europe. Clearly, neither taxpayer nor
parent is getting value for money. The limited options available to
parents for such high costs are due in large part to overcomplex
funding systems and unnecessary bureaucracy, which are stopping
childcare providers from growing and flourishing, thus preventing many
parents and children from taking advantage of the excellent childcare
that exists across the country. Let us take a quick look at the most
common options available to parents— childminders, nurseries and
school nurseries.</hs_para>

are popular, flexible and local. Many parents prefer home-based care,
especially for the younger children. They also suit parents who work
shifts; I used one myself when my elder son was small, and it worked
well. Despite this, though, as the noble Baroness has pointed out, the
number of childminders has almost halved over the past decade, to the
point where just 1% of funded early-year places are provided by
childminders. This appears to be due to two issues: difficulty in
accessing funding and the mass of paperwork involved in registration.
Childminders have to register with Ofsted. They have to spend about
£80 on a medical check, £100 on a preregistration course,
up to £100 on paediatric first aid training and more on public
liability, car and home insurance, a website, professional membership,
DBS checks, buying equipment, toys and books and sorting out marketing
and accountancy. The whole process costs around £800, clearly
contributing to high costs for users of the service.</hs_para>

good or outstanding childminder can automatically offer funded places
for two to four year-olds. Previously, fewer than 4,000 childminders
were accessing funding but now 32,000 are automatically eligible. To
help to reduce the bureaucracy, childminder agencies are being set up
to help with admin and to 
<?notus-xml column=1636?>simplify the process. They could spread the costs, reduce the hassle and
use economies of scale to make it cheaper, and for parents they should
make it easier to find an employer childminder. In France, where
creches familiales have similar functions to agencies, they have five
times as many childminders per person than England. I welcome the new
childcare business grant scheme that has been introduced to boost the
provision of childcare and to incentivise entrepreneurship. It will
encourage and support the starting up new childcare businesses by
providing a flat-rate start-up grant of up to £500.</hs_para>

provide about one-quarter of all childcare, are equally essential,
providing a valued and trusted service to parents. Their funding should
be simple and accessible. Any good or outstanding nursery will be able
to access money just like childminders, without jumping through further
bureaucratic hoops. Through this measure, the Government estimate that
about 80% of nurseries would automatically get funding. They should be
encouraged to expand and grow, just like any other business. Planning
rules should be more straightforward so that premises can be converted
without requiring additional planning permission, allowing nurseries to
grow and flourish.</hs_para>

perhaps an underappreciated part of childcare yet they make up
one-third of the national childcare market, with some 800,000
early-year places. However, the hours that they offer can be
inflexible; most do only 9 am to 3 pm, if parents are lucky. An extra
four hours a day would change many parents’ options. More school
nurseries could look to the model of a mixture of funded and fee-paying
care, which in turn helps local government funding to go further. Such
schools can generate income from the nursery and by good, flexible
timing of their sessions they can fill the spaces.</hs_para>

is not the only problem that many families face when looking for
suitable childcare. Even when many families find the perfect solution
for them, they are locked out of the market due to the high cost.
Parents are locked out of the workplace and children are left out of
sociable learning

average annual cost of a part-time nursery place for a young child is
now more than £5,000. At an hourly rate, this is about
two-thirds of the minimum wage. Even as the economy is picking up, with
nursery costs in some parts of the UK rising more than twice as fast as
family incomes, childcare is a big item on tight family
budgets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000102">Every
three and four year-old gets 15 hours of free childcare a week. This is
now much more flexible so that parents can take it in blocks. Funding
has been increased for low-income two year-olds and just one month
after launching the scheme, 92,000 children benefitted, reaching an
estimated 70% of the deprived children who most need help. On top of
this basic entitlement, low-income working families can get help for up
to 70% of their additional childcare
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000103">Are we
missing other innovative ideas? Should the Government revisit some of
yesteryear’s solutions for inspiration? In World War II,
shipyards in the United States established pioneering company-sponsored
childcare centres. They were in operation 24 hours a 
<?notus-xml column=1637?>day, had a nurse on site for any ill children and provided hot meals
during the day. They were opened to ensure the company had the
workforce to build ships and were closed after the war ended, but could
this large-scale, open-all-hours creche be a possible
option?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000104">In the
past, communities came together to look after children if their parents
were not available. Could the Government look at childcare collectives
put together by volunteers? Sweden, for example, has a long history of
parental co-operatives run by many pre-schools. They are organised and
staffed by the parents who use the service. The idea has echoes of the
big society agenda where regulatory barriers are removed to encourage
voluntary groups and communities to take action. This might also
provide an opportunity for another resource we may not be using
effectively.</hs_para>

Prosser (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, for providing us with the opportunity to debate this
important issue. It is important to children, to parents and to the
economy of the country. However, this discussion gives me a very gloomy
sense of déjà vu. The question of good quality affordable
childcare for those parents who want or need it has been a rallying cry
from women’s groups and individual women for at least the past
40 years. Back in the 1970s we had childcare campaigns organised and
working in different parts of the country. I became the secretary of
the Southwark childcare campaign. There were London and national
umbrella campaigns. In Southwark, we had virtually reached agreement
with the then GLC for the provision of a childcare centre in Bermondsey
when the GLC was abolished. That was very disappointing at the
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000108">A number
of these campaigns, including ours in Southwark, grew out of the trade
union movement. My old union, the Transport and General Workers’
Union, put resolutions to the TUC women’s conference. One such
resolution in the early 1980s called for a 
<?notus-xml column=1638?>parents’ charter which itself called for not only good quality
affordable childcare but for parental leave for mothers and fathers.
Yes, there were and are examples of the trade union movement being in
the vanguard of
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000109">In the
1990s, I went to Sweden and Denmark looking at their childcare
policies. The provision of affordable childcare was something of a
given. Interestingly, leave for fathers was available, but was not
being well used at that time. Acceptance of such provision requires a
cultural shift, which takes time and effort to bring about. Hopefully,
in this country, we will continue both to encourage fathers to take
leave but also, crucially, to campaign for better financial
compensation to enable the person who earns the most within the
household to be able to afford to take advantage of the leave

Equal Opportunities Commission produced a research report on the value
to society of affordable childcare. One of the possibilities proposed
was to embrace the then French system which spread the cost between
parents, local government and central government, the burden therefore
not falling too heavily on any one partner. Needless to say, this was

nursery provision in the workplace. While I accept the case for a
contribution from employers, I can also see that this can hardly be

that there is an overall strategy towards working parents, so some will

segregation is most prevalent among women who have children. These are
generally the women who have started off in decent jobs with career

service—is that unless the woman is earning a considerably good

scoots up to £14,000. Since the general election in 2010, the
cost of childcare has risen by 30% and the number of available places
has gone down by 35,000. We therefore have the situation where business
and/or the taxpayer has paid good money to train a female employee. The

childcare is central to the current cost of living debate and concern
about living standards. According to a Joseph Rowntree Foundation
report, the cost of childcare has risen by 37% since 2008, more than
double the rate of inflation, and at a time when real wages have been
stagnant or falling. In short, any attempt to alleviate the pressure on
family budgets will be incomplete if it fails to offer credible
solutions to the current lack of affordable
childcare<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:18:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000122">Last
year I had the privilege of chairing a Liberal Democrat policy working
group that looked at the problems of people on low to middle incomes
who try to juggle work and family responsibilities. The report we
produced, <I>A Balanced Working Life</I>, looked in particular at
childcare and benefited hugely from the experience of my noble friend
Lady Walmsley. We sought to emphasise in our report not just the
financial burden of expensive childcare and its impact on household
budgets but its implications for the participation of women in the jobs
market, child development and social mobility. I want to emphasise
today the importance of looking at childcare in the
round.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000123">The
loss of female employment after childbirth due to the current lack of
flexible and affordable childcare is a serious loss of skills to the
economy. Of course, some mothers choose to stay at home and look after
their children, and that must always be a matter of individual choice
based on their own circumstances. However, some people are denied that
choice because the childcare simply is not there.</hs_para>

the Institute for Fiscal Studies has shown female employment to be the
key driver for increased income among low to middle-income families in
the past 50 years. Not only is the lack of affordable childcare a limit
on women’s job prospects and professional development, it can
also leave some women in a more vulnerable situation if they find that
they are unable to support themselves; for example, if a relationship
breaks down or a partner dies. It does not have to be this way.
Findings from the OECD show that employment among women with children
is eight percentage points lower in the UK than in the top five
performers in the OECD. If our competitors can establish policies that
enable women to return to work, surely we can,
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000125">From a
social mobility
perspective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>, the
importance of early years is unequivocal. We have heard many times in
debates in this Chamber that, by the age of three, large disparities in
child development have already become apparent between children from
low-income backgrounds and their relatively wealthier peers, with these
gaps widening further over time. If we are serious about ensuring that
children from disadvantaged backgrounds reach their potential,
guaranteeing access to high-quality and affordable childcare from a
young age is the place to
start<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:20:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Working Life</I> report, to which I referred earlier, set four criteria
against which we should judge the childcare market and how effectively
it is working: affordability; quality; convenience and flexibility; and
the adequacy of provision. Looking at the evidence, the childcare
market does not stand up particularly well on any of these
counts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000127">Let us
take affordability, which is our prime concern today, and imagine that
we are the parent of a one year-old child who has returned to work,
five days a week, from 8 am to 6 pm, from financial necessity, just to
help make ends meet. The 50 hours of childcare you require per week
will set you back on average £11,000 per year, or £14,000
if you live in London. The burden is not eased once you child reaches
school age. If your job requires working longer hours and your child
attends a daily after-school club, you could be faced with a weekly
bill of almost
£50<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:21:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000128">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>
is no surprise that two-thirds of parents say that the cost and
inflexible nature of childcare has meant that they have been unable
either to take up a job or to work longer hours. Once again, as we
heard from the noble Baroness, Lady Jenkin, the comparisons with the
rest of the OECD are unfavourable. The average British family spends
27% of their earnings on childcare, which is higher than every OECD
nation, bar

mention briefly a point made eloquently by the noble Baroness, Lady
Massey: the position facing parents of disabled children who look for
affordable, high-quality
childcare<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>. Even
when that childcare is available, and in many places it is not, it is
often available only at a substantial premium. A survey by Working
Families found that around 13% of respondents were paying more than
£10 per hour for childcare for their disabled child. With the
huge personal toll that providing such intensive care takes on
individuals and family life, the need for affordable, reliable care is
acute<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:22:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000130">On
convenience and flexibility, it is clear that, for many parents, the
availability of childcare is simply not compatible with their working
hours. This is particularly pronounced for parents working atypical
hours. Just 9% of local authorities in England reported having
sufficient places for these children. More generally, with the typical
school day finishing at 3 pm, the question of who will care for
school-age children becomes particularly
pronounced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000131">I
have spent some time describing the challenges that we face, because I
think it is important to be clear about the nature of the issue, but I
want to finish by focusing on some of the good things that are already
happening and what I would like to see happen in the future. I should
like to highlight the community childcare hub model developed by the
charity 4Children and currently being piloted in nine locations, with
very welcome funding from government. The purpose of these hubs is to
integrate local childcare services, increasing their accessibility.
Whereas formerly parents have had to plan and co-ordinate their own
childcare, working around fixed opening times and making independent
arrangements with childminders to cover irregular working patterns,
hubs bring together the full range of childcare options, including
nurseries, 
<?notus-xml column=1642?>childminders and after-school
clubs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:24:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Working
with the hub, parents are able to establish a complete, co-ordinated
pattern of care for their children, and change that when their family
or working hours change. Early feedback from these pilots is
encouraging; they provide a promising model for shaping and
co-ordinating the local childcare
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:24:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:24:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:24:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000132">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:24:29"></hs_TimeCode>
am proud that Liberal Democrats have given the issue of childcare real
priority in difficult economic times. Thanks to Liberal Democrat
policies, implemented through the coalition Government, three and four
year-olds are now entitled to 15 free hours at Ofsted-inspected
early-years settings which offer the early years foundation stage.
Moreover, that entitlement has already been extended to 20% of two
year-olds from the most deprived backgrounds, rising to
40<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>% as of
September<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000133">Our
<I>A Balanced Working Life</I> report focuses on ways of reducing the
cost of childcare by building on that free entitlement, which I think
is at the very heart of the matter. I am pleased to say that its
recommendations were adopted as party policy at our party conference
last September. Therefore, as a party we are committed, as resources
allow, to increasing the free childcare entitlement on a stepped basis
to: 10 hours per week for all babies between the ages of one and two;
15 hours for all two year-olds; 20 hours for children
between three and four; and 25 hours for four to five
year-olds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000134">I
believe that those additional hours should be targeted at those
families whose joint household income is below £100,000 per
year. It is worth noting that that very small provision of 10 hours of
free childcare for one to two year-olds will not only help mothers to
keep in touch with the jobs market, which is crucial, but provide a
bridge, which does not currently exist, between parental leave and the
current free entitlement for two
year-olds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000135">Speaking
in a personal capacity, I hope that such policies will feature
prominently in all party manifestos, including my own, as we move to
the next election, but of course mine will not be the final voice on
the issue. I simply end by saying that I observe, and note with much
interest, the parallels between the Liberal Democrat party policies
that I have just described and those that the Labour Party announced in
late September, which also aim to extend free childcare for three to
four year-olds from 15 hours to 25 hours. Perhaps a cross-party
consensus is about to emerge—who

grateful indeed to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, for

those children who are most at risk within our

provision in this country has grown like Topsy. As we have heard from a
number of examples comparing our own experiences when we were young
parents with those of our children as parents now, the need for
childcare has become more and more crucial to both parents and
children, and as a mainstay of our 
<?notus-xml column=1643?>culture as well of our economy. However, there is such a complex system,
which is part universal and part not, with childcare vouchers in their
varied forms as an additional complication. Rather strangely, there is
also the danger that universal credit will actually make the situation
more, rather than less,
complex.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000138">There
is indeed a very strong case for extending access to affordable
childcare, but there is also a case for starting again to provide a
coherent system. I wonder whether there ought to be something along the
lines of an all-party commission—we have heard a good deal about
how the parties are coming together on some of these
issues—which could stand back a bit from the immense detail with
which we can get involved and consider whether there is a more coherent
long-term strategy for looking at
childcare.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000139">Within
that context, I should like to stress two particular points. First is
the need for childcare to be not only affordable but of high quality.
There are some welcome signs. The increase in the proportion of paid
daycare staff who hold at least a level 3 early years qualification
from 54% in 2003 to 84% now is a very encouraging marker. Nevertheless,
childcare remains a low-wage profession, and the point made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Jenkin, that we have here a system that is at the
same time expensive and low-wage, needs looking at
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000140">The
noble Baroness, Lady Massey, cited the statistic that turnover of
childcare staff is as much as three times that of a good school. This
must have an effect on quality. I know from my own experience how much
my own grandchildren value the particular relationships that they
establish through the childcare that is provided for them, and how
difficult it can be for them and their friends when there are changes
in that childcare. That turnover of staff is something that needs to be
combated. What strategy do the Government have for improving the status
of the childcare profession and the requirement for adequate training
and qualifications so that it is comparable, for example, to teaching
or
nursing?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000141">Secondly,
despite the increase in free provision, childcare is taking an
increasing proportion of the income of our poorest families, especially
of those in work. More than half the families living in poverty are in
work. We need to ensure that the main beneficiary of childcare is the
child. Children in poverty need the high-quality childcare that enables
their parents to work and so contributes to the well-being of the whole
family. It is perhaps particularly important for lone mothers.
Gingerbread has recently published startling evidence of the
improvement in the mental health of lone mothers when they enter
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000142">The
Government need to be careful in the financial arrangements they make
to support lone mothers and others who are unemployed in accessing
affordable, high- quality childcare to enable them to return to work.
Yet the current proposal for a childcare element of universal credit
provides 85% of costs from 2016 only if both parents earn above the
income tax threshold. The lowest-income working parents will receive
only 70% of childcare costs. If earnings fluctuate, as they do in so
many of these families, it will be unclear to them whether they are
entitled to 70% or 85%.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1644?><hs_para UID="14010944000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000143">Through tax credits and
housing benefit, families can now receive up to 90% of their childcare
costs. Those in most need will see help reduced to 70% in 2016. How
will the Government ensure that support for childcare costs is given to
the families in most need? This is a key part of the weft and woof of
our society in these days. It is something that needs and deserves the
attention that we are paying to it in this debate today, but this needs
to be extended to serious consideration in all our parties and in this
House as a whole. I hope that this debate will be a developing part of
a concentration on childcare that will stress its importance for
families, for parents, for our society and, above all, for the children
themselves.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_09_PT_1/440CC37BC866EB57CBA0A67F0C9A4ABC28EFAFBB" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 January 2014">Thursday,

King of Bow (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thought I would start with
a reflection on what a strange breed working mothers are. All you
really need to know about us is that we never sleep and continually
stress over childcare. Between 1 am last night, when I gave the baby
his last feed and started jotting down a few notes for this speech, and
5 am this morning, when my husband got up to feed him, I was woken six
times. I have four children so I have no one else to blame but myself.
It is my bed and I made it; I just wish I could lie in it, but that is
a problem entirely of my own
making.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000145">What
is not a problem of my own making is that when I drag myself out of
said bed and complete several school runs, as I did this morning, and
when I finally arrive at my two year-old’s nursery, I find that
I must pay £1,100 per month if I want her to go full-time, five
days a week. Despite the fact that I am, by definition, extraordinarily
privileged because—look—I am standing in this gilded
Chamber as a Member of Britain’s most prestigious LinkedIn
group, the fact remains that I cannot afford £1,100 a month. So
my daughter does not go full time; she goes half time—two and a
half days a week. For that I pay £660 a
month<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:35:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

two pre-school children, the cost for me to place them in the local
children’s centre was £880 per child, or £1,760
per month. That is why, as my noble friend Lady Prosser said, once you
have two pre-school kids it is simply impossible for most people to
afford that childcare. At the time I had what most people would
consider to be a really good job. I was senior policy adviser to the
Prime Minister but still I could not afford to spend £1,760 a
month on childcare. So I left Downing Street and got a job where I
could afford more childcare. So what? Who cares? My point is this: if
you are a woman working in the Prime Minister’s Office and your
employment choices are governed by the lack of affordable childcare,
then you know that women with fewer resources and fewer networks have
no chance at all of being able to pay for childcare out of their
salary. They are forced to stay at home or make arrangements for their
children that put those
children<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:37:02"></hs_TimeCode> at risk

down a job only if they have a sympathetic boss. Working mothers and
working parents, therefore, often become unfairly beholden to the
individual views of their boss. I was in a situation—a 
<?notus-xml column=1645?>lot of us have been—in which I had a sympathetic boss. My boss in
Downing Street was, after all, the first Chancellor and then Prime
Minister to recognise the importance of massively increasing funding
for childcare. He recognised that it was a national investment, as
important in terms of infrastructure—certainly to
women—as, say, transport.</hs_para>

when I arrived at the local childcare centre that I mentioned and found
a sign on the gate saying, “Closed due to staff
sickness”, I felt sick in my stomach because I was due to have
my first one-to-one briefing with the Prime Minister on my policy area.
It was Sod’s law. I arrived in Downing Street with a 16
month-old on my hip and was shown in to see Gordon Brown, who had a
face like thunder. To be fair, he often has a face like thunder, so I
was not entirely sure if it was because I had a baby on my hip.
However, I knew that I would not be pleased if a member of my staff
turned up with a baby on their hip for a meeting. The baby started to
cry, I was jiggling him and when I turned back, Gordon had disappeared.
I thought, “Oh my God! He’s just walked out and is going
to sack me. He is outraged and I do not really blame him that
much”. Then his head popped out from the side of his desk. He
was on his hands and knees and he said, “Maybe your son will
like this little train set. My sons play with it”. He pushed it
round and round for 10 minutes, and then said, “I think
he’s settled now; we can get down to business”.</hs_para>

point is that even though he was a sympathetic boss, let me get away
with bringing the baby into the office, presided over a sea change in
funding for childcare, and created and funded Sure Start, the fact is
that now we see the gains falling back.
Too<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:39:39"></hs_TimeCode> often we see
Sure Start being used as a political football or, indeed, not being
used at all. When Labour was in power, Michael Gove said, “The
Tories may well be wary of Sure Start because they believe it is the
nationalisation of childcare”. If childcare is affordable and of
high quality, I frankly do not mind who provides it, whether it is the
voluntary sector, the private sector or the state. In reality, it is
only the Government who can ensure that affordable, quality childcare
is available to all children who need it. I thought that the point made
by my noble friend Lady Prosser about the role that trade unions have
played in providing childcare was important. I am reminded of the
school run that I do each morning. Every day I pass a small blue plaque
at the bottom of my street saying that this is where Sylvia Pankhurst
set up the first crèche for working women—those otherwise
known as the matchstick girls. Of course, times have changed since
then, but not enough. Although we have poured in that money—and
I recognise some of the very important points made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Jenkin—we need to be smarter about how we invest
it. We need to do as well as or better than our European competitors.
However, I imagine that as well as spending the money more smartly, if
we are to deal with all those children—and parents—who
need childcare we are also going to have to bite the bullet and invest
more<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:41:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to the nub of this debate. What is the case for increasing access to

the Exchequer, but what is the social case? In my few remaining

inequality and on improving social mobility, and how it can also
improve parenting across social classes. I hope that we will also take

point is that if we cannot come to a political consensus in this

more and more of our money at the other end of the system in crisis,

has stated that greater spend and higher enrolment in early education
is correlated with increased social mobility. Universal, affordable and
high-quality childcare helps in two ways. First, it lifts maternal
employment rates and, secondly, it improves child development for the
most disadvantaged children. I hope that we will note the report of the
Early Action Task Force, entitled <I>The Deciding Time—Prevent

in early years education and childcare is possibly the single most

we need is more radical than what we have heard mentioned. Over the
long term, we need free universal pre-school childcare. As
Labour’s shadow Minister for Childcare, Lucy Powell MP, has

is now largely—certainly in Scotland—a devolved matter.
We need to be careful, therefore, that the context in which some of
these policy changes are being made has been properly thought through.
I should like an assurance from the Treasury Bench —I
know my noble friend understands these issues perfectly
well—that the necessary steps are being taken to make sure that
there are no surprises in the different tax positions being taken at a
national United Kingdom level and in the devolved legislatures. It is
important  to make sure that the interface is kept as efficient

the short term, I was struck by the evidence that was submitted by the
Commission on Social Mobility and Child Poverty in response to the
Government’s current plans on childcare. I know that this is a
cross-departmental issue and that the Treasury has an obvious interest
in all of this, but I would really like, more than anything else, to
take away from this debate an assurance from the Minister that that
report, submitted by Mr Alan Milburn and his distinguished group of
commissioners, will be absolutely and thoroughly studied. He has made a
number of recommendations, two of which I think deserve particular
attention. It would be possible to switch some of the
resources— £750 million, £800 million,
whatever was announced in the Budget earlier this year—to some
of the lower echelons, particularly for low-income families who may be
able to take advantage of universal credit, whenever that happens; I am
not holding my breath for it to happen any time

Milburn has suggested that rather than having a ceiling of £150,
000 you could make it £120,000, save some money and switch it
into putting an 85% support level within universal credit. That makes
perfect sense. It would cost no extra money at all—the money is
already in the plan, and from a social justice point of view, that is
an incontrovertible idea that needs to be addressed. If it is rejected,
then I, for one, would like to hear the reasons
why.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000163">The
second thing that Mr Milburn said, and I agree with him, is that within
universal credit the current plans have got a split, a 70% or 80% cliff
edge. He makes some valid criticisms which I absolutely associate
myself with, and that deserves an answer as well. The right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds also made some important points,
and Barnardos has made some valid criticisms, with options for change
which are entirely reasonable and need to be studied to help us
understand how we can deal with some of these issues going
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000164">I
remind the House that the current tax credit levels of childcare were
originally set in 2005 at £175 for one child and £300 for
more than one child. If the current plans hold, they will exist all the
way through to 2016 at that level. The Commission on Social Mobility
and Child Poverty estimates that by the time we get to
2016—there have been various estimates about the increases in
childcare that have occurred and are obviously evident—childcare
costs will increase by 80%. All the powerful points that have been made

noble friend go back to the department and say “Have we got some
contingency planning for some of this?”. I agree with universal
credit, I think the architecture is perfectly good and I have been a
stout supporter of the principle. However, if we are really thinking of

seven siblings. The women of my generation who went to university and

unchecked young students from abroad who had to be given time to study
and who “babyminded” for a few hours each day. They were

Walmsley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Massey—who I would also called my noble
friend—on introducing this debate. At a time when the country
needs all those who wish to work and are capable of working to be
enabled to do so, there is a very hard-headed argument for providing
families with high-quality childcare when and where they need it.
Working parents juggle the demands of work and family life precisely
because they know that poverty will hold their children back and will
not contribute to their welfare and happiness. Although enabling both
parents to work if they wish is a good thing, the main issue for me is
the development, physical and mental health, and happiness of the
children. This comes first. As the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said,
there is a good child-development argument for enabling children to
come together under the guidance of properly trained people to learn to
socialise, to make decisions, to speak and listen, and to concentrate,
as well as to develop their physical skills and enhance their emotional

<?notus-xml column=1651?>and cultural development. This is usually done by childminders or in
groups in early years settings run by other professionals, but let us
not forget that it can also be done informally in community playgroups
and parent-led co-operative childcare groups, as mentioned by the noble
Baroness, Lady Jenkin of
Kennington.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000175">Research<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>
has shown that children benefit from high-quality settings where the
staff are well trained but can be harmed by spending long periods in
poor-quality settings. Sadly, the poorest-quality settings are to be
found in the most deprived areas, where the children desperately need
the stimulus and care that is found in a good setting to compensate for
their poverty of experience at home. However, research also shows
emphatically that infants with secure attachment histories become
better adjusted and more skilled at solving problems, seeking
assistance, dealing with difficulties and tolerating frustration in
later life. I am sure that the noble Baroness, Lady Bakewell, would
agree with that. I also agree with her that a happy mother means a
happy baby—we need to achieve both. We need to balance the
child’s need to spend enough time with its principal carer, with
the opportunity for loving, touching and interaction, with the
child’s need to socialise with other children and receive the
stimulation he needs to develop, as well as with the family’s
need for sufficient income to keep them out of poverty. This is quite a

to accept the statistics which that show that, despite the large
amounts of public subsidy that are, rightly, put into providing early
years education, the cost of childcare to some parents in this country
is relatively high. I say “some parents” because many of
them solve the problem by using loving grandparents and other family
members, who generously give up their freedom in later life in order to
look after their grandchildren for nothing. Of course, most of them
love doing it and provide love as well as care to the
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000177">I
also use the word “some” because there are—we have
to accept this—thousands of families in this country who benefit
from the 15 hours of free entitlement and also receive a subsidy of 70%
or more on any additional hours purchased or receive a tax refund on
what they spend. I welcome all that. When you look at those facts you
have to realise that this Government, and the previous one, have done
an awful lot to help families to enable both parents to go out to work.
So how is it that costs are so high? Some believe that it is because
the mandatory ratios of adults to children are low compared to other
countries, apart from the Nordic ones. I do not agree with that. I am
one of those who believe that we have got the ratios right and they
should not be changed. It is interesting that the sector feels that
too, despite the fact that it would stand to gain if the ratios were to
be increased. Indeed, many in the sector choose not to use the higher
ratios which the law currently allows them to use in the interests of
providing a high-quality
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000178">I
have a theory about why costs are high. It is because a large number of
parents are unable to resist the lure of 25 hours of free childcare in
a primary school, so they send the child to school as soon as he turns
four rather than keeping him in a nursery setting, 
<?notus-xml column=1652?>where the free entitlement is only 15 hours. One can hardly blame them
but the result is that nursery settings have lost all the children for
whom they were legally allowed to use higher ratios and are left to
make their money only from the younger children, to care for whom they
need to employ more staff. Whatever the reason, we need to do something
to help hard-pressed families afford good childcare if both parents
wish to work and can find a job. The danger of providing additional
cash benefits or tax vouchers is that the costs will simply spiral to
take up the new money and there will be no improvement either in
quality or affordability. So what do we do to keep costs down without
compromising
quality?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000179">From
these Benches, our solution, as outlined by my noble friend Lady Tyler
of Enfield, is to increase the number of free-hours entitlement,
thereby decreasing the number of hours for which a family needs to pay.
This would soon pay for itself, as the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser,
has pointed out, through the greater economic activity of both parents.
It would also bring down costs because nurseries could get back the
four year-olds, for whom the adult-child ratios are higher. We and the
Labour Party are both proposing that, at four years-old, the child
would get<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> 25
hours of free nursery entitlement.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> believe that
under-fives—indeed, under-sixes—thrive best in a
play-based environment, in which their healthy and happy development is
the main objective, rather than whether they can read and write at
four, and where their development is supervised by trained early years
professionals. There is much evidence that children who start formal
education at seven catch up with others who started at five by the time
they reach nine and overtake them by the time they reach 11. This is
because their development and their learning have gone hand in hand so
that what they learn is more firmly embedded. As to those families who
rely on two incomes to survive the child’s first couple of
years, I would like to see an increase in the parental leave benefits
to prevent mothers feeling that they have to go back to full-time work
too soon for the good of their own health and the well-being of their
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000180">The
other major issue is, of course, the quality of provision and the
qualifications of the staff in early years settings. I share the
concerns of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and
Leeds—we will miss him in this House when he comes to retire in
about a month’s time, and I am sure the rest of the House will
share my wishes for him to have a very happy retirement. I therefore
welcome the proposals for a new simplified system of qualifications
bringing in the level 3 early educator and the graduate early years
teacher, although I regret the proposal that the latter should not have
qualified teacher status and conditions like other teachers. However, I
am not clear how the Government plan to ensure that these well
qualified people work in areas of high deprivation where their skills
are most needed. Funding through the different schemes is weighted
towards very low-income households, who can receive the vast majority
of the approximate £9,000 per year cost of an average childcare
place while families in the middle, on an average income of
approximately £32,000, receive only £2,500. Although
lower-income families receive a great deal more funding, there is no
clear way 
<?notus-xml column=1653?>of ensuring that those children are getting the best-quality care.
Perhaps my noble friend can say how that is to be
achieved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000181">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:09:00"></hs_TimeCode>

£21.1 million visiting and inspecting around 55,000

Education Select Committee
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14010944000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000218">“we
need to think about the future and how we inspect childminding
institutions. I do not think we can carry on doing it as we are doing
it at the moment: every time a youngster goes into a childminding
setting, we have to inspect. That is
unsustainable”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="14010944000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000205">He
also admitted, in my hearing at a meeting of the APPG for Education,
that the current inspections of childminders are a desultory and
tick-box event and have little to do with the quality of care being
provided as long as it is above the minimum the law requires. Perhaps
this is the real reason why the Government do not plan to insist that
Ofsted inspects all childminders signed up to one of the new agencies.
I would therefore be very interested in how quality is to be
guaranteed.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14010944000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000182">I
share the concerns of others about disabled children. It is common
knowledge that many parents of disabled children are unable to find
appropriate childcare at all. Even when they do so, they have to pay a
premium for it. I am aware that local authorities receive additional
money for disabled children, but that does not seem to filter through
to the right places to ensure that parents pay no more than any other
family. I suspect that it is not the legislation that is going wrong
but the practice. I would be interested to know whether the Government

Graham of Edmonton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a joy and a
pleasure to follow the noble Baroness. Our Thursday debates are very
precious to me because one hears more about the background of Members
of this House—which, quite frankly, is a counterargument to
those who talk disparagingly about the make-up of this House. I
thoroughly enjoyed the last speech. When I reflect on all the speeches
I have heard today, first, I very much want to congratulate my noble
friend Lady Massey for providing the peg that allowed so many noble
Lords to get these issues off their chests and to recognise, as I do,
that no Bench in this House is entitled to say, “This is our
issue”. I made the point in my notes that everything that could
have been said has been, but not by everybody. The more one hears of
contributions from colleagues around the House, the more respect one
has for the fact that they have made it to this place, which is of
course a great
achievement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000184">I
can speak of childcare in the 1920s and 1930s because I was there. My
mam and dad had five children. I was the eldest. Dad was on the dole
from 1930 to 1939, when war broke out. In fact, it was not the dole but
worse—the means test. The means that you had were tested to see
if they were right. In 1937, I remember speaking to mam and dad after
that test. They had 37 shillings a week to look after seven
people. A factor in that was that the princely sum of two
shillings—that 
<?notus-xml column=1654?>is, 10 pence—was allocated to each child. I come from a
background that was not poverty stricken but where we managed because
everybody else was in the same boat where I lived in
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. I survived and had a very interesting life. I am
proud now to have this platform

Minister who will reply to this debate—whom I respect very
much—will have her own contribution to make, but I have learnt
from my experience and that of other people of the enormous difference
in circumstances now. When my mam had to look after seven people, the
question of her going out to work never figured. The way it was, if you
had five children and seven in the house, your place was there to look
after them. One reflects upon the opportunities now, and my noble
friend Lady King of Bow was able to illustrate just how wide the gap
has grown from my circumstances to hers. That means that, as in the
very first words of my noble friend Lady Massey, it is the
responsibility not just for this but of every Government to take
seriously what has been said
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010944000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010944000186">When I
moved on into the 1950s, I married and had two children. We were not
hard up, but the vogue of going out to work certainly came about and
was there. That vogue has grown and grown. I read of the circumstances
of young married women who try to do what the Government urge them to:
get a job, and get out and work. Then one looks at what is available to
enable them to do that. All parties are guilty of not looking at the
two ends of that spectrum. We are very good at recognising the concerns
of the elderly—pensions, grants and so on—but not this
sector for one reason or other, bearing in mind that we are talking
about flesh and blood, and the future of our society. As my noble
friend Lady Bakewell said very well, how did we get into this mess? The
priorities need to be readjusted. The Minister has a responsibility to
do that because she will speak to her colleagues and be briefed by

Morgan of Ely (Lab):</Member></B> I begin by thanking my noble friend

having an effect on families up and down the country. I have just
returned from two weeks of looking after my 10 year-old and my 
12 year-old for the holidays. I am utterly exhausted and have come back
to work for a little rest, so I cannot begin to imagine what my noble

the country and the armies of childminders and pre-school teachers, who
are crucial in the early years of a child’s development. Having
a child is an expensive business, but under this Government it is a
more expensive business than ever. The decision as to whether to stay
at home is of course an individual one, and rightly so, but it is based
on a number of factors. Today, I fear that that choice is curtailed for
many who have often been highly trained and highly educated by the
state—people who were making a valuable contribution to the
workplace—but for whom the cost of childcare simply does not
make it worth their while to go back to work. They drop out of the
workforce, they lose their opportunities for promotion and they often

he had hurt his wing, or something. I moved the wasp so that my

you doing?”. I said, “Look, he has hurt his wing”.
“Oh yes, he has hurt his wing, he wants his mother”, he
said. So I said, “You go and look for his mother”. Two
minutes later he came back. He said, “Mum, I have looked
everywhere for the wasp’s mother. I think she has gone to

people with young families who are already contending with higher fuel
bills and transport costs are really struggling now with these
rocketing prices—30% up, as we have heard, five times more than
pay since the coalition Government came to power. It is worth spelling
that out in financial terms. As we have heard, the average cost of a
full-time nursery place for a child under two is £11,000,
£211 a week. Let us not forget that the average salary in this
country is £23,000 before tax, so half the money is
supposed to go on childcare. That is double the amount that people
spend on a mortgage. That is just for one child. We need women to
engage in the workforce to increase economic activity, because this is
not just a massive financial burden for parents, it is a burden for the
wider economy, which is dragged down by the fact, according to the
Resolution Foundation, as we have heard, that fewer women with children
work in the UK than in many of our competitor countries. In a survey of
mothers carried out for Asda, 70% of stay-at-home mums said that they

British-born mothers had more children, in addition to immigrant
mothers. Why? Because every signal that the Labour Government sent out
was that babies and children are welcome in our society. Government
childcare and tax credits were a key factor. Maternity leave doubled
under the Labour Government, paternity leave was introduced and mothers
were for the first time able to request flexible working hours. Child
benefit rose and child tax credits added greatly to family incomes.
Childcare costs for the poorest were covered up to 80% by credits, with
free nurseries for three and four year-olds and 3,500 Sure Start

of course, has hit the poorest hardest. As we have heard from my noble

Government’s proposed agency approach to childminders will push

treats and not enough to cover one child’s weekly nursery bill.
That is the reality of the working poor; it is the cost of living

Labour Party recognises that the issue of childcare is fundamental to
this cost of living discussion. That is why Labour has a costed pledge,
funded by an increase in the bank levy, to extend free childcare for
three and four year-olds from 15 to 25 hours per week for working
parents of three and four year-olds. In addition, another measure that
will have parents up and down the country heaving a sigh of relief is
that the Labour Government will introduce a legal guarantee to access
to wraparound care from 8 am to 6 pm at primary schools in
England—we need to note that that is just for England. This is
reinstating a programme that proved successful under the previous
Labour Government, whereby, in 2010, 99% of schools in England were
providing access to before and after-school childcare. This programme
was abandoned by David Cameron, effectively ending that guarantee of a
core offer of activities from 8 am until 6 pm for school-age children.

Northover (LD):</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
for tabling today’s debate on access to affordable childcare and
for introducing it so effectively. She has a long track record in
fighting for the rights of children and families, as I know from
sharing with her the position of trustee for UNICEF, a position which
my noble friend Lady Walmsley also held. I also thank all noble Lords
who have spoken in today’s debate. As ever, this has been a very
powerful debate and we all agree that the cost and quality of childcare
matters. As the noble Baronesses, Lady Massey and Lady Bakewell, my
noble friend Lady Jenkin and others have pointed out, life has changed
over the past few decades. Of course men and women have long worked but
as social and economic patterns have changed, so too has the way that
children are brought up. Increasingly, from the Second World War
onwards, women took up paid work and, what is more, nuclear families
often lived away from other family members. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Bakewell, said, we have here a large-scale social change.</hs_para>

experience of the huge challenges of arranging paid childcare, as the
first ones to do so in our families. The noble Lord, Lord Graham,
thought that I might inject my own experience and I must not disappoint
him. I recall my experience as a lecturer at UCL, returning to work
with a baby and finding that I would have needed to reserve a place in
the nursery at the moment of conception, not birth. My baby accompanied
me, and I kept him as quiet as I could for the first few months until
he secured his place. I knew to act faster when I became pregnant the
next time. Although that then almost obliterated my salary, I had a
very good and wonderful workplace nursery.</hs_para>

with those who felt guilt, as expressed by the noble Baronesses, Lady
Massey, Lady Bakewell, Lady Morgan, my noble friend Lady Jenkin and
others. I still have this image of Munch’s “The
Scream” from when my second child’s face was one large,
gaping, wailing hole as I left him one day in the nursery when he was
aged about one. I wondered what I must be doing to him. I also recall
the black looks of my male academic colleagues at the Wellcome
institute as I had to leave work when the nursery closed at
5.30 pm, but their wives were looking after their children
and they did not have to worry about it. As the noble Baroness, Lady
Prosser, mentioned, I then had to carry my tired children home and the
evenings were no fun.</hs_para>

first here phoning home and speaking to my then six year-old daughter,
to discover that her eight year-old brother was in possession of a

person supposedly looking after them had taken my other son to
something. I was phoning from just outside the Chamber while waiting
for a vote and the noble Lord, Lord Peston, was on the other phone. 
<?notus-xml column=1659?>He heard my desperate reaction as I heard about the power drill and
reassured me that they would survive, and they did—but they
might not have. So I am extremely familiar, as so many here are, with
what this actually means.</hs_para>

that both parents will return to work before their children are fully
grown. I am glad also that we have made the moves we have to make sure
that there is shared parental leave. We are not talking here only of
children who are under school age but of those going through school as
well, including their holidays. Of course, not all parents will want to
place their children in childcare and parents should have that choice,
but for those who return to work who, as I say, are increasing in
numbers, it is essential that they have access to good quality
childcare. I am sure that we all agree with that and I do not quite
follow the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, when there
had been so much agreement across the Chamber. We all understand the
significance of
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010946000006">Childcare
is obviously particularly important for enabling mothers to work, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, my noble friend Lady Walmsley and
others have said. That is because it remains the case that the primary
responsibility for children is seen as being the mother’s,
rightly or wrongly. We know from many surveys that women still carry
out the bulk of caring for children and for the home so, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Bakewell, said, this is all part of a long process of
establishing more equality for
women.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010946000007">The
noble Baroness, Lady Massey, asked whether we are facing a childcare
crunch. I do not agree; what I said about my own experience and what
others have said indicate that as this social change goes on, childcare
has been a challenge all the way down and continues to be so. It was so
under the previous Government and I pay them credit for what they did.
We have been building on that and are taking a number of positive steps
that are beginning to demonstrate an impact but, as the noble Baroness
and others all said, all Governments have faced this challenge and will
do so. We all, from whatever party, need to continue to address this.
It is best to be working together on this, in my view.</hs_para>

adoration at the wonderful person who looked after her, that too made
me happy. My noble friend Lady Walmsley is quite right about the
benefits of good quality care. As I listened to the noble Baroness,
Lady King, I also recalled that when my daughter was about seven days
old that same young lady, who is now a university student, left a
particularly large wet patch on Paddy Ashdown’s carpet 
<?notus-xml column=1660?>here. I was trying to maintain my career, which meant that my daughter
came with me, so that swam into mind. I left very rapidly then and this

Lady Massey, mentioned that childcare is a low-wage profession with
high turnover. We agree with the noble Baroness that the quality of the
workforce is key; evidence shows that this is extremely important. The
Government have introduced the early years teacher status from
September 2013, in recognition of the impact of graduate teachers on
children’s development. We have introduced apprenticeships and
bursaries of £3,000 to increase the number of staff educated at
least to A-level and to have English and maths GCSE. I learnt quite a
bit from the person who was caring for my daughter about how to bring
up three children who were close in age and in competition with each
other. At that stage she had been taught but had not had her own
children, which she now

all agree that we need to aspire to having good quality childcare
available at a reasonable cost, and that it is vital that we get that

what the previous Administration achieved, but all would
recognise—this has run through the debate—that more needs
to be done. That is why we have taken a number of steps to seek to
reduce parents’ childcare bills. In September 2010 the
Government increased the free entitlement to early education for three
and four year-olds to 15 hours a week—570 hours per
year—up from 12.5 hours a week. My noble friend Lord Kirkwood
and others are right to emphasise the importance of early years
education. It so happens that early years education can also help in
terms of childcare, but I would not necessarily conflate the
two.</hs_para>

extended to around 130,000 disadvantaged two year-olds, and it will be
extended still further from September 2014 to two year-olds from
working households on low incomes, for whom the costs of childcare are
such a burden, and more than 260,000 children will be eligible. My
noble friend Lady Walmsley stressed the importance of that educational
provision.</hs_para>

Lady Jenkin is right about the proportion of GDP that we put into this
yet, as she emphasised, we still see the challenges in the cost both to
the state and to families. The noble Baroness, Lady King, talked about
universal free childcare. As I say, there is universal childcare for
three and four year-olds, and the Government are proud of extending
that to 40% of two year-olds. There are arguments for extending that
further, of course, but the Department for Education estimates that
universal full-time childcare for children aged one to four would cost
£18 billion. She seemed to indicate support for that by her
reference to her colleague in the Commons but it sounds from 
<?notus-xml column=1661?>what the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, indicated that that is not
actually an agreed position. That kind of provision was made in some
countries, obviously—I remember visiting nurseries in

simply providing more funding will not halt the long-term increase in
childcare costs or provide the childcare places that we need for the
future. Nurseries find it difficult to expand without jumping through
many hoops, especially in planning. In addition, a complex registration
system and duplicatory inspection regimes have created barriers to new
entrants to the childcare market. We are not making enough use of the
many excellent facilities in our schools. In Denmark, for example, 88%
of six to eight year-olds take advantage of before-school and
after-school or holiday care, compared with only 22% in England. What
the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, said about wraparound care in schools
was not exactly accurate; a number of the schools that she was
referring to  were simply pointing parents in the direction of
care, not providing it themselves. Unfortunately, I do not think that
in the past this has been cracked, and it is therefore important to be
clear about what the situation actually is.</hs_para>

assure the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, that we are indeed looking at
this strategically. Our reforms focus on three key areas: increasing
supply—we are working very actively to expand the number of
places available with childminders and in nurseries and schools;
streamlining inspection so that we can focus on what matters to improve
children’s development and ensure that they are safe; and
reforming financial support to parents, making it simpler and more
consistent. That is an issue that the noble Baroness emphasised. On the
simplification of funding streams, the Government are carefully
considering how best to achieve that as the universal credit and the
new tax-free childcare system schema are rolled out. It is important to
get the balance right between stable funding for providers and
flexibility and choice for

noble Lords have said, we need to increase supply. We are doing what we
can to halt the long-term decline in childminder numbers—that
has been a very long-term decline, as anyone can see from the figures;
it is not recent—and provide new opportunities for high-quality
private and voluntary nurseries and schools. Noble Lords here will be
well aware that we are coming up to day four of Report on the Children
and Families Bill, and we are legislating to enable the creation of new
childminder agencies to make it simpler for people to become
childminders, to provide training and support and to help parents to
access home-based 
<?notus-xml column=1662?>care. We are making it easier for schools to expand to take two
year-olds and to offer out-of-school-hours childcare. In February we
will have the first results from schools regarding our demonstration
projects on this, and we will be assessing how they are working and
what can be done to expand that. So we are taking a number of measures
to try to address this.</hs_para>

few noble Lords have made reference to children’s centres and
indicated that they thought that these were closing in large numbers.
We are well aware of the great services that children’s centres
provide to their local communities for prospective parents before and
after their babies are born, for the parents and children themselves
until they are five. The noble Baronesses, Lady Massey and Lady
Prosser, for example, thought that 576 Sure Start centres had closed.
In fact that is not the case; as of 30 November, fewer than 2% had
closed and more than 3,000 were open. The question of Sure Start comes
up quite often, and as I looked at this carefully I found, and this is
worth emphasising, that children’s centres provide only a very
tiny proportion—less than 1%—of all registered childcare
places. That does not mean to say that they not of value, but they are

regard to inspection, we have to ensure that while increased choice is
important, if provision was not of a high standard it would leave
parents with no real choice at all and be detrimental for children. The
noble Lord, Lord Graham, made that point very clearly. Growth should
not be at the expense of quality. Ofsted has recently announced reforms
to early years inspection, and expectations will be higher and
accountability increased. I have a lot of detail about the inspection
process that I am happy to write to  my noble friend Lady
Walmsley about. She was also asking about childminder agencies. We are
working with 20 organisations to trial how childminder agencies will
work. As part of that, we are considering with Ofsted the most

earners, government will continue to pay up to 70% of childcare costs
through working tax credit and universal credit. I am again happy to
put details in a letter to noble Lords who have taken part in this
debate. The right reverend 
<?notus-xml column=1663?>Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds and my noble friend Lord Kirkwood
asked about this. We are already investing £2.2 billion in

are positive indications that the package of reforms that the
Government have put in place are starting to have the desired impact.
The signs are promising in terms of the cost of provision and maternal
employment. The National Day Nurseries Association reported in July

all nurseries was 1.5%, which is well below inflation, and 200,000

we are not complacent. We know that a great deal needs to be done. We
need to encourage growth in every part of the childcare market, place
quality at the heart of childcare provision, create genuine choice of
providers for parents and ensure that work really does pay. We are
talking about a long and very important social change. This has been a
very important debate. The right reverend Prelate, who will be much
missed when he takes retirement, pointed out that it is part of the
weft and woof of our society. It is vital that we have flexible,
accessible, high-quality childcare available to those parents who wish
to access it. We know that for better equality between the genders more

have learnt a lot today and had some ideas reinforced. I heard an
important concept put forward: an all-party commission on childcare.
There is a great deal of consensus between us in this House, as always
when we speak about children. I shall not refer to noble Lords by name,
but they will know who they are. Speakers on all sides said that all is
not well, much has been achieved, but we still have some way to
go.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010946000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0001.htm#14010946000028">Personal
reflection is always very important, and we had it about a 16 month-old
child on the hip, a wasp’s mother and wet patches, and my noble
friend Lady Prosser spoke about campaigning and organising. We have
mentioned key issues which could form the basis for discussion on this
large social change. Some of these issues seem to be about how the
system can be made simpler and more flexible, coherent and accessible.
Let us look at structures, including holiday care. Let us look at
spending smartly, as a noble Lord said, and at how we can show that
childcare can ultimately pay 
<?notus-xml column=1664?>for itself if it is rightly funded. Let us reinforce what we know about
women and employment. Childcare is good for women,
families and the economy. Let us look at good practice, not just abroad
but in the UK. Let us look at the benefits of early intervention and
how it can prevent problems later on. At the same time, let us look at
the early years workforce. It is key that childcare must be of the
highest possible standard and must benefit children. Let us look at
inspection. Let us look at issues about disabled children and
childcare. Let us look at in-work poverty. Let us look honestly at
social mobility and childcare. That is just for starters. Much work has
been done and is being done by all parties on childcare, families and
children, but, in thanking the Minister again, I ask her to suggest
some cross-party forum way where we can forge and examine these issues
realistically and honestly.</hs_para>

1 January and which is the European Union’s poorest

the numbers are important, we must not let them mask the human sorrow,
the tragedy, the catastrophe, that is the real substance of this
crisis. The UN and its partners in the region face many pressures. They
have to safeguard the health of millions, many of whom are now at risk
of contagious diseases, such as polio. Their ability to deal with the
extraordinary, such as survivors of torture and victims of chemical

organisations are also fighting to ensure social stability, which is an
uphill battle. In Lebanon, where the population has grown by an extra
25%, essential 
<?notus-xml column=1665?>resources, space and labour are all causes of significant social
tension. Near a village in east Lebanon, a makeshift refugee camp
providing shelter for hundreds was burnt down last month, a sign of the
increasing social tension in that area. The violence is spreading. The
Lebanese town of Tripoli saw bloodshed mirroring the Syrian conflict in
the past few months. Car bombs in Beirut are once again headline news.

Syrian civil war is enough to spark renewed violence that can
destabilise the whole region. The spread of violence will continue
unless practical and immediate measures are taken to relieve the
pressures on Syria’s own neighbours. They are generous, but can
they cope? The international community has responded admirably to the
United Nations high commission’s call for financial assistance
for refugees. The UK has pledged £500 million in aid—4.1%
of the 2013 aid budget. A further £16 million was pledged only a
few days ago. However, refusing to provide further practical help can
undermine the overwhelmingly generous response from the UK public to
this

immediate, hands-on, practical help that is now needed. We have so far
failed to allow any extra space for Syrian refugees, but I suggest that
it is now absolutely imperative that we do so. I received a Written
Answer on 28 November from the Minister, informing me that the
Government refuse even to consider relaxing the financial requirements
in the family immigration rules for the extraordinary cases of Syrian
nationals resident in the UK. I consider this response reflects a
deplorable lack of compassion on behalf of the Government, considering
how we as a nation and a society could combat that international
crisis. Simplified and expedited family reunions for Syrians here, on
any kind of visa, should surely be considered further. What proactive
efforts have been made to reunite refugees in the UK with their
families? Will the Minister make a declaration on the status of Syrian
students in the United Kingdom?</hs_para>

Prime Minister stated that we have accepted 1,500 Syrians seeking
asylum in the UK. This number, however, needs to be taken in context to
be properly understood. First, it represents only those who were able
to reach the UK independently using the normal asylum process. That
precludes so many—millions—of those who are most in need
of our help. Secondly, I understand that 352 Syrians were refused
asylum. Indeed, by the third quarter of 2013, there were still 446
Syrians awaiting a decision on their application made through the
normal channels. The truth is that ignoring the problem and accepting
Syrians seeking asylum only through normal routes can be hugely
damaging. The UN has called for us to take Syrian refugees in addition
to our current resettlement quota.</hs_para>

calling for the creation of another EU body. Under the auspices of the
UN, a working resettlement programme already exists. The UN aims to
register all refugees, and in so doing document those in particular
need. When other developed nations answered the United Nations’
call for resettlement, they responded to the cry for help from the UN
on behalf of these most vulnerable human beings. Not all 
<?notus-xml column=1666?>countries have used the same method but they have, in their own way,
responded to the need. Norway, Finland and Sweden have each accepted
400 to 1,000 refugees on a permanent basis. The Government of Canada
have accepted 200 refugees, but have also pledged a further 1,100
places through private sponsorship. Germany, taking the lead, has
pledged 10,000 places, staggered across the next three years, on the
basis of a pilot humanitarian assistance programme, limited to 
a two-year stay. On a similar basis, Austria and France have each
offered 500 places. Even Moldova, with a GDP of just over $2,000 per
person, is taking 50. We have said that we can take nobody.</hs_para>

that only a firm, global or continent-based resettlement programme will
offer a durable solution to this crisis? Both in financial and in
practical human terms, the current, unequal levels of response are
totally unsustainable. The United Nations is already working closely
with these countries to select and assist the most vulnerable,
including women and girls in danger of sexual violence, survivors of
torture, refugees with severe medical needs and disabilities, those in
need of family reunification, and those who face persecution because of
their political views, sexuality, ethnicity or religion. We hear so
much about the persecution of Christians in that part of the world. We
are saying that we are not going to accept these people. We are denying
them a place and saying that they must make do with what other
countries—Jordan, Turkey and others—are offering. The
priority is not only to accept those who are in danger, but also those
who will be invaluable in the rebuilding of Syria once this dreadful
conflict has ended.</hs_para>

accept 10,000 of those in need. I fully support that call. Does the
Minister? He will say, “Ah, but that is a big number”.
With the Vietnamese boat people in 1979, we did accept 10,000. The
fears of a public backlash in that case were totally unfounded. The
British people proved their compassion and their hospitality. Of
course, a decade earlier, in 1968, the east African Asians were another
example. Forty-five years on, and in the light of the greatest
humanitarian catastrophe of modern times, we are called upon to do so
again. When the Minister says that we cannot possibly have a
resettlement programme, where does he get his knowledge from? Where is
the difficulty? The UK has a proud history of providing support in this
way, most recently in the Balkans. What has changed?</hs_para>

Commissioner for Refugees has made a modest request that Europe should
accept 30,000 vulnerable refugees who fled Syria—vulnerable
people being pregnant women and children—and I would add those

very short notice we were asked to make arrangements for 4,000 Bosnians
who had been detained in those vile Serb concentration
camps—people who were absolutely traumatised, as are the Syrians
today. Those people came at short notice, and we arranged for reception
facilities and that they should then be moved on. We arranged that they
should not all come to London but that those people should be in
regional clusters to make it more acceptable in other parts of the
country—and it worked. There was virtually no public objection

Bosnian programme worked pretty well. Lessons had
been learnt from the earlier Vietnamese programme about dispersing
people in small units, because in the experience of the Refugee Council
it was better that people should be together with other members of

actually refused to take any of them. That is something that the

Syrians to leave the terrible circumstances in which they are living

I draw attention to a particular group of refugees—the
Palestinians—who have been displaced already and have been
living in Syria for many years. I want to draw particular attention to
the 30,000 Palestinian refugees trapped in the Yarmouk camp on the
outskirts of Damascus. It has been under tight siege for many months by
the regime’s forces, and the regime is preventing humanitarian
assistance being provided to the besieged people. Around 30 people have
died already, but there are nearly 30,000 Palestinians living in those
circumstances, which are probably worse than the circumstances of some
of the people living in the

Tonge (Ind LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble
friend on securing this debate and bringing the plight of the people
fleeing Syria to the attention of the House once more. As he says, it
is a great exodus of people; it is estimated that, by the end of this
year, 4 million people will have left Syria. At the moment, it is 2.3
million, but it is growing all the time. The conflict is continuing
much longer than expected; initially, it was assumed that the UNHCR,
with an appeal to the international community, would be able to cope.
This has not proved to be the case, and the numbers of people fleeing
are simply staggering. More than half of the 2.3 million are children,
and 75% of those children are under the age of 12. Noble Lords can
imagine the terror that they are living
with</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000063">Lebanon,
Turkey, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt are hosting some of those people, and we
know that they are not coping—and I shall not repeat what other
noble Lords have said. Resettlement is desperately needed, if only in
the short term, until Syria is stable again. I will repeat the figures.
Excluding Germany, which has pledged 10,000 places, the EU in total has
offered 2,340—not really very many—and we in the UK none,
even though I believe that Nigel Farage of UKIP has suggested that we
should take Syrian refugees, which is a very great recommendation. Up
to now, 17 countries have offered places up to a grand total of 16,000
places for 2.3 million people. Even Australia, which, as I have been
reading recently, is not known as a state that welcomes asylum seekers
and refugees, has offered 500 places—but the UK
none<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:26:53"></hs_TimeCode>.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:27:27"></hs_TimeCode> only
solution, as the noble Lord, Lord Wright, said, will be a political
one, but that seems far off, although we must hope. So the resettlement
being asked for will not necessarily be permanent but could give people
security and breathing space and, above all, care and education for the
children, who always suffer disproportionately in these
situations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000064">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:27:47"></hs_TimeCode>
of us who have been to Syria know what a wonderful country it is. I was
there three years ago with the Council for European Palestinian
Relations, which has already been referred to, a fine organisation that
hopes to introduce parliamentarians in Europe to all sides of the
situation. We visited refugee camps for Palestinians, some of whom have
been there since the 
<?notus-xml column=1672?>creation of Israel—since the Nakba, in fact—when some
8,000 or 10,000 were killed or driven from their homes. The subsequent
war between Israel and the Arab states added to that refugee crisis.
Others were forced to flee neighbouring Iraq after the Shia Government
took control following our ill judged war on the Iraqi people.
Palestinians who fled the terror of the Nakba on the creation of the
State of Israel and went to Iraq were, when I was there, fleeing into
Syria because of the actions of the Iraqi Government, and are now
fleeing Syria because of the civil war in that country; that means four
displacements in 40 years for those people, and there is estimated to
be up to 500,000 of them. It is worth noting, too, that President
Assad’s Government gave the Palestinians a lot of help in the
refugee camps; they had housing, right to work and healthcare and
education. They did not want citizenship, only the right to go home to
Palestine.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000065">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:29:35"></hs_TimeCode>
people who have now fled Syria cannot be officially helped by the UNHCR
because they are not refugees unless they are fleeing their own
country. So it falls back to UNRWA, created to help the Palestinians
after the State of Israel was created, which in those days was catering
for 750,000 people, to cater now for 5 million Palestinian refugees,
still in camps all over the Middle East. As we face the problem of

have a dream, my Lords. I have a dream of what a wonderful force for
good Israel could have been, and I think still could be, if only it

to Jordan, as was mentioned earlier. Israel could be part of the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, in concluding this debate, I
should like to begin my contribution to it by thanking my noble friend
Lord Roberts of Llandudno for tabling the Motion, which gives us the
opportunity to talk about this very serious issue. He graphically
described the catastrophe that has overtaken the people of Syria and
the consequential problems for the people not only of that country but
of neighbouring countries. The Government share many of the deep
concerns expressed by noble Lords today; if there are disagreements
between us, they will be about how we best handle the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000080">Conflicts
of this magnitude, with such a severe impact on civilian populations,
require a commensurate response from the international community. The
Government are proud of the fact that the UK is playing its full part
in that response. The UK has 
<?notus-xml column=1675?>pledged £500 million for the Syrian relief effort, of which more
than £470 million has already been allocated to partners both
inside Syria and in neighbouring countries. This represents the United
Kingdom’s largest ever response to a humanitarian crisis. It is
also the second-largest bilateral contribution by any country behind
that of the United States—until very recently, we had given more
money than the rest of the European Union put
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000081">By
providing aid in this way, we believe that we can help far more people
than we could by resettling what could be only a token number. I think
that all noble Lords will agree that the numbers that have been
mentioned today are tokens compared with the massive figure of 2.3
million people who have already left that
land.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000082">We are
proud of the UK’s record of offering protection to those
genuinely in need. In the EU, the UK is the third-largest recipient of
asylum seekers from Syria, behind Germany and Sweden. As the Deputy
Prime Minister said earlier this week, in the year up to September 2013
the UK had received more than 1,500 asylum applications from Syrians.
Over the same period, more than 1,100 were granted refugee status. We
also operate an immigration concession for Syrian nationals who are
already legally present in the UK, designed to make it easier for them
to extend their stay or switch immigration

response to the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, in some cases
reiterated by other noble Lords, 30,000-plus Syrians have sought refuge
in the EU so far, not the 12,000 he quoted. We recognise that Bulgaria
is under considerable pressure. We are supporting efforts by the
European Asylum Support Office to build capability in Bulgaria. UK aid
is providing immediate practical help to Syrians in the region. Family
members of Syrian refugees in the UK are eligible for family reunion
under Immigration Rules and 90% of Syrian asylum claims are granted. We
recognise the scale of this process and we respect the views and values
which want to resettle Syrians, but our own view is that aid in the
region will help more. I think I have made that clear in my response so
far.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000084">The
Government have discussed with EU partners on a number of occasions,
both in Brussels and bilaterally, the best way to respond to those
fleeing Syria. I emphasise to the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, that these
are active negotiations. We have also spoken to the United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees and other partners in the UK. We are very
aware that some, including the UNHCR, would like to see a more
proactive programme of resettlement of refugees currently hosted by
countries neighbouring Syria. We have considered these options very
carefully and respect the views of those countries who favour a
resettlement programme, but we maintain that our top priority and that
of the EU should continue to be to provide humanitarian assistance to
displaced people in the region, in partnership with neighbouring
countries, UNHCR and other UN and non-governmental
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010946000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010946000085">Beyond
immediate humanitarian assistance, our priority must be to help

With more than 2 million people, as we know, now having been

rights of the vast majority of displaced persons can be safeguarded.
Accordingly this should be our focus, rather than resettlement or
providing “humanitarian admission” to displaced Syrians,

I shall scrutinise each of those matters in turn. The concept of
“spending power” of local authorities is an interesting,
new, complex and extremely controversial way of defining spending. It
includes a number of different sources of local funding—25 in
total, the biggest being council tax and settlement funding. However,
it also includes the highly contentious new homes bonus, to which I am
sure colleagues will refer later. It also includes the relatively small
amount of funding to lead local flood authorities. Members may be
interested to know that funding for those authorities will decline by
one-third next year. Perhaps in view of the recent weather, the
Government might wish to reconsider
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

2.9% is achieved by an interesting device of excluding the GLA. It may
no longer be considered a local authority, but perhaps it still is. If
you include the GLA, the figure increases to 3.1%. However, this time,
when defining the spending, the Government have included pooled health
budgets, which are the responsibility not of local authorities on their
own but of local health partners. Those budgets are of course also
included in the Department of Health’s figures, so there is some
double counting there. If those figures were excluded, then the cut
would increase to 5%. CIPFA, the respected local government finance

away—have gone. We are now into serious cuts in spending. My own
local authority had to take off £66 million, will have done so
by the end of this financial year, and faces a further £43
million in cuts over the next three years. Cuts at this level cannot be
achieved by slicing and cutting; we are actually going to have to make
significant savings in real

system of local taxation. I think that I can see an established pattern
in how local taxes change. Stage 1 is that a local tax becomes
unpopular for some reason, probably fuelled by a media campaign. Stage
2 is when the Government respond by trying to mitigate the effects of
the tax through a subsidy—they put in money to try to reduce its
impact. On the whole, that does not work, so we get to stage 3, where
the unpopularity continues. The Government therefore then move to stage
4: they abolish that form of local taxation and try to replace it with
something else. We saw that some time ago with the rates, and in place
of the rates we got the poll tax. However, that did not last too long

that our current major forms of local funding—that is, the
council tax and business rates—are both now at stage 2 of the

make them justifiable. The council tax—and I make no apologies
for repeating my point—is still based on 1991 values. It is
difficult to understand that when it applies to a house built last

suddenly the Government rightly recognised that the valuation of
business rates was not regarded by the business community as fair, so
the Chancellor came up with a wheeze in the autumn Statement to reduce
the impact of business rates. Therefore, we will again have a local tax

the past 47 years I have been a councillor for a ward that is among the
10 most deprived wards in the country. Its spiritual needs are in part
met by the daughter of the right reverend Prelate, who is the vicar of
St James’s church in that ward. Life expectancy is 10 years less
in that ward than in the ward in which I live. The unemployment
percentage is in double figures. Most of our primary school children in
the ward are entitled to free school meals and the schools operate a
breakfast club. We have one food bank in the ward and another within a
quarter of a mile of it. Hundreds of residents have been hit by the
bedroom tax and the changes to council tax support, which can take just
under £4 a week from people on JSA of only £71 a week but
also affect many people on low wages. Rent and council tax arrears are
mounting and evictions may follow, although the council is doing all it
can to help avoid them. Non-statutory youth provision is being cut,
play centres are closing and another voluntary centre is under threat.
The future of our successful Sure Start centre may be in doubt after
2015. Maintenance of open spaces is under severe pressure. The

make much of spending power, carefully ignoring that this does not
include a range of specific grants, many of which have been mentioned,

of the north-south divide. The pernicious impact of this persistent

over the next three years, with a huge impact on the distribution of
grant, by definition hitting hardest those areas with higher numbers of
lower-banded properties. Newcastle, for example, has 57% in band
A—the lowest band. Windsor has just 3%. We should remember that

matter for judicial review, because equality obligations appear to have

for introducing what I think has become an annual debate in his usual
and characteristically reasonable way, in spite of all the provocation
that I am sure he feels has been offered to him. I also apologise that
I missed the first minute of his speech. My train was cancelled due to
a landslip in Surrey, which I suspect at this time is not feeling
overgenerously resourced by central government. However, I think I got

agree with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000030">I
also have to start by declaring my own interest on this occasion, for
the last time in this annual debate, as a councillor in the London
Borough of Sutton, and, for the first time in this annual debate, as a
vice-president of the LGA. Perhaps this is the point too for me to
welcome the Minister to her first outing in this annual debate. I am
pleased to see her predecessor, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, also
present today, probably relishing the fact that she can sit two Benches
back and enjoy the debate in a way that has maybe not been possible in

years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000031">Throughout
my 40 years as a councillor—and I recognise that the noble Lord,
Lord Beecham, regards me as a wimp for giving up after only 40 years,
but that will be the case—this has been an annual ritual.
Central government, of whichever party is in power, has always said how
fair and generous the annual settlement has been, and local government,
whoever has the majority there, has always said that it is not fair,
not generous and that it means the end of the world as we know it.
Then, sadly, local government sets about arguing among itself as to
which parts of the country or which types of authority are more or less
fairly dealt with. I very much regret
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000032">One
thing that has changed over those 40 years, to which reference has
already been made, is the date of the announcement of the settlement.
It used to be certainly in early November, it slipped a bit to December
and for the last two years it has been, in effect, Christmas Eve. I
understand that that timetable is not 
<?notus-xml column=1688?>entirely in the hands of the DCLG—of course it is not—but
I think we would all wish to say, through the DCLG, “Please try
to bring this timetable forward”. It makes life extremely
difficult for all local government, and most especially for the finance
staff trying to deal with this in very short time, however expected the
settlement may
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000033">In my
first year as a councillor, way back, the Tory leader in local
government, who happened also to be a Sutton councillor, told me that
there were really only two parties. I thought that was the usual
political comment being made to a Liberal in those days, but he said it
was the central government party and the local government party. I have
to say that I have increasingly come to recognise how right he was. If
I ever have any doubts about it, that is characterised in your
Lordships’ debates on local government. Most of us who take part
in these debates, for whatever party, have a long background in local
government, and inevitably speak in a sense on behalf of the local
government party. All too often the poor unfortunate Minister who has
to reply, who may indeed belong to the local government party too, has
to deal with that. That will go

be going too far to say that there is good news in this settlement;
that is too much to expect given the state of the national economy, the
reasons for which we have rehearsed many times. However, there are
certainly aspects that even the LGA has been right to welcome, and I am
pleased that it has done so. The first is that it is no worse than
originally expected. It is a sign of the times that that can be seen as
good news. However, it is good news and is a welcome sign that central
government has recognised that local government has borne the brunt of
the public sector spending cuts, that it is not just the annual ritual

grim.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000035">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:30:22"></hs_TimeCode>

the new homes bonus is going to the London LEP and not to the London

about this, and that the Minister will not be able to give a definitive
answer today. However, I hope she can at least confirm that it is being

this relatively good news—I stress
“relatively”—it is clear that the financial year
2015-16 will be the crunch year for probably most local authorities. As
other speakers have said, so far, most have been able to make
significant cuts in ways that have not too seriously affected most
residents who are not in receipt of direct support. That may well be
one reason why 
<?notus-xml column=1689?>public satisfaction with local councils has indeed gone up in the past
two years rather than down. We experienced exactly the same phenomenon
in the 1990s, when budget cuts were being made, albeit they were not as
serious as the current ones. However, the cuts required for 2015-16 are
of such magnitude that the public generally will be affected and will
notice. Decisions on those cuts will have to be made in the coming
financial year before the May 2015 general election. That is obviously
bad news for the government parties, as it will come just when we are
trying to convince the voting public that the corner has been turned,
that austerity was worth it and that economic recovery is on the way,

am pleased to see that no one on the Benches opposite is smiling at
that. It is not good news for any party. Wise Labour politicians will
know that local residents blame their local council for the decisions
that are made, the demonstrations take place outside the town halls and
that in many parts of the country Labour councils and Labour
councillors have to make those decisions, so it is bad news for
everyone. I think that it is bad news for all of us who believe in the
democratic process. We all know what the threat may be to the healthy
democratic process, so the threat is there and is obvious and is
getting very close to us. However, I also believe that it is a great
opportunity. We are now in the situation where both the level of
central government funding is such and the state of play is such that
it really is time to introduce the fundamental and radical change to
which the noble Lord Smith referred towards the end of his speech, and
I would like to have had more time to deal with that.</hs_para>

significant consensus moves right across the political parties with the

government more independence, more financial freedom, less opportunity
to blame central government and less dependence on central government.
The questions now are the following. How are we going to do it? When

government—in that I include the Labour Party as part of the
wider central government role—actually come clean and say that
they agree and say how it will be achieved, and what is the timetable

Lord Smith of Leigh, on introducing what is now his annual new year

struck me that we could all make the same speeches that we made this
time last year and comment on the discourtesy of government in making
the financial settlement for 
<?notus-xml column=1690?>local government so late in the day for planning purposes, the unfair
distribution and the end of local government as we know it. However, I

I listened to the interesting debate introduced by the noble Lord, Lord
Shipley, in December on reviewing the Barnett formula. I remember
thinking, “Good luck with that”, because the formula for
distribution is only one element of our challenge. Centralisation by
successive Governments—I agree with what the noble Lord, Lord
Tope, has just said in that regard—is a much bigger challenge,
and it is hard to take when it is carried out in the name of local
government autonomy. Time and again we see evidence that one of the key
engines for growth in an economy is strong regional government with
real powers. If the Government are in doubt about this, why not try an
experiment and give one of our cities the independence they had 130
years ago? Call it the Birmingham Independence Bill or, given the
number of speakers from the north-east, the Newcastle Independence
Bill. I am not talking of elected mayors, which I think are an
abomination, concentrating on style over substance, but of real power
for regions or cities. This is about not just the survival of local
government but the future health of our economy. There is a human cost
to what is going on. Half a million local government jobs have

disappearing every day. These people had a commitment to public service
and cared about what they were doing. There is real and sustained
damage to services which are vital to maintaining the social fabric and
supporting community cohesion. The public are being misled about claims
of a fair settlement for local government and that efficiency savings
can make up the difference. Does the Minister really believe that a

speak on this but, as we know, the Better Care Fund is a
pooled budget for health and social care services shared between the
NHS and local authorities to deliver better outcomes and greater
efficiencies through more integrated services for older and
disabled people. No one would disagree that pooled funding should be an
enduring part of the framework for the health and social care system
beyond 2015-16, which was a commitment in the Autumn Statement in
December. However, according to the LGA, the fund simply brings
together local government and NHS resources that are already committed
to existing activity—it does not address the financial
challenges facing councils and clinical commissioning groups. Indeed,
the LGA has accused the Government of double
counting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000045">Underfunding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:47:01"></hs_TimeCode>

trick by this Government—perhaps even bigger than the spare
bedroom tax. My fear is that it will not lead to a peasants’
revolt—which the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, has called for in
relation to local government regeneration—but will be
represented by thousands of sad stories of single old people living out
their lives in cold and misery and the disabled being stuck in their

do not know the Local Government Minister—he was born the year I
was elected to a local authority, in 1971—so I looked him up on
Wikipedia. To my surprise I saw that, during his time as leader of
Brentwood Borough Council, he co-hosted a radio show with local MP Eric
Pickles, called “The Eric and Brandon Show”. I do not
know whether perhaps they were the Laurel and Hardy of Brentwood,
although that is hard to imagine. The Secretary of State of course
relishes his appearance and caricature as the jolly fat man who
“waters the workers’ beer”, to quote an old song,
although jollity is not something I would normally associate with him.
The fact that the two of them had a radio show indicates that at least
there is some diversity as far as newly appointed Conservative
Ministers go. However, the suggestion that this settlement goes in any
way to support local firms was truly undermined by the noble Lord, Lord
True, who pointed out that central government refuses to relinquish any
control over the sort of planning matters that are so important at
local level. That surely demolishes that particular argument. It was
also said that the settlement will get people into work but, of course,
as my noble friend Lady Donaghy has just said, hundreds of thousands of
people have lost their jobs in local government since the coalition was
appointed. A succession of such settlements will guarantee that the
number of people in local government out of work will continue to
rise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000049">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:47:01"></hs_TimeCode>

Under the leadership of the current leader of the council, Councillor
Darren Cooper, it has continued the eminently sensible policies for
which it is renowned. Yet it is being punished—I can find no
other word to describe it—by the sort of settlement we are

perhaps something of a surprising note: the impact that this
Government’s attitude to local governance has on Conservative
representation around the West Midlands. In my own borough of Sandwell,
there are 72 councillors. It has been predominantly Labour since it was
created in the Heath—at the time, I called it the
Heath-Robinson—reorganisation of local government back in 1974.
But the Conservative Party controlled the council for a year or so in
the 1970s. Out of 72 councillors on Sandwell Council, there are now
only two Conservatives left. I hope the Minister will take this in the
spirit that it is intended, as although I have no great wish to promote
the interests of Conservative councillors—I have worked with
some extremely good ones over the years; I have worked with one or two
I would not describe in quite the same way—they are a dying
breed outside London and the south. Again, when I was a councillor,
Manchester City Council was controlled by the Conservative Party. There
are now no Conservative councillors on the city council at all. In all
seriousness, the sort of parsimony we are discussing in the settlements
that have taken place over the past few years under the
coalition—particularly this one and perhaps the one next
year—will further decimate the Conservative Party’s local
government base. I support this particular aspect of this: it certainly

Welfare Reform Act 2012, key elements of the discretionary Social
Fund—crisis loans and community care grants—were
abolished and replaced by funding to local authorities, with the
intention that they establish their own local welfare assistance
schemes. The £178 million allocated for 2013-14 was a cut of
46%, but local welfare assistance has in the past year

be substantial extra pressure on that group of people who fall into
crisis circumstances, who are the prey of loan sharks. Loans are
already a casualty of the present system. Reasonable interest rates on
loans are simply not available for those in most need in most areas.
Much as I applaud the work of credit unions and the substantial
cross-party support for them, they are in no position to help in these
crisis cases. The alternative is the payday lenders, leading to an ever
increasing spiral of debt. The removal of all funding can only make
that worse. Can the Minister tell us what guidance she will give to
local authorities for the continued provision of safety-net schemes

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I will try to note that. I, too,
thank my noble friend Lord Smith of Leigh for securing this debate and
for his forensic 
<?notus-xml column=1696?>analysis of the balance of the settlement. I declare my interest as a
vice-president of the LGA. Although, like others, I have a feeling of
déjà vu, I think that I actually participate in this
debate only every couple of years. Nevertheless, the Government have
shown, on the basis of the figures for this year and next, that local
government will continue to take a hugely disproportionate share of the
cuts in public expenditure—slightly disguised, as my noble
friend Lady Donaghy said, by the treatment of health and social care
provisions, but the figures are still clear. Within that, the
distribution is also extremely regressive. It moves money from cities
to shires and, within those groups, for example in London, which
authorities face the biggest cuts over the next two years? It is Tower
Hamlets, Hackney and Newham. Even within the shires, my own county of
Dorset, which has fairly deprived rural areas in many respects, has a
50% higher cut than that of the county of Surrey.</hs_para>

provided to us through the Library shows, there is effectively a direct
correlation in the wrong direction between the level of cut and the
level of deprivation, authority by authority. This is not a happy
picture and, while we are all sometimes lost in admiration for how
councils of all political persuasions try to cope with these cuts in
their own areas, we have to face up to the fact that was well set out
by the right reverend Prelate just now: the social effects of some of
these cuts are dire indeed.</hs_para>

face—this is a message for all Front Benches, and all
Governments and potential Governments—is that underlying all
this is the terrible centralisation of local government funding in this
country, which the noble Lord, Lord Tope, underlined. Even by the
1970s, we had the most centralised system of funding in Europe. Since
the 1970s, successive Governments have tightened central control of
local authority funding. It is also historically the highest level of
centralisation for some of our great cities and shire counties, which
were much freer in the 19th century and the early part of the previous
century. Some of the great achievements of local authorities reflected
that freedom. Local authorities are heavily dependent on the government
grant. They are not allowed to raise specific taxes in their areas. The
taxes they can raise, as council tax, have been capped or frozen. They
have virtually no flexibility on the business tax and severe
limitations on their ability to borrow, even from the public sector
loan board. They have almost no ability nowadays, compared with earlier
centuries, to go to the market to raise money.</hs_para>

know that my particular interest is housing. It has become clear to all
parties and interests within the housing sector—all forms of
tenure and everybody from developers through to tenants—that
there is a very serious crisis in housing in this country. There is a
role for local authorities both as leaders and providers in this area,
yet the rules that govern their ability to do anything serious about
housing effectively stymie their ability to play a key role in this
area. The interventions by the Government, who started by cutting
social housing funding, including their positive intervention in
relation to the new homes bonus, have been shown by the Select
Committee in another place to be pretty ineffective. Their latest Help
to Buy scheme 
<?notus-xml column=1697?>has certainly helped a number of first-time buyers but, without
effective action on the supply side, all it will do is raise the price
of housing, and thereby rents, in the private and public
sectors.</hs_para>

authorities cannot go to the markets to raise money for housing is
nonsense. That is the major bar to local authorities or ALMOs being
able to build more houses. It all reflects the definition of the public
sector borrowing requirement or the public sector net debt that is
adopted by the Treasury and imposed on local authorities in this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000067">It is
a different definition from the one that applies in Europe, and it has
different consequences from the situation in North America. When the
Government report to international bodies such as the IMF and the EU on
the national borrowing requirement, that excludes the kind of borrowing
that is allowed by the public sector borrowing requirement in other
European countries.</hs_para>

is not an act of nature; it is a positive decision by successive
Treasury officials, and one that makes a nonsense of the ability of
local authorities to do anything about the housing crisis that is
facing them in most areas, either on an immediate basis or on a
long-term strategic one. We know, and this has been reiterated by all
parties, that we need to double the level of the new supply of housing.
This is an inhibition on the public sector acting directly. I am not
just talking about the ability to build traditional council housing; I
am talking about the ability of local authorities to engage in joint
ventures with housing associations and to support developers in the
private sector in building houses. If all this is barred to local
authorities, there is no hope of resolving the housing crisis that
faces us.</hs_para>

ask the Government—I also direct this to my own Front Bench in
terms of what an alternative Government would do—at the very
least to review how this definition of the public sector net debt is
impacting on the ability of local authorities to do their job in one
very important area, one that is vital to the future health not only of
our society but of our economy, since housing could provide a much
needed local and national boost to economic activity. Could the
Government at least commit themselves to a review? The current
situation is a nonsense. It is part of the general centralisation of
financing within this country but it could specifically be dealt with
pretty easily, in immediate and bureaucratic terms, with the stroke of
a pen. I hope that the Government, and indeed other parties, can commit
themselves to such a

Pitkeathley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Smith for securing this debate. I confess that I am not one of the
usual suspects taking part in this annual event, nor am I an expert in
local government funding, and I would not dream of engaging on the
detailed consideration cited by many other noble Lords who have
expertise. However, I have some expertise in what cuts or inadequacies
in local government funding mean to consumers, especially to caring
families and to the voluntary sector. It is on this that we should
focus in the difficulties that we are facing, and in each case it is
evident to anyone engaged in these sectors 
<?notus-xml column=1698?>that not supporting caring families and not supporting the voluntary
sector result not in the savings that we all know have to be made but,
rather, in increased expenditure. We have already heard from my noble
friend about the numbers of people staying in hospital because local
services were not available to enable them to be discharged.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010969000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000071">I want to illustrate
this with an example. Mandy is a woman in her 60s caring for her
severely physically and mentally disabled son, who is 32—she has
been caring for him since he was born—and her mother, who had a
stroke three years ago. Mandy’s husband left her some years ago
and she is the sole carer. She dearly loves both George, her son, and
Vera, her mother, and happily accepts her role as carer, even though it
is very stressful. What has enabled her to cope and to manage to keep
going is that George goes into residential care one weekend a month and
her mother attends a day centre run by the Stroke Association twice a
week. She was told in November that George will now be eligible for
respite care only for two weekends a year instead of every month, and
the day centre has no funding beyond the end of March this
year.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010969000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000072">Mandy
herself is a diabetic. The stress associated with losing most of the
very minimal support that she has been enjoying, if that is the word,
means that her blood sugar levels have gone up to a dangerous level and
it looks as though she herself will have to be admitted to hospital. If
this happens, both Vera and George will need residential care. So the
withdrawal of a small amount of care will result in more expenditure
for the
state.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000073">This is
the reality of what cuts to local authority budgets mean: cuts to
direct services to families and to the voluntary sector. Many of the
services provided by the charitable sector are in the area of
preventive work, and we have heard from many noble Lords how important
that is in stopping situations developing or getting worse—the
day centre for the stroke patient, the drop-in centre for someone with
mental illness and family support for those coping with addiction. Many
local authorities hardly engage in this work at all nowadays, since
eligibility criteria have become so much stricter, so they have to rely
on charities. Of course the charitable sector must play its part and
take its share of financial cuts, but it would be not only unjust but
counterproductive to make it take more than its fair share. Where a
local authority has control of only 5% of its budget, the rest being
set out in statute, and that 5% is whence comes the funding for the
charitable sector, the budget may be drastically cut simply because it
can be when other budgets cannot. We see this happening everywhere.
Will the Minister tell the House what guidance is being given to local
authorities in this regard because so many initiatives that make up the
so-called big society are dependent on precisely this funding, which is
now at risk?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010969000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000074">I also want to say a
word about morale. The services which support families are dependent on
the dedication and commitment of hundreds of thousands of local
authority and voluntary sector workers. Since the rewards and
conditions are not great, their job satisfaction is an important factor
in keeping them dedicated and 
<?notus-xml column=1699?>committed. This is hard when you are constantly being told that your
working conditions are only going to get harder as yet more resources
are cut, and that the public sector must bear the brunt of future cuts,
as we have just heard from the Chancellor. In addition, if your morale
and the morale of your service are low, you are inevitably less
inclined to embrace change and new ways of working, which are essential
when making the best of scarce resources. You are inclined to retreat
into your silo for safety. Nowhere is this more important than when
considering integrated services across health and social care and the
voluntary sector, which are so essential from the point of view of the
patient, the user and the carer. Again it is counterproductive not to
invest in staff support of all kinds to ensure that these dedicated
people, on whom many rely, do not become entrenched in the so-called
silo mentality.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010969000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000075">Labour’s Total
Place programme was a fine example of the benefits of integrated care.
This Government’s Whole Place scheme is more limited in scope,
but the potential is there. Pilot projects focused on health and social
care and families with complex needs in high-cost areas show how
services can be combined and transformed to produce significant savings
and improve outcomes. For example, Greater Manchester estimates from
pilot work that it could achieve £270 million net savings over
five years, while Essex forecasts that savings of £414 million
could be made over six years. Does the Minister agree that if we want
to break down the barriers to integrated working, the morale of workers
is of the utmost significance? Will she tell the House how the
Government intend to maintain it in the face of constant threats to the
public and voluntary sector as a result of pressure on the budgets of
local authorities?</hs_para>

Shipley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Smith of Leigh, for initiating this debate, and I declare my
vice-presidency of the Local Government Association. So far in this
debate the Labour Party’s approach has been avoiding two
critical issues. The first is the level of government debt because
although the economy is improving, we still have major fiscal problems.
This year’s deficit is forecast to be £111 billion, which
is very high by any past comparator year. Over the next four years,
there will continue to be high annual deficits adding more than
£300 billion to our national debt. Four years from now the
national debt could be £1.5 trillion, double what it was in 2010
when it stood at £760
billion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000077">That
level of rising debt is unsustainable and has to be reduced. The
Government have protected some public services from cuts. They have
ring-fenced the National Health Service, schools, overseas aid and
pensions. Because of that, it is inevitable that other budget heads
will have to take a bigger cut if debt is to be contained—unless
the Labour Party thinks that the ring-fence around the National Health
Service, schools, overseas aid and pensions should be removed. In
summing up, the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, might tell us what
the Labour Party’s position on that is. For local government,
things are difficult. This is not a surprise since local government
accounts for a quarter of public spending.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1700?><hs_para UID="14010969000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000078">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:16:03"></hs_TimeCode>
second concern about the way in which the Labour Party is approaching
this debate is that it talks mostly about cuts in government revenue
support to councils and the distribution of those cuts when total
government spending in an area needs to be added in, since health and
schools are ring-fenced. The Labour Party also assumes that the level
and distribution of revenue support was correct in 2010 when this
Government took over. Large cuts would have come under Labour anyway,
not least in working neighbourhoods funding directed at the more
deprived areas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:16:44"></hs_TimeCode>.
That is the context in which this debate is being held.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010969000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000079">However, there is no
doubt that the cuts have been steeper in the more deprived parts of the
country. The Government try to justify it by talking about spending
power which, as we know, includes more than just revenue grant because
it includes council tax, charges and fees, and NHS funding for social
care. Ministers have rightly pointed out that poorer areas still get
much higher levels of support than richer areas. This then begs the
question as to what the differentials should be, and here things are
much hazier. Running complex formulae in DCLG simply gives us sets of
numbers with absolutely no certainty that their basis is
robust.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000080">The
settlement consultation documentation says that the most deprived areas
in single-tier authorities will have 50% higher spending power per
dwelling than the least deprived areas and that, to deliver this
spending power, central government support will be three times higher
per dwelling in the most deprived areas. The trouble is that it is not
clear that these figures are the appropriate ones. Why are they as they
are? Can they be justified in detail?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010969000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000081">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>
me take as an example our big cities which are in many ways very
similar. Leeds in 2014-15will have spending power per dwelling of
£1,851, but Birmingham will have much higher spending power per
dwelling at £2,587. Newcastle will have £2,407;
Sheffield, £2,125; Liverpool, £2,492; Manchester,
£2,428; Nottingham, £2,371; and Bristol, £2,152.
Can the Minister explain the basis for these differences in spending
power per dwelling across our big cities, from £1,851 in Leeds
to £2,587 in
Birmingham?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000082">Of
course, that point is more generally applicable because similar
differences arise all over the country. The problem of defining a fair
distribution of grant is compounded by the decisions councils
themselves take on council tax levels, which can vary considerably
between councils, both at Band D and as an average payment from each
household. That problem is compounded even further by sums allocated to
an area but not via the council. Schools budgets and the pupil premium
is a good example; DWP spending is
another.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000083">This
is why we need to know how much the Government are actually spending in
an area in terms of total public expenditure, and I hope that the
Minister might look at how this might be done. Unless we know this
across Whitehall, we shall continue to have uncertainties about how
much is actually being spent, and some in local government will
continue to talk only about cuts to council budgets when actually it is

<?notus-xml column=1701?>the total amount of public spending in an area that matters because it
is all that funding that delivers local
services.</hs_para>

issues and the current consultation. First, it has been reported that
42 councils plan council tax rises rather than another year of freezing
it, and that more than half of those are Conservative-led. They should
not be criticised. Localism should mean that it is their business.
Freezing council tax with a central grant making up the loss placed
into a council’s baseline for future years is fine as a
temporary measure, but I have been uncomfortable, for some time, with
the view that it needs to be frozen for five years or longer. The
reason is that that increases local government dependency on central
Government at exactly the time we should be empowering
councils—with their electorates, if it is felt that a referendum
is justified—to make the right decisions for their local area.
That is localism, and we will never solve the overcentralisation of
England unless we get councils to raise more of their revenue locally.
Many, of course, have been doing that, and many will do so next
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000085">Secondly,
on the specifics of the consultation, I come to the £120 million
safety net holdback proposed for 2014-15. I doubt that it is necessary
and I would distribute it unless consultation clearly demonstrates
otherwise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000086">Thirdly,
it is unclear whether this funding settlement as proposed will enable
all councils to deliver their statutory obligations. Councils have to
help in this process as part of the consultation by demonstrating
exactly where they may fail to meet them. Councils also have to help by
pressing for single funding pots for local authority spending, health,
and for expenditure by the DWP. Savings are to be made in that area by
reducing duplication. I entirely agree that we need to create a
place-based system of finance in England, and local government has to
lead it. That could be based on the governance that is developing
locally: combined authorities, health and well-being boards, joint
committees, local enterprise partnerships, and so
on<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:22:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000087">Our
current model for financing and running local government is not fit for
purpose. The Local Government Association has proposed five-year
funding settlements, wider revenue-raising powers and the wider
involvement of local government establishing how grant is to be
distributed. I concur with its position, but we are now in great danger
of seeing some local authority services sinking to levels that are
unacceptable for a civilised country. I hope very much that the
Government will take on board the financial problems that many councils

importance of local government, as many other noble Lords have
commented, is that it has a very large and direct effect on
people’s lives—on their health, jobs, education, leisure,
environment—and particularly on poorer areas and communities,
which may not benefit to a disproportionate extent. However, 
<?notus-xml column=1702?>they are not necessarily the people who are most reflected by opinion
surveys. Therefore, the notion that because opinion surveys show that
things are getting better might not, for the population as a whole,
reflect the key activities of councils. Nevertheless, over the past 20
years everyone has seen a remarkable improvement and a rise in morale
in many of the most depressed communities—or in some of the ones
I have seen. Increased funding was very much central to that process,
so I am not ashamed of the fact that the Labour Government spent
considerable quantities of money, as one saw great advantages come from
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:24:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000090">It
is also important to realise that local government’s activities
are associated not just with spending money, but often with great
creativity and with making improvements requiring imagination, as I
learnt myself when I was a city councillor introducing
pedestrianisation, which cost very little indeed. I was recently
canvassing in Stoke—a very important city—where the slag
heaps have been turned into green hills and an international cycling
arena. However, as the noble Lord, Lord True, and others have
commented, there are many rigidities in our local government compared
to that of other countries. I put down a Parliamentary Question on the
issue that many schools are still unable to use public parks, nor are
school playing fields allowed to be used as public parks, as they are
in the United States. It is quite extraordinary. I battled on that
issue as a councillor years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:25:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000091">As
the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, has just commented, when the facilities
and services provided by local government are insufficient to maintain
communities—this is not just a zero-cost effect—there
will be other costs, perhaps to health, and perhaps to security and
policing. There are areas in cities where we have seen the role of
focused funding, in Sure Start centres, youth clubs and social health
programmes, which have proved to be very effective for deprived
families; those are areas which may be cut in the likely financial
outturn. Of course, in richer towns there is a differential expenditure
according to whether local people sue them. In a certain rather
well-to-do city, which I shall not name, it was well known that
pavements in certain areas were always very well maintained, because,
if they were not, people would sue the council. So there is another way
in which people can have a
comeback<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:26:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000092">No
mention has been made in the debate of the role of the Audit
Commission. When I was a councillor—and as a Member of the House
of Lords—I saw reports from the Audit Commission about new
ideas, progress and problems in local government. I cannot see that the
demise of the Audit Commission has led to the creation of an equivalent
substitute. All that we see in the Government’s documentation is
that they have produced a leaflet of 50 ways in which to save money,
which is not quite the same
thing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000093">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:27:11"></hs_TimeCode>
Government’s encouragement to local authorities to stimulate new
business and housing is, of course, welcome. As a former councillor and
a director of a high-tech company in Cambridge, I saw at first hand how
councillors working with all local organisations could be very
effective in bringing in innovative business—although they could
also be very effective in stopping local business—but it had to
be done properly. One 
<?notus-xml column=1703?>difficulty in the past three years is that one way in which local
government was working with business was through the regional
development agencies, which were clobbered when the present Government
came to power, although they have now been effectively reinstated under
some new

other important feature, as other noble Lords have said, is that no
company is going to invest in an area unless there are not only good
pavements but high standards of health, environment and education. The
Trading Standards Institute, in producing information for this debate,
was very concerned about the loss of funding for its
inspectors—and the same applies for public health inspectors. To
give noble Lords a bit of history at this point, when I became a
councillor in Cambridge I met the chief public health inspector, Mr
Edwards, who said that Cambridge was a very dodgy place. When he first
arrived in Cambridge, which I suppose was in the 1960s, he checked on
all the taps in all the famous colleges. Of course, Prince William is
going to one of these Cambridge colleges, and I hope that someone has
checked the taps—because when Mr Edwards did so, he found that a
certain college had very dodgy water. He said that that was probably
why Prince Albert died three weeks after visiting a certain college in
Cambridge. Those inspectors have a very important
role<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:28:57"></hs_TimeCode>. The

actions by people and businesses, which local government inspectors can

recently, we see another role for local government, working with
government agencies in dealing with the issues of floods and the
coastline. How can we have businesses moving into these areas if there
is uncertainty about whether they will be prevented from flooding, as
the noble Lord, Lord Smith, said? There seems to be some real question
as to whether there will be ongoing funding for this process and these
events look as if they may become more serious and
frequent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:29:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000096">Even
the most middle-class people, whose pavements are nice and smooth and
who live near parks, still have to breathe the same air as those in
poorer areas of the cities. There are very considerable developments in
that regard; the average air quality in UK cities, as Defra has pointed
out, is now worse than the EU recommended standards, and even worse in
poorer areas, with high traffic
concentrations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:30:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
The funding for air quality monitoring, forecasting and traffic
management is apparently to be cut back. If there are a large number of
unhealthy people as a result, that may involve a cost to the NHS and
the community. That is just one example of where a cost-benefit
analysis would seem to be appropriate when investment decisions are

Liddle (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is with great pleasure that I
take part in this debate, which was excellently introduced by my noble
friend Lord Smith of Leigh. I 
<?notus-xml column=1704?>declare an interest as the newly elected county councillor for the
Wigton division in my home county of Cumbria, although it is not my
first experience of local government. I have not as long a record as my
noble friend Councillor Lord Beecham, but I was elected in 1971 as a
Labour councillor to the old County Borough of Oxford when I was 23.
Those were heady days for local government. Nowadays, the Conservatives
think of Keith Joseph as the trail-blazer for Thatcherism, but then he
was Secretary of State for Social Services and was encouraging us to
increase our social services budgets by 10% a year in real terms. Well,
it all had to come to an end, and it was my adolescent political hero
Tony Crosland who, in 1975, told us, “The party’s
over”. I am afraid that, in the late 1970s, that phrase applied
not just to the increase in local government spending—my own
party went pretty near the
brink.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000099">Indeed,
my second spell in local government was in the London Borough of
Lambeth in 1982, where I was fighting the lunacy of Ted Knight’s
illegal refusal to set a rate. I hope to God that we never have to live
with that kind of experience again. The contrast in local government
between today and the early 1980s could not be more striking, I think,
in two respects. First, the cuts now being demanded of local government
are massive and unprecedented. I think that I am right that, in 2010,
Cumbria’s total budget for capital and current together was
£720 million and there were £88 million of
cuts to be achieved by April 2014, but it will be necessary to achieve
another £88 million from within that £720 million by
2016-17. Of course, if George Osborne gets his way on requiring
£25 billion of further cuts over the following two years, it
will be a pretty gloomy
picture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000100">I say
to the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, that I do not think that many people
on our side of the House sincerely dispute that cuts had to be made in
2010, because of the impact of the global banking crisis on a very
exposed UK economy. If Labour had been elected, as Alistair Darling
made clear in the run-up to the general election, there would have been
deep cuts in public spending. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord True,
that there was fat that could be cut. The question is whether the
extent is now
reasonable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000101">My
second point is about local government’s response. Think of the
early 1980s and the contrast could not be starker. Local authorities,
including I think virtually all the Labour-controlled councils, have
behaved with realism and responsibility in this very difficult
situation. Many of them have planned and pioneered innovative ways of
delivering services at lower costs—I think of my old London
Borough of Lambeth where I was a councillor, which is now a model of
innovation in local government. That is a tremendous success for the
modern Labour Party. It would be nice if, for once, Eric Pickles could
at least acknowledge that local government has met this situation with
realism and responsibility. Of course I would not want to equate the
Minister in any way with the Secretary of State, who often lacks the
ability to reach out across the party divide in order to recognise the
tough decisions that local government has responsibly
taken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000102">There
is a very serious question about the sustainability of what is planned
for the future. I think that the Government should now be, as the noble
Lord, Lord 
<?notus-xml column=1705?>Smith, suggested, not only thinking about what would happen if local
authorities became insolvent, but carrying out a major study of whether
and how a sample of authorities will be able to sustain their present
pattern of statutory activities with the financial outlook that we
have.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010969000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000103">Already
in Cumbria, the Labour/Lib Dem administration is being forced to pare
back virtually all non-statutory services. Our budget consultation in
the coming year, for instance, assumes that the authority will withdraw
from providing free school transport for all post-16 schoolchildren. In
a sparsely populated county, it could have extremely negative
implications for equality of opportunity if children from poor homes
can no longer access the best A-level provision. Similarly, we are
proposing to withdraw all bus subsidies in Cumbria. Bus subsidies are
the lifeblood of communication in communities made up of small towns
and ex-mining and agricultural villages.</hs_para>

Wigton, I am facing a very tough battle with the leadership of my
council, with whom I get on very well, to rescue and repair the
swimming pool that has been closed. I know that if we can find the
money to repair that swimming pool the county will not be able to
sustain it over the future years—it will have to become a
community responsibility and the community will have to take charge of
running it and finding a way to finance its deficit. The big society
may sound a noble aspiration, but I have to say that from the present
Secretary of State all you feel is a vicious kick in the backside and a
lot of disingenuous information and
bluster.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000105">The
Government claim that the overall reduction in the spending power of
local authorities is only 2.9% next year and 1.7% the year after. Many
speakers in this debate have demonstrated how that is not so. Without
the NHS money, which is not free money, coming into local government
the reduction in central government support for local authorities is
going to be 15.9% over the next two years. That is a huge body blow.
Cumbria as a shire has done a bit better than the mets—our
reduction is only 8.5%—but, frankly, the Conservatives have
looked after their own in this local government settlement and I think
it is a bit of a disgrace.</hs_para>

savings. There is a trifling scarcity grant, but in fact the cost of
providing services in rural areas is very great. The Government need to
explain what they are doing with the grant for local welfare provision,
which many noble Lords have referred to, because this is a serious
problem. In Cumbria, for instance, we have one division in Workington
where life expectancy of people is 19 years less than in the most
prosperous division, next to Penrith, yet the Government are
withdrawing all support for us in dealing with the circumstances of
poor families.</hs_para>

efficiency savings could be made, but we really need from the
Government a rethink of their present approach. It is time that the
realism and responsibility that local government has shown in the past
three and a half years are matched by a similar attitude on the part of
the Secretary of
State.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_09_PT_1/DD2C17DD3E732FC5DDEE677717FD6DD81BB8614E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 January 2014">Thursday,

the Conservative local authorities were being denied revenue and it was
all going up to, for example, northern boroughs. So the type of debate

by the unedifying spectacle of the Minister in another place having to
be dragged to the Dispatch Box to answer an Urgent Question tabled by
the right honourable Hilary Benn. As we have heard, the settlement
covers the upcoming year 2014-15, with provisional grant figures for
the subsequent year, and it does not make for happy reading. Councils
will face significant further spending reductions up to 2016 and, as
others have said, if the Chancellor should have his way—although
we are trying to stop him having that—beyond. The challenge to

spin and misleading presentation than the technically sound explanation
that councils and the public would expect. In particular, comparing
such different councils as affluent Windsor and metropolitan Newcastle

point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:50:38"></hs_TimeCode>. Time does

contention—again dealt with by my noble friend—is the
presentation of the overall settlement in terms of spending power
rather than the settlement funding level. The former shows cuts of only
2.9% and 1.8% respectively for the two years, whereas the latter shows
cuts of 9.4% and 13.2%. These are staggering amounts. The former
includes significant tranches of NHS money to support social care,
which will go to social care authorities only. Pooled funding, as my
noble friend Lady Donaghy said, is to be welcomed, but the fund does
not address the financial challenges facing councils and clinical
commissioning groups in so far as it is bringing together resources
already committed to existing

settlement funding level is the local share of business rates and the
revenue support grant, the money available for statutory services. The
latter has been cut by 17% next year and by 41% over the two years. So
it is clear that the cuts expressed in terms of spending power
understate the impact of changes to government funding of council

need to consider not only the overall level of the settlement: its
distribution is also vital. We dispute the Government’s
assertion that it is fair. My noble friend has pinpointed this problem,
in particular, and has identified the technical arrangements that are
driving it. His analysis is right. A simplistic comparison of 
<?notus-xml column=1709?>total spending power per household is meaningless without an
understanding of the different spending pressures that councils face in
meeting statutory demands and their ability to raise revenue through

the settlement is that the spending power of the more deprived areas
has been reduced, while that of the wealthier areas is being protected.
This is an inevitable consequence of the cut to the resource
equalisation component of the revenue support grant, especially in an
environment where the RSG component overall will be a declining part of
the settlement funding assessment under the business rate retention
scheme. This unfairness can be depicted in a variety of ways but, given
the regional changes in spending power over the two years to March
2016, London authorities will lose 8.2%, the north-east
7.2%, the north-west 6.5%, the West Midlands 6.1%, Yorkshire

right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds in probing that

noble Lord, Lord Snape, and others refer to the fact that council tax
support funding is not transparently identified in the settlement, and
the fears that councils may be forced to reduce their support in line
with the reduction in their settlement funding assessment. The LGA
points out that council tax has already become more progressive and
that the cut in central government support, which could amount to
£1.1 billion, would make this worse. As for a council tax
freeze, is it not the case that an increasing number of councils,
including Tory councils, are struggling to hold the line because it is
difficult to balance the books? Unpalatable choices are inevitable,

is difficult to remain optimistic despite the historic resilience of
local government, and recognising the role that councils could play in
delivering jobs and growth. Councils have had to innovate and have
benefited from strong and imaginative leadership; we have heard from
some of those leaders today. However, this settlement 
<?notus-xml column=1710?>will test their resilience like never before. For the future—this
deals with the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley—they
deserve restoration of fairness in the distribution of resources. There
can be no going back to 2010; I agree with my noble friend Lord Liddle
on that. I agree with my noble friend Lord Whitty on the devolution of
powers over housing, and would say to him that there is an independent
commission that Ed Miliband has set up to look at the financing of
affordable housing and council housing. There should also be devolution
of powers over planning, jobs and skills. Above all, we want local

what we have done in terms of the changes we have made and
people’s reaction to them. It is worth reminding your Lordships
that, as regards the changes we have made to the way in which councils

council services has stayed the same or actually improved in 90% of
cases. That is a real credit to local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:00:30"></hs_TimeCode>. We
are making progress but in order to continue to do so it is vital that
we stick to the disciplined course that has been set. Like every part
of the public sector, councils have had to shoulder their fair share of
the responsibility to pay down the deficit and get the nation’s
finances back on a stable footing. The noble Lord, Lord Liddle,
acknowledged that the right honourable Alistair Darling, when
Chancellor, said in 2010 that cuts would be necessary if the Labour
Government were re-elected at that time. However, it is worth noting
that the Labour Opposition have opposed all of this Government’s
cuts to local government. My noble friend Lord Shipley was right to ask
what the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, would do if Labour were elected. I
noted that he did not provide us with much information on that in his
winding-up speech

the comment today has focused on reductions in central government
grant. However, concentrating on those grants misses the bigger
picture. It is far more accurate to look at the overall
spending power that councils have. Contrary to what has been said,
spending power is the best available measure of resources
available to councils. We have published the methodology and the data
in full on our website. Spending power includes the money the councils
raise through council tax, business rates and financial incentives. I
am sure noble Lords will welcome being reminded that local authorities
now retain 50% of those business rates, which is not something they
were able to do
previously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0002.htm#14010969000136">This
debate illustrates some stark contrasts between this
Government’s approach and philosophy and those of the
Opposition. The previous system made councils dependent on central
government for their income. Councils got more money by painting the
blackest possible picture of their area. Indeed, Andy Sawford, the
opposition spokesman in the other place, said only this week that the
Labour Party would return to this approach if it succeeded in winning
the general election next year. The Opposition talk about so-called
fair funding but what they do not say is which councils they would cut

public services which best support local residents. Our system means

Government have listened to local authorities about not topslicing the
new homes bonus, which was acknowledged by the noble Lord, Lord

of the other major points raised by noble Lords is that some parts of
the country are losing out compared to others. However, the settlement

district and county, city and shire. On average, councils will have
spending power worth £2,089 per household. The average spending
power reduction is just 2.9% in 2014-15. There is protection for more
deprived areas of the country, those areas which are most dependent on
grant. They continue to receive significantly more government grant.
Notwithstanding the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, it

greater need in an area such as Newcastle. That is why it is receiving
considerably more per household than areas that are not in as great a
need. We acknowledge that and that is what we are doing. However, we
also believe, taking on board the point made by my noble friend Lady
Hanham, that Newcastle, along with every other area of this country,
also has great opportunities to raise more funding in its own area
through the various different kinds of scheme that are there and that
will increase growth in the area if the opportunities are taken. We
have also recognised that services can sometimes be more difficult and
expensive to deliver in rural areas and have set aside £9.5
million to help them as they modernise their services.</hs_para>

local government finance settlement, local council tax payers are very
much in the front of our mind. The Opposition talk a lot about the cost
of living, but it is worth pointing out that under the previous
Government, as my noble friend Lord True said, council tax more than
doubled. This Government have done everything possible to protect
hard-working families from further rises. Over the past three years, we
have offered enough funding for councils to freeze council tax without
losing income. We will be doing the same again for the next two years,
with a further £550 million available to councils. We also
intend to roll that funding into the baseline, giving certainty that
councils will not lose out tomorrow by helping council tax payers
today. Where bills have been frozen, the average bill payer could have
saved more than £700. I very much hope that as many councils as
possible will take up this offer, passing on these savings to their
residents and doing their bit to help people with the cost of

are ensuring that councils can freeze council tax. We think that it is
important that that can be delivered as a way to support families who
struggle with the cost of living. The noble Lord, as concerned as he is
about the cost of living, should support councils in freezing their

do not agree with the noble Lord, Lord Liddle, that my right honourable
friend the Secretary of State has not paid tribute to what many
councils have done to try to transform services. We acknowledge that
many councils have taken steps to make savings through common-sense
measures, but much more could still be done. I also do not agree with
the noble Lord, Lord 
<?notus-xml column=1714?>Smith of Leigh, that nothing more can be done because only low-hanging
fruit was available to them. We are not talking small change here. It
is estimated that some £2 billion a year is lost through local
fraud. Local authorities spend £60 billion a year on
procurement. There remains plenty of room for councils to save
significant sums through more joint working, sharing back-office
functions and using smarter procurement practice. Council tax payers
rightly expect to see councils tackle these issues before they start
putting up bills or cutting back on services. As has already been
mentioned, the Government published <I>Fifty Ways To Save</I>. I will
not accept any cynicism about this because no council is yet fully
realising the potential set out in that document. As one example, there
are only around 20 shared chief executive posts in the country. There
are plenty of other examples where local authorities have made
significant strides forward in this area and demonstrated what is
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000151">Councils
also have more than £19 billion in reserves. People would be
surprised to hear that that is increasing while at the same time local
authorities plead poverty. There is also something like £2
billion-worth of uncollected council tax. Councils have varying degrees
of success in their collection rates, but all need to aspire to the
best. That is even before we begin to consider the more fundamental
transformation in services through models like the troubled families
programme or the whole place community budgets, where the emphasis is
on early intervention and prevention. Over time, these programmes
promise to be more effective and efficient. I could offer more examples
but do not have the time. I highlight this kind of approach in response
to the noble Baroness, Lady Pitkeathley, and others who raised concerns
about some specific services. We have set aside £200 million
from capital receipts to support service transformation. Next year,
there will be a further £330 million to continue this
transformation, including a £200 million expansion of the

noble Lords raised questions about the timing of the announcement. I am
sure that noble Lords will understand that the settlement must follow
the Autumn Statement, which this year was on 5 December. The
noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy, asked about the consultation period. I
make the point to her and other noble Lords that the consultation
period we are in at the moment is on top of widespread consultation
during the course of the year that led to the provisional settlement. I
have already mentioned in respect of the new home bonus one change that
we made in light of listening to that consultation. My honourable

a very arbitrary definition of what is going on in local areas. There
is much in it; there is much left out. When we had a proper place-based
settlement we understood how much money was going in and it was in the
control not of local authorities on their own but of local authorities
working in partnership with other agencies. We need to get the DWP to
recognise that we are not going to get people into jobs from offices in
Whitehall or Manchester—it will be local people on the ground
who get people back into work. That will have the biggest impact on
public spending, because families with incomes from employment, on the

repeat devaluations got us into a terrible position, many years since

remain as a result of Mr Cameron’s recent rather clumsy
démarches on the EU scene. Is the Tory referendum planned for
2017 just PR rubbish or a serious attempt to give the long-suffering
public a real say, as they had in 1975—yet again for narrow
internal party reasons—under a different party? Why does the
infamous EU Act of 2011, which a number of us oppose strongly,
specifically exclude enlargement treaties from the referendum lock? If
Turkey were to join the EU, why would that not be an enormous new
delimitation of the out-of-date and quaint definition of “true
national sovereignty”, whatever that means in the modern world?
Can the Government accept that most reforms in the Union are part of a
continuous legislative and procedural evolution as well as being
comprehensively covered in the extensive Lisbon treaty provisions,
which consolidated all the accumulated treaties since Messina and Rome
and include more of a role for national
parliaments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:27:56"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:28:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

not losing it; it is a net gain. Each country becomes even more
influential and strong precisely because it is part of the larger
modern comity of the whole Union. Before anyone complains too loudly
about a so-called lack of democracy—the democratic

reminded in history how long it took the USA after its revolution,
albeit that it was gradually developing into being a single country, to
get the electorate voting in more than mere handfuls of percentages,

background to this sad subject has been anything but cheering and
uplifting, and austerity and slowdown in the member states’
economies have been an inevitable concomitant. The signs are now,
gradually and painfully, getting better in many parts, including in
Britain. However, an ominous aspect remains. At a time when virtually
all sane and sensible representatives of our 
<?notus-xml column=1719?>UK business and corporate community are so pro-European—the CBI
is a good example of that, bearing in mind its views a few years
ago—politicians’ recklessness has left us now teetering
on the brink of resolving our incoherent European policy stances, at
best as a semi-detached and irrelevant member country or possibly even
with complete separation. Are we not therefore paying a very heavy
price for years of insouciance by the pro-European politicians in this
country who have always been ready to postpone indefinitely a strong
and necessary defence of a full role for the UK, instead of always
pretending to be half-committed? The moment of truth is coming, and I
am sure that the Minister will help us

Howell of Guildford (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble
friend Lord Dykes for initiating this debate on European priorities.
The right place to start is indeed from the famous Bloomberg speech by
my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on 23 January
2013, which I strongly believe set the right agenda and pointed in the
right direction. However, follow-up is now needed. The reform agenda
will not solve itself; it must be vigorously pursued. Indeed, as the
excellent pro-European organisation Open Europe puts it:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="14010969000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000279">“Sweeping
European reform is fully possible but … Downing Street must
seriously raise its
game”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14010969000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000269">Of
course, it is not only Downing Street. This should be above parties if
that is possible, but certainly it should mobilise the best brains in
this
country.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14010969000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000176">Two
essential strategic requirements follow from the agenda-setting of the
famous 23 January speech. The first is obvious. It is that allies must
be secured if there is to be European reform. It must be European
reform, not just reform of the narrow issue of Britain’s
relations with the rest of the European Union. There is definite
progress on this. Mr Cameron, the Prime Minister, is gathering support
for European reform on a scale frankly not dreamed of and, no doubt,
longed for by previous Prime Ministers from both major political
parties. Support for reform is coming quite strongly from the
Netherlands, Sweden, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, the Baltic
states and, of course the Club Med countries. Although they are arguing
for reform for very different reasons, as we know, related to the
difficulties of the eurozone, they are also looking for a reformed
system. We should also have Poland with us as a friend and in the
reform programme—the different kind of EU for the
21st century—but, frankly, present differences are
not exactly helping that. However, I believe that the underlying
interests are the same and point in the same direction.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14010969000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000177">In my view, there is no
question of the UK being somehow marginalised or isolated, as some of
the gurus and commentariat keep insisting. Even if we were alone in
this EU reform programme, and we are not, in our modern networked world
interdependence is guaranteed to every responsible nation. We are
linked to all our neighbours in Europe and, indeed, with the wider
world and the developing world far more closely today than ever before.
We are caught up in an international system of connectivity and joint
responsibility as never before in the history of the 
<?notus-xml column=1720?>world. The intensity of communication is instant and deep, and that
completely changes the interface between all nations.</hs_para>

question of Governments in Europe supporting or being in favour of
different aspects of European reform. There are also powerful interests
that support them and which are shifting very visibly and very clearly.
There is growing scepticism among German business leaders, who say that
the doctrine of ever closer union has failed; that is frequently
reported in the <I>Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung</I> and other bodies.
We have the CSU in Munich calling very loudly for more localism and
less centralism and regulation. We have the German association of
family businesses, which are really the beating heart of the German
economy, demanding that the treaties be “fundamentally
recalibrated”. Frankly, the call is coming from countless
quarters all over the European Union for the political class to rethink
its hard-line 20th century dogmatic position, whether in France, Spain,
Germany or any of the countries I have mentioned. That is the first
requirement that flows from the 23 January agenda and the need to
mobilise political support behind
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000179">The second
essential element is the development of a really profound intellectual
case against the outdated 20th century doctrine of integration and
against what many countries regard as—as quoted in this
morning’s papers—“federalist hyperbole”.
The centralist model is simply no longer relevant in an age when all
the disciplines, from scientists and engineers to physicists, are
telling us about self-assembly, flexibility and building from the
bottom up. This demands a different relationship internationally, and
you can see it developing, perhaps away from the media somewhat, at
every level in our different societies.</hs_para>

out—many people of strongly pro-European
inclination—Europe today is not working. Unemployment is
miserably high at 12%. Youth unemployment is frankly appalling; the
figures are unbelievable. The euro problem is not solved. It has gone

decentralisation and the balance of competences, as our Foreign and
Commonwealth Office is now doing, we should be especially wary of
overambitious European energy policy, which is currently a catastrophe
and of which the outcome is, horrifically, much more coal burning.
Europe is burning more coal than ever. Germany is building 10 new
coal-fired stations. There are sky-high energy prices in Europe, which
are damaging our industry and competition, losing jobs and creating
more fuel poverty. Oddly enough, this is an area in which, in some
senses, you need more Europe. We need more physical connections of gas
and electricity interconnectors to make our market work, but we also
need much less administrative interference from Brussels in our
national energy policies. More Europe and less Europe go together

not only assess but unpick and reallocate some of the competences that
are now no longer valid and were conceived in a different,
pre-internet, age. Equally important is that there is no real single
market in services. There, too, we need fundamental change. I am not
against a detailed shopping 
<?notus-xml column=1721?>list of things that it would be nice for the different countries of
Europe to have, including this country; that is perfectly reasonable.
Of course, the whole subsidiarity principle needs to be boosted.
National parliaments should be given a red-card role. Then there is the
working time directive, tighter budgets and the common fishery
policies—we have been over these things a thousand times. As
long as these aims are widely supported, and are not just British
special pleading, I am all for putting maximum force behind them.

for change to bring the European Union into the 21st century, which
people really want, needs advancing. I agree with Mrs

recovery from her recent skiing accident—that Europe is no
longer the right model. An utterly transformed world has now emerged.
New patterns of modernisation are now unfolding in Africa and Asia,
which are not the same as the European modernisation experience at all.
The growth markets we must penetrate are outside Europe and the West.
Power has not just shifted east and south but has fragmented into a
thousand pressures, sources, cells and groups in the global digital

priority is not so much to lead because, in the networked world,

striking change, at least in the tactics and rhetoric of the Government
on this issue over the past year or so; that is of course very welcome.
I am sure that noble friends of mine will accuse me of being very naive
if I place too much reliance on this, but I speak this afternoon on the
basis that that change is genuine, that the Government are acting in
good faith and to encourage them along that path. It is not impossible
that there is a large element of genuineness about the government
rethink. A year or two ago, the Government were adopting an extremely
confrontational stance towards our partners in the European Union,
vociferously demanding all sorts of concessions, exemptions,
derogations and repatriations, and occasionally laying on some
histrionics, such as walk-outs and so forth, in order to appease
pressure from the Cashites in the Tory party and UKIP. It was a
deplorable

Baroness, Lady Warsi, say on several occasions that the Government now
take the line that they are committed to our membership of the European
Union and simply want to be a member 
<?notus-xml column=1722?>of a reformed European Union in the future. Of course, I welcome that
very significant change. The change may be a genuine one for two very
good reasons. One is that the Government—and the
world—have clearly seen that the tactics they were adopting
previously were pretty counterproductive and unintelligent, and they
have drawn the sensible conclusion from that. The second thing is that
they were forced to look into the abyss: into what would actually
happen if we left the European Union. I know that they have had some
very frank advice on that—franker in private than in public, of
course—from bodies such as the CBI, the Corporation of the City
of London, the Engineering Employers Federation, and from a number of
Japanese and American multinationals and others as well. Therefore they
have had to confront the alternative, which has been a salutary
process.</hs_para>

that spirit, therefore, I will not attack the Government this afternoon
but will try to be helpful and suggest ways in which we can make a
success of those discussions. We on this side of the House, and I think
the whole country, want to see reform in a positive sense. Any human
institution can always be improved and reformed, and the more important
that institution, the more important it is that it is improved and
reformed by each generation. Therefore we should be committed to that
process in principle. I will suggest one or two bases on which the
Government might decide what are the sensible initiatives to take and
what the less productive course to take might be in the months and
years ahead, as discussions continue with our
partners<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000189">The
first thing I urge on the Government is always to focus on the
substance, not on the symbolism. Always go for the content, not the
colour of the wrapping on the package. We should have absolutely no
more farces such as those we had with the Justice and Home Affairs
opt-out, where the Government opted out of a whole series of measures
and then wanted to opt right back into them, because on the substance
they were very necessary and in the national interest. That was a
deplorable and ludicrous exercise, and it was quite obvious that the
Government were pirouetting around in order to appease their own
extremists and to head off pressure from UKIP. That was not a very
edifying episode at all. I hope that the Government will learn the
right lessons from that in future and that they will always focus on
the reality and the substance, and be

pragmatic, my second point is that it would be sensible to take up
issues where we have a particular credibility and, obviously, where our
national interest is directly engaged. The obvious selection is the
single market. We have a natural credibility on the single market as
after all, we took the decisive initiatives to push it through in the
1992 programme and so forth, which we should not allow our partners to
forget. We have not completed the single market—there is some
important work to be done. I hope that as a result of this discussion

thing that cries out to be resolved is the services issue—we
must have a proper services directive. Of course, we have a services
directive, but we all know 
<?notus-xml column=1723?>that that is inadequate. It was much better than what we had before and
was a considerable achievement in itself, and we all know that you can
only move human institutions along at a certain pace. However, now is
the time to try to achieve a real services directive so that we have a
single market in services that is comparable to the one that we have
had successfully for a long time in
goods.</hs_para>

time round we found that the French and the Germans were the greatest
obstacle to that, but it is possible that the Germans will now be less
opposed. That is partially because their economy is doing so well and
unemployment is falling in Germany, so they are less frightened perhaps
by the prospect of Polish plumbers coming across the frontier to work
in Berlin—that was one of the many issues that arose last
time—and also because the Germans have got into the habit of
lecturing everybody else about deregulation, so they may be more open
to deregulatory arguments
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:44:15"></hs_TimeCode>.

on energy, I am never quite sure whether I agree with the noble Lord,
Lord Howell, or not, because he says one thing at one moment, and
something that sounds slightly contradictory in the next sentence.
However I agree with some of what he said about energy policy. Energy
policy is an area where we need to complete the single
market—there is no question about that at all. We do not have a
single market in the retail sector in energy, and that, after 20 years
of the single market, is quite disgraceful. We should do something
about that. We have had partially state-owned
monopolies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:45:00"></hs_TimeCode> in
France—they are not entirely nationalised, of course—and
“monopolies” is the word. In the terms of the domestic
market, they are holding up progress on this, very much to the
detriment of the interests of French consumers, as much as anyone else.
We should deal with that, and now is the time to do it. I think that we

third piece of advice to the Government is the kind of advice that I
would give to anyone who felt that they wanted to slightly change their

positively, and come up with something that results in the continentals
saying, “Good Lord, the British really have changed”,
which would establish a certain credibility for what we say about being
pragmatic. If we are genuinely pragmatic and open-minded and believe in
European reform, clearly there will be cases when the competences of
the Union should be extended to resolve a particular problem, because
that is the right way in which to do it. There may be other cases, of

in fact, in many cases, we might want to go further into integration.

open-minded and could be persuaded that there are situations in which
we should repatriate powers, and I hope that the Government and the

union. If you look at the matter purely objectively, you can see that
there is every interest in our being a part of it, and it is extremely
dangerous to fragment a supervisory regime or bank resolution regime.
It is not something that can possibly be in the country’s

time is short, I shall make a final suggestion, which is one that I
made before to the noble Lord, Lord Newby. The Government—and I
congratulate them on this—have come round to the arguments of
many of us over quite a long time that we need to do something about
the scandal of payday loans and loan sharks. I see that the Minister is
nodding to me, and I understand that the Government have instructed the
FCA to come up with an interest rate or cost limit on those payday
loans. I congratulate them on doing that. When that has been done in
the United States and individual states of the Union—and the
Minister will be familiar with this argument, because those opposed to
it have always come up with it—it has always been ineffective,
because lenders have come in from other states. This is an obvious area
in which, if we are to have effective regulation, we need to have it on
an EU-wide basis. I put it to the Minister a few weeks ago that it
would be worth taking the matter up with Brussels to see if the
Commission might be minded to produce a regulation or directive, and
whether our partners would agree that this would be a sensible move to
take. Now that I have put the issue in public to both the Treasury and
the Foreign Office, I would be grateful to the Minister when she
responds to this debate, or subsequently in writing, leaving a copy in
the Library of the House, if she would let me know whether my arguments
have been considered and what the Government’s conclusions

area of health and delivery of healthcare was not an area originally
anticipated as having any competence at European Union level,
specifically in the treaties. The delivery of healthcare and the
allocation of healthcare resources along with the development of 
<?notus-xml column=1725?>health policy were described as an area in which member states and
national governments maintained absolute competence. The Department of
Health balance of competence review, necessitated by the fact that,
inadvertently, much European legislation and many directives have
impacted on the delivery of healthcare, determined broadly that, in
those areas where European regulation and directives have impacted on
the delivery, it was positive. However, it identified a number of
important areas where there were unintended detrimental consequences
resulting from European
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:50:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:50:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000201">I
shall concentrate on two areas that were highlighted in that competence
review and in the third report of Session 2013-14 of the Science and
Technology Committee of the other place. The first is the question of
the European working time directive, which has been debated extensively
in your Lordships’ House. I return to that because the directive
continues to have a very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:50:48"></hs_TimeCode> impact
on the way that we are able to organise and deliver healthcare in our

working time regulations have affected the quality of care. Although
initially it was anticipated that restricting working time to 48 hours
per week for trainees would promote patient safety and improve quality,
regrettably that has not been the case in this country. Indeed, where
the question of the duration of working hours for junior doctors has
been studied carefully, particularly in the United States, it is clear
from prospective evaluations that have been undertaken over a period of
time that such a restricted period of working each week has a
detrimental impact on patient
safety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000203">There

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> I am most grateful to the noble Lord
for giving way. I greatly recognise and admire his expertise and
experience in this area, but can he perhaps tell the House why our
continental partners, in France and Germany and so on, do not seem to
have had the same problem with the delivery of healthcare that he
suggests we have had as a result of the
directive<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:51:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000205"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kakkar" PimsId="5492" UID="14010969000349" xid="2021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000349">Lord
Kakkar:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for his intervention. That
is because the application of the working time directive in those
countries has been different from our rather fastidious application of
the directive here in the United Kingdom. It is also due to the fact
that the organisational structure for the delivery of healthcare is
very different in France and Germany from the way that we deliver
healthcare in our
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000206">Particularly
in the craft specialties, such as my own specialty of surgery, trainees
have found it increasingly difficult, within the restriction of 48
hours and the restricted period of time now available for specialist
training, to develop the skills necessary to deliver independent
consulting practice, which is very much a feature of the delivery of
healthcare in our NHS but is rather different from countries such as
France and Germany, where they tend to have larger departments with a
much more hierarchical structure.</hs_para>

substantial cost impact from the adoption of the working time
regulations. In the first full year after their application across the
National Health Service, an extra £200 million was spent on the
provision of locums to fill rotas necessary to cover the provision of
out-of-hours care within the NHS. Indeed, just for surgical
specialties, the Royal College of Surgeons has assessed that an
additional £60 million was spent to provide locums to cover
surgical rotas. The Royal College of Surgeons estimates that, because
of the application of the working time regulations, some 40,000
surgical hours are lost per month. Again, that has had a detrimental
impact on ensuring that access to services can be adequately delivered
to meet workload demands. Most worrying is the fact that, on a number
of occasions, coroners have included in their narrative verdicts
reference to the working time regulations as having had a detrimental
impact on the care of individual
patients.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000208">Her
Majesty’s Government recognise that this is an important
challenge. Indeed, in 2010, the then Health Secretary and the Business
Secretary announced that they were to initiate negotiations with our
European partners not on withdrawing from the working time directive as
it applies to healthcare but on ensuring greater flexibility, which
would allow us to develop training schemes to meet the specific needs
of the NHS in England in the training of our trainees. That resulted in
the process being pursued through the mechanism of the social partners,
but regrettably that negotiation has failed and the question has now
been returned to the European
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000209">Clearly,
this is an important area where action is required. As I have said, we
need not to withdraw from the working time directive but to allow the
necessary flexibility to allow working hours to increase from the
current level of 48 hours to 56 or 65 hours, depending on what point
trainees are at in their training and on what specialty or discipline
they are
training<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:55:13"></hs_TimeCode> in. Can
the Minister confirm that this might be a priority area in any further
negotiations with our European

second area is the question of clinical research. Our country has a
very distinguished heritage in terms of its contribution to biomedical
research globally. The citations for research undertaken in our country
are substantial. Some 12% of global citations for biomedical research
are derived from research conducted in our country, a substantially
greater proportion than in any other country in the world. Much of this
is based on our distinguished history in delivering important clinical
research. In 2001 6% of all patients entering clinical trials in the
world came from the United Kingdom. By 2006, after application of the
clinical trials directive, that had fallen to 1.4% and in the period
2007-11 there was a further 22% decline in the number of patients
entered into clinical trials from our
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000211">The
clinical trials directive has not only impacted on clinical research in
our own country, it has affected all other European member states in
terms of their competitiveness globally to deliver clinical research.
The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which
registers new clinical trials, identified in 2007 some 1,207 new trials
registered. By 2011 it was down to 943. Clearly, the clinical trials
directive is 
<?notus-xml column=1727?>having a detrimental impact. It has, indeed, been renegotiated and a
clinical trials regulation was agreed in 2012 by the European
Parliament, due for application in 2016. The third report of the
Science and Technology Committee of the other place identified ongoing
concerns even about the newly drafted clinical trials regulation,
concerns that were raised in evidence the committee received from the
Academy of Medical Sciences and from the Wellcome Trust, a major funder
of clinical research in our
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000212">In
the area of clinical research, I suggest not that we withdraw from the
clinical trials directive or the future clinical trials regulation,
because there are important benefits to having a certain standard
across the European Union, but that we should be able to ensure that
flexibility provides for the specific environment in which we undertake
and deliver clinical research in our country, with the strong national
clinical governance mechanisms that we have in place, rather than find
that the directive and the future regulation have had a detrimental
impact on our ability to remain competitive in the life sciences area.
The life sciences are an important feature of national activity, both
in terms of ensuring excellence in our health service and in terms of
the economic impact that life science industries have for our
country.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_09_PT_1/64DD68594B143F90305DB7EC94B618E0A47EB76D" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 January 2014">Thursday,

I should not say this, but I have just written a book on the future of

past and present. I always greatly respect the speeches of the noble

today. The Prime Minister wants an open and flexible Europe. Everyone
wants a more open and flexible Europe, and many reforms are being
pushed through to try to achieve this. However, it is absurd to
identify flexibility with cherry picking. Flexibility often means, for
example, enhanced leadership. In the case of the eurozone, for example,
as the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, mentioned, we need more leadership and
more capability to respond quickly. That is not achieved by a version

differences between our review and that being carried out in the
Netherlands, which is often thought of as being a similar exercise. The
Dutch approach is not based on the idea of securing treaty
change—as our approach seems to be—rejects an approach
based on opt-outs, and is concerned with subsidiarity as such. I have
read the literature on our review of competences and a lot of
interesting ideas are developed in it, but I feel strongly that we

conscious of this. One of the things on which I agreed with the noble

transformation, dominated by technology, throughout most of our lives.
All states, not just the European Union as a collection of states, are

UK’s major contributions to Europe in the past has been to
support enlargement, it being the driving force behind part of the
European Union’s success. We had a war in Europe in which
100,000 died. In my view, it will be crucial that the Balkan
countries—Serbia, Kosovo and Albania—are incorporated
into the European Union. Are the Government seriously threatening to
block accession, as reported in the press, as part of a sort of
blackmail tactic? Is there any truth in that assertion? Surely that
would be wrong. We need those countries in the European Union. There is
still the possibility of conflict in that area, and the UK has always
supported such a process in the past. Is it now going to try to throw
up a roadblock? I certainly hope not, and I hope that the noble

before but I would still like to see whether she is willing to venture
an answer. Following the Prime Minister’s Bloomberg speech, if
the Government are still in power and if sufficient forms of response
from Europe are not achieved, is there a situation in which the PM
would actively campaign for the UK’s exit from the European

Liddle (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an excellent short
debate and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, for raising this topic.
To be honest, the 
<?notus-xml column=1730?>quality of the contributions is likely to be considerably in advance of
what we hear tomorrow, and I think that this is a much more relevant
topic for debate on the future of Britain’s relations with
Europe. As I listened to the excellent speeches from all noble Lords
who have spoken, it struck me that we should be using our wonderful
Lords Select Committee to try to put together some kind of consensus
about what a reform agenda for the EU would be. That would be a very
valuable
exercise<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T18:09:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

always be some differences on areas such as social Europe but I think
that there is a possibility of achieving a large measure of agreement
on what such a reform agenda should be. However, the key point, which I
put to the Minister during Questions this morning, is that an agenda
for reform has to be a multilateral agenda for Europe and not a set of
British demands for the repatriation of this power and opt-outs from
this or that directive. I was glad to hear the noble Lord, Lord Howell,
endorse that
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T18:10:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000228">I
do not agree with the Prime Minister’s speech about a
referendum—we can debate that tomorrow—but it was
extremely well crafted. There is a lot of common ground on about 80% of
what it had to say about the future of the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T18:11:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government’s reform agenda has certain flaws. The questions
asked by the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, were extremely relevant. I had
intended to ask them myself. I will not repeat them but I will add to
them. First, the assumption that there will be a major treaty change in
the next Parliament is debatable at best. Some of the countries which
most favour reform—the Netherlands, for example—are among
the partners who are most opposed to a comprehensive treaty change. So
we do not necessarily win allies on reform by demanding treaty
change<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T18:12:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000230">Secondly,
as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, our approach to future
enlargement and the linking of that to the question of migration and
limitations on migration, threatens to put against us in Europe most of
the new member states that, when I worked for Tony Blair, we fought
hardest to get onside. There are obviously many issues that need to be
considered on the question of migration—social security benefits
and so on—but if it is thought that we are playing a populist
game on these issues, we will simply alienate a large section of the
European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T18:13:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000231" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000231">The
third error the Government are making is the assumption that the
eurozone will become a much more integrated area and that we will have
to accept a kind of permanent outer-tier status in the European Union.
That is not realistic. I am sure that we can negotiate
non-discrimination clauses and commitments that would reassure people
who worry that a eurozone bloc might discriminate against us. I am sure
that that could be done and the integrity of the single market
preserved.</hs_para>

is wide range of issues within the EU in which Britain should seek to
play a leading role, such as energy and climate change; defence and
security, where our bilateral co-operation with France is presently
very strong; foreign policy; free trade agreements; and the deepening
of the single market. We should not automatically assume that we will
be outer-tier players. 
<?notus-xml column=1731?>That is not a viable vision for Britain’s future in the European
Union. I do not see a country such as Great Britain putting up for
decades with the idea that it is only on the outer

Government may have some of the right ideas about reform but they are
not, in our view on this side of the House, going about it in the right
way. There is a big opportunity for change coming up with the
appointment of a new European Commission. Who will be the President?
Are we pressing for reforms to how the Commission works? One of the key
things in trying to ensure that Europe focuses on a limited number of
key priorities rather than trying to legislate over a wide area is to
think about how you streamline the European Commission so that it has a
limited number of priorities, and making an agreement with the European
Council about what those priorities would
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010969000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140109-0003.htm#14010969000234">I do not
think that the agenda for the future should be
one of repatriation of powers. However, it should certainly be one of
understanding between the Council and the
Commission about how competences that the treaties give to the European
Union should be exercised. We must have another go at the
question of more sharply defining the principles
of proportionality and subsidiarity. For the moment, that is enough.
The Government have a lot of major questions to
answer.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_09_PT_1/437B61C4B5AFDD21BFF485FCF997E562389A65F9" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 9 January 2014">Thursday,

Government are clear that membership of the EU is in the UK’s
interest. We are also clear that the EU urgently needs to reform. As
the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister set out in speeches last
year, the EU needs to become more competitive, more flexible and more
democratically accountable, with powers flowing both ways and fairness
between eurozone and non-eurozone members. I am delighted to hear the
noble Lord, Lord Liddle, say that he agrees with almost 80% of the
Prime Minister’s speech from last January. He also agrees with
the need for reform, and it would be interesting to hear specifically
the areas that he does not agree with. I certainly look forward to

British people could also have their say in relation to these

the Government’s priority to engage with all member states and

reforms that we seek are for the benefit of all member states, and we
