obviously analyse the reasons the panel puts forth in its report. He
asks a hypothetical question, and all I can say is that we just have to

Australia, the scientific evidence shows that it is now TB free. We can
look at the United States and the white-tailed deer, the brushtail
possum in New Zealand, or Ireland, which I have just cited. The
Republic of Ireland is a scientific, practical example because by
bearing down on the disease in cattle and in wildlife, it has got it

in my previous answer, many water companies are now taking such action,
but there are other things we can do to help people who are struggling
with their water bills. The biggest thing we can do is to ensure that
we bear down on charges for everybody. My right hon. Friend the
Secretary of State has been clear in his expectations, Ofwat has been
clear in the way it has entered into the price review period and
companies are now responding. We will see, in the vast majority of

below inflation. That is a real improvement on the last price review

for the exemption of small businesses. DEFRA’s call for evidence
in relation to a charge on single-use plastic bags closed on 20
December, and the results are 
<?notus-xml column=440?>now being analysed. The Government recognise that there is a significant
debate about acceptable levels of contamination from biodegradable
plastics in the recycling stream, and have therefore called on industry
to develop new ways of separating plastic bags from the waste stream.
Two companies have been awarded contracts for the research, and will
complete their feasibility studies by

should be welcome at the communion rail. The working group did not
recommend a new authorised liturgy, but a majority of its members did
recommend that vicars should, with the consent of parochial church
councils, be able to mark the formation of a permanent same-sex
relationship in a public service. I am sure that that is one of the
issues that the House of Bishops will be considering very seriously in
the context of its consideration of the Pilling report’s

Indeed, one only has to see the plaque in Westminster Hall to remember
where Sir Thomas More was put on trial in part for his beliefs. In this

Knighton-Smith, who was five, was diagnosed with neuroblastoma and
given only a few weeks to live without a new monoclonal antibody
therapy. That treatment was not available on the NHS, but thanks to the
efforts of the former health Minister Ann Keen, John Parkes of
Northamptonshire primary care trust and the then shadow Secretary of
State for Health—the Leader of the House—Zac received the
treatment in Germany, which the NHS paid for. On Saturday, this lovely,
full-of-life and happy little boy passed away. He will be sadly and
greatly missed. However, without politicians of different parties
working together, he would not have had the last five years of life.

point. Comparisons are of course odious, but I would say two things.
First, I was interested to see the Centre for Economic and Business
Research’s annual review of the world economic league, published
on Boxing day. Among other things, it said that the United Kingdom was
the west’s second best performing economy after the United
States, and that by 2030 it was likely to overtake Germany and become
the largest western European economy. That was partly attributed to its
being a relatively low-tax economy. By contrast, the CEBR saw France
moving to about 13th position in  the world economic league by
that point—that is only its view, not mine. Secondly, we have to
ask the Leader of the Opposition, who said that what President Hollande
was doing for France, Labour would do for Britain, whether the Labour
party continues to adhere to that
philosophy.</hs_Para>

representing the interests of his constituents. The Government took the
decision to link eligibility for the pupil premium to adoptions under
the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which was implemented on 30
December 2005, to ensure consistency with the Government’s
policy on priority school admissions for children adopted from care,
and in the light of the need to balance competing funding priorities
during the current difficult economic climate. The criteria for the
pupil premium are reviewed annually. As part of that process, the
Government will revisit the decision to limit access to the pupil
premium to adoptions under the 2002 Act in time for the 2015-16
financial
year.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_09_PT_1/5404A2C262AD753771D69F63BB675ACD2B00614C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="9 January 2014">Thursday

of non-custodial sentences for serious offences? The public are rightly
questioning why some people found guilty of very serious and violent
crimes are avoiding prison. Victims of crime need confidence that those
guilty of serious crimes will be properly punished, but there is

which we all feel strongly. I remind her, however, that the sentencing
regime we had was substantially inherited from the Labour Government.
We have taken action to improve the very things people are concerned
about. For example, if someone commits a serious crime under this
Government, they are nearly 10% more likely to go to prison than in the
last full year of the Labour Administration, and the average sentence
for sexual offences is nearly one year longer than it was in 2008 under

for employers themselves to invest in training. In that respect, one of
the many positive results reported in the British Chambers of Commerce
economic survey

plan that the coalition is pursuing. Flexible labour markets are also
important. There have been widespread pressures on many economies
throughout the world, some of which have manifested themselves in
rapidly rising unemployment. The fact that we in this country have been
able to produce 1.6 million extra private sector jobs is testimony to
the fact that we have been prepared to make difficult decisions in
controlling public sector expenditure and the reduction of public

grateful to the hon. Gentleman insofar as he seeks to protect the
interests of Members and, especially, of the Chair. A cynical soul
might hazard a guess that he had been in consultation with

is true that many in rural communities live in relative comfort and
prosperity, particularly in my area, but there are also enormous
challenges. There are pockets of rural poverty and isolation, as well
as poor public services. Public services cost more to deliver in
sparsely populated rural areas, where there is also a high
concentration of the elderly population. All those factors represent a
challenge to the delivery of public services. The extra cost of
providing these services to rural communities is evident across the
public sector, yet in 2012-13 rural local authorities received less
than half of the per head funding that urban authorities received. If
we look at areas such as education, we find that the Government are
reducing local authorities’ flexibility to allocate extra
funding to small rural schools with higher running costs. We urge the
Government to recognise that the current system of calculating local
government finance is deeply unfair to rural areas in comparison with
their urban counterparts. I congratulate

wish to take the opportunity to highlight some areas where that is the
case and go on to discuss them in more detail. The cost of heating
homes and filling car fuel tanks in rural areas is very high, yet rural
public transport is infrequent and, as we know, the bus subsidy 
<?notus-xml column=470?>is under threat. Off-grid households are currently prevented from
accessing the same incentives and finance to improve their properties
as are available to on-grid households. I am delighted to see that the
Treasury is extending the ability of rural areas such as Thirsk, Malton
and Filey to apply for rural fuel duty discount, and obviously we will
look to make sure that the EU funding under the state aid rules
criteria will apply equally across the board to such rural and sparsely
populated areas as

debate, as the hon. Gentleman is highlighting, is the “Rural
Communities” report and the Government response to it. We
published our report in July and they responded in October. It is a
source of disappointment that the Government are leaving it to rural
communities to make their own arrangements; some will be better placed
than others to do so.</hs_Para>

me go back to the report’s highlights. We believe that school
funds should revert back to varied lump sum payments going to rural
schools according to their need. We also looked at the rolling-out of
superfast broadband to rural areas, finding that it should be
prioritised to those with the slowest speed. We urge the Department to
impress upon BT that it must refocus its priorities. It is pointless
giving those who have a fast speed an even faster speed; we believe
that we should improve access for communities that have no, or
extremely slow, broadband. We also urge BT to indicate which areas will
be covered by 2015 under the rural broadband programme, thus allowing
the areas that will not be covered to make alternative
arrangements.</hs_Para>

urge the Department to ensure that all rural areas will have fast
broadband. We must ensure that the Department is able to provide the
outlying farms that are too far from the cabinet and do not have fast
broadband with paper copies of things in the interim. Incredibly, when
I try to use my mobile phone at home in a rural area, I find that I do
not have mobile phone coverage; voice not spots should also urgently be
addressed.</hs_Para>

makes a crucial point about the so-called last 10% in rural areas, such
as Devon and Somerset, where roll-out has taken place. Unless we
achieve 100% accessibility for high-speed broadband, we will do an
immense disservice to people in very rural areas. Does she agree that
when those areas or properties are identified, the Government should
make funds available to ensure such accessibility? We want not a
bidding system or matched funding, which is not available in rural
areas, but the Government to finish the

partnerships to address the needs of rural businesses, and we urge the
Government to ensure that financial support is offered to the business
sector. The business bank, the single local growth fund and other such
funds are available to rural businesses. We recognise the needs of
rural communities. Currently, deprivation, affordability and provision

me explain why we called for this report. In 2010, the Government
abolished the rural watchdog, the Commission for Rural Communities, and
replaced it with a beefed-up rural communities policy unit in DEFRA
that operates as a centre of rural expertise, supporting and
co-ordinating activity within and beyond the Department. It champions
rural issues across the Government. We were told that the unit would
play an important role in helping all Government Departments ensure
that their policies are effectively rural-proofed before decisions are
made<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:51:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000237">Earlier
this year, we commenced an inquiry into rural communities to assess how
successful DEFRA and the new unit have been at championing rural issues
across Government to achieve their target of fair, practical and
affordable outcomes for rural residents, businesses and communities.
Our findings led us to conclude that the rural communities policy unit
faces a difficult task if it is to meet that ambition. Too often,
Government policy has failed to take account of the challenges that
exist in providing services to a rural population that is often
sparsely distributed and lacks access to basic
infrastructure.</hs_Para>

have mentioned the local government settlement and how rural
communities pay higher council tax bills per dwelling yet receive less
Government grant and have access to fewer public services than their
urban counterparts. I will not go over all our conclusions in that
regard, but the Government have, in part, recognised their
misjudgement by announcing an extra £8.5 million efficiency
support payment for one year only for the most rural councils. Some
payments are as small as £650. As welcome as any extra funding
is, that is clearly not the long-term solution to the problem of rural
councils not getting their fair share. Regrettably, the Government
rejected our call for the gap in funding between rural and urban
councils to be reduced. We must and we will continue to press the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:53:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000239"><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Gilbert" PimsId="5554" UID="14010943000514" xid="1188" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000514"><B>Stephen
Gilbert</B> (St Austell and Newquay) (LD):</Member> I congratulate my
hon. Friend on this debate. In Cornwall, the reality is that we have
higher than average council tax, lower than average earnings and less
money spent per head in the rural areas than in the urban areas.
Closing that gap by just 10% a year for the next five years would mean
an additional £16 million of income for people in Cornwall. Does

McIntosh:</Member></B> Indeed, and I, as an individual, am part of the
rural fair share campaign. The reason for calling this debate is to
lend support to that campaign, which goes to the heart of delivering
public services in rural areas. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for
allowing me to make that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:54:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000241">Let
me turn now to housing, another key part of the report. Parts of rural
England are among the most unaffordable places to live in the country.
Ryedale, in my area, stands out as the people working there earn less
on average than those working in urban areas or in other parts of
Thirsk, Malton and Filey. Rural homes are more expensive than urban
ones. The average house price in the countryside is equivalent to 6.3
times gross annual average earnings, compared with 4.9 in urban areas.
Potential first-time buyers are particularly hard hit by high property
prices and are increasingly frozen out of rural areas. If we do not
address those problems, the consequences for rural communities will be
grave. If young people are priced out of rural areas, we lose the pool
of labour for the local economy and the service sector, and demand for
services, schools, shops and pubs will also decrease, making their
existence less viable. Rather than addressing the problems on the
demand side, we urge the Government to do much more to increase the
supply of housing in rural
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:55:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000242">We
recommended that small rural communities should be exempt from the
bedroom tax. In my area, there is a chronic shortage of one and
two-bedroom homes. Until such a time as we can rehouse those who wish
to downsize, allowing larger families to move into larger properties,
housing will remain a problem. Sadly, the Government rejected that
recommendation. In their response, they suggested that those affected
by the bedroom tax should simply work more hours to make up the
shortfall or should move into the private sector. When I visited the
food bank in my area, run by the local church, volunteers and the
Trussell Trust, I found the story of one lady who volunteers there very
affecting: she wants to work more hours for her employer, but the work
is simply not
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:56:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000243">Regrettably,
there are also planning issues—the elephant in the room that no
one wants to mention. Whenever a planning authority in a nice area
makes a proposal for social housing or smaller units, people always
write to their MP—I do not think I am an exception in this
regard—to say, “I know just the place for that
development: at the other end of the village from where I live.”
Until we can get over that barrier, we will have a smaller stock of
social homes. The bedroom tax means that tenants are expected to move
greater distances, away from friends, family and schools. We must have
a policy that allows key workers to live in the areas where they
perform a vital
role<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>. When the
Minister sums up, will he explain what input his Department had into
that policy from a different Department, and why he believes that it is
suitable for rural communities that lack the variety and volume of
social housing stock on which the policy
depends<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T11:57:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

in more detail to rural broadband. It is crucial to rural businesses,
allowing economic growth in rural areas and allowing rural businesses
to compete with their urban counterparts. I have mentioned digital by
default, and we must ensure that any new computer system the Government
bring into effect is fit for purpose before it is introduced and that
it reaches every farm on 
<?notus-xml column=473?>which the Department is relying to fill in a digital form. Rural
communities and their businesses, schools and households have fallen
behind their urban counterparts on broadband access. The roll-out of
superfast broadband to 90% of rural areas will, I am sorry to say, be
delivered late and it is unclear when the target to which we all aspire

reports suggested that it will be wound down in March and that much of
the available funding will be returned to Brussels. It aimed to deliver
£20 million in funding and to connect 70,000 homes, but so
far—I hope that the Minister can correct me—only three
projects have been approved, claiming less than £1 million in
total, and they will connect just 2,500 homes. A member of the public

although funding existed, officials had made it impossible to spend and
that therefore the rural community broadband fund was dead. Another

transport, the extent to which the pupil premium reaches rural areas

reducing local authorities’ flexibility to allocate extra
funding to schools with higher running costs, a move that will affect
smaller rural schools in particular. The Government are demanding that
all primary schools receive the same level of lump sum funding,
regardless of size, location or other circumstances. That also applies

<?notus-xml column=475?>and for giving a very measured speech with references to the document
that we are considering. It is important to stick to that document,
because many of us in the Chamber represent areas that are not covered
by DEFRA and have devolved Administrations who deal with many rural
issues. However, the House of Commons still retains some reserved
matters, and it is very important that Members from Northern Ireland,
Scotland and Wales are present. Obviously, I make particular reference
to Wales. It is good to see here representatives from Wales from three
of the four parties. Without making any partisan point, Plaid Cymru

Thomas was the first rural Labour MP to sit in the House of Commons. He

is one of the big issues. When an area loses many people, capital
grants are reduced and that makes it even more difficult to sustain and
regenerate local communities. In the 1980s and 1990s, our

only one to lose population during the two census periods from 1981 to
2001. We lost a lot of talent and a lot of families who had been there
for many years. Economic decline is an issue in rural and periphery
areas. We have the double whammy of being on the periphery, which has

Ministers are taking the off-grid issue seriously, but not enough
practical steps have been taken. I am very pleased that my party is now
calling for something for which I have been campaigning for some time:
for the energy regulator to take responsibility for those not
on the mains grid. This is an historic element of privatisation. When
the energy markets for gas and electricity were set up, they
encompassed the old generators that were on-grid and left an
unregulated off-grid, which means that many people are paying a lot
more in energy costs for their gas

the Government, the energy companies and, indeed, the regulator talk
about discounts and dual-fuel discounts—this issue affects every
Member who represents a rural community—that does not apply to
people who do not have mains gas. They are paying considerably more for
their energy. The average price is a luxury for many people in rural
areas. They pay considerably more, not only for the distribution and
transmission cost, but for not benefiting from the energy
companies.</hs_Para>

Many Members, including those from the Cornwall and Devon area, have

recommendation to the Competition Commission. Unfortunately, it did not
find that there is no competition, but I think that is blindingly
obvious. That is why I welcome—I am not just making a party
political point—the Labour party’s intention that Ofgem,
the regulator, look at off-grid as well, because it could give the same
protection to off-grid customers. It is there to champion consumers and

to buy their fuel before winter. In line with a cross-party campaign, I
urge the Government to look at mechanisms to allow people in rural

in advance and do not have to pay premium prices for coal, oil and
other energy sources. I have pressed my party on that important point,
and it has agreed, if it comes into government in 2015, to bring that
measure in. I know there are IT issues, but I am sure that postcodes

goods and local goods. There have been a few hiccups with labelling
issues, but I again give credit to the Government for moving in this
direction. People want to know exactly what they are buying and where
it comes from. Some bland labels just say, “British” or
“European”, and I want labelling to be more localised, so
that local farmers can sell their produce in their area and have
marketing opportunities if they choose to export it to other areas.

final point is about broadband and infrastructure, which is also

telephone poles—including in some very remote areas in my
constituency, and I am sure in others—so it is important that,
in the 21st century, the same communities should get fast
broadband at equal speeds to those in the rest of the United Kingdom.
We need to work towards that position. Unfortunately, the market does
not help, because many companies start off in urban areas where there
is a large customer base, while rural areas very much have second-class

cathedral, will be built along the Lincoln edge. This is not a debate
about wind farms, but it is a debate about rural areas and surely it is
a debate about the right of local people to have a say. The planning
committee of West Lindsey district council has opposed unanimously the
application for those vast wind farms. I believe that the planning
process should respect the views of local people, particularly given
that there are good planning reasons relating to local archaeology and
the proximity to RAF Scampton, as well as the famous view that I have
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000305">Localism

Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton, because there is no bedroom
tax—it really is a spare room subsidy. In rural areas, we have
to try to find a way—she was feeling her way towards this
point—to distribute low-cost housing and to move people on from
housing that is under-occupied so that younger families can get into
it. As she said, this is a complex issue because there is not enough
low-cost, single-bedroom social housing in rural areas. Local councils
such as East Lindsey and West Lindsey district councils in my area are
working on the problem and the local housing associations are very
aware of it. I agree with her to the extent that localism comes into
this. In this complicated area, central Government must work with local
councils to ensure a good supply of low-cost
housing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:34:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000308">The
cost of living in rural areas is often not recognised. One can get
bogged down in statistics and details, but it is important that we, as
Members of Parliament who represent rural areas, put on the record the
sheer cost of living in rural Britain, compared with living in urban
Britain. People who live in entirely rural seats a long way from the
capital are very under-represented in this city. Often, our voice does
not get through. That affects all essential public services. In
policing, despite high rural crime—I am a victim of rural crime
myself—Lincolnshire is bottom of the heap for funding per head.
It affects transport and hospital services. Again and again, despite
the fact that incomes are lower in rural areas, the funding that we
receive from central Government is inadequate. Our political voice is
not powerful enough. We do not have a sufficient number of Members of
Parliament or, dare I say it, Members in marginal seats, but we have a
right to speak out because there is a clear injustice in the national
funding formulas against rural people, who are often living in
poverty<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:35:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000309">That
is not just rhetoric; it is fact. There have been a number of academic
studies on the minimum income standard. That concept was invented by
researchers and is carefully worked out. It is based on what members of
the public think people need in order to have the minimum acceptable
standard of living. There is no doubt that people in rural areas tend
to have to spend 10% to 20% more on everyday requirements than those in
urban areas, even though they often have lower wages or salaries. To
reach a minimum living standard on 2010 levels, the research indicates
that single working adults need to earn at least £15,600 a year
in rural towns, £17,900 in villages and £18,000 in
hamlets or remote countryside. Those in urban areas need earn only
£14,400. For couples with two children, the annual earnings
requirement is much higher at about £33,000 to £42,000,
depending on the circumstances. I assure the House that many people who
live in rural areas do not earn anything like £42,000 a year.

that, proportionally, more households in rural areas are in fuel
poverty than the national average. That is obvious—it is a clear
fact. Fuel 
<?notus-xml column=483?>poverty is even greater in sparse villages and hamlets than it is in
rural towns. Some 36% of rural households are off the gas grid, as the
hon. Gentleman said, as opposed to only 8% in urban areas. As we all
know to our personal cost, those households are reliant on much more
expensive domestic fuels than others. I do not pretend that I know the

In rural towns and their fringes it is £62, in villages it is
£78, and in hamlets and isolated dwellings it is £90. The
average for England is £58. In rural areas, the highest
proportion of income that is spent on an individual commodity or
service goes on transport. We should consider the sort of wages that
people in rural areas earn. There are a lot of retired people on
relatively modest pensions. They have to spend an average of no less
than £90 a week on transport if they live in hamlets or isolated
dwellings, which is an enormous
burden.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000312">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T12:39:05"></hs_TimeCode>

We in Lincolnshire know all about long distances. Some 96% of urban

bus services. Only 42% of households in rural areas have a regular bus
service. Famously, in my constituency in north Lincolnshire, we have
the train service between Gainsborough, which I represent, and
Cleethorpes, which runs once a week. Imagine a train that runs once a

is obvious that we have a problem of poverty in rural areas, and that
there is not sufficient political weight to address it. The idea of
minimum income standards is, in some ways, tied to that of the living

focusing on areas such as London and the other big cities. I believe
that the concept applies even more powerfully to the countryside. The
social teaching of the Churches, which is a rich vein of thought and
very much to be recommended as a read, puts strong emphasis on justice
in the relationship between employers and their employees. For an
employer to deprive a worker of his justly earned wage is traditionally
described as “a sin crying out to heaven for vengeance”.

Edward Leigh:</Member></B> That is an interesting point, but we cannot

the agriculture sector. Let us look at the farming economy in
Lincolnshire. I live on an estate of 5,000 acres—I do not own
it, I hasten to say. When the boards were created, there would probably
have been 40 or 50 agricultural labourers working the estate. Now,
there are only one or two. Although the hon. Lady’s point is
fair, I do not believe that agricultural labourers’ wages are
quite the problem in current rural Britain that they were in the
immediate post-war period. I am thinking more of the problems that are
loaded on to the great majority of people in the countryside, who are
not farmers and do not work for 
<?notus-xml column=485?>farmers but who are living in fuel poverty, are retired or find
difficulty with their transport costs. Their children have difficulty
in getting housing, and they perhaps work in low-paid jobs in the

pensioners whose homes are not connected to the mains gas grid, and
whose principal source of fuel is home fuel oil, liquid petroleum gas
or propane gas. Bringing forward payment of the winter fuel allowance
would allow low-income consumers who have no access to reduced tariffs
and no possibility of changing supplier, to fill their tanks prior to
the onset of winter, at a time when prices tend to be a little lower.
Unlike those of us who get quarterly bills, those with oil tanks have
to pay large four figure sums up front to fill them, and it would cost
nothing for the Government to simply re-sequence payments for those
affected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000333" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000333">Another
key issue for our rural communities is postal services. Our post office
network has shrunk dramatically over the past 10 years, and it is
critical to protect our remaining post offices in rural areas. Often
the post office will be the last business in a village, and the last
vestige of any accessible financial services. A reliable universal mail
service is essential to businesses in rural areas and to efforts that
encourage the growth of such businesses, particularly as online retail
continues to expand and create new opportunities. If we are to
re-energise small businesses in the rural economy, they must have
access to a full, reliable and—above all—reasonably
priced postal service that will ensure they can send and receive
packages quickly and efficiently. We must recognise that post offices
are an essential piece of our economic infrastructure in the digital
age. Despite all the good intentions and words, however, the reality is
that postal services continue to decline. Until  
<?notus-xml column=487?>we see the establishment of more Government and
financial services in post offices, the future does
not look all that
bright.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000334">Given
that the regulator has already removed price caps from every service
apart from second-class mail, I have little confidence that it will
provide rural consumers and those in remote areas with protection
against big price increases in postal services. The record of
regulators in other privatised industries has shown how ineffective a
protection they can be—we need only look at the energy market to
see that in action.</hs_Para>

aspect of our essential rural infrastructure is broadband and mobile
connectivity, and a lot of attention has been paid to that today. Parts
of my constituency are still black holes for phone reception, and many
households in rural areas have wholly inadequate broadband speeds, if
they have it at all. Sizeable areas of my constituency are simply not
online. Moreover, in areas where broadband is available, it is
comparatively expensive and people will pay around £40 or
£50 a month for a service that they would easily get for less
than £10 a month in London. As somebody who pays phone bills in
both areas, I know that there can sometimes be a £45 difference
in the monthly charge. That hidden cost for people in rural and remote
areas does not necessarily come to the fore very often, but even when
they have access to the internet, they are likely to pay through the
nose for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010943000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000336">To
my mind, the underlying problem is the way that spectrum licences have
been issued. It is all very well to say that 90% or 95% of the UK will
have broadband by a certain date, but if the remaining 5% is mostly in
rural Scotland, that is a problem. As Government services increasingly
move online, digital exclusion is becoming an ever more pressing
problem in rural areas, compounding economic exclusion and the existing
challenges of rural life that already create a lot of hurdles for
people in our rural communities. Other countries in Europe with similar
geographical challenges have done a much better job than the UK of
delivering access to mobile and broadband connectivity, and we
could—and should—learn a great deal from them.</hs_Para>

conclude by touching on agriculture. The economic vitality of our rural
communities is underpinned by our agricultural industries and the food
and drink processing and distribution sectors that derive from them. In
many parts of rural Scotland, common agricultural policy support is
essential to the viability of primary producers and the sustainable
development of our rural areas. CAP rural development funding has
played a crucial role in enabling the 52% rise in exports of food and
drink since 2007, mainly by investing in the facilities and
infrastructure that those businesses need to grow.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010943000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000338">However,
keeping up with our neighbours in Europe is increasingly difficult.
Historically, Scotland has had low levels of CAP support relative to
the area of land in agricultural use. Currently, we receive an average
of €130 per hectare, compared with an EU average of
€196. Within the UK, Scotland’s €130 per hectare
compares with an English average of €265 per hectare, a Welsh
average of €247 per hectare, and a Northern Irish
average of €335 per hectare. Therefore, compared to other parts
of the EU and UK, Scotland has been short changed on the CAP for a long
time, putting our agricultural sector at a competitive disadvantage.
In that respect, moves towards convergence are an important
step in the right direction, but Scotland’s rural communities
will 
<?notus-xml column=488?>not benefit from that process because the UK Government have decided to
use the £230 million convergence uplift they received because of
Scotland’s historically low levels of support to plug gaps in
CAP funding elsewhere in the UK, instead of using it as
intended.</hs_Para>

Scotland will have the lowest levels of CAP funding per hectare of any
country in the EU—money that could be used to make tremendous
investments in our rural communities, improve our rural environment,
and support jobs and economic growth in rural areas. Scottish farmers,
those living in rural areas and running rural businesses do not want
special treatment, but they do want equitable treatment and parity with
their neighbours in the UK and the rest of the EU.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010943000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010943000340">Around 30% of
Scotland’s economic output is generated by the rural economy, so
the issue is critical for our future development. With better support,
we could do a whole lot better and on all those issues—rural
development funding, fuel costs, heating costs, postal services and
broadband—the UK could, and should, be doing a lot more to
support rural communities such as the one I represent. I hope Ministers
will use their opportunities in the remainder of this Parliament to
give the issue the priority it
deserves.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_09_PT_1/17FD6CABC994213DE4F76F87D46A3A2C44BE452B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="9 January 2014">Thursday

Davies</B> (Montgomeryshire) (Con):</Member> This hugely important
debate is of great interest. I often speak in debates in the House, but
if I raise an issue about rural areas or rural policy, it is usually
tangential or an add-on to another debate. A debate wholly
about rural affairs is, therefore, hugely welcome and I am pleased to
take part.</hs_Para>

lived in rural Wales. I was born on a hill farm in rural
Montgomeryshire, where I have always lived, and nearly all my relations
are still from there. Throughout my public life—now decades
old—my interest has been the promotion of the economy of rural
areas, and that involves not only farming, which was my occupation, but
the recognition that rural areas must change and develop other forms of
employment if they are to thrive.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010947000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000004">The report,
which was so ably presented by my hon. Friend the Member for
Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh), covers a huge range of
issues. One could probably speak for days on this topic, but I want to
consider those areas that have an impact on my constituency.
Inevitably, most of those issues are related to policy in England, but
they have a big impact on Wales and particularly on my
constituency. Montgomeryshire is a beautiful constituency that marches
alongside another beautiful constituency in Shropshire, and many
policies in mid-Wales depend on what is happening there. Wales is
developing as its own nation in a great and welcome way that I support.
The reality, however, is that the economy of mid-Wales is still
connected and dependent on Shropshire and the west midlands, so the
link between Shropshire and Montgomeryshire is important.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010947000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000005">The four
headings I want to speak on briefly relate to the cross-border issue:
health care; transport infrastructure; rural community empowerment,
touching on onshore wind farms; and farming, which is not covered
massively in the report but is important to all of us.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010947000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000006"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:00:18"></hs_TimeCode>The
report covers the difficulty of access to health care for people living
in rural areas. Strokes and heart attacks in particular require
quick access, and 
<?notus-xml column=489?>that is problem for those living in rural areas, especially when the
ambulance service is nothing like as good as it should be.
Although a relatively small number of people in the west of my
constituency depend on Bronglais general hospital, we depend
substantially for specialist services, including obstetrics and
paediatrics, on those in England, in Shropshire. A £38 million
development is going ahead in Telford, which will serve my constituency
of Montgomeryshire. The situation is the same in relation to
orthopaedics and elective care, which are crucial.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010947000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000007">Devolution
affects how the Governments in Westminster and Wales work together.
There has been a tendency, certainly with some Ministers in Wales, to
want to develop a Wales solution, and that influences policy in
Shropshire to the huge detriment of my constituents  in
Montgomeryshire. If the people developing services in Shropshire are
seeking to serve their community of Shropshire, that almost inevitably
points to the middle of it, which is Telford. Although the £38
million development is going ahead at Telford hospital, the area served
is Shropshire and mid-Wales, so Shrewsbury should be the centre. Any
sensible consideration, which looked not at two separate Governments
but at the people they serve, would make investment in Shrewsbury
hospital more likely. That point needs to be made here and in the
National Assembly for Wales.</hs_Para>

second issue, which I have touched on previously, is transport
infrastructure. Transport is largely devolved, but investment in
cross-border issues depends on commitment from both sides of the
border. There are schemes where the Welsh Government are keen to go
ahead and would make the commitment to go ahead, but they require a
commitment from England. When the Welsh Government are making their
assessment of the value of a scheme, they know how important it is to
have access to markets. From an English perspective, there is no access
to markets consideration. Devolution is, therefore, resulting in
schemes that would have gone ahead, because the Welsh Government want
them to, falling with no prospect of going ahead at all. That is not
the way devolution is supposed to work. In relation to cross-border
road schemes, it is causing great disbenefit to my community. I have
mentioned this on a number  of occasions and I will probably do
so on a number of occasions again. I hope that in the next few months,
as we consider the Silk commission, we will have opportunities to
return to the matter.</hs_Para>

third issue is tangential to the onshore wind debate. Mid-Wales and
Shropshire are again linked together by the Mid Wales Connection. I
should say briefly that the Mid Wales Connection takes in north
Shropshire and Montgomeryshire and amounts to between 500 and 600 wind
turbines on top of what is there now—there are probably more in
Montgomeryshire than anywhere else. It is a monster, with about 100
miles of cable, that will completely transform the whole area.

point is how the communities feel. Having a public meeting in
Montgomeryshire is difficult to organise because people have to travel
big distances and make a big effort—they cannot just walk down
the road. Despite that, 1,500 people not only turned up at meetings I
organised, but travelled, in 38 buses, all the way from Montgomeryshire
to Cardiff to emphasise their point. They feel that their opinion has
been completely sidelined. We sometimes read, usually in <I>The
Telegraph</I>, that the Government are listening and that perhaps more
weight will be given to local opinion and that there might be some
change to the way in which planning policy works, but it is not
happening. Rather than promises to secure favourable headlines, we want
something real delivered. The people of mid-Wales and north Shropshire
have a sense of hopelessness and helplessness about how central
Government, both in Cardiff and in Westminster, are responding to the
views of people living in cities and other urban areas by imposing
something on rural areas that they do not want. We have to be very
careful that we do not just look at numbers and the big populations,
and ignore the opinion of rural areas.</hs_Para>

final point I want to touch on relates to farming. There is not a huge
amount in the report on farming, but I want to touch on the impact of
bovine TB on farming communities, which is not properly understood.
This has always been a difficult issue for me. I have a good
understanding of the farming industry, but I have always been involved
in the local Wildlife Trust and understand the implications and
sensitivities. We must, however, have a policy that deals with the
issue. Most of my eight years at the National Assembly for Wales was
spent as Chairman of the agriculture Committee. The position was that
the Welsh Government wished to go ahead with a cull, but the United
Kingdom did not. There was a mistake in introducing the legislation, so
that did not happen. The Minister was removed and a new Government came
in and pursued a vaccination policy, which is a reversal of the
position here. We must consider all the ways of dealing with the issue
to find the most effective and best way of going forward. If we can
recognise that we must deal with the issue in the most effective way,
there will not be so much sensitivity about it.</hs_Para>

would have liked to raise a number of other issues on farming, but I am
conscious of time, so I will just mention how the levy is distributed
for promoting food. The promotion of food in England and Wales depends
on the levy for slaughter. A lot of the livestock in Wales is
slaughtered in England, so the levy is available to the Meat and
Livestock Commission in England, not Wales, so we are probably about
£1 million down and at a huge disadvantage. We should look
seriously at how to introduce a degree of fairness in the system for
distributing the levy so that food promotion can follow where the
animals are farmed and bred, rather than where they are slaughtered. In
my constituency, an awful lot of animals go over the border to
Shropshire to be slaughtered.</hs_Para>

to reinforce the point made by the Secretary of State for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs earlier in the week, it is important for
everybody to eat 
<?notus-xml column=491?>British food wherever possible. I cannot imagine anyone not wanting to
eat Welsh lamb. Why go anywhere else? Why eat anything but British beef
or British dairy products? It seems crazy not to do that. If we want
beer, there are microbreweries dotted all over the country, and there
are two in Montgomeryshire. Why import when we have wonderful stuff at

constituency is a mix of rural, semi-rural and urban. Some choose to
live in the countryside, some go for more space, some were born and
brought up there, but there is a real problem of rural poverty. Some of
the hardest-hit areas are former mining areas, places nobody would ever
have dreamt of building houses had there not been mines there. We have
people from mining families who were born and brought up there, many in
old terraced or social housing, and the difficulty for them is that
costs escalate, it is hard to find work, transport costs are high and
all the local costs, such as buying in the local shop rather than a
supermarket in town, are much higher, yet their incomes are not
comparable to those of the sort of people who can commute, have two
cars and all the rest of it. Rural poverty is a major issue, therefore,

Wales.</hs_Para>

social housing, in the past people were allocated rooms, bedrooms and
homes on the basis of what was available in their village. I am pleased
that the EFRA Committee has identified the bedroom tax as a major
problem for these areas, but I am disappointed in the
Government’s response, which repeats a fallacy peddled by
Ministers from the Department for Work and Pensions: that a person
needs only two or three hours’ work at  the minimum wage
to make up the £15. Worryingly, given that these are DWP
Ministers, this completely misunderstands how housing benefit is
calculated and the idea of clawback. Things such as housing benefit and
tax credits depend on a person’s income, so extra hours do not
simply equal extra income because there is a clawback; they do not get
the extra housing benefit when they do the extra work, so they actually
have to do an awful lot more hours, which obviously is a major problem
for people in rural areas, where sometimes even getting the bus to do
an extra day’s work can be almost counter-productive. Unless
they do six, seven, eight hours’ work, the price of a bus, if
they only do three or four hours or have a split shift, makes it
completely impractical.

some of those areas now have nobody there

the fire station, which I am pleased to say we convinced the fire

campaign to identify people it can train up as retained firefighters.
That is symptomatic of the lack of working-age adults in the community

brings me to the issue of transport out of the villages and how much
more difficult that is for people in rural areas. As more and more
people have acquired cars, it has become even more difficult because
bus services have become less and less viable. If it were not for the
pensioners with their passes, some buses would not have any passengers
on them. That is a major issue we have to consider, particularly when
transport costs make it difficult for people to take up work
opportunities.</hs_Para>

areas face much higher fuel bills—both types of fuel: the fuel
people put into their vehicle, if they have one, and the fuel they use
to heat their home. As hon. Members have said, there is much less
choice in rural areas. If someone is not on mains gas, they cannot
benefit from dual fuel deals, and many areas in my constituency are not
on mains gas and so face either higher oil prices or even higher coal
prices. On liquid petroleum gas, there are real problems with tied
deals, where groups of houses have to order and switch at the same
time, which raises competition issues. How can anyone escape from the
provider they are forced to take on when they move into a property? I
raised this matter with the former Member Chris Huhne and with the
regulator, but it was not entirely sorted out. We need a regulator that
can deal with these off-grid issues, which is something Labour is
committed to doing.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:15:08"></hs_TimeCode>As was
mentioned, Wales also has particularly high electricity
costs—electricity usage in rural areas tends to be higher
because of the lack of gas, and again, a tough new regulator could look
into that and make much sharper recommendations.</hs_Para>

welcome Labour’s decision that the winter fuel allowance should
be paid earlier, and if we get into government, we will certainly
implement that proposal. It is important that people be able to buy
when prices are low in the summer months and prepare for the winter,
but of course, the Government have cut the winter fuel
allowance—we had forgotten that. One of the very early cuts, it
took £100 off the over-80s’ allowance and £50 off
the over-60s’ allowance. It is a significant cut that has
affected many people, particularly in rural areas, over the past few
years, as prices have rocketed.</hs_Para>

wish to repeat my dismay at the abolition of the Agricultural Wages
Board, which was supported by the Farmers Union of Wales because it
provided a framework for settling disputes and enabling farmers to
calculate how much to pay neighbours, friends and
relatives—people it is sometimes difficult to bargain
with—for the work they did. Furthermore, there was its
“standard of accommodation” clause for workers working on
agricultural premises. Especially disappointing have been the
Government’s efforts to prevent Wales from retaining an
equivalent board. Having spent £150,000 going to the Supreme
Court to dispute Wales’ right to pass the byelaw legislation,
they have spent more money this year going to court over the board. All
this could have been easily sorted out through discussions between the
Welsh Government and the Government here and need 
<?notus-xml column=493?>not have cost the taxpayer all that money. It is a real
shame, particularly as it obviously went against
the will of people in Wales.</hs_Para>

turn now to Royal Mail. In my Christmas visit to Royal Mail, it was
interesting to learn that the big rush now takes place in November, not
December, because so many people shop on the internet. The preference
for internet shopping is even higher in rural areas. I was told that
proportionately, more packages were going to rural areas than to urban
areas, because obviously—it all makes sense—if it costs
someone too much to get in the car and drive to the shops, they will be
more tempted to go on the internet and pay the postage costs. But, of
course, those postage costs are also an important issue for rural
businesses, many of which rely on postal services, particularly where
internet access is not as fast as it might be.</hs_Para>

is worrying, therefore, that with the privatisation of Royal Mail, we
might see the erosion of the universal service obligation. Moya Greene
has openly said, “Well, in Canada, a delivery once every two or
three days is sufficient in rural areas.” Given that she is the
head of Royal Mail, we can see the direction of travel, and it is
worrying because it could affect the many rural businesses that depend
on Royal Mail<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:19:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
The other problem is whether Royal Mail will keep its link with the
post office network, because without that link, the network will be
much weakened. While I welcome a recent announcement on safeguarding
several rural post offices in my constituency, others have not
benefited from any safeguard.</hs_Para>

me deal with the specific issue of the derogation of rural fuel duty
and some of the experiences we have had—or, rather, not
had—in Ceredigion in trying to get included in the list of areas
to be considered for it. As the Select Committee report notes, those
who live in a rural area are likely to travel 10,000 miles a year,
whereas those who live in urban areas travel 6,400 miles. That, along
with poor access to public transport, means that our cars are a
necessity, not a luxury. There is simply no other means of getting
around, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:21:57"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Members for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:21:58"></hs_TimeCode>for Ynys
Môn (Albert Owen) both argued: there is simply no alternative. A
single rail line comes into the top of Ceredigion, passing through
beautiful Montgomeryshire and the beautiful parts of my constituency,
ending in Aberystwyth, which is very much the end of the line. There
are no other rail lines across the constituency and we have somewhat
fragmented bus routes. There is no choice other than having a car for
oneself and one’s family, so the cost of fuel has a huge impact
on household expenditure. As the Select Committee report also notes,
average expenditure on transport accounts for 17.7% of total
expenditure for rural residents, compared with 14.5% for urban
residents<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:22:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000030">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:22:47"></hs_TimeCode>

showed that in Ceredigion, people were travelling 540 miles a month
just to get to work. We are not talking about a little trip around the
corner; we can be talking about long distances and round trips of 100
miles a day across large rural areas. That has been recognised in part
by our Government, who have abolished the fuel duty escalator, made
cuts at the pump of 20p a litre—over and above what the previous
Government were planning—during the last three and a half years
and frozen fuel duty, which has been welcomed.</hs_Para>

before, but additional criteria about population density. I was
confident that Ceredigion could be included because it is sparse, with
147 communities scattered across a large area and 600 farming families.
We could meet those criteria. The additional part, however, was that it

response to questions to the Treasury and to Wales Office colleagues,
it has been asserted that the criterion has been directed from Europe.
I remain unclear about its origins. However, if, as the Chancellor
says, we are constrained by European Union rules, I am confident that
our Government will challenge them robustly to encourage the breadth of
the scheme. On the other hand, might this be not so much an EU
instruction as the Treasury’s interpretation of what is more
likely to be successful? If that is the case, I understand it, but it
does not address the many concerns we have about rural areas. I believe
that the criteria being pursued are too tight and too much focused on
proximity to an oil refinery. Ceredigion is an incredibly sparse area.
I have no doubt that the initial criteria used the first time the
Government applied to gain the derogation for the islands in west
Cornwall, the Isles of Scilly, and for  the Scottish islands
were appropriate. I have frequently been to the Scillies, so I
understand the cost of transporting fuel by boat from Penzance over to
the solitary pump in St Mary’s. I understand the criteria used
there, but I hope that in this new round and for future rounds, we can
be much more flexible so that the large tracts of rural England
represented here today, rural parts of Scotland and rural Wales can be
included.</hs_Para>

decide whether it was more worth their while to pay an extra fiver to
get Tesco to deliver their shopping to them, or to pay for petrol so

a farmer who was required to submit his VAT return to HMRC online. Of
course, he had no internet provision, so he rang HMRC and asked whether
he could submit it on paper. HMRC said yes, and he did not expect to

years ago, some of the villagers got together and decided to make the

a group called Furness Community Organising Green Space, or COGS, with

authority, the county council and me; they consulted local residents;
they had plans drawn up; they worked out a budget; and they even
produced a 3D model of what the field would look like eventually. They
encountered some difficulties along the way—there was, for
instance, an obstacle involving land use notifications—but they
stuck at it, and, as a result of their own tenacity and their work with

the other end of my constituency is the village of Bamford, which is in
the Hope valley and is part of the Peak District national park. It is a
truly beautiful village. In Bamford sat an empty pub, the Anglers Rest,
which was put up for sale. Fearing that the pub would be sold to
developers and redeveloped, a group of residents formed the Bamford
Community Society with the aim of securing its future by bringing it
into community ownership. At the time, the post office was looking for
a new home. The BCS saw an opportunity to bring the post office into a
newly operating Anglers Rest and help to make it a viable
proposition<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000051">The
BCS used the Localism Act 2011 to register the pub as an asset of
community value, which gave it time 
<?notus-xml column=498?>to work towards purchasing it from its current owners, Admiral Taverns.
Like COGS, it developed a business plan. It launched a share issue, and
embarked on discussions with the Post Office about the transfer of the
local branch to the newly opened Anglers Rest. I met the group’s
members, looked at their plans, and listened to what they had to say.
It was apparent that a great deal of work and thought had gone into
their business plan, which had been professionally prepared. The share
issue among the villagers raised nearly £200,000, which, along
with some further finance, made the purchase of the pub a
reality.</hs_Para>

duly purchased in the autumn. A few things had to be pulled out of the

be opening in the Anglers Rest soon. This week saw a development that

the last 48 hours between its representative Adrian Wales,
representatives of the BSC and me, considered its position and, despite

some mistakes—adopted a flexible approach. They are dealing with
the community, and they have played their part in making the dream of

available to all, and that is thanks to the community of Furness Vale.

May I add my congratulations to the Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs Committee on its work on this report and the issues
it raises<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:39:42"></hs_TimeCode>? I
cannot deny that I am slightly underwhelmed by the turnout in the
Chamber this afternoon. The manifestos of all the
political parties have always over the past few years stressed
the importance we attach to rural communities and rural voters. When we
have an opportunity to express that support, albeit on a one-line Whip
Thursday, I think we should all reflect on the fact that we mustered a
maximum of 15 Members—I could probably have fitted them into my
office—and at our worst, at the moment, about 11, and at least
50% of the representation has come from Wales, as has been
said<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:40:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:40:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
It is important to have debates such as this, however, because
minorities are important and the fact that the rural community
represents a small voice at times—and a numerically small one
when it comes to elections—is all the more reason we should
treat it with the greatest respect, and with enhanced respect in our
political deliberations in this
Chamber.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:40:49"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

want to touch on a few matters that I have extracted from the report
and which to some extent are treated differently in Wales thanks to the
devolution settlement, but first I want to comment briefly on the
definitions that are tucked away in an appendix towards the back of the
report. The definition of “rural areas” we would have
come up with 20 years ago would have been very different from the
current definition. That is in part down to the fact that there is no
longer an area we can describe as exclusively or truly rural, any more
than we can describe an area of London as exclusively urban. The fact
is that we have a much more dynamic population that spends a lot of its
time, if it possibly can, in other areas. The—almost
geographical—line that used to exist separating city centre from
suburb and suburb from countryside does not really exist any longer and
we need to be very careful not to isolate elements of the community and
describe them as being different from other parts. That contributes to
what can be an unhelpful element of this debate, when people say, for
instance, “Townspeople do not understand us” and some
sort of cultural distinction is drawn between those who live in the
countryside and derive their living from it and those who love and
respect the countryside and wish to visit it from time to time. If
through our loose use of words in this Chamber we create a distinction
between those two valuable contributors to the rural economy, we will
do ourselves harm rather than
good<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:42:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000059">The
first subject I want to discuss is broadband, which all contributors
have mentioned. It is seen as almost essential when people are buying
or renting their house that it has a decent electricity or gas supply,
and estate and letting agents say that one of the first things a client
will now do when walking into a house is look at their mobile phone and
see what the reception is like and ask what the broadband provision is
like, and if it is not up to the standard they expect or require there

role of BT and the broadband roll-out has been mentioned, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:43:20"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen), who is not in his place, rightly
pointed out that the situation is slightly different in Wales. We need
from 
<?notus-xml column=500?>BT, through the relevant Minister, a little clarity about exactly what
criteria BT is applying to its roll-out because that is not immediately
obvious to the average customer and voter. This is not a selfish
request, and there is also the encouraging news that in Wales the
100,000th household has been connected to superfast broadband this
week, so thumbs-up to the Government for having achieved that
milestone. The clarity we require from BT is not a selfish request
because we want to enable those people who may be further down the
priority list and who may not be due superfast roll-out for a number of
years to make sensible decisions in investing in alternative providers,
whether wireless or satellite. At present they feel restricted in doing
that because they do not know where they sit in the list of BT
priorities. A perfectly straightforward and justified commercial
interest is being expressed by businesses across the UK and, I suspect,
especially in Wales: that they should be able to make some sensible
decisions based on BT being a little more open about its criteria. For
BT to cite commercial sensitivities as a reason not to do
that—as I believe it has done—is not a satisfactory
answer because it creates a two-tier society, particularly in Wales,
with those who know they are going to get it and know when they are
going to get it and those who have absolutely no idea and have no idea
how much they can spend on alternative provisions.</hs_Para>

exchanged comments in the Chamber and Westminster Hall about mobile
phones because it does seem ludicrous that in parts of our two
constituencies we seem to be somewhat behind the Alps, Norway, parts of
Africa and, indeed, Kazakhstan in people being able to communicate with
one another via mobiles. Again, this is not about kids being able to
have a laugh by texting each other; it is about sensible, commercial,
contemporary requirements. Indeed, the emergency services are a whole
lot more dependent on decent mobile coverage for providing the
protection we expect from them than they were five or 10 years ago.
Mobile fingerprinting machines will not even work in certain parts of
rural Wales because there is not a mobile signal to support them. This
is not about luxuries, therefore; it is about an everyday essential
commercial requirement for people going about the sorts of businesses
we want and need and providing the services that keep us safe. There
are economic consequences of our lacking the mobile coverage that in
other countries is seen to be absolutely

have been raising for some time the topic of planning and affordable
housing, particularly in the context of the national parks. In a
Westminster Hall debate just before Christmas I raised the problem of
affordable housing provision in my own national park on the basis that
the affordable housing subsidy—a policy that is not universal
across all national parks in the UK, but is certainly adopted by
some—was acting as a deterrent to people developing affordable
housing, rather than encouraging it. I am pleased to say that that has
resulted in an internal review of this policy by Pembrokeshire coast
national park. It accepts that the policy has  not worked as
well as it would like and that there  was a distinction between
rural and urban, and, most encouragingly, this month it is engaging
with all rural stakeholders and interested stakeholders in my area to
see if the policy can be improved so that the landscape can be enhanced
and protected at the same time as kick-starting the currently flagging
affordable housing 
<?notus-xml column=501?>building and provision in the county. The message,
therefore, is a thumbs-up and full marks to Pembrokeshire coast
national park for recognising in the first instance that there was a
problem and, secondly, for doing something about it, not through its
own auspices but by inviting all those in the area with an interest in
this topic to engage in a process. I hope other Members will take some
encouragement from that and perhaps try to persuade their own national
parks to undertake a similar exercise if there is a similar problem,
because that returns influence and power to the communities where it
should be held and where these decisions can have a huge benefit if
decided correctly—or a huge negative impact if
not<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:48:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000063">My
penultimate subject is fuel and fuel costs. Other Members have made
quite a lot of this, but one point has not yet, I think, been
mentioned: the steady decline in the number of filling stations in
rural areas over several years. Slowly but surely where there was once
one five miles away there is now one 10 miles away or even 15 miles
away, and each and every closure not only imposes greater expense and
inconvenience on rural communities, but some other services often go,
too—a shop, or an outlet where people can buy their gas
canisters or whatever. This has been another little difficulty layered
on top of all the other difficulties of living in rural
areas.</hs_Para>

we talk about rural-proofing, we sometimes overlook the fact that
Treasury decisions on fuel duty for independent fuel retailers can have
a disproportionately hard-hitting effect on rural areas. I believe
that, at present, the duty is payable within 28 days of the moment the
fuel leaves the refinery. A small independent fuel retailer in a rural
area will therefore have to fork out a significant amount—80% of
the value of the load—before they have a chance to sell any of
it on to the customer. Consequently, they are uncompetitive. They place
small orders, and their supplies often run out when the weather is bad.
This can contribute to a delicate and fragile situation with regard to
fuel resilience.</hs_Para>

problem could easily be rectified by altering the date by which the
fuel duty became payable. The Treasury would be no worse off, and the
independent fuel retailers in rural areas would be much more
competitive. They could buy more, and they could compete better against
the bigger suppliers. To coin a phrase, everyone would be a winner. I
wonder whether the Minister or anyone else here today could persuade
the Treasury to do that in a way that came as close as possible to
being cost neutral. I suspect that that is a matter for the Department
rather than for those on the Back Benches. Such a change would make a
significant difference to the ability of those independent retailers to
run sustainable businesses and support rural communities.</hs_Para>

are lots of success stories in rural Britain at the moment, even if
some of them are happening despite the Government rather than because

Glen</B> (Salisbury) (Con):</Member> It is a great privilege to be able
to speak in the debate. I represent Salisbury, which I always think of
as a constituency of two halves: one half is a suburban area; the other
is full of rural communities. The two work closely together. I echo the
remarks of my hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen West and South
Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart). He hit the nail on the head when he said
that it is unhelpful to make too clear a distinction between the
interests of rural and urban communities.</hs_Para>

want to focus today on the challenges to rural businesses. Those
businesses in Salisbury and south Wiltshire are growing, and they form
a vibrant and wholly necessary part of the economy, which is now doing
better. The jobs that they provide are also really welcomed by members
of the local community. Those people tell me that the most significant
challenge they face is what the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
Committee report calls a “key barrier to growth” for the
rural economy—namely, the lack of superfast broadband provision.
As other Members have said, it is no longer a luxury but a necessity
for everyday life, and certainly for everyday business
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000072">Significant
challenges relating to flows of information have still not been
overcome. We wholly welcome the substantial investment to ensure that
95% of households will have access to superfast broadband, but there is
a real sense of frustration among those in the most rural parts of my
constituency about when that is going to happen and whether they will
be included. If they will not be included, what alternatives
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000073">I
want to mention the Dun Valley Broadband Group, a well organised and
well motivated group located primarily around the village of Pitton.
Members of the group first approached me more than six months ago, when
they were unsure whether they would fall within the zone or which phase
of the roll-out they would be included in. We have had meetings with
Wiltshire council, which has been excellent in trying to move things
forward 
<?notus-xml column=503?>and pressing BT for more clarity. The maps and the
postcode check-up have been mentioned today, but we have found them
quite inadequate for identifying specific communities. People do not
want general answers about 95% coverage; they want specific information
on whether they will be able to access superfast broadband and when
they will be able to do so.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:56:21"></hs_TimeCode>Those
communities that are unable to access it want to be able to take steps
to move forward with alternatives. This particular group has been
working with Gigaclear, a wholly commercial scheme, and it has been
challenged to reach a certain threshold of
applicants.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:56:42"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

the report states, the biggest challenge faced by smaller companies is
the ability to meet up-front costs.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:56:53"></hs_TimeCode> am also
concerned about the challenge to poorer households that fall outside
the 95%. What will they do if a well motivated group reaches the
threshold for alternative provision that is outside the protection of
the regulator in regard to the escalation of costs in subsequent years?
They will have no option but to sign up and go along with the
alternative provision that the rest of the community has put in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T13:57:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000075">My
hon. Friend the Member for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh) suggested
that we should start by concentrating on the communities with the
greatest eligibility. I am not an expert on these matters, but I would
urge caution with regard to the “spidering out” process.
As I understand it, BT will work out the logical location for hubs,
stations and bases. If any of that were then skewed according to
deviations of speed within those communities, there could be a massive
escalation in costs, which could undermine the end result for the
community.</hs_Para>

information flows should be improved, so that communities can get
organised and find alternatives. It is important that those who are
outside the current intervention areas should have access to a
superfast service, but that must not be at the expense of those who
cannot afford to pay an additional subsidy. If the smaller schemes are
to be commercially viable and accessible to the whole population, we
need to look at how public subsidy can effectively address the initial
costs for small businesses and poorer rural
householders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000077">The
other thing I wish to mention is my concern about the plans to extend
to 95% coverage for superfast broadband by 2017. My local authority is
concerned about not wasting time planning for that when there is a lack
of clarity about whether and when the money will be delivered, and how
it will be delivered. Wiltshire council has invested considerable time
and money in an outstanding programme, but it wants clarity about what
is going to happen. It is keen to extend its existing contract
arrangements with BT so that it can bring more households into the
remit of the roll-out, but it does not want to spend hours of council
time and lots of resources on tendering, and it does not want to spend
months dealing with the state aid issues and so on. We need to ensure
real clarity and that things do not get lost in conversations which
seem to go quiet when we get within 12 months of a general election. We
must be clear about what local authorities can expect until 2017, so
that rural communities in my part of Wiltshire know what is going to
happen.</hs_Para>

is no doubt that local authorities and villages are working hard to
secure superfast broadband. It will be the measure of the
Government’s success or otherwise when going into the next
election. Small businesses will 
<?notus-xml column=504?>not be able to function reliably without it. If they need to transfer
lots of data to clients abroad or in London, there
must be no doubt about the quality of the provision in their rural
business. I welcome the steps that have been taken so far, but I hope
that the Minister will address the point about the resources that will
be available. I hope that he will also address improved information
flows and the point made earlier by

confidence and sensitivities, which prevent a good deal of progress

about, and I am anxious to ensure that we

the Member for High Peak (Andrew

regular farmers forums with the Macclesfield branch of the National
Farmers Union. The work that our farmers do is essential. Despite the
fact that their number has been declining in recent decades, it is
clear that they punch well above their weight in ensuring that our
communities thrive and flourish, and we need to support them. To have a
vibrant future, we need to ensure that these communities are able to
innovate and diversify to seize the opportunities before them. That is
what this debate is about: making sure that we can shape the future, as
that will be vital.</hs_Para>

year, I was able to participate in four fell races. I needed to do that
because the work we do here is not particularly conducive to physical
fitness. I also thought I would do what I could to support local
community events. The Wincle trout run is to be commended, with its 350
participating runners each getting a trout at the end of the
race—so there is an added incentive if anyone wants to
participate. I should also mention the Macclesfield sheep dog trials,
which also has a wonderful fell race. The organisation that runs it is
wonderful and I am proud to be a supporter, although the race is
particularly gruelling. All the events in which I participated brought
home to me the fact that even our traditional village fêtes are
adapting to new trends, and to increased interest in physical and
outdoor activities, and how important physical pursuits are to our
rural communities. I co-chair the all-party group on
mountaineering—I will avoid doing the usual thing of saying that
it is the summit of all APPGs. I draw hon. Members’ attention to
the register of interests for APPGs, and to the benefits of rural
diversification and of getting involved with these vital outdoor
pursuits, be it walking, fell running, climbing,

is a privilege for me to be able to work with these organisations, be
it the Outdoor Industries Association or the British Mountaineering
Council. The economic benefits of these pursuits are clear. The
Ramblers organisation has recently produced evidence to support that,
which says that in 2010 alone £7.2 billion was spent on visiting
the countryside. In England walkers spend about £6
billion a year and thus support 245,000 jobs in the rural community.
The figures are staggering, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:05:19"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs recently reminded the

the contribution made by these outdoor pursuits should not go
unnoticed; it should be encouraged. These pursuits have health and
well-being benefits, not only for me when I participate in the
occasional fell race. It is clear that physical inactivity is one of
the public health challenges faced by this country. It leads to
long-term health conditions; it is estimated that 37,000 premature
deaths result from this lack of activity; and it costs the NHS and the
wider community about £10 billion a year. So real action is
required, and this is a good debate in which to point to
that.</hs_Para>

me give some examples. The Britain on Foot campaign, brought about by
the Outdoor Industries Association, in conjunction with the National

about, is helping to draw attention to the need to get active outdoors.
The GREAT campaign, being taken forward by the Department for Culture,
Media and Sport, VisitBritain and VisitEngland, also helps to draw
attention to our great outdoors, which is a part of our tourism mix.
Sadly, it is under-appreciated by visitors from overseas, as it is
sometimes by visitors from home. We could be supporting a vast array of
other local initiatives, be they, as in my case, the Bollington walking
festival or other such festivals across the country. Walkers are

highlighted the case for the English coastal path. I know that Wales

along it. We in England need to take steps forward to ensure that our

infrastructure in the digital age—broadband. We have to make
sure that it is provided across our communities, including in the rural

hon. Friend the Member for High Peak highlighted the power of rural
communities. I cannot add anything to what he said; he made his speech
incredibly well. The opportunities are about diversification, and
outdoor pursuits are an important part of that. Innovation is critical,
whether it is through encouraging entrepreneurialism among our local
rural businesses or even in public services. The area between Port
Shrigley and Bollington St John’s, for example, is home to a
great federation of small local schools. We must be innovative in the
way that we provide local services in a cost-effective way. The future
must be underpinned by proper infrastructure and proper and adequate
funding that recognises sparsity, which comes back to the points made

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:13:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Thirsk and Malton (Miss McIntosh), for its sixth report on rural
communities. There are 143 pages of recorded evidence—written
and oral—from, among others, the Rural Coalition, the County
Councils Network, BT, the Dispensing Doctors Association, Calor Gas,
the Consumers Association, the Plunkett Foundation and all other groups

has been a good debate, and I want to touch briefly on some of the
contributions. First, the hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton summed up
all the matters raised in the sixth report, which was a real tour de
force, and I will return to some of them in a moment. Interestingly,
her proposal for an annual debate on rural communities received good
feedback from all parts of the House. In fact, there has been a great
deal of support for it in the Chamber today. I am sure that you, Madam
Deputy Speaker, will have noticed that, as will have the Leader of the
House and the Minister. It is certainly something that we would support
in line with other good debates we have on matters such as
fisheries<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:14:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0002.htm#14010947000098">Let
me turn to the contribution of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:14:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Ynys Môn (Albert Owen). I can vouch for the
beauty of his constituency, which he waxed lyrical about. It is second

mentioned the fact that transmission costs of energy are much higher in
rural areas such as north-west Wales. He also talked about off-grid
energy costs. More than 126,000 people in Wales rely on off-grid
energy, and they are not all in areas that we would customarily regard
as peripherally rural. They are often in mining communities such as my
own. I pay tribute to him for championing these off-grid energy issues
for many years.</hs_Para>

other Members, my hon. Friend raised the issue of petrol rebates. He
made the interesting observation that the rebates seem to be going to
those areas that are of a particular colour on the political map of
this country. I am sure that that will change over time with his strong
representations.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Gainsborough (Sir Edward Leigh) spoke well for his
constituents and highlighted the fact that poverty and deprivation can
be hidden behind this idyllic rural image of thatched cottages and
leafy lanes, or even, as he mentioned, hedge-fund millionaires’
mansions. He also talked about the additional costs of living in rural
areas and of accessing services and said that 20% more is spent on
everyday goods than in urban areas. That theme was picked up by other
Members including
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:16:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford), who also mentioned petrol
costs.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Montgomeryshire (Glyn Davies) —we had a
lot of Celts here today from the Celtic fringes, from the south-west of
England, through Wales and elsewhere—talked about the costs of
providing rural services such as health in places like Powys and the
need for good cross-border work on this and on other aspects such as
transport. I certainly subscribe to such a view as my wife works for
the NHS in Powys. It is a very real issue.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman also talked interestingly about a potential
review of the red meat levy and how it is properly allocated around the
regions and nations of the UK. He recognised, though, the good work
that is done centrally. His call on that matter is timely, and

hon. Friend the Member for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) powerfully reminded
us that some rural communities, including my own, were previously at
the heart of the industrial and extractive industries such as steel and
coal. Curiously, they are often missed from these debates on rural
areas. In a fairly short time frame, those areas have been exposed to
all the problems characteristic of rural isolation and peripherality,
so it is good to see them strongly represented today.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend also picked up on the abolition of the Agricultural Wages
Board, which was opposed in Wales not just by Labour but by the
National Farmers Union in Wales, the Federation of Young Farmers and
others, but I suspect that that matter is for another day. She also
touched on the fears over the long-term future of rural post office

hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams) spoke well for his
constituents, but was slightly derogatory about the fact that his area
had not been included in the rural derogation for petrol proposals, and
a few other Members picked up on that, and put in pitches for their
area as well. He also talked about the additional costs of living in
rural areas.</hs_Para>

one has talked specifically about the research that has been done to

comes to speak.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:18:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for High Peak (Andrew Bingham) talked about the power of rural
communities to come together to help and protect each other. It reminds
me of much of the co-operative movement or even, dare I say it, the old
slogan used by Labour and the union movement, which says, “In
unity is strength.”</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire (Simon Hart)
observed that the numbers in the Chamber were not as high as we would
all like. Perhaps they will be in future debates. We may be in few in
number, but we are among the best. He summed up well the false and
dangerous metaphorical wall that we put up around “rural”
issues and communities. In fact, the health and wealth of our cities,
market towns, hamlets or crofts and all points in between are
seamlessly interwoven, a point also made by

hon. Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire mentioned in
closing that 2% had been suggested as the proportion of the electorate
represented by rural MPs. I would challenge that, as it depends on how
we define rurality. As I said earlier, a wide range of rural issues
also affect places with industrial parts. My area is 20 miles from the
M4 corridor and the main south Wales rail network, yet it has issues
with off-grid energy, rurality, isolation and so on.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Salisbury talked about the roll-out of superfast

mentioned the Macclesfield sheep dog trials—not guilty, say I.
The old ones are the best. He talked with some fluency about the
economic impact of the Ramblers, and I declare an interest as president
of the Glamorgan Ramblers and vice-president of Ramblers Cymru. We need
to do more and to see a speedy and resourced roll-out of the England
coastal path. That will be a huge benefit for rural coastal
communities.</hs_Para>

I was preparing for today’s debate over my breakfast, I picked
up my daily breakfast reading. I was surprised by the fact that who
knows what glorious conjunction of the stars had brought about, on the
same day as we were to debate rural communities, the front-page
headline, “Coalition’s legacy could be harm to the
countryside.” I spluttered over my Weetabix. One might expect
such a headline ripping into the coalition’s record from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:21:06"></hs_TimeCode> <I>Morning
Star</I>, or from revolutionary pamphleteers such as <I>The

of the left—a flag-waving, “Red flag” singing,
barricade-storming sentinel of socialism, attacking 
<?notus-xml column=510?>the serried ranks of landed privilege and wealth—but I spluttered
again over my breakfast, this time toast and jam, when I read that it
was inspired by the criticisms of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:21:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

my subscription to <I>Socialist Worker</I>, so taken am I by the
successful attacks on the Government by this new revolutionary cell in
No. 10 and our fourth estate. Rumours are circulating that the hon.

the debate is set against a rural backdrop of tough times, including
for working families. We know that across the UK working families are
struggling because of the impact of the policies being pursued. A
typical family will be £1,600 worse off at the end of the Prime
Minister’s tenure, but research shows that there is an added
impact on rural communities across the country, where wages fell in
real terms by £1,300 between 2010 and 2012. The nature of
rurality means that rural families are spending £2,700 more on
everyday goods than their urban counterparts.</hs_Para>

know that the bedroom tax hits rural households disproportionately
severely, as working families, who are already struggling to find

and to their families, are displaced further and further afield,

ultimately undermining the sustainability of those rural

viability of rural communities is intimately tied up with their ability

looking to make a fleecy purchase after taking up the Energy
Secretary’s advice to wear a jumper to cut down on heating
costs, they all need access to the internet. However, the National

realise I risk sounding a little negative about the Government’s

suggesting some ideas that would help the hard-stretched rural
communities, businesses and households struggling under a prolonged
cost of living crisis. We know that the Government have turned their
back on one proposal that would help many rural households by refusing
to accept a price freeze while the market is reset for the
consumer—we will have to wait for the next election for
that—but they could do something for off-grid energy users in
two ways. First, they could bring off-grid under a regulatory structure
to bring long-term thinking to the sector and give certainty to
consumers and investors that their interests are being looked after.
Secondly, they could bring forward payment of the winter fuel payment
so that vulnerable elderly householders could purchase oil and gas
outside autumn/winter when typical costs can increase by hundreds of
pounds, as I know from experience. The Government could also look at
the lamentable delivery to those same households of the energy company
obligation and green deal installations on energy efficiency. Of
379,297 measures installed before the end of October 2013, how many
have been delivered under the carbon saving community obligation rural

alternative schools. That is why, following a review of the funding

allow local authorities to use a new sparsity factor when allocating

the Government have distributed £20 million to rural transport
authorities in England to support the development of community
transport schemes, which provide services that are vital in many rural
areas. We are funding more than 20 Wheels to Work schemes
through the local sustainable transport fund. Those schemes enable many
young people to access employment and training opportunities. We have
protected the statutory entitlement to concessionary bus travel,
ensuring that older people can maintain greater freedom and
independence. As we stated in the Government response to the EFRA

journeys between cities outside London, however, the overall fastest

Fastest journeys can involve absurd dog-legging through
London—for example, Cambridge to Sheffield, Ipswich to Newcastle
and Swindon to Leicester—and journeys between the 29 key city
regions can involve as many as four changes. Those figures are the
consequence of past investment focused on hub-and-spoke systems based

four of the six biggest cities in England, as well as many significant
towns and other cities, and it is home to more than a quarter of the
UK’s small and medium-sized businesses. Although it is already
an economic powerhouse, it could be so much better with proper
inter-city rail investment. Our forefathers recognised its importance
by building one of the first cross-country motorways, the M62, to link
Hull and Liverpool.
How<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:57:41"></hs_TimeCode> is the rail
service through the region? The answer is, very poor. The 120-mile
journey from Hull to Liverpool takes 30 minutes longer than the
214-mile journey from Hull to London, which means that it is at exactly
half the speed. The vital commercial centres of Leeds and Manchester
are joined by a service that runs at only 46 mph, whereas they both
already have services to London at more than 100
mph.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010947000178">Slow
train times lead to far more people travelling by road, which in turn

corridor, which for some bizarre reason stops at Exeter and does not go
on to the 15th largest city in England. As long as that
continues and we are not part of the strategic national corridor, we
will continue to see poor levels of investment in our routes in
inter-city services. Indeed, I would go further and suggest a real lack
of interest in Whitehall in any area outside that corridor.</hs_Para>

doubt that distance and accessibility impact directly on the way
business costs are assessed and on the logistics of companies. It has
been estimated that for every 100 minutes of travel time from London,
productivity drops by 6%. Tackling that underperformance by supporting
our rail links, inter-city services and connections to the main line
could be hugely beneficial to the wider UK economy. We are, however,
talking a little bit about jam tomorrow. I am sure the Minister will
mention the benefits of electrification, but those will not percolate
down as far as Plymouth—certainly in the immediate
future—partly because of the unresolved issue of the line
between Exeter and Plymouth via Dawlish. Any benefits of
electrification are decades away, and whoever is in power after the
next general election must stop pushing the issue away. That is why we
must ensure—as those on the Labour Front Benches have
insisted—that High Speed 2 is not some open-ended cheque, and
that we keep a lock on how much money goes into it.</hs_Para>

even mentioned resilience and the importance of keeping the rail line
open to rail companies as well as our local economies. Some £178
million was lost when the line was closed last year because of flooding
at Exeter and further down the line, and we had no inter-city service
for some considerable time. I cannot understand why it has been so
difficult to get the head of the Environment Agency and Network Rail to
agree on a plan. We were told that £31 million had been
earmarked for work to ensure the trains could get through, but we now
hear that that has gone down to single figures. What is going on?
Perhaps the Minister will answer that when he responds to the debate.
Is the CEO of the Environment Agency correct when he says that
cuts  will impact on that type of maintenance? In questions to
the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the
hon. Member for South West Devon  
<?notus-xml column=526?>(Mr Streeter) asked a question on that issue. Significant remedial
investment is needed if the far south-west is to have more than a
fair-weather inter-city service.</hs_Para>

key asks for Plymouth and its inter-city connections are: that the
Secretary of State continue to guarantee the money for the resilience
work at Exeter and beyond, and that it is clearly aimed at keeping the
network open and not just blocking it off; that we get an early morning
arrival in Plymouth from London, which was promised by the franchisee
but appears to have drifted off the agenda, like so much else; and that
we benefit from newer rolling stock, rather than the ancient units that
currently serve our railway and undoubtedly slow the service down.
Demand is expected to outstrip capacity on both branch and inter-city
services, so we need confirmation from the Minister today that the
displaced diesel stock following the electrification of the main line
in south Wales will be cascaded on to the main line between London and
Penzance. On that, I will finish and allow other Members to express
their

am one of the many people from Brighton who frequently commute to
London for work, and over the years I have come to know the Brighton
main line very well—better than I ever wanted to know it, if the
truth be known. I know how important the train service is to people in
my constituency and to the whole economy of the south-east. I also
know, unfortunately, how frustrated regular rail users in Brighton are
with the service they
receive<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:16:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010947000214">When
I tweeted about this debate on my way up to London this morning, I was
inundated with responses from fellow passengers who have simply had
enough. One person told me that he has been late to work every day this
year because of the trains. Another pointed out that 44% of Southern
trains operating on the Brighton main line last year were late. Another
tweet described the daily commute as “grim” and rightly
protested that people in Brighton deserve
better<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:17:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010947000215">Concerns
about rail services are raised with me by constituents every week,
perhaps more frequently than any other issue since I was elected in
2010. Concerns over cancellations, delays, overcrowding, cold and dirty
trains and a lack of information feature most prominently. Last
year’s Which? survey confirmed that rail passengers in the
south-east have the lowest customer satisfaction in the whole of the
UK. First Capital Connect, which operates on the Brighton main line,
finished bottom of the pile with a 40% satisfaction rating. The
understandable anger among commuters is exacerbated by increases in
rail fares, which went up again last week. As one constituent put it to
me, people simply do not feel that they are getting value for their
money. That is backed up by the 2013 national passenger survey, which
revealed that 
<?notus-xml column=527?>only 32% of First Capital Connect customers and 36% of Southern
customers feel that they get value for money for
the cost of their ticket. That is hardly surprising when only about 40%
of customers feel that they are likely to get a
seat<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:18:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010947000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010947000216">Clearly,
there are serious problems that need to be addressed. At their root is
the problem of capacity. The huge demands on the line present
challenges for Network Rail and the train companies, and their current
failure to meet them is having a terrible effect on passengers.
Projected employment growth along the main line between Brighton,
Crawley, Gatwick and London means that demands on the line are only
going to increase. A report from WSP group last year revealed how
serious the situation could become. It concluded that the capacity
problem on the Brighton main line would reach critical levels within
the next 20 years and prevent rail services from operating efficiently,
but none of the people who use the service today would say it will take
20 years to reach critical levels; they would say it is operating
inefficiently as we speak.</hs_Para>

number of solutions have been proposed, all of which would require
significant investment as a matter of urgency. The WSP report proposed
an upgrade of the current line to allow more trains to more
destinations and reduce journey times. Another option, which I have
thrown my weight behind, is the Brighton main line 2 proposal. I am
happy to work with my Brighton colleague,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:20:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), if it means that we can make
it a reality. It would provide a new line between Brighton and the

avoiding the bottleneck that is Croydon, which currently causes many of
the problems.

are clearly the major mode of land travel for the long-term future.
Anyone who tries to drive by car to and from London these days has a
problem, despite some improvements in motorway traffic. It is the
railways that will provide the transport of the future. Passenger
numbers are increasing massively in spite of privatisation and higher
fares because rail travel is the only practicable way to get to and
from work. I speak as a 45-year rail commuter on Thameslink and its
predecessors from Luton. I see every day the problems on the other side
of London—on the same line that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:23:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Kemptown (Simon Kirby) mentioned. Fortunately, I live far
enough out to get a seat most days, but by the time we get to St Albans
passengers have to stand. Indeed, yesterday, there simply was not
enough space on the train and many passengers were left on the

are severe difficulties on those commuter routes, but we are talking
today about inter-city rail. Forty years ago, I was responsible for
transport policy at the TUC. In those days, railways were seen to be in
decline and people lauded the car as the future. Even then, I
passionately believed that railways were the future and that we had to
preserve what we had. Fortunately, we hung on to just enough to make it
credible, and we still have the great Victorian-built lines providing
city centre to city centre travel, which is so valuable. The
convenience of being able to get on a train in a city centre and be
taken directly to another city centre is an enormous
advantage.</hs_Para>

want to focus today on a particular scheme. I have mentioned it before,
but I want to re-emphasise its importance. I believe it would be a
major advance to upgrade the Birmingham, Snow Hill to London line,
which passes through Solihull, Leamington Spa, Banbury and other towns,
on which only a handful of trains currently run each day to and from
Marylebone. The line also runs directly to Paddington—a much
more useful London terminus that links directly with Crossrail and thus
to the City. Snow Hill is in the centre of Birmingham and easily
accessible to the business district.</hs_Para>

is, however, a much more compelling and exciting possibility for this
route. If it were to be electrified, a simple link to Crossrail at Old
Oak Common would provide direct passenger services between the centre
of Birmingham and the City of London and, indeed, Canary Wharf.
Business travellers would have available direct travel from city centre
to city centre with no changes required, thus saving time and
inconvenience. But there is more: the electrified Snow Hill to London
line could also branch off at Greenford to join Crossrail going west,
thus providing a direct service from Birmingham city centre to
Heathrow. The electrification of that line and those two links with
Crossrail would together cost no more than £500

suffers badly as a result of its lack of such connections. There was a

Cleethorpes and travel to other major cities such as Leeds, Birmingham

inconvenient and add to journey times. Let me give a couple of
examples. Last autumn, I attended the annual dinner of the Grimsby and
Immingham Chamber of Commerce and Shipping. One of the guests was the
Finnish Ambassador, who expressed his surprise at how long it had taken
him to travel to Grimsby from London. Another example can be found in
an article in <I>The Sunday Times </I>on 29 December. The journalist A.

To give an historical perspective, until 1970 there were two direct

east Lincolnshire line through Louth, Boston and Spalding through to
Peterborough and on to the main line. I remember travelling on the last
service train on 4 October 1970. The service fell at long last after a

some decisions are still going the wrong way. For example, the Scottish

connecting Fife and Edinburgh, without any new rail connection. That is
a missed opportunity. We had an opportunity to put in some sort of
double-decker bridge; there are ways to build both road and rail
together, if we did indeed want more road capacity. We are going to
regret this decision in the not-so-distant future. The building has
started, so the bridge is, unfortunately, going to go ahead, but I
think that within months of it opening the call will be, “What
on earth did you do that for when the congestion in the area and the
car drive into the city are going to get worse and the rail link would
have been a fantastic advantage?” Of course, we do have a rail
bridge, of considerable antiquity. It is an iconic piece of rail

wish to make some brief remarks on High Speed 2 and public investment
in inter-city rail generally. There are different views across the
House on HS2, but those of us who support it must deal with the danger
of a perception that it will not have any benefits for the rest of the
network. HS2 will enhance capacity on other key routes: trains will
continue on the classic network to serve other destinations; space will
be freed up for services to smaller towns and cities; and, providing
high-speed platforms are properly integrated into existing stations,
people across the country will have access to high-speed trains. We
need that form of travel, in both directions. I understand the fear
about the pull to the south-east, but that pull is happening in any
case, for all sorts of other reasons, not least the lack of employment
in the north. We need to address that, but not grasping the nettle is
the wrong way to go.</hs_Para>

from 40 or 50 years ago might well have thought that people would not
need to travel now because they would be able to talk to each other by
all sorts of new mechanisms, and indeed they can. I used to tease my
husband, who works in IT, in the academic community, which has always
been quite far ahead on things such as networking, by asking him why he
needed to travel to conferences and to London because he could do
everything by video conferencing. I asked why on earth he was going yet
again. Of course, as I pointed out to him when I thought about it,
people cannot have conference dinners by video conferencing. That is
not an entirely facetious point to make, because, as we all know from
our party conferences, when people meet at events what goes on outwith
the main setting in terms of networking, catching up with people and
having those debates and conversations is hugely important. Human
communication has not been supplanted by all the technology at our
fingertips<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:48:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

quiet coaches. When my father used to complain about people talking on

fusspot. However, I have to say that although it is good to have some
sort of business interaction on the train, it would be nice not to have
it right in my ear when I am trying to work. Interestingly, on the east
coast main line, the quiet coaches are now the most popular and most
booked up of all the coaches. That suggests that I am not in a minority

Gilmore:</Member></B> I suspect that the quiet coach operates to a
large extent as a business class. Perhaps operators should consider
expanding the number of those coaches. Many people want to use that
time on the train—whether 
<?notus-xml column=535?>it is two hours, three hours or more—productively, even if they
are only recharging their batteries and reading a book or whatever. If
we are serious about the environmental advantages
of rail over air, we need to make that journey as
productive and as comfortable as we can, and also to speed it up. The
big advantage of HS2 in Scotland would be a cut in journey times, even
without the high speed rails reaching us. The city centre to city
centre advantage of HS2 is huge, and it works both ways. For example,
11% of employment in Edinburgh, even after the recession, is in the
financial service sector. The links from Edinburgh to other financial
centres are important. If we are to continue to be the headquarters of
some very important financial institutions, rather than a sub-office of
somewhere else, it is just as important that people can come to us as
it is that we can go to

Gilmore:</Member></B> My understanding is that when phase 2
is in place, we could save a full hour—perhaps slightly
more—of the journey time. As we are talking about a long time
scale, I am not averse in any way to looking at ways of improving the
speed on existing rails. One thing East Coast has done, which is
helpful, is introduce a train that leaves Edinburgh early in the
morning and arrives in London at a time that allows people to attend
meetings. It does that by having fewer stops, so there is always a
trade off. By only stopping at Newcastle and then coming straight
through, it has shaved off time. The only downside is that the train
departs very early in the morning. We are privileged here in the House
of Commons. As we go through until 10 pm on a Monday night, we do not
start work at 10 am, which would be difficult.</hs_Para>

aside the whole HS2 debate, we welcome the fact that intercity lines in
other parts of the country are receiving significant public investment
for electrification, new rolling stock and so forth. Of course, it is
important to emphasise that all that investment is public and coming
from the taxpayer. That fact was reinforced last month when the Office
for National Statistics announced that it would reclassify Network Rail
as a central Government body from September. That is an acknowledgement
that it is not outwith the Government.</hs_Para>

of the promise of privatisation was that it would generate investment,
but it has not done so. We must be realistic about that. What about the
level of private investment in other inter-city routes following the
Government’s decision to prioritise the franchise competition
for the east coast? I am sure that Members will remember that under the
Government’s initial franchising timetable, a new contract for
the west coast main line was due to start in October 2012, with Great
Western starting in April 2013 and east coast in December
2013.</hs_Para>

the debacle of the west coast bidding process, a new timetable was
announced last March. The east coast main line, which was previously
last in the queue of those big franchises, was brought forward so that
it 
<?notus-xml column=536?>would be let before April 2015. As the Government accepted the
recommendations of the reports produced after what happened with west
coast that only one major franchise should be dealt with at a time,
that was only made possible by giving the current operator of the west
coast main line—Virgin—a four-and-a-half-year franchise
extension to April 2017. The operator of the Great Western line, First,
was given a two-and-a-half year extension to September 2015. That is 77
months of extensions between the two operators.</hs_Para>

who prioritised the east coast franchise and justified it by referring
to the Brown review are presumably reiterating their belief that
competition in the bidding process should drive private investment.
Although franchise competition might achieve that, franchise extensions
clearly do not. The Government have lost any bargaining chip they had
in the process. Having made that set of decisions, they had no option
but to negotiate with the existing operators. The only bargaining chip
Ministers could use would be to threaten to call in East Coast’s
parent company, Directly Operated Railways. The operators know the
Government’s reluctance to do that and the very fact that they
want to extract the east coast franchise from DOR shows that, quid pro
quo, they would not want to put the other routes into DOR’s
hands. That means that competition is effectively
absent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000039">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:57:16"></hs_TimeCode>
companies have no incentive to invest during the remaining time for
which they are operating the routes and have every incentive to demand
significant subsidies. The extensions are likely to cost us, the
taxpayers, dearly. In 2011-12, Virgin paid the Department a premium of
£165 million and First Great Western paid £110 million.
Will the Minister confirm that following the agreement of the
extensions, payments of such an order are unlikely to be made? Perhaps
he could confirm what sort of payments he anticipates. Will the
Minister also confirm that apart from the roll-out of wi-fi on First
Great Western, which we would have expected from any operator, the two
extensions offer no improvement for passengers?</hs_Para>

38% of people who work in our city work in the public sector, so there
is a strong wish to get primary investment into the place in order to
build on that. We need to make sure that the city deal that I hope is
about to come to fruition is a success, because that will mean that in
return for some money being paid to clear up and decontaminate the
dockyard, 10,000 new jobs could be created at the marine energy park,

is a low-skills and low-wage economy. In that sense, it is very similar
to Portsmouth and places such as Gravesend and Chatham, where
unfortunately there has been too much dependency on the public sector,
which has always wanted to make sure that it gets all the bright boys
and girls to go and work for it, especially in places such as the
dockyard. If we are to rebalance our economy, we need to make sure that
we not only have a better skills base but try to increase private
sector wages.</hs_Para>

desperately need better transport links. The really big issue for
Plymouth and the west country is that every time it rains, everybody
holds their breath, because we do not know whether there will be enough
resilience to allow us to continue to travel from Plymouth up to London
following any damage caused by the storms that take place. I urge my
hon. Friend to consider an alternative line going north through
Tavistock, because that would be very helpful should, at any stage, the
Dawlish route fall to pieces. Last year, landslips caused very big
problems on the line. Unfortunately, we have also lost our airport. I
am afraid that
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:07:22"></hs_TimeCode> is
therefore a sense in Plymouth that we are somewhat isolated from the
rest of the country. Others have been campaigning to try to get Newquay
involved. There is great concern about this, and 37,000 people in

than the trains, we are dependent on our roads as the only way to get
in and out of the peninsula and into Plymouth. I thank my hon. Friend
for his work in ensuring that there will be a case study on the
dualling of the A303, which will be incredibly important. During the
past two or three weeks when I have been going to and from Plymouth, I
have somewhat aquaplaned my 
<?notus-xml column=539?>way down the M4, M5 and bits of the A38, and I  have found that
incredibly worrying. Dualling the A303 will be just one activity
whereby we end up with good transport links, and I am therefore
grateful that my hon. Friend has been able to press for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>. We also need

are several little things that I would like to ask for. I have already
called for electrification of our line, and I thank the Government for
sorting out the junctions at Reading, because that will certainly help,
but there are several other things as well.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>, we need
more three-hour train journeys between Plymouth and London, as well as
better links to Manchester and other parts of the country, including
the north, the north-east and the north-west. Secondly, we need to get
trains into Plymouth from London before 11.17 am, as is currently the
case. If I were a business man seeking to do some work, I would want to
make sure that I arrived in Plymouth at  9 am, rather than
11.15. That is incredibly
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000058">Thirdly,
I am delighted that progress is being made on getting free wi-fi on our
railway line. We also need to make sure that people who catch a train
can be certain that not only will they sit on it for three rather than
seven hours—which is what I am campaigning for—but that
it will actually go through. It is incredibly important for there to be
resilience in the
network<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:10:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000059">Another
small point is that the Environment Agency proposed at one stage that,
if there was going to be bad flooding, it would cut off the line at
Exeter, which would have created real problems for those of us further
west. I hope the Government will address that important
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:10:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000060">We
also need to make sure that the travelling public in Plymouth are given
certainty. Given that 90% of the Devon and Cornwall MPs are members of
the coalition parties, this is a real opportunity for the Government to
demonstrate that we are serious about delivering better infrastructure
in the
south-west<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000061">I
want to set my hon. Friend the Minister a very small challenge. In
2020, Plymouth will commemorate the Mayflower. The founding fathers
left Plymouth to find America; I think it was called the American
colonies in those days. This is important because we will potentially
get a flood of tourists from America. I and others have been pressing
for the G8 to be held in Plymouth. It would be brilliant if we could
get the President of America to visit the homeland of civilised
activity in America. I am fully aware that President Obama will not be
in office then, but his successor will be very
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000062">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:11:58"></hs_TimeCode>
ask my hon. Friend the Minister to give me a commitment. First, would
he be willing to meet me and the other Plymouth Members of Parliament
to discuss how we can deliver a more resilient and better train
service? Secondly, if we deliver a proper transport infrastructure by
2020—I wish to carry on being here for much longer than

huge amount of money and, as has been said, the cost just went up again

amount<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:13:42"></hs_TimeCode>. What do

Brighton. The connection between the two cities is critical to my
constituents and we do not want to wait for the crumbs from the table.
Many Members have said that this is not a debate about HS2 and it
certainly is not, but I think we should remind ourselves of the amount
of money that can be found when the political will is there to invest
in our rail infrastructure. I would far rather that that money was
invested in the general rail systems on which so many of our
constituents depend, rather than what I see as pretty much a massively

well as talking about the specific needs of Brighton, including for a

country’s broader rail system. I believe that it is failing us,
which is unforgivable in the sense that there is an alternative to the
overcrowded, unreliable, overpriced and fragmented private services
that we have to put up with. We could have an integrated, publicly
owned and run railway that does not waste money on profit, and there is
a model for doing that gradually and

the standard mantra that privatisation saves money, the cost to the
public purse of running the railways has risen by a factor of between
two and three since they were sold off. The report “Rebuilding
Rail” from the Transport for Quality of Life group makes clear
the key reasons for that increase, which include high interest payments
to keep Network Rail’s debts off the Government balance
sheet—the Government have recently been made to put those debts
on the books—as well as debt write-offs, costs arising from the
fragmentation of the rail system into many organisations, profit

dividend payments to private

only way to sort out that mess and waste, as well as the rising fares,
overcrowding and the rest is for the state to take back control of the

Railways Bill. I hope that the official Opposition will make clear in
their response whether they might back that Bill. If we want to improve
our inter-city services, we have to nail the myth that buying back
assets that have been sold off would be too expensive. The step-by-step
approach in my Bill would allow the assets of the railways to be
reacquired for the public at minimal cost, with substantial ongoing

The east coast main line was brought back into public hands because of
market failure, but it is the UK’s most successful rail

franchises, given the lack of investment that went in earlier. My
position stands strongly and I am backed up by independent regulators

others<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:21:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000081">If
the Government really want to make savings and to improve our transport
network for everyone, they should recognise that privatisation has
failed and bring railways back into public ownership as the franchises
expire. According to calculations in the “Rebuilding
Rail” report, reuniting the railways under public ownership
could save more than £1 billion a year of taxpayers’
money. To put that figure in context, if all unnecessary costs were
eliminated and the resulting savings were used entirely to reduce
fares—I am not saying that that would necessarily be the best
thing, but it gives one a sense of what we are talking about—it
would equate to across the board cuts of 18%. Fares that are price
regulated because of their social importance could be cut substantially
more<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:21:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0003.htm#14010951000082">Under
public ownership, all the public money that is invested in the railways
could be used to deliver a better service for passengers, while also
achieving wider social and environmental goals, rather than to line the
pockets of private shareholders. Train travel could once again be a
pleasure and something to be proud of. That is the kind of bright
future that I want for our railways. I urge Ministers to wake up to the
potential of public investment in our inter-city infrastructure and to
look at the evidence clearly and objectively, rather than
cherry-picking the figures, as I fear the Minister has done this

improving signalling in the south-west. Up to £15 million needs
to be spent before 2017, which Cornwall council and the local transport
board are keen to co-fund. That will improve capacity on the line by
creating the prospect of a half-hourly main line service, improving
journey times, and helping the route absorb the predicted increase in
passenger numbers. I also put on record my support for the proposed
Traincare centre in Penzance, which is a £14 million investment

conclude with a couple of parochial points that I hope the Minister and
I can correspond on in the future. There is a real need for
improvements to St Austell station as there is currently no waiting
room on the up platform, and no disabled access between the up and down
platforms. The Minister’s predecessor and I were in
correspondence about additional Government funding to make those
renovations. The funding has been forthcoming but the project has not
yet been delivered, so I hope the Minister will be able to return to
his Department tomorrow and kick the necessary people into ensuring
that the project stays on time and—excuse the pun—on
track. People in Newquay value the fact that over the summer months a
direct Newquay to other cities service comes through the branch line
into Newquay, providing much relief for local traffic, particularly on
the A30. That service needs to be maintained.</hs_Para>

in recent years the south-west has fallen behind other parts of the
country in terms of rail infrastructure. The Government have taken
action through the extension of the franchise to encourage investment.
I welcome much of that, but we continue to need a concerted long-term
approach to ensure that the entire region—Cornwall, Devon and
indeed the rest of south-west England—benefits from what our
rail services could, and should,

After ending the failed Railtrack experiment and establishing a tough
new regulator, our railways became the safest major European network by
2010. There was a major programme of investment in rolling stock. More
than 5,000 new vehicles were ordered between 1997 and 2006 alone, both
to replace older trains and to allow for an expansion of services. The
number of long distance passengers, and the services run to accommodate
them, doubled since the mid-1990s, and with that growth came new
pressures on our existing lines. We are now accommodating the same
number of passengers as we did in the 1920s, but on a network that is
less than half the size.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:37:42"></hs_TimeCode> is why the
previous Government committed to a number of important projects to
improve capacity and overall performance of the network, including the
electrification of the Great Western main line to Swansea and key lines

replace the ageing rolling stock on the Great Western and east coast
main lines.</hs_Para>

of the Great Western main line, which has come up several times today,

electrification to Newbury was announced in November that year, but the

2011. Ministers said then that the line to Swansea would not be
electrified, and it was not until they faced further pressure that,
over a year later, they agreed that the route to Swansea would be

commercial performance speaks for itself. By February 2015, it will

it has invested every penny of its profits—some £48
million—back into the service, but under the Government’s

Will the Minister tell us how many private operators have announced a

Government have allowed train operating companies to raise prices by up
to 5%—more than double the rate of inflation—and the
average season ticket is now 20% more expensive than it was in 2010. So
at a time when passengers are facing a cost-of-living crisis, why are

for what was said by the hon. Member for Nottingham South (Lilian
Greenwood), <hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:50:03"></hs_TimeCode>let
us have some honesty in this debate. When Labour was in office it
crashed the economy, and gas and council tax bills doubled. Had her
party been in office today, the average fare would have risen by 11%
rather than 3.1%. Moreover, in 13 years, we saw just 9 miles of
electrification. Just as we are dealing with the economic mess that was
left behind by the last Government, we are determined to deal with the
massive infrastructure deficit that we inherited.

As a result of the tough decisions that we made in order to get the
public finance mess that we inherited under control, we have been able

modernisation since the Victorian era. That will mean faster journeys,
more seats, improved access to stations, better freight links, and a

environmentally sustainable, support growth and deliver benefits for
both passengers and freight

the heart of the growth to which I have referred, and at the heart of
today’s debate, are the historic inter-city routes, which
provide a vital link between the towns and cities of the country. The
impact of those routes is clearly significant: they provide links for
communities, businesses and freight, and drive the country’s
economy. They are important because they do exactly what a railway
should do. They serve local communities, they serve people, and they
serve markets. They move people to jobs, connect industry with its
markets and suppliers, and connect regions with one another. The high
capacity and reliability of inter-city networks is

was pointed out by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T16:53:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Redcar, it is easy to think of inter-city services as merely
connecting one end of a route to the other, but it is important to
recognise the importance of intermediate stops and the rail networks
that spread out from them. They provide the inter-regional and
intra-regional connectivity that allows us to keep the country moving.
Good inter-city rail services make it possible to live in one place and
work in another, or to live in one place and socialise in another. They
open up opportunities for employment throughout the country. We must
therefore continue to invest in increasing, extending and enhancing
services that are already improving rapidly during the current period
of investment.</hs_Para>

many Members said, the inter-city network is all too often seen only in
terms of connections to London. It must not be so. It is a driver of
change in the economic geography of the country, decreasing journey
times and improving links between all our nation’s major cities
and regions, providing agglomeration benefits for business, increasing
productivity and, importantly, providing access to new markets. The
major cities of the north—Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds and
Sheffield—will soon benefit from the huge investment in the
northern hub, a transformative package of rail enhancements radiating
from
Manchester.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0004.htm#14010951000146">Investment
needs to flow not only from the Government and Network Rail. We must
continue to find ways to adapt our contracts and contacts with the
private sector to ensure that we work in partnership with them,
allowing 
<?notus-xml column=552?>them to bring real innovation through their own investments in projects
that will genuinely benefit their passengers. The west coast main line
is a great example of successful inter-city investment. Working in
partnership with Network Rail, over £9 billion has been spent to
modernise the route and improve journey times from 2008. That
investment has been so successful that in order to meet the increased
demands and expectations of passengers, further investment on the
franchise has been necessary. Some 28,000 more seats per day were
provided on the line by 106 new Pendolino carriages procured when the
direct award was negotiated with Virgin at the end of 2012. To those
who say no benefits come from direct awards, I say I suspect that the
passengers who fill those 28,000 extra seats may well feel there is
some benefit.</hs_Para>

population and economic activity in the west, east midlands and
Yorkshire with the south of England. It will complete the full
electrification of the midland main line out of London St
Pancras and provide electrification of the lines from Nuneaton

will provide faster, more reliable services on many important strategic
routes, and not just routes into London. This is massive investment

great news for British manufacturing, creating more jobs for the area

on the NHS Choices website and will be freely available to the public.
We also expect regular updates to demonstrate how the trust is
progressing. I believe that progress will be posted against that plan
in a transparent way as the period for improvement progresses. The TDA
will keep close to the trust as it works to make the necessary
improvements and will hold board-to-board meetings with the trust. It
has also arranged to buddy-up and provide support, as appropriate, with
a high-performing foundation trust. Special measures are designed to
produce results quickly. The trust will have one year to improve
sufficiently, as judged by the chief inspector of hospitals, in order
to exit special
measures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0004.htm#14010951000191">As
the hon. Gentleman said, the safety of A and E departments is very
important. The trust has been subject to an external clinical review of
the safety of its A and E services commissioned by the local clinical
commissioning groups and undertaken by the London Clinical Senate. I
understand that this was in response to a request from local CCGs
following concerns raised about potentially unsafe levels of medical
staffing within the A and E units, as we have discussed. The TDA has
confirmed to me that this review, which published interim findings in
September 2013, concluded that neither the A and E at King George
hospital nor the A and E at Queen’s hospital was unsafe, but it
made a number of recommendations to improve the service. It has also
been made clear to me that the A and E review was very much independent
of the chief inspector of hospitals’ inspections at the trust
and the TDA’s decision to put the trust into special
measures<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T17:25:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010951000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/debtext/140109-0004.htm#14010951000192">Let
me touch on some of the support that has been put in for A and E. We
have provided further support  to the trust through the funds
available to respond to winter pressures. The local health economy in
the hon. Gentleman’s area has received about £7 million,
while the trust itself has received £3 million. Some £4
million 
<?notus-xml column=560?>has been earmarked for A and E recruitment, and another £4
million was allocated throughout the local health economy by the urgent
care working group responsible for the area. That money was allocated
based on clinical need and went to a range of organisations, including
the local mental health trust, the London ambulance service, and the
local authority.</hs_Para>

taking longer-term action with regard to reducing demand at A and Es.
Some of that falls within my own portfolio of public health in seeing
what health and wellbeing boards can do to reduce demand as regards
people going to A and E when that is not the appropriate place for them
to be. Of course, the extension of GPs’ opening hours through
new contractual arrangements is highly relevant in a population that
is, as the hon. Gentleman described, to a large extent young, highly
mobile, highly diverse, and often working in London’s 24-hour

both sides of the House who have expressed concern about the situation
for some time should continue to engage with the trust at every
opportunity—clearly, there have sometimes been challenges in the

be tackled by the local NHS and all the partners—local

Louise Ellman</B> (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> It is a
pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Ms Dorries. I am
pleased to have this opportunity to debate the Select Committee on
Transport report, “Access to Transport for Disabled
People”, which we published in September last year. The topic
was suggested to us by members of the public. It is a vital issue in
relation to equality of opportunity for disabled people and their
ability to access employment, education and health and social
amenities, for example. Without appropriate transport, that is not
possible, and people may suffer
isolation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000010">Our
report is wide-ranging. It identifies problems such as the availability
of information on planning disabled-friendly journeys, the physical
accessibility of transport, spaces for wheelchairs on buses and the
training of transport staff, and stresses the importance of
interdepartmental working.</hs_Para>

11.5 million disabled people in the UK, one fifth of whom report
difficulty with transport. The number of disabled people will grow as
the population ages, and most people will face some type of disability
at some time in their lives. We started our inquiry in the aftermath of
the successful Olympic and Paralympic games and as the Government
published their accessibility action plan, which contained a number of
encouraging proposals for improvement. However, a year after the
Paralympics, we were concerned that some of its schemes were falling by

the opportunity to travel on public transport in my constituency and

concerned that some of the schemes in the Government’s plan were
falling by the wayside. For example, the Department planned to review
the 2005 inclusive mobility guidance for pedestrian and transport
infrastructure to take account of changes in design and 
<?notus-xml column=152?>the lessons learned from the transport provided during the Paralympics.
The issue is important, as was shown earlier this week when the
Committee viewed a film made by Sarah Gayton of the Sea of Change
campaign about the problem that shared space presents for many disabled
people. It requires urgent attention. Can the Minister tell us when the
review of the 2005 provisions will take
place?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000015">In
relation to rail, the response to our report was encouraging in some
respects. The Office of Rail Regulation has now taken over the
monitoring and enforcement of train operators’ disabled
people’s protection policies. The Government told us that the
ORR will raise awareness of existing provisions. One prime candidate
for action must be making known more widely the requirement for an
operator responsible for an inaccessible station to provide a free
accessible taxi for a passenger to the nearest accessible station. I
wonder how many people are aware of that right. If a greater number
made use of it, train operators might invest more in making stations
disabled-friendly. Can the Minister give us any information about how
the ORR is progressing with that important work?</hs_Para>

important issue of staff availability at stations, against the
background of anticipated ticket office closures and general concerns
about possible reductions in staffing on trains. The Government
responded that future changes to ticket office opening hours should
mean no overall reduction in—and, in some cases, an improvement
to—the services provided to disabled passengers. It was good to
read that, but we need a clear explanation from the Government of
exactly what that means and how it will be carried out. The information
from the Department argues that the service provided by staff in future
on the station concourse will be an improvement on that offered by
those in ticket offices. Will the Minister clarify what that means? Is
it really the case that any change in ticket office staff will not
reduce the overall level of trained staff at the station? The issue is
important, and it is creating a lot of anxiety among travellers,
particularly disabled people, but also many other members of the public
with safety issues.</hs_Para>

concerns in our report about the requirement to book ahead to receive
assistance when travelling by train. I was pleased to receive a letter
following our inquiry from the Association of Train Operating Companies
stating that ATOC would produce clearer guidance for disabled
travellers booking assistance. It also stated that in London, ATOC is
identifying point-to-point routes where staff are available to provide
assistance for disabled people who want to turn up and go, rather than
pre-booking help. I welcome that initiative, but I want to know more
about it, including how it will work in London and how many routes will
be available in that way, so that people need not book ahead. I would
also like to know what will happen outside London. Is this a pilot
scheme that will start in London and then be extended? I would be

Anne Begg</B> (Aberdeen South) (Lab):</Member> I apologise for being
late, Madam Chairman, but the lift was not working, which happens all
too frequently in transport. Did the Select Committee take evidence
from people who do not book ahead with train companies, but discover
that they sometimes get a better service than 
<?notus-xml column=153?>those who do? My experience is that very often booking ahead does not
ensure that help is in place, but a lot of the train companies are much
better these days if I just turn up. That suggests that it can be done
on an arrive-and-help basis, rather than requiring booking
ahead.</hs_Para>

They have all referred to practical examples of difficulties that occur

journey in Liverpool. They showed me how important it is to receive
information, at the right time, about the numbers of the buses that are
operating, the routes being run and, indeed, where the buses have
stopped. It was clear that the lack of practical information deters
many people from travelling, including people with sight impairments,
learning difficulties or mental health problems, and undermines
people’s confidence to undertake journeys and lead independent
lives. Drivers play an important part in providing information, so it
is important that they are given disability awareness training so that
they have the confidence to do so. I cannot emphasise too much that
training should be adequate, available and compulsory.</hs_Para>

People who use buses in London soon get to know that audio-visual

benefit as fully as London does from those systems. It is not just
blind and partially sighted people who benefit, but tourists, visitors

improvements to transport for disabled people are devised and

journey with a young woman with learning difficulties and was shown a
travel training scheme. These are local schemes that aim to support
disabled people who might otherwise rely on door-to-door transport. A
successful scheme can provide the disabled person with more
independence and reduce the cost of door-to-door services for the local
authority. Will the Minister offer us an assurance that travel training
schemes will be supported by the Government, at least with their
initial set-up
costs?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000038">I
want to raise one more important issue, concerning the ability of
disabled people to claim their rights. The Equality Act 2010 is a piece
of civil law. In practice, making sure that transport operators comply
with Government requirements for equal access to transport has too
often required individuals to pursue civil court actions. Disabled
users of transport are rarely wealthy enough to pay the legal fees of
their solicitors and risk funding those of the transport operator
should they lose their case. Most challenges to transport operators
under the Equality Act are undertaken as pro bono work by solicitors,
who take out insurance to cover the costs if the case is lost. However,
the civil justice reforms enacted last year will change that. As a
result, cases might not be pursued and transport operators might not
believe that breaches will be challenged in court.  
<?notus-xml column=156?>Is the Minister aware of these concerns, and will he raise
them with colleagues in other Departments? Does he have any suggestions
for mediation that could prevent legal action?</hs_Para>

have given is not exhaustive. I have used the time available to point

disabled people help all passengers. The response we have received to
our inquiry has confirmed that this is a vital area where much more
needs to be done. Will the Minister assure me that he will continue to
pursue the issues that the report raises, so that transport barriers

those testimonies, it is disappointing that the Department for
Transport exercised an exemption from the EU requirement for bus

can be revised in March 2014, as evidently increased training is
necessary for some staff. It is important that the training includes
how to respond positively to those with hidden disabilities, such as
problems with speech and mental health difficulties, which is a
particular concern of mine. I recognise that many transport staff are
more than willing to take all this into account positively and
helpfully, but it is vital that best practice is spread across the
whole
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000049">The
issue is not just about staff training. Improvements to infrastructure
are necessary. I continue to campaign for disabled access to stations
in my constituency—Hedge End is an example—and it is
imperative that if a route claims to be accessible, it actually is when
the passenger comes to use it. I noted the section of the
Committee’s report that refers to lack of consistency.
Consistency is key, and action must be taken to ensure that companies

improvements must go further than just the bigger physical challenges,
such as level access and ramps, which of course are vital. They also
encompass the smaller changes that can make a massive difference to a
journey. As hon. Members have said, audiovisual destination and
next-stop announcements are important. I share the disappointment of
the Chair of the Committee that the DFT has rejected the call to
require bus operators to introduce audiovisual systems across the bus
network. When I was younger, we had audiovisual systems. They were
called bus conductors and, at their best, they were really helpful. We
seem to have lost them now, so we must substitute something for
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000051">I
agree with the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association and many other
disability charities that audiovisual announcements are vital. Lack of
information apparently causes 89% of blind and partially sighted
passengers regularly to miss their stop. As the association states,
missing a stop is a pain and an inconvenience for most of us, but for a
partially sighted or blind person it can cause major difficulties and
could be dangerous. It genuinely puzzles me why it is too much to ask
that audiovisual systems be introduced gradually over 10
years, as the Committee suggested. They could be introduced as new
buses enter the fleet or older ones are refitted. They exist on trains,
so why not on buses? Audiovisual systems also have benefits for the
wider population, including older people, children and those with
mental health difficulties. If buses are more accessible and appealing
to use, more people will use them, improving bus company revenue, so it
would be win-win all
round.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000052">A
Department for Work and Pensions survey showed that 37% of disabled
respondents found transport accessibility a significant barrier to
work. That leads me to the conclusion that improving access to public
transport would play a role in reducing Government
expenditure,  
<?notus-xml column=158?>which many desire. Given that, we must ask what
wider effect access to transport is having on people’s overall
well-being. Transport is more than just getting from one place to
another; it is a vital part of everyone’s life, whether getting

there has not been a business case seems flimsy. There is a social need

participate in today’s debate because I have received a large

physical disability and some degree of sight loss.</hs_Para>

has a higher than average level of deprivation, and some 40% of all
households there include a person with a physical disability of some
kind. An ever greater proportion of my constituency population is over
65. 
<?notus-xml column=160?>Some one in six people in Hartlepool are over 65 and by 2030 they will
constitute 23% of the town’s population. That means that an

circumstances, a reliable, inclusive and, above all, practical—I
have heard that many times already today—public transport system
is vital for my constituents and would allow those with physical
impairments and disabilities to enjoy a better quality of life. It
would also encourage, as the hon. Member for Eastleigh (Mike Thornton)
said, greater use of bus services, which would make them more viable
and be, as he said, a win-win situation.</hs_Para>

blunt, however. Hartlepool does not have a public transport
system—not really. It has a private sector monopolistic service,
run by Stagecoach. It disregards choice, quality and provision of
service and concentrates on profit at the expense of passengers,
especially those with disabilities. That is why the company can boast
of a 17.1% profit margin in its UK bus operations.</hs_Para>

“sector-leading profit margins”, as the company said in
its latest annual report, and that is why it can increase its earnings
per share and dividends to shareholders this year. It is also why it
can abolish evening and Sunday bus services in my constituency. I wrote
to Stagecoach on behalf of my constituents on the campaigning matters
of audiovisual announcements and better accessibility through the use
of low-floor boarding devices and new stock. I was told about Transport
for London and the trial of a system on the service 7 route in Perth,

Hartlepool.</hs_Para>

by the opening remarks of the Chair of the Transport Committee, who

do not want to discourage enterprise and rising profits for companies,
but when it is done at the expense of a deteriorating service to
customers, particularly those with physical disabilities, and without
the option for those passengers to move to a more appropriate
competitor that can provide a better service, it is clear that
competition is not working and something needs to change. In these
circumstances, it is important that we have a smarter regulatory system
that works in the interests of passengers, particularly those who, for
reasons of disability, would find it difficult—if not
impossible—to travel by other means in a safe, reliable and
affordable way.</hs_Para>

I take up the point made by my hon. Friends about the need for more and
better audiovisual announcements on buses. I fully support the
Committee’s recommendation that the Department for Transport 
<?notus-xml column=162?>should require all new buses to have audiovisual systems and for that to
be phased in over no longer than 10 years—hopefully, quicker
than that. Of course, that issue applies not just to England, but
throughout Great Britain and perhaps Northern Ireland. It is certainly
relevant to my constituency, and I hope that the Government will
reconsider their refusal to make the provision
mandatory<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:09:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000082">The
argument that there is no business case for the mandatory introduction
of audiovisual systems—that a mandatory rule would place new
financial obligations on operators in a difficult economic
climate—is one that I do not think we can accept. First, no one
can say that a transitional period of perhaps up to 10 years just for
new buses will in any sense place excessive burdens on operators,
unless the Government think that there will be a bad economic climate
for the next 10 years; that is another issue.</hs_Para>

a system in will surely not be impossible for the vast majority of
operators. We do not accept that buses can go around without having
destination boards or numbers; it should be as automatic that new buses
should have audiovisual information in them. I do not see that there is
a case against
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000084">As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:19:24"></hs_TimeCode>
many hon. Members have said, the provision of audiovisual information
benefits not just passengers with visual or hearing impairments; the
public as a whole benefit from such provision. We see that in London
when we travel on buses. I represent another city that has many
tourists. We can see how it benefits tourists, and others who are not
used to the city, to have that information available. It is obvious to
me that that should be
mandatory<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:10:52"></hs_TimeCode>.
Another reason why it is important is that otherwise we will be

am fortunate, in that Edinburgh has Britain’s largest
municipally owned bus company, Lothian Buses, which, like many
operators in London, is increasingly providing audiovisual
announcements on buses. On five routes, they are provided as a matter
of course, and they will be added to other routes in the
summer.</hs_Para>

That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:11:34"></hs_TimeCode> decision
has been taken by Lothian Buses itself. The company has not been made
to do that by the Government and nor has it had any
assistance—from the Scottish Government, in this case—in
providing that help. It has made the facility available because, as a
publicly owned operator, it has a commitment to providing as accessible
a transport system as possible.</hs_Para>

Lothian Buses won an award from the Scottish Accessible Transport
Alliance a couple of years ago for its work in this area. Of course, it
is common sense to provide all passengers with the facility. There
should be no difficulty in the Government making it mandatory for all
new buses over a

second point is about provision on buses for people with disabilities
and particularly those who require wheelchair access. As we know, the
regulations provide that all bus and coach operators will have to make
their vehicles, both new and old, accessible to disabled people over a
transitional period, but in practice that is taken up much more
actively by some operators than others. I am glad to say that again, in
Edinburgh, Lothian Buses 
<?notus-xml column=163?>has a good record in this respect: 100% of Lothian buses are
now wheelchair-accessible and that will also be the
case for the trams in the future. Again, that has been done without any
assistance from any governmental
source.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000089">However,
as we have heard, the situation is not as good in every part of the UK.
I certainly support the recommendation in the Select Committee report
that the Department for Transport should introduce financial incentives
for bus operators to replace older non-accessible buses, particularly
where no alternative bus route is available. We all know of cases in
which a route is meant to be accessible, but then suddenly the bus
operator, for some operational reason, puts on a service that is not
accessible. That means that a person who wants to get on the bus with a
wheelchair may have to wait half an hour or two hours or not be able to
travel at all in a rural area, because the so-called accessible service
has not been
provided<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:13:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000090">That
takes me to my third and last point. Much more work must be done to
create a seamless journey for all passengers, but particularly for
people who have disabilities and especially, in this context, those who
require access for wheelchairs, although not only them. For example, a
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:14:15"></hs_TimeCode>passenger
travelling in my constituency on one of the new No. 10 buses, with full
wheelchair access, to Edinburgh’s Waverley station can look at
the mobile app that has already been developed by Lothian Buses; it
provides information on many of the issues on which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:14:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Eastleigh (Mike Thornton) was looking for assistance on behalf of
people with disabilities and travellers more generally.</hs_Para>

gets to Princes street in the centre of Edinburgh, gets into the new
lifts, which take them down to the platform, and gets on to a train
with a wheelchair-accessible place run by East Coast Trains. They go to
London, use the lifts at the new King’s Cross station and get on
a wheelchair-accessible bus to wherever they are going in London in due

experiencing the world without sight was extremely unsettling and it
gave me a greater understanding of what it is like for a blind or
partially sighted person to do what we, the fully sighted majority,
take for granted. With many blind or partially sighted people reliant
on buses for mobility and freedom of movement, it is concerning and

being blindfolded and taken on a short journey on a bus around a town
that I am so familiar with. I soon lost my bearings and all sense of my
surroundings and became completely reliant on assistance from those
around me to get on the bus, find my seat and get off at the correct

changes to the Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000

sadly fall short of including audio-visual announcements. The Transport

information reduces the willingness of the visually
impaired, as well as the wider public, to use
buses. AV announcements would help the elderly, who may not be as
confident as they once were, or those with special needs, who could
strike out more independently if they had the reassurance that AV
announcements would bring. Indeed, AV announcements would also help the
fully able first-time visitor to a town or city to navigate

McDonald:</Member></B> That is a stark illustration of the point I am
making. The problem will not cost a lot to put right. Research by the
TAS Partnership found that it would cost only £2,100 to install
a system to make AV announcements on a single-decker bus and
£2,500 on a double-decker bus. The systems could be introduced
over a number of years, as new buses are brought into the fleet, to
mitigate the burden on bus companies. Is it not ridiculous that we are
talking about such sums of money, when AV devices should be an integral
part of the plant and machinery of any bus operation? Windscreen wipers
were not compulsory years ago. Such devices should be part and parcel
of the ordinary running of a bus company. When it comes to the business
case, I have not run a bus company, but it would not surprise me if
making buses more attractive for people attracted more passengers and
encouraged a greater flow of income. It is not rocket
science.</hs_Para>

introduction of AV announcements will give greater independence to
passengers, I urge the Government to take account of the Transport
Committee’s recommendations and ensure that such announcements
are phased in over the next 10 years and on all new buses. I applaud
the determination of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, which is
campaigning for the creation of a fund to encourage local authorities
and bus companies to install AV announcements. Ultimately, the issue is
one of equality, and indeed of disability discrimination. I urge the
Minister to consider closely the suggestions made in this debate. They
will give our fellow citizens the dignified assistance they request to
overcome the hurdles and difficulties they face as they endeavour to
play their full and rightful role in our
society—difficulties that the majority of us simply never

the Committee’s key recommendations. The tone of much of the
response drifts between complacency, defensiveness and world-weariness
about the whole issue. We accept that the problem presents complex

not being modified, Crossrail is not forced to make them accessible to
be legally compliant. However, as I have said, work is ongoing, and we

related point is that if Crossrail is approaching this work on the
basis of meeting its legal requirements, I must say that we often find
situations where accessibility at some stations requires someone in a
wheelchair to 
<?notus-xml column=171?>use four, five or six different lifts to get from one point to another
within the same station. Obviously, I accept that there are
difficulties in terms of what can be done in many stations.
Nevertheless, I hope that every effort can be made to ensure that,
where accessibility is provided, it is provided in a way that is as
convenient as possible and not in a way that forces passengers in
wheelchairs to go on a magical mystery tour to get from one part of a
station to another.</hs_Para>

though, many of our mainline railway stations date from Victorian

in terms of opening up the rail network to disabled passengers.
Currently, more than 450 out of a total of 2,500 stations have
step-free access between all platforms. By 2015, we expect that some
75% of rail journeys will start or end at a fully step-free station, up

colleagues and I are, of course, concerned that only around 20% of our
national rail stations have step-free access to every platform. That is
why we have continued the Access for All programme that was launched in
2006 and have made plans to expand it, to provide a step-free route at
more than 150 stations by 2015. That programme has already delivered
smaller-scale improvements at 1,100
stations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000163">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T14:55:30"></hs_TimeCode>

hunger, but we certainly have not improved nutrition. Indeed,
malnutrition, which in a way is hidden hunger, is a major issue that is
separate from the issue of people who simply cannot get enough to eat
on a regular
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:04:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000177">There
are a number of reasons for those spikes, some more convincing than
others. There is obviously the pressure of population growth although
that was outside our report’s scope other than to acknowledge
that, obviously, the more people there are in the world, the more
pressure there is on food supplies. Therefore a population policy, to
the extent that that is possible, is perhaps
desirable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:04:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The
experts also told us that they believe it is possible to feed the
planet’s projected population, provided that we are organised to
do so. However, the food spikes and the perpetual hunger and
malnutrition that exist clearly demonstrate that we currently are not
in that
position<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:05:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000178">Food
waste is another issue. I was interested to hear reports this week that
link to other aspects of our findings. Obesity is increasing in
emerging economies. In places such as India, for example, there are
people who are desperately poor and hungry, yet there is a middle class
that is becoming increasingly overweight because of its
diet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000179">There
are two issues in that context, one of which is food waste. We received
conflicting evidence; some people suggested that as much as 50% of
world food production is wasted, but the settled figure seems to be
about 30%. 
<?notus-xml column=178?>We are aware of how much food is thrown away in domestic bins. We all
throw food away. We buy too much and we throw it away because we have
not eaten it in time, but food is also wasted in the fields, in
transit, in storage and in a variety of other ways.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010948000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000180">By
definition, addressing waste increases supply. That includes investing
in security, refrigeration and cold stores and trying to ensure that
food is processed as close to the point of production as possible. Many
developing countries have a problem in that area because the cost of
setting up storage and cold stores is high, yet without them food
literally goes to waste. The Committee had an active discussion when we
were in Afghanistan, where people were arguing that they have to
process an awful lot of their food in Pakistan because they do not have
the facilities in their country. That leads to waste in
transit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:06:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
Addressing that issue is clearly a relevant
factor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000181">There
are other problems. When a food price spike happens, it affects
different commodities differently. One of the most volatile commodities
is rice, but all the basic commodities can be affected. Some producers,
as has happened in Thailand and Russia, for example, decide that they
will protect their own populations by banning the export of such foods,
but that exaggerates the problem for the rest of the world; it does not
solve the problem. The Committee’s view is that we should
discourage countries from export bans and encourage people to recognise
that there is interdependence in the supply of
food<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:07:44"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
issues on the supply side and on the demand side that need to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010948000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000182">There
was an inevitable debate on the effect of biofuels on food
availability—I have got to that debate only at this point
because, although I think it is important, it sometimes dominates the
issue of global food security. There is recognition that simple blanket
encouragement of biofuels can lead to a switch away from food crops to
biofuel crops, at the expense of food production. That is not
desirable, but it would be wrong to assume that biofuels are therefore
inherently a bad idea.</hs_Para>

how to develop biofuels that do not compete with food production. There
are some successful examples—Brazil is one of the better
ones—of where waste products from food production can be turned
into biofuels without affecting the delivery of food into the market.
In some cases, there are areas of land on which food production is of
limited value but where it is possible to produce biofuels.</hs_Para>

is asking that we switch away from the blunt instrument of setting
targets for biofuel incorporation into our motor car and vehicle
fuels—the UK recognises that, but the EU is still wrestling with
it. The UK Government have accepted that we should to try cap it at 5%
and that we should try to ensure that, if possible, 100% of that 5% is
made up of non-food alternatives. Indeed, the former Under-Secretary of
State for Transport,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:09:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Lewes (Norman Baker), told us that encouraging the reuse or
recycling of cooking oil has helped to increase the proportion of
biofuels from less than 20% to more than 80%. Therefore, these things
can be done, and that is almost wholly environmentally
beneficial.</hs_Para>

moment, the EU seems to be locked in a tussle over the level of the
cap. The UK Government are committed to 5%, although they found
themselves voting for 7% at one point. The European Parliament voted
for 6%, but my understanding is that everything has gone 
<?notus-xml column=179?>back to the drawing board. I simply urge the Minister to use her good
offices, and those of her Department and her colleagues in other
Departments, to ensure that the principle should be to take the
threshold down to 5% and to promote non-food-competitive
biofuels.</hs_Para>

logical and obvious point is that we need to improve the productivity
of small farmers. It is important that people get to grips with the way
the developing world has changed in recent years. There is an idea that
the majority of poor people in sub-Saharan African or south Asia live
on some kind of smallholding in a rural area or in the bush, scratching
a living from subsistence farming. Well, many are, but half the
world’s population now live in towns and cities and are not
engaged in agriculture at all.</hs_Para>

therefore need to do two or three different things. One is to ensure
that those on smallholdings get support to maximise their own food
production and then—and only then—to sell food to provide
additional support for their families. However, we must also improve
yields to enable those people to supply towns and cities in their own
countries, which often import food from outside. That goes back to the
idea of improving storage and transport facilities.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010948000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010948000188"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:11:44"></hs_TimeCode>There
has been controversy over landholding. Different approaches have
suggested that large-scale farming will somehow produce better yields
than smallholders. The evidence we had—I suspect
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:11:54"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) will make a contribution on
this—is that smallholding can improve productivity in a
comparable, but much more appropriate, way. Obviously, it is up to
individual countries to decide how they want to promote their
agricultural mix. We have combined our farms to ensure we have
larger-scale farming, so it would be wrong for us to criticise other
countries that seek to do the same. However, we should not rush things,
and, where large-scale farming is displacing smallholdings, there are
certainly questions as to whether that is the best way
forward.</hs_Para>

mentioned the Committee’s star coverage in the <I>Daily
Mail</I>, which came about because of a particular interconnection with
the fact that countries are changing their eating habits as they become
more prosperous, which is also linked to the obesity issue. As the
populations of emerging countries such as India, China, Brazil, South
Africa and Indonesia become better off, they aspire to eat a more
elaborate diet—in particular, meat—encouraging the
production of cereal-fed livestock, diverting food into meat production
and forcing up the price of meat globally, which, again, is something
we notice in this country.</hs_Para>

suggested that, over time, people in this country might want to
consider eating less meat, which led to a headline along the lines of
“Mad MPs seek to ban meat eating”. We were quite clear
that we made no such suggestion, but we did think that people should
consider balancing their diet away from meat. As someone who represents
a beef-producing constituency, I did manage to win support from my
local beef producers when I made it clear that there is a strong case
for pasture feeding and natural livestock production and that there is
a role for livestock.</hs_Para>

is how we raise that livestock, and I should put it on the record that
the beef rearing we do in my constituency exemplifies the kind of meat
industry we want, as opposed to the forced production of cereal-fed

the suggestion that, over time, that is the sort of balance that needs
to be sought.</hs_Para>

want to conclude by pressing the Minister on a couple of points and
commending a measure that we saw in Ethiopia. Ethiopia’s
productive safety net programme pays people in rural areas for
work—sometimes construction work—thus giving them money
to invest in alternative activities, many of which improved their
farming productivity. We saw beekeeping and livestock rearing expanded,
and living standards dramatically improved. The work also improved the
physical environment—roads, access and so forth—in the
community.</hs_Para>

course, the programme cost money, most of which came out of aid money,
and the objective in the long run is to find a way of making the
programme sustainable. However, it definitely works, and we were very
impressed to hear from some of the people directly affected about how
their lives had been transformed and how they had gone from being
unemployed and unproductive to being very satisfied, employed and
productive, as well as having food and money in their
pockets.</hs_Para>

two respects, the Government response was not quite as the Committee
would have wished. One point was about social support. I have spoken
about urban food shortages; the best way to deal with them is to give
people the means to buy food—preferably from producers in their
own countries. However, only 14 of the 29 countries with
which we have bilateral programmes have social protection networks. The
Government’s answer was that it was up to the country programme
managers to make an assessment, and I accept that, as I think the
Committee does. However, we would still make the point that, where
possible and appropriate, provision could be improved and
expanded.</hs_Para>

other issue was nutrition. Again, the Committee is pleased that,
following previous reports, the Government have prioritised nutrition
to a greater extent and recognise how important it is. Nutrition is
about giving people not just food, but the right kind of food. While
that is especially true of pregnant or nursing mothers and very small
children, it is also true of the rest of society. The World Food
Programme prioritises the issue, but there is an overlap between its
target programme and the Department for International
Development’s programme in four of the UK’s bilateral
partners. We would like the Government to see whether they could, at
least in those countries, bring the two programmes together to help the
WFP’s programme and DFID’s own programme to be more
effective in improving the nutritional element.</hs_Para>

summary, people are still hungry. If we are to achieve the millennium
development goals and their successors, lifting everybody out of
absolute poverty and leaving no one behind over the next 17 years, we
absolutely have to address the issue of global food security and adopt
measures, or encourage the adoption of measures, that improve supply,
eliminate waste, improve storage, increase productivity and ensure that
food gets to the people who need it, when and where they need
it.</hs_Para>

done. Much of it is being done, but, with nearly 1 billion people going

we commend the Government on what they are doing, but we hope they will

also a pleasure to follow the Chair of the Select Committee, who has
excellently outlined the Committee’s excellent report. Although
things have moved on since it was first produced in May last
year—that is not the Committee’s fault—it still
makes some important points. The key points are, first, that there is
still a crisis: 1 billion people go to bed hungry every day. At the
same time, however, the report highlights the fact that positive things
are happening, that there is a way forward and that the situation can
be tackled if the right measures are put in place and the right
policies adopted. That is a reminder of the enormity of the issue, but
also points out that we can move forward, which is an important
antidote for those who sometimes despair about whether anything we do
actually makes a
difference.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000002">I
would like to make a couple of points before I have the delight of
hearing the expertise of the members of the Select Committee who will
no doubt contribute to the debate. I would like to speak
first on biofuels, to which the right hon. Member for Gordon (Sir
Malcolm Bruce) referred in his speech. As we all know, the production
of biofuels was once seen as a key part of reducing carbon emissions.
That is why, some three or four years ago, the European Union adopted
targets to ensure that an increasing proportion of transport fuel comes
from renewable sources. Although some criticised it at the time, that
target had support across parties and from groups outside politics
because it was seen as the right thing to do to try to tackle growing
carbon
emissions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000003">We
now recognise more widely that the clearance of land to grow biofuels
can itself cause carbon emissions, especially where it involves
forests, which are part of the solution to global warming because they
absorb carbon dioxide. According to one estimate, the clearance of land
for biofuels could produce as much CO<Sub>2 </Sub>by 2020 as between 14
million and 19 million cars. A more relevant point to this debate is
that land clearance is a serious obstacle to addressing the problem of
food security because it can cut the amount of land available for
agriculture, thereby pushing up food prices. As the right hon.
Gentleman pointed out, that affects the UK as well as many people in
developing
countries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000004">Although
there is an increasing recognition that energy from biofuels and food
security are clearly interlinked issues, there is still no
international or European agreement on a way forward. The right hon.
Gentleman pointed out that some countries, including the UK, have aimed
for a 5% cap on the proportion of biofuels used in transport fuels in
the EU. Other countries want a higher percentage, but at this stage
there is no agreement on what it should be. However, the key principle
is that biofuels must be based on genuinely sustainable sources, 
<?notus-xml column=182?>such as waste. Their production should not affect agriculture or the
production of food for consumption. That must be the basic principle.
Although they have been pushing, the Government must push much more
actively for that at the EU level—I must say that I read a
certain lack of priority into how the Government have dealt with
biofuels at the EU level. I would be interested if the Minister could
update us on EU developments on this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000005">Another
point relating to biofuels, which the right hon. Member for Gordon has
already mentioned, is how we can do much more by developing biofuels
that come from food waste and other sources. That could also produce
jobs in the UK. As well as producing biofuels from food waste, we must
try to reduce food waste in the first place, as that has a major impact
on the demand for food. One estimate is that 30% of food produced in
the world is wasted. That clearly does not make sense from any
perspective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000006">I
want to say a few words about promoting agricultural development by
small farmers in developing countries. The right hon. Gentleman was
right to point out that this is not simply about small farmers being
good and anything else always being bad. It is much more complex than
that. Nevertheless, in many countries there are still problems with
excessive land acquisition and land banking, particularly by large
multinational corporations. That must be recognised. I am certainly not
against private sector investment in developing countries, either from
international companies or the private sector in developing countries
themselves, but there are still too many examples of small farmers
being forced off land that they may have cultivated for generations
because they have no formal title to it or are driven off by powerful
actors in the countries
concerned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000007">One
possible avenue might be for the Government to do more to support land
registration efforts to assist small farmers and agricultural
co-operatives, and smaller producers in negotiating and agreeing
contracts with the large companies that acquire their produce. I notice
with interest the recommendation from the Fairtrade
Foundation—which is referred to in the Select Committee
report—that companies that purchase crops from small farmers
should offer to pay by instalment throughout the year, rather than in
one go at harvest time. Such a simple measure could potentially make a
real difference for small producers in many countries. I do not see how
that could be imposed internationally through some sort of legal
framework, but it is the kind of good practice that the large,
responsible British company, among others, should be encouraged to
adopt when dealing either directly or indirectly with small producers.
That is something practical that the Government and international
bodies could be
encouraging.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000008">Given

issue also affects us right here. The right hon. Member for Gordon has
already referred to what happened in 2000, when we were on the edge of
a food supply crisis as a result of the fuel strike. Shortages on the

accommodated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000013">I
welcome the renewed emphasis that the Government have placed on
supporting agriculture throughout the developing world, including
enlarging the remit of the Commonwealth Development
Corporation—now called the CDC—to look again at direct
investments in agriculture. The CDC was a pioneer in investing in
agriculture after the second world war, and many of those investments
are still very productive, employing a lot of people in developing
counties. The CDC rather lost its way on the issue of agriculture 15 or
20 years ago, so I welcome the return to its roots, along with
investment in infrastructure and many other areas in which it has
recently become
successful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000014">Food
security must be taken more seriously by all Governments, not just
those whose people live daily with the consequences of shortages. We
recently saw an example, to which both previous speakers referred, of a
lack of seriousness when the European Union failed to introduce a
food-based biofuel cap of 5%, which I believe the Government support
and that was recommended by the Select Committee. Using precious land
to grow food that is then inefficiently converted into fuel costs a lot
of money in subsidies and pushes up food prices globally. As the
Government support the cap, I urge them to call on EU member states to
do the same, and as rapidly as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000015"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:29:15"></hs_TimeCode>In
2008, the sharp rise in the price of food arising from shortages led to
hunger, hardship and civil disturbances in many countries. At that
time, the world managed to rouse itself from its complacency and
slumber, and took some important steps. The G20 formed the agricultural
market information system, which includes the G20 plus Spain
and seven other major agricultural exporters and importers, and of
which the UK Government are a very active supporter. It analyses data
on production, consumption, prices, stocks and trade and uses that
analysis to prepare short-term market forecasts, which have made a
great deal of difference. It also has a rapid response force, which
meets as often as is necessary—I read “annually”,
but I hope it meets more often than that, as it is supposed to be a
rapid response force —to discuss policy co-ordination,
which is vital. Given that one reason for the food price spike in 2008
was 
<?notus-xml column=184?>misinformation about the level of stocks in China, the system is a
significant step forward and has helped to lessen the impact of more
recent crises<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:30:37"></hs_TimeCode>.

2011 decision by the G20 to remove export bans or special taxes for

makes clear, however, the hasty imposition of export bans still happens
and makes difficult situations worse. This goes slightly beyond what
the report says, but I would recommend that, led by the G20 and the
United Nations, the World Food Programme should put in place plans with
every state in regions likely to be affected by shortages, so that if a
neighbouring country faces a crisis, countries could allow food to go
where it is needed—instead of closing their borders for
exports—in the full and confident knowledge that the World Food
Programme would immediately support them with additional stocks if
necessary to avoid a crisis for their own people. Export bans are based
on the fear that a country’s own people will face shortages.
That fear would be unfounded if the World Food Programme had definite
plans in place, together with Governments, immediately to replace those

sometimes think that Governments—I am not referring to the UK

see what Joseph did during the food crisis that affected Egypt for many
years. He suggested that emergency stocks be built up, which saw the

proposal was not to manage prices on a day-to-day basis, in a way that
would lead to the failed grain mountains and wine lakes that the
Government response implies we were suggesting; it was specifically
aimed at emergencies and food security when prices rocket. Indeed, the
Government’s response
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14010953000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000113">“Evidence

is precisely the point. I do not believe that there is such a marked
dividing line between stocks for emergency purposes and stocks to
relieve pressure on prices. In countries where the cost of food forms a
major part of household expenditure, a sharp price rise is a food
emergency, because it means that an ordinary person without much money
cannot afford to buy food, which makes the situation almost like a
famine, even though 
<?notus-xml column=185?>food is around. This is such an important matter that I ask the
Government to look again at their response. Later in their response,
they made a sensible reply to our recommendation about emergency food
stocks. I ask the Government to combine the two responses and examine
how we can improve the world’s view, and particularly the
UK’s view, about the handling of food
stocks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000023">There
have been major improvements in how crises are handled locally. The
World Food Programme’s purchase for progress scheme, which aims
to procure much more food regionally and locally, rather than shipping
it in, is eminently sensible. It supports local food producers and does
not distort the market. It enables countries to continue their normal
way of life while helping to tackle a local or regional problem.
Cash-transfer and voucher-based schemes, such as those already referred
to in Ethiopia and elsewhere, are also effective, and the Department
for International Development is rightly regarded as a world leader in
such schemes. I commend those who are developing and implementing those
programmes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000024">Two<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:35:40"></hs_TimeCode>
decades ago, development agencies substantially withdrew from
programmes supporting agriculture, particularly small-scale
agriculture, and it was left to non-governmental organisations and
national Governments. It was thought that agriculture was perhaps a
business of the past, that the problems had been solved and that they
could concentrate on other areas. That was a big mistake, so it is good
to see DFID once again strongly supporting investment in agricultural
research and
productivity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000025">As
the hon. Member for Edinburgh North and Leith mentioned, the fair trade
movement has made a significant contribution. Although it has
concentrated on the cash crops, starting with coffee, cocoa, sugar and
others, it has supported smallholder agriculture throughout the world.
Let us not forget that most of the production of those smallholders is
usually for their own local consumption of food crops, in addition to
the cash crops that they have grown. We can rightly be, if not proud,
then satisfied that the UK is now the world leader in fair trade in
terms of volume of sales. It has adopted a pragmatic approach to fair
trade, which is not viewed as an ideological subject, but one that
promotes good quality and the interests of producers. That is why
supermarkets have taken it on board. In other countries, the fair trade
movement has perhaps rather shunned supermarkets and has hence deprived
the smallholders of extremely large outlets for their produce. I
reiterate my call for the Government to put their full weight behind
Fairtrade fortnight in a few weeks’ time, because it is
important that we do not lose the initiative that has driven the
movement for the past 20 years to the position it now holds in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:38:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000026">We
also need to recognise, as was said earlier, that smallholders do not
fit into one category. They can be farmers with an acre or two, or they
could have 10 or 20 hectares—in fact, we have many examples in
this country that might be regarded as smallholders in developing
countries around the world. They are not uniform. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:38:24"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Gordon, the Chairman of the Select Committee,
said, this is not just about farmers subsisting in the bush. Many of
them are 
<?notus-xml column=186?>substantial businesswomen and businessmen in their own right; they just
happen not to have large expanses of land. At the heart of the matter
is the ability or confidence of farmers to know that they own their
land and have the rights to it in
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000027">I

tenure and rights, which are often fragile or non-existent. In 2011,
the Select Committee saw the programme in Rwanda, which has now
documented almost the entire country as far as leases or freeholds are
concerned. As a result, everyone owning land and the millions of small
farmers—men, women and families—know that they own the
land, can develop it and are not at risk of having it arbitrarily
seized. In addition, if they need to develop the land and have a good
business case, they can go to a local bank and secure borrowing on it
to increase, we hope, their incomes.
DFID<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:39:56"></hs_TimeCode> has also
supported such work in India, Nepal and Mozambique. I hope the
Department will extend that support to other countries, because it is
rapidly building up world-leading expertise in land registration for
smallholders. Indeed, I would go so far as to say that this is one of
the best possible uses of UK taxpayers’ money that I have seen

infrastructure—irrigation, storage and rural
roads—improves both pre and post-harvest production. The
International Development Committee saw that in the Congo, where a
400-km earth road financed at a relatively reasonable cost by DFID

hours. Agricultural production can therefore be brought to market in a

billion new jobs globally, both to tackle current unemployment and for
the new entrants into the labour market—agriculture is vital,

the modern world. By opening up the markets, we would see developing
countries, which have a huge competitive advantage in agriculture, able

climate change on crop production—changes in the
types of crop that can be grown, sometimes to the detriment of crop
volume and productivity. On the other hand, agro-forestry can make a
huge contribution to the world, although we do not place quite enough
emphasis on it at the moment. Many countries are beginning to look into

incorporation of indirect land use change factors into the directive.
The directive, if accepted by the Government after discussions,

encouraging things are going on in different countries. What DFID does
well is to take best practice from country to country and help people
improve their techniques. DFID’s plans will help encourage food

would like to share one example with the Minister. When we were in
Ethiopia, I went to meet a British glove manufacturer from the
south-west that has always invested in Ethiopian sheep pelts for its
gloves. It has now built a factory in Ethiopia and is manufacturing 
<?notus-xml column=189?>gloves over there, but the farmers there have stopped dipping their
sheep. As a result, the sheep get various infestations that cause holes
in the pelts, which means that the pelts are not of such good
quality.</hs_Para>

was umming and ahhing about what to do. Its core business is glove
manufacturing, but it felt that if it could set up a model farm and
train the local farmers to dip their sheep, they would not produce
flawed pelts with holes. Not only that, but if they showed them how to
let the rams in only at certain times of the year, as we do—so
that when the lambs are born they have plenty to eat—they would
get bigger lambs, bigger sheep, bigger pelts and more meat to share.
That is the sort of lateral thinking that we can encourage. Maybe DFID
should consider how it can operate model farms to show farmers how best
to do such things.</hs_Para>

because I believe that a lot of farmers in many countries need better
education about farming practices, maybe we should be encouraging
agricultural colleges to set up branches abroad or get people to come
here to learn more about agriculture. However, it would be better for
people to learn in their own countries, because we do not have to deal
with the same climates or water shortages as they do in African
countries. If farmers could be taught to use fertilisers and much
better farming methods, including irrigation, we could help improve
farming practices throughout the continent, which would inevitably
improve productivity, which other hon. Members have
discussed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000047">Another
problem, discussed by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:54:15"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Stafford, is land tenure in Rwanda. We saw on our visit
that Rwanda has a problem. It has allowed people to build all over the
place, so that buildings are dotted about, meaning that there are no
large amounts of land for people to cultivate, but lots of
smallholdings. Until such countries have better planning laws, they
cannot have large farms; they can only have various sizes of
smallholding. Maybe some education could be delivered, or work done
with Governments of other countries, to improve planning laws so that
buildings are not built all over the place. Countryside is lost when
that happens, and there should be better ways of planning for the
future.</hs_Para>

report’s recommendations are clearly having an effect on
Government policy. I am particularly encouraged by the partial
consensus in the Government response that the UK will do its utmost in
its role in Europe to promote the food security interests of less
economically developed countries. I am hopeful that the International
Development Committee will continue to be effective in dealing with
that important issue in future. As hon. Members have said, we will have
to produce much more food for the world. The land is there; we just
need better technologies. We are well placed to help developing
countries to produce more and better food.</hs_Para>

perhaps declare an interest. I am involved with a charity in this
country called Free the Children, which works internationally. It talks
about adopting a village and does health and education work, but it
also spends a lot of time teaching children in schools how to grow
crops, so they can then go back and teach their parents. Free the
Children shows them how to use water and fertiliser, and what happens
if they are not used appropriately, so they can take the technology
back to 
<?notus-xml column=190?>their parents, who can see that they get much more crop yield per acre
or hectare than if they did not use that technology.</hs_Para>

ways for us to be innovative, as Free the Children has been, by working
with schoolchildren, as well as with our agricultural colleges working
out there. We can also encourage British and European businesses
investing in developing countries to think laterally and consider how
they can help by setting up model farms and demonstrating ways to do
things, so that best practice is spread as quickly as possible.
Everything is very good, but it is all fairly small-scale. It needs to
be much more rapid if we are to satisfy the world’s needs in the

McGovern</B> (Wirral South) (Lab):</Member> It is an honour to serve
under your chairmanship, Ms Clark. It has been a pleasure to hear all
the contributions from hon. Members. This debate has been postponed
several times, which is no reflection on its importance. It was
postponed once to accommodate the commemorations of the life of
President Mandela. However, it is right that we now have the chance to
discuss the report, which deals with the vital issue of food security.
As others have said, the issue has impact both here at home and abroad.
I am often struck by how many policy issues that we think affect people
far away are, at heart, the self-same ones of public policy that we
grapple with week in, week out in the House of Commons.</hs_Para>

Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations estimates that about 842
million people, or one in eight of the global population, suffer from
chronic hunger. Although the global trend of hunger is, thankfully,
downwards, all too frequently there is a lack of resilience in food
supply, which can put millions of people at risk of tipping into hunger
as a result of external influences, whether due to a spike in food
prices, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-09T15:59:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) mentioned, to climate change
or to conflict. It is worth noting that  1.3 million people in
the Central African Republic, for example, are now at risk of
hunger—that is a huge number; 40% of the country’s
population—as a result of the ongoing internal conflict
there.</hs_Para>

this debate has shown, food security is a desperately important issue.
As we have heard, it is connected to infrastructure problems and to
people’s income and position in society. I was pleased to hear
the hon. Member for Stafford correctly judging Malthus as wrong.
Malthus made a mistake; he forgot—or did not know or work
out—that we would use technology to meet the challenge presented
by the world’s finite resources as the population grows. That is
what we have done down the years: it was true at the time of the
industrial revolution, which changed where people lived and how food
was produced, and is true today for Africa and other countries around
the world. It is sometimes frustrating to hear people to repeat as
common-or-garden knowledge the idea that there is only so much space on
the planet, so there can only be so many people, and that the problem
is countries with growing populations. Those people make the self-same
mistake as good old Reverend Malthus did all those years ago. We ought
not to forget that our responsibility is to support the development of
infrastructure and technology, rather than spreading doom and gloom
about the inevitability of food insecurity.</hs_Para>

Committee’s report is welcome and wide-ranging. It demonstrates
not only the urgency of tackling food security issues but the breadth
of policy areas, both international and domestic—from transport
policy to food waste, from social protection to co-operatives and
climate change—that have an impact on ensuring that food
resources are used sensibly and sustainably and are distributed
globally in an equitable fashion. We heard something of the breadth of
the report from the Chair of the Select Committee earlier.</hs_Para>

rightly emphasises the impact of the two major recent food price
spikes, in 2008 and 2011. The 2008 spike in particular caused a
stagnation in the fight against global hunger and significantly set
back efforts to meet the millennium development goals. The spikes
demonstrate clearly the increasing volatility of food prices in an era
of lower food stocks and a tighter balance between supply and demand. I
encourage the Minister to speak with her colleagues in the Treasury if
possible to investigate the impact that commodities trading has had on
food prices. It is another symptom of the fight about financial
services regulation—a fight that must continue—that the
ever more complex products being bought and sold cause prices to become
disconnected from fundamentals.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14010953000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000056">The Committee
is also right to take a strong position on the impact of biofuels on
food prices and supply, by concluding that the increasing use of
agriculturally produced biofuels is driving up food prices and
increasing their volatility. By using land that could be feeding the
world’s poorest, the growth of those fuels makes the
fight against global hunger far harder. Further, the report rightly
notes that their use is potentially even more environmentally damaging
than the use of fossil fuels—a point made by my hon. Friend the
Member for Edinburgh North and Leith (Mark Lazarowicz). The report
makes a strong case for a revision to the renewable transport fuel
obligation’s equivalent target for biofuels in transport fuel
volumes, to disincentivise the use of agriculturally produced biofuels.
The Government’s response to that recommendation is
disappointingly non-committal and appears to play down the impact of
biofuels on food prices. When winding up, will the Minister commit the
Government to revising the RTFO, or at least set out a timeline for
doing
so?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000057">Further,
the report urges Ministers to push for the EU to revise the renewable
energy directive, or RED, to cap use of food-based biofuels and stop
those fuels counting towards the RED target. There was a difference of
agreement between the Commission and the recently ended Lithuanian
presidency over whether the cap should be set at 5% or 7%. What
discussions have Ministers had with EU counterparts recently on
revising the RED and where do the Government stand on the level of the
cap?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000058">It
is disappointing that the Government reject, out of hand, the
Committee’s recommendations for statutory targets and sanctions
for food waste reduction, which although declining still stands at over
20% at a household level in the UK. Is there a point at which the
Government would consider waste to be unacceptably high and, as a
result, reconsider their position? Food waste reduction is an important
challenge that does not always receive the attention that it deserves.
We could all shine a light on that issue.</hs_Para>

encouraging that the report calls for greater support for farmer
organisations and co-operatives in developing nations, to help
strengthen small farmers’ bargaining positions with large
corporations. In particular, it calls for support to assist women and
marginalised farmers. Although Ministers have not rejected those
proposals, their response, particularly on co-operatives, feels
lukewarm at best and makes no proposal to expand support for such
organisations. Worryingly, the response fails to mention the positive
impact of co-operatives for women and marginalised farmers. Will the
Minister give some practical examples of how DFID is supporting farmer
co-operatives and set out how the Department intends to expand that
work? Again, the way that co-operatives can help to support food
production and equitable distribution of its rewards is a lesson that
we have learnt in this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000060">Both
the hon. Member for Stafford and my hon. Friend the Member for

the hon. Member for Stafford mentioned, the Committee’s modest
recommendation that the Government undertake further research into how
small-scale, judicious use of food stocks could act as a buffer to some
of the worst impacts of food price volatility seems to have met
somewhat of a brick wall in the Government’s response. The idea
that we should go back to the common agricultural policy is a bit of a
straw-man argument. There is potential value in having up smaller scale
food stocks for poorer nations. Perhaps Ministers should have a think
about their approach to that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0001.htm#14010953000062">The
report rightly argues that social protection schemes have a vital role
in protecting the food security of the poorest, but Ministers’
ambitions seem to be a bit limited. Fundamentally, two things stop
people starving: money in their pockets and food in the shops that they
can afford to buy. We have systems of social protection in place in
this country, and countries as diverse as Liberia and Brazil and south
American countries have been investigating building up such systems.
Social protections inevitably mean that food price spikes are less
catastrophic for the poorest. The report notes that DFID plans to
support social protection schemes  in only 14 of the 29
countries where it has bilateral programmes. The Government response to
the report
states:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14010953000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0002.htm#14010953000114">“It

does not feel like an ambitious commitment. Will the Minister set out
whether she sees DFID as having an activist role as an advocate for and
supporter of social protection schemes, whether they are governmental
or are
community-based?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010953000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/halltext/140109h0002.htm#14010953000064">This
report once again reminds us that development issues do not exist in a
vacuum. Our domestic policies on a wide range of areas can feed into
food insecurity issues overseas. It works the other way round, too:
food price spikes, speculation and insecurity of supply impact on our
constituents as well, as they struggle with the cost of living crisis.
The Select Committee has made some very worthwhile suggestions on how
the British Government could step up their efforts across the board 
<?notus-xml column=193?>to tackle food insecurity. Unfortunately, in certain cases, the
Government’s response seems lukewarm. However, I hope that
through today’s debate and the Committee’s good efforts
in its report, we can bring a greater focus on the important issue of
food
security.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_09_PT_1/6DB59765864E6F874E7843120CA0822F4CC53DC3" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="9 January 2014">Thursday

social safety nets for the most vulnerable people. Hon. Members raised
those points, and DFID already prioritises all of them. The report also
tackles more contentious areas, including using food crops to produce
biofuels, which I will come to in a moment and which was raised by

security is as much about the quality of food as having enough to eat.
Stunting is a critical issue to address because it is the future of the

Government is committed to ending child poverty in the UK. Evidence is
clear that work remains the best route out of poverty and we are
helping more people back into work through our welfare reform
programme. We also provide support to low income families to help with
the cost of living, including new born babies. For example, we are
investing £105 million per year in Healthy Start Vouchers for
low income families with young children to help with essential foods
and vitamins. In addition the Department for Education has been
allocated funding of over £1 billion (£449 million in
2014-15 and £634 million in 2015-16) to fund universal free
school meals for infant pupils. Further, some low-income mothers will
also be eligible for the £500 maternity grant benefit, which

tell the Department when they want to terminate their claim, and the
reason for doing so, through the Department's claim closure telephony
service. Alternatively, they can notify the Department by post or in
person at a Jobcentre Plus office. It is not mandatory for a
jobseeker's allowance claimant to give the reason for terminating their
claim but when they do so this is recorded on the Department's computer
systems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14010970000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140109/text/140109w0001.htm#14010970000438">The
information is not complete enough to produce regular statistics as a
significant minority of claimants do not provide a reason for ending
their claim. A destinations survey in 2011 found that 68% of those
leaving JSA moved into work. People leaving for other destinations do
not necessarily remain unemployed, as the figures will include those
starting an education or training course and people who have retired or
left the labour force for other reasons.</hs_Para>

Households that have had an assessment were asked if they plan to

households said they had installed, were in the process or intend to
install at least one recommended measure. Of the 5% of households that
said they will probably or definitely not install a measure, cost of
improvements (37%), hassle/disruption of making improvements (14%),
would not save enough money to make worthwhile (12%) and structural

equivalent to tax increases or spending cuts of £1,150 per

scenario, the IFS determined that an independent Scotland would need to
make a permanent adjustment in 2020 equivalent to increasing the basic

year to the income tax of a basic rate taxpayer (in 2012-13

regards to gangmasters, the draft modern slavery legislation will
consolidate existing human trafficking and slavery offences to make the
options available to law enforcement, when investigating and pursuing
trafficking related charges, administratively simpler and operationally
clearer. The legislation also sets out to increase the maximum sentence
for human trafficking to life imprisonment, to ensure that modern-day
slave drivers face the full force of the law. There are plans to
introduce an anti-slavery commissioner to galvanize efforts in the UK
to challenge modern slavery by working with government and
law-enforcement agencies to realise 
<?notus-xml column=318?>more investigations, prosecutions and convictions of human traffickers.
The legislation also proposes the introduction of ‘slavery and
trafficking prevention orders' and ‘slavery and trafficking risk
orders' to restrict movements or impose other prohibitions on convicted
or suspected traffickers to reduce the risk they pose. This will also
create a new requirement for ‘first responders' to report all
suspected cases of human trafficking to the national referral mechanism
(NRM). This will improve our understanding of the nature and scale of
this crime and help improve our

risk management partnership funding approach started to make a real

DEFRA funding in 2013-14, about a quarter (143) have secured external

will go ahead than if costs were met by DEFRA alone. Particular
