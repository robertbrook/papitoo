said in my initial speech that the Bill is not fit for purpose. These
amendments and many of the amendments that we will deal with today
point out some of the problems, omissions and inadequacies of the Bill
as drafted. I do not know who drafted the Bill, but it certainly does
not have the fingerprints of good parliamentary draftsmen. It is

people in Scotland think, and we can take the Scottish referendum as an
example, that if—heaven forbid—they vote yes on 18

it is not as simple as that; it is not at all simple. It is up to
Parliament—this Parliament—to consider the result of that
referendum, to legislate, and to negotiate and discuss it with the
Scottish
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000014">Similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T10:12:12"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is a view that if 50% plus one vote for the United Kingdom to
move out of the European Union, that would happen very quickly.
However, again, that is not the case. It is up to Parliament to assess
the result, which is why subsequent amendments that say Parliament must
assess whether the result of the referendum is “definitive and
beyond challenge”. It would create tremendous problems if it was
challenged. The problems could arise, first, if the referendum was very
close indeed, especially if there were a lot of spoilt ballot papers,
which there could be—we have known elections where the number of
spoilt ballot papers has exceeded the majority vote. In a referendum,
that would mean that the result could be
challenged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000015">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T10:19:26"></hs_TimeCode>
will come to amendments later about counting in each of the constituent
parts of the United Kingdom: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and
Scotland. If there was a different result, for example, in Scotland, as
we discussed briefly last Friday, we should think of the consequences
of that. Indeed, there are other consequences in other parts of the
United Kingdom. What if the result of the referendum was very close?
Under the Bill, everyone who has a vote for a UK European Parliament
constituency will be voting in this referendum, which means that people
from Gibraltar will be voting. We will come to those amendments in more
detail later on, but just imagine if, on a very close result, the
outcome of the referendum as to whether the United Kingdom should
remain a member of the European Union was decided by the votes of the
people of Gibraltar. That would be astonishing, but it could happen.
These are the kind of things that we have to take account
of.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000016">Later<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T10:13:33"></hs_TimeCode>
on, we will discuss who votes in the referendum, which is relevant to
this as well. We will discuss whether 16 and 17 year-olds should vote,
and whether European Union citizens living in the United Kingdom or UK
citizens living in Europe should. Again,  whether or not we
incorporate and accept any of those 
<?notus-xml column=1471?>amendments—I hope we will—will affect the outcome of the
referendum as well. These are important matters, which is why the

56 is the one that I am really arguing for. I think that we have got
the wording wrong in Amendment 51 and, at a later stage, I

over 50%. That means, effectively, fewer than 25% of voters could
determine the future of the United Kingdom within the European Union.

If the Scotch Whisky Association, for example, were to have a problem
with Japan in respect of Japanese whisky, is it better that the UK
Government make representations to Japan or that we rely on the full

constitution that no Government can bind their successor. So why try?
What is the purpose? I had a television debate with a leading member of
the Conservative Party, and when it was put to him, “What,
really, is the purpose of this Bill?”, his reply was very
honest: he said, “It’s a signal”. If something is
a signal, one of course has to ask the simple question of who it is a
signal to. The signal was intended, presumably, either for potential
UKIP supporters or Conservative Party Back-Benchers in the other place.
If it is a signal, it is clearly a signal which has not been heard or
heeded.</hs_para>

have just been announced. Previously, there was a highly Eurosceptic
Government there under President Klaus; now, with the change having
taken place, a potential ally has been lost in the Czech Republic. The
Czech position on Europe has fundamentally changed in that the party
there which is allied with my own party is Europhile; the Christian
Democrats are Europhile; and the party of former President Klaus has
been consigned to the sidelines— so, again, the Prime Minister
has lost an ally. He lost an ally in Bulgaria and Romania with what is
being said in respect of immigration. He has lost an ally in Poland. So
where is he going to find that coalition which is necessary in any

other problem which exercises me—I shall say it at this stage

stands; she clearly does not speak on behalf of the coalition. She also
sought to preserve the fiction that this is a Private Member’s
Bill. If this be an initiative of the Conservative Party, on whose
behalf 
<?notus-xml column=1473?>she speaks, and if it be the case that this is purely a Private
Member’s Bill, I ask with all delicacy what
the officials are doing in the official Box. Who are they briefing? Are
they briefing the Conservative Party—that surely would be wholly
improper? Once upon a time, I was a member of the Diplomatic Service
and I sat in the officials’ box; I would like to think that I
wrote one of Mr Heath’s best speeches, but that is another

I say that business does not like uncertainty? Inward investors do not

have enough inward investment at the moment; we are a relatively proud

Parliament could exert stronger control over this process. In terms of
this amendment, Clause 1(6) attempts to put both the date of the

order. In any other context, that would indeed be an appropriate level
of control. However, I believe that this clause should simply be
removed because, in the words of so many noble Lords, the Bill is unfit
for purpose. It is of such a confused parentage that it is very
difficult to know whether it is a single parentage. If it were a child,
it would certainly be very much at risk; social services would be
taking a serious interest in it. Under these circumstances, any attempt

legislating now for what might happen in the next Parliament. The next
Parliament after the next election will be a different Parliament from
the one that is now sitting. In those circumstances, that Parliament

and not by some general constitutional doctrine that no Parliament can
bind its successors. It should be given by this Bill in the sense that,
before the Bill actually comes into force—it can be passed in
this Parliament if that is what Parliament wishes to do—a
resolution is passed by both Houses in the next Parliament saying that
the Bill should now come into force. That is an attempt to deal with

it seems to me that in those circumstances, it is only just, reasonable

one. I said in my speech that it was not a filibustering one: it is not
going to go on for very long, anyway. It is an attempt to square this
very difficult circle in which we have been placed by the shenanigans
of the party opposite, and particularly by the Government. The

Bill is legislating for something designed to take effect in the next
Parliament, the next Parliament will nevertheless have a direct say as

occasionally astonished by the nonchalance—or, some would say,
the recklessness—with which the sponsors of the Bill are lopping
great chunks off our constitutional practice. It is really pretty odd.
Yesterday in this House, we had a superb debate about the future of the
union of the United Kingdom and there was unanimity around the House,
but today Members opposite, the sponsors of the Bill, are supporting a
Bill that will increase the number of yes votes in Scotland in
September 2014 and decrease the number of no votes. I know that logic

people confronting a world of 7 billion. Leaving the EU

referendum of any importance, otherwise decisions, even highly
consequential ones, can be taken that do not reflect the will of the

some serious options for the House to consider. There is a need for
serious parliamentary analysis of the outcome of whatever referendum
there may be. Let me set out the argument in these terms. It may be
that, after a referendum, it is wholly clear what the people of the
United Kingdom wanted—but, even in those circumstances, some
things would not be wholly clear because work would still fall to be

am not saying that because I would disrespect a serious majority among
a large number of people voting, but just in terms of trying to work
out what would need to be done and how we might set about it. The
precise terms of the disengagement would need to be thought through and
negotiated. Later amendments address this question, but there would
need to be a consideration of what the continuing relationship would be
as, many people would submit, we would not simply cut ourselves off and
that would be the end of the matter; there would be a continuing
relationship of some kind, and that would need to be thought through.
The terms of the continuing relationship would, I submit, need to cover
trade agreements and competition rules—we would not want
suddenly to find that the businesses and industries of the United
Kingdom were at a massive disadvantage in relation to other nations in
competition terms. We would need to look with considerable attention at
labour market arrangements—I know that they are among the most
highly contentious things, but none the less, it is unavoidable that we
would need to analyse them properly.</hs_para>

would need to look at environmental co-operation and at all the
arrangements, which have preoccupied me during parts of my career, for
the relationship between higher education institutions, the movement of
scholars, what we regard as comparable qualifications and so on. In all
those cases, and in many other issues, we would need to consider
timing. Their timing might not be identical. There would need to be a
serious analysis. Parliament will have a major role in that analysis at
every

made the point a few moments ago that in the case of a big majority and
a very good turnout, we might be able to say that we were at least
wholly clear. In those circumstances, there is what I described last
Friday as an expression of the settled will. Even that has its
complexities, which are also addressed in amendments. The settled will
of people in Scotland or people in Wales about the EU is a significant
issue, because we have already devolved a considerable amount of
political authority, and I think that the people to whom that political
authority has moved will want to feel that they have an objective view
of what is happening and what their interests might be. So even that
expression of settled will has ramifications.</hs_para>

not be of that kind. Personally, I do not believe that it will be. I
would like to believe that the people of the United Kingdom would wish
to remain in the European Union, but let us suppose for a moment that
they decided by a very marginal result, on a very small turnout, that
there was a wish to leave. I completely accept that that would be a
result of sorts, but just think of the set of negotiations which 
<?notus-xml column=1480?>we would need to conduct. Those negotiations would be considerably
complicated by being conducted in circumstances where there was a
marginal result on a low turnout. All the counterparties in the
negotiation would understand that it was a weak decision which, in that
sense, would reflect that at that moment we had become a weak nation. I
cannot believe that counterparties in the modern world would not take
advantage of those circumstances. Those are real politics in what could
be a real set of circumstances.</hs_para>

majorities. However, this is not like a general election, where people
are being voted for in a single constituency. It is not one-650th of
the variance at stake; it is much more profound than that. Neither will
it be changed five years further on by another election or, in an even
shorter period, by a by-election. It is essentially an indelible

not believe that the appeal to other kinds of votes which we have had

Tyneside or its relative importance; it could be a mayor anywhere else.
It is simply a different decision, and when people have said,
“Well, what about all those decisions?”, I cannot believe
that they would transform our constitution in so fundamental a way on
the basis of those kinds of decisions setting the precedents. The
length of time for which the decision would hold, as I said, would be

issues at stake are quite different. This set of decisions will be
fundamental to our economy, now and in the future. The decisions will
be fundamental to our relations in economic terms with North America,
China, the BRIC states and the MINT states, whatever difficulties some
of those states may be facing, probably temporarily. When we start
thinking about the character of the economic relations that we would
want with them, we will have a totally different game plan in any
negotiation with them, depending on whether we are doing it within
Europe or trying to do it without the rest of Europe. It is fundamental

and we discussed that in Committee last week, but there comes a point
when all these nostrums about parliamentary sovereignty require a dose
of carbolic and common sense, when we need to find a democratic
balance. That balance is not achieved by this unelected House
obstructing the clearly expressed view of the other place. Parliament
is sovereign, of course it is, but even above a sovereign Parliament
there are the people. When the people have expressed their will, it is
a terrible thing for any House of Parliament to defy. What British
Parliament, as sovereign as it may be, would be unwise enough to turn

position. My noble friend Lady Warsi is a government Minister;
therefore she sits on the Front Bench, and by convention those who sit
on  the Front Bench speak at the Dispatch Box. That is the
position. While there is no collectively agreed position on the overall
policy in the Bill, there is a government position on much to do with
the Bill. For instance, on questions about our relationship with the
EU, Gibraltar and referendums, there is a government position. From
that point of view, having a government Minister available to answer
questions to do with government policy, advised as appropriate, is
absolutely the right thing to do. It is also perfectly in order for my
noble friend, or any other Minister from across the coalition, to offer
an opinion—as a Conservative, in the case of my noble
friend—as an individual. My noble friend is completely entitled
to do that. Any Minister in our proceedings can do that so long as they
make it clear when doing so that that is what they are doing. When my
noble friend Lady Warsi speaks on behalf of the Conservative Party
alone, which is a distinction that my noble friend Lady Falkner drew
earlier, she will do that and be absolutely clear about it. That is the

position that my noble friend Lady Symons has just raised about
collective responsibility, which is what this is about, is central to
the way that we conduct business in this House. If, as the noble Lord
says, the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, who is representing her party
in this matter, should not sit on the Front Bench because she is not a

been invoked, so it is important for me to clarify where we are. I say
to the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, that we are not necessarily in
opposition to this Bill. We are doing our proper function of scrutiny,
amendment, improvement and revision on this Bill. I say to the noble
Lord the Leader of the House that his comments have been very helpful
and illuminating, but it would have been helpful to the House if we had
had that explained to us from the outset. When the noble Baroness, Lady
Warsi, whose reputation improves every day on all sides of the House
and who is held in very regard, spoke on the Bill last Friday, she did
not make the distinction that she was speaking only on matters to do
with the implications for government that might arise out of the Bill.
Will the Leader of the House tell the House whether when the noble
Baroness speaks on matters to do with her position in the Conservative
Party she will move back to the Back Benches in order to create clarity
between the Dispatch Box and a Back-Bench position? Finally, we have
been told of the precedent set when the noble Lords, Lord Strathclyde
and Lord McNally, both spoke on Leveson. They did so in a
self-regulating House with the consent of the House. It seems to me
that the House is quite clearly expressing the opinion that it is not

they therefore speak from the Dispatch Box. On the rare occasions when
there is not an agreed collective position, they are obviously under an
obligation to make clear when they are speaking solely in their
capacity as a member of a party. My noble friend will do that. I think

Hill of Oareford:</Member></B> My noble friend Lady Warsi was extremely
clear about that as well. As it happens, there is a convention that we
should not name people in the House who are not Members. That aside, we
have clearly gone past that point. My noble friend made very clear the
distinction, which anyone who has been a Minister will understand, that
there are civil servants and officials to advise on government policy
and a political person to advise on political matters. I have always
believed extremely strongly in the traditional distinction in our
system between civil servants who properly should stay one side of the
line. I expect all civil servants to do that, to know very well how to
tread the right side of the line and to make sure that Ministers do not

noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, has set out the case for this Bill in his
characteristic urbane manner, but no amount of urbanity or suavity can
disguise the fact that the arguments for the Bill are superficial and
the evidence thin. He has sought, for example, to persuade us that the
other place has spoken loud and clear and that, with a majority of
around 300, it would be wrong for this House even to amend it. However,
I suspect that that does not reflect the true depth of support in the
other Chamber. In any case, it will soon be put to the test. If the
support for the Bill is as strong as he claims, there will be no
problem in securing the additional time that the Bill needs to consider
our amendments. To judge from the glum faces on the Benches opposite

noble Lord made much of the argument that we must give people a choice.
I agree with that, but it must be an informed choice. I am not against
a referendum—I am against a “pig in a poke” or a
“leap in the dark” referendum. Amendment 9, which was
passed last week, established the principle that people must be given
the information that they need about the results of an exit from the
EU, without which they may make a choice that they come to regret.
Responding to the noble Lord, Lord Roper, the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs,
said that it was unnecessary to make special provision for such
information and that people could get it through political parties,
through referendum campaigns, and through the press and business
groups, pretty much as the Scots are getting their information now.
That will not suffice, as some information can come only from the
Government, which is what Amendment 50A
addresses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T11:24:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T11:24:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000118">As
I pointed out at Second Reading, voters need three things to make an
informed choice: an understanding of how society and the economy will
develop if we remain in the EU with its current framework; an
assessment of how that might be modified by a process of renegotiation
and reform in the EU; and an assessment of what our relationship with
the EU might be—what might be retained or replicated, mimicked,
modified or dropped. Only then can the impact assessment called for in
Amendment 9 be established. Having set up these scenarios, the pros and
cons of each can be compared and the balance of advantage struck in
what, in the current jargon, would be called the delta. But the
information required by voters cannot simply be left to laissez-faire;
much of it can come only from the Government, who would be left with
the task of negotiating the divorce
settlement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000119">People<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T11:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>
will need answers to a host of questions—some general and some
affecting their personal lives or their businesses. Let me give the
House a practical example. Forty-two years ago, I found myself on the
Treasury’s agriculture desk, looking after MAFF spending. I soon
had to master the outgoing UK regime of deficiency payments for each
sector of agriculture—beef, dairy, and so on. I then had to
grapple with the incoming CAP regime—intervention prices, export
subsidies and import measures. Then I had to master what was called the
fourchette, the transition plan between the two. With a leave vote, we
would face that journey in reverse. Farmers will want answers. What
will the new regime be for them? Will they still be able to export
their beef, and should they expand their dairy herd, or should they get
out of farming altogether? Being told that it is too soon to say will
not cut much ice, inform any sensible investment decisions or, worse
still, satisfy the bank
manager.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000120">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T11:27:04"></hs_TimeCode>
problem will be repeated in a hundred different domains. Top of the
list will be residence, citizenship and employment. People will ask,
“Can I still employ EU nationals? Can I get a job in the EU?
What healthcare or welfare benefits can the thousands of British
retirees now living in the EU expect?”. Then there is trade and
the single market. Many fear that we 
<?notus-xml column=1490?>will be reduced to what has been called fax diplomacy—receiving
notice of changes in regulations on which we have had no influence. In
my view, it might not be as extreme as that, as we and the EU have a
huge amount of trade together, far more than Norway and Switzerland,
and a mutual interest in fostering trade in goods and services. That
would all have to be negotiated. But it is likely that we would have a
reduced influence. Furthermore, will my intellectual property rights,
registered at the European Patent Office, be protected? Will I have to
renegotiate and reregister my patents in the UK? Will the interchange
of students be encouraged, will professional qualifications be
recognised and will accounting standards stay the same? The list goes

me give an example of the kind of work that needs to be done. The
“five tests” assessment of 2003 for membership of the

in the Treasury, and had many components, but it was crucial in helping
the UK to reach what I believe has been vindicated as the right
decision. It has also helped us resist the blandishments of some people

criticism was that the Scottish Government had made an inadequate

authoritative statement of what life would be like outside might take
time—Article 50 of the treaty of Lisbon talks about seceding
from the European Union being a two-year process—but this would
be before that. This would be before the referendum. This would be the

subsequent step to the referendum. All this Bill does is to establish
that there will be a referendum. The point the noble Lord, Lord
Turnbull, made when he drew the analogy with the Scottish debate
yesterday seems to me not to be correct. We had a Bill about the
referendum. The criticism about the lack of information came
afterwards. The mechanism was quite separate. Although all the points

you can really make that assessment on purely normative lines. It has
to be descriptive as well. If this amendment is addressed not just to
Parliament but to the people, we are asking that the people be informed
of the Government’s view of that future relationship. There has
to be an element of the descriptive in that. That is the line that I
have clung to in my support for this
amendment.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14013131000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000137">The
Prime Minister has said over and over again—and to the
discomfort, to put it mildly, of a substantial number of his
Back-Benchers—that he wishes the United Kingdom to stay in the
European Union. However, what if the people in an “in or
out” referendum 
<?notus-xml column=1493?>beg to disagree with him? It is inconceivable to me that, with eventual
withdrawal a possibility, the people should vote without the benefit of
knowing in advance what kind of relationship he
would wish the UK to have with the Union that it is leaving. I would
have thought that to so inform the electorate was a simple matter of
common sense, not to mention courtesy. In other words, does the Prime
Minister have a plan B? If he does not, he must construct one and,
having done so, the Secretary of State must publish it and lay it
before Parliament before making any order under Clause 1(6). That is
what the amendment would be calling
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000138">At the
heart of this assessment, or plan B, would presumably be the end
product that the Government seek to gain by negotiation—the best
terms that they can obtain for access to the single market, to take but
one example. Will the Prime Minister opt for the kind of relationship
enjoyed by current members of the European Economic Area and EFTA? Will
he take the relationships enjoyed by Norway and Switzerland as his
model? I use the word “enjoyed” with some hesitancy,
since EEA and EFTA members suffer taxation without representation,
having to contribute to the EU’s budget without getting any
money back, a reality of which the public ought to be made aware before
voting. Or will he be aiming for some other kind of association? What
kind of associate status would he judge appropriate for one of the
largest economies in Europe and, indeed, the world? Whatever his
intentions or preferences, in the case of withdrawal they need to be
put on the table for all to see and discuss before the referendum is
called.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000139">We on
this side of the House are not alone in calling for an eventual impact
assessment of the actual effects of withdrawal on the British economy

Lord Turnbull, referred to that. That assessment could show that things
would turn out to be disastrous if a Government who had taken the UK
out of the EU had failed before doing so to formulate a proper vision
of the intended relationship. That would be inviting our erstwhile
partners to do our thinking for us. I strongly support this eminently
reasonable and crucial amendment.</hs_para>

be clarity at that stage about whether the supporters of the Bill want
to follow in the steps of Norway. Norway is often cited publicly as a
parallel for the United Kingdom. Inside the European Economic Area it
may be, but it has no direct power in the EU, it has no seat at the
table and it cannot vote. However, it still has to abide by directives
just as full members do. Indeed, Norway has to implement three-quarters
of all EU legislation, including the working time directive. It has to
implement other employment laws—consumer protection,
environmental policy and competition—and has to contribute to EU
budgets. Norway’s per capita contribution is just over
£100; the UK’s net per capita contribution is
£128. If we joint the EEA, there will be little saving in
practice for us.</hs_para>

cited as another example that we might emulate, but it has no right of
access to the single market and it has to negotiate each and every case
separately. Even Switzerland contributes to EU budgets at £53
per capita. If we left the EU, it is possible that we could operate
with a most-favoured-nation status, but that would mean that 90% of UK
exports to the EU by value would face tariffs. If we were in the EEA,
trade would be tariff free and, as with Norway, the four freedoms
relating to the movement of goods, services, labour and capital would
apply, along with the implementation of three-quarters of EU

has been made this morning of trade agreements. What will the
implications be for our trade agreements? If our intended relationship
is not clear, where do we lie with the 46 trade agreements that the EU
has with other countries—and, I understand, a further 78 trade
agreements pending? If we left the EU, we would lose access to every EU
trade agreement with a third party and each of those would have to be

come from a background in Wales where the main question will
undoubtedly be an economic one: what effect will pulling out of the
European Union have on jobs? I will refer briefly to three headings.
The first, which was touched on by the noble Lord who moved the
amendment, is in regard to agriculture. The Farmers’ Union of
Wales came here last year to brief noble Lords on the effect of pulling
out of the European Union. It indicated that some 80% of its business
would be affected adversely if we pulled out of the European Union.
That is a massive consideration, and a shadow that will hang over the
industry until this is put to

second sector that I referred to is the motor sector. Last week I
referred to Toyota. There are a number of other important motor
companies in various parts of the United Kingdom that will be
affected—as will jobs. I started my career working for the Ford
Motor Company, and I know very well that companies such as that one do
not have a time horizon three years ahead; they plan for a decade
ahead, and longer. If there is uncertainty as regards the conditions in
which companies that operate in the United Kingdom will trade after
2017, it will affect investment decisions. That has already been
flagged up by companies from Japan, and we cannot ignore it. When
voters come to vote in a referendum, they need to have the information
available on how the Government interpret what the situation will be if
we pull out, and on what the alternative is. Companies need to know
that so that they can inform their employees and others who will be

other locations in mainland Europe. The issue is that if it decides to
put more emphasis on mainland Europe because we are not part of the
European Union, the likelihood will be that the contracts for
manufacturing all the components that go into a nuclear power station
would drift to Germany rather 
<?notus-xml column=1497?>than to the United Kingdom. The Government have already indicated that
they see the knock-on effect of their programme of building nuclear
power stations as important, not just as regards the locations
themselves but as regards the industries associated with that. They

“oppose”, but I do not oppose the Bill, and neither do I
oppose a referendum. I have made it quite clear, as have other noble
Lords, that I support a referendum on the basis put forward by the
Prime Minister in his Bloomberg speech. It is precisely because I
support a referendum that I believe that the terms of that referendum
need to be as good as we can possibly make them. This will be a very
important referendum—all noble Lords agree on that point.
Therefore, if it is to be a very important referendum, the terms on
which it is held have to be drawn up as carefully and objectively as
possible. Because of that, it is very important that the people of this
country should<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T11:59:38"></hs_TimeCode>
be able to make an objective choice based on as much information as

to balance the advantages and disadvantages of membership of the

new relationship.</hs_para>

this occasion I will do so. He points out, very frequently, that if we
leave the European Union, there will still be trade between us and the
European Union, and we will still deal very closely with it in economic
matters. Of course he is right; one must not overstate the consequences
of staying or leaving. However, it is undoubtedly the case that if we 
<?notus-xml column=1498?>leave, the terms of the relationship will be different. Some people may
think that they will be better, while others may think that they will

part of the noble Lord, Lord Tugendhat. I am a pro-European. I am
unusual for a Brit in that I am a passionate pro-European but I also
believe in having a referendum. It is important to have an “in
or out” referendum at some point. I think that most of us who
are arguing in relation to the clauses of the Bill are doing so because
we see that this is the beginning of an extended discussion. The House
is laying down important markers for the progress of that discussion.
The discussion will go on for several years. It should and must do, and
it must reach the citizenry. The worst thing that could happen is that
the UK will exit the EU without its citizens having a proper grasp of
the issues at stake. As I see it, this amendment is a contribution to
making a resource that will help people understand the pros and cons of
leaving or staying in the European

repeat the point I made earlier about leaving an organisation and then
making requests of that organisation. If we turn down our membership of
it, we will not be in a strong negotiating position. We will not be in
a position to say that we want to be like Switzerland or Norway.
Therefore, it is highly important to think through not just the
objective bases for, and consequences of, leaving but also the
strategic consequences. It is very important, for example, to consult
other states in the European Union well before the referendum so that

which have already been deployed in support of it. However, in
connection with the intervention by the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, of
course it would have been possible to put forward an amendment which
would require the Government now to say what they would do in the
context of a no vote in the referendum—but that is not what the

he himself favours continued membership of the EU. If the Prime

the extent to which the Prime Minister carries his party with him seems
to be in a little more doubt today than it was a few days ago. As I
say, I am sure that the noble Lord is correct, but the amendment would
require the Government of the day—that Government may well not
be the present Prime Minister’s Government—to provide, at
the time a referendum is held, and in advance of it, certain kinds of
information that are not called for in the Bill as it stands. I happen
to think that this falls fairly and squarely in what I would call in
the argot the “Cormack category”—that is, a
provision that will improve the Bill. I hope very much that the noble

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, if the noble Lord, Lord
Dobbs, says that he will accept this amendment, I will very happily sit
down and spare your Lordships’ House a few moments of my
thoughts. I think I detect a negative response, in which case I ask the
noble Lord, Lord Sherbourne, what is the purpose of giving information
to the electorate after the event, and telling them plan B after they
have voted yes or no, possibly partly in ignorance of what the
implications of so doing are? I am reminded of the story of the eminent
Scottish divine who, to his surprise, after a blameless life, found
himself languishing in hell. He looked up, saw the good Lord and said,
“Oh, Lord, I dinna ken, I dinna ken”. The good Lord, in
his infinite mercy and goodness, replied, “Ye ken the
noo”. That will the position of the electorate. They will know
the consequences of the referendum result for good or ill, but after
the event—after the blameless life, in that
case<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:06:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000172">I
am a signatory to both the amendments we are discussing. I put my name
to them because I believe that on an issue of such importance the
electorate should be informed about it. It is for those proposing 
<?notus-xml column=1500?>the measure to say what their plan B is. Surely, we do not say to the
electorate, “You will vote yes or no. If you vote no, you will
step into the void. We will be coy about what the implications
are”. That is why I have tabled a series of
amendments—Amendments 74A to 74G—which I will summarise
briefly. Amendment 74A is headed, “Report on
alternatives to membership of the European Union: Switzerland”;
Amendment 74B is headed, “Report on alternatives to membership
of the European Union: Norway”; Amendment 74C is headed.
“Report on alternatives to membership of the European Union: the
Commonwealth”; Amendment 74D is headed,
“Report on alternatives to membership of the European Union:
North America”; Amendment 74E is headed,
“Report on alternatives to membership of the European

of the European Union; Amendment 74F is headed, “Report on
alternatives to membership of the European Union: European Economic

is a whole series of potential alternatives. Probably the most likely
would be a relationship akin to that of Norway or Switzerland, or akin
to that of the Commonwealth. I will not give a dress rehearsal of what
I will say if we reach those amendments, as that would surely bore your
Lordships. However, if the amendment we are discussing is
passed—I very much hope that it will be because of its potential
for an informed electorate—my amendments may then be otiose.
However, I say for the benefit of the House that, as regards the
position in respect of Norway, the report published about two years ago
for the Norwegian Government by a learned professor is very helpful. He
said, in terms, that he had come to the conclusion that it made sense
for Norway to be fully part of the European Union. He set out all the
disadvantages of Norway’s position, including the financial cost
to it and the extent to which it was not able to make any serious input
into discussions. Indeed, that was underlined by a representative of
the Norwegian employers’ federation, the NHO, who

City of London, those arrangements are of considerable importance to
us. Frankfurt and other financial centres look eagerly to see if they
can replace the City of London. As to the implications for
Switzerland—I shall not dwell on this because it would bore your

European Union and the Commonwealth was given in a speech by the then
Commonwealth Secretary-General, the New Zealander, Don McKinnon. He
gave clear answers in response to a speech by the noble Lord, Lord
Howell. I have copies if colleagues wish to see it. I shall not
extensively go over what was said, but Don McKinnon was saying
essentially that the Commonwealth needs the United Kingdom to be part
of the European Union as an advocate on behalf of Commonwealth
interests—whether in relation to bananas, or the interests of

no vote with the more likely outcome of a yes vote. I, like the Prime
Minister, want to find myself in a position to vote yes, if I am still
around. The problem is that the people know that we have been on a long
journey of some 60 years to get to where we are. But the people are
also apprehensive because they do not know where they are being taken.

for a plan B regarding the currency. The noble Lord, Lord Wigley,
referred to uncertainty. Take it from me that if you are in an extended
referendum campaign, the impact of uncertainty, particularly on
business intentions, is very considerable indeed. We are not
confidently out of recession; even the Chancellor acknowledges that.
One thing that business cries out for is a degree of
certainty. That is why this is a common-sense amendment. We have to go
into any referendum in an atmosphere of calm. It should not be held in

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I take it as pretty
certain that there will ultimately be a referendum because, at some
point, there will be a new treaty anyway. I totally agree with my noble
friend Lady Liddell that any referendum produces economic costs and
uncertainties, and that is why it is particularly regrettable that the
Government have, quite unnecessarily, brought forward this entirely
gratuitous Bill in this Session of Parliament to have a referendum at
some point in the next Parliament. It would be much better if we left
the matter until
then<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:18:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that our labours are wasted because what we are producing today, were
producing last week and will go on producing in the remaining days on
which the Bill is under consideration, is a kind of template for any
future referendum when it occurs. It will be clear to any Government
what can and cannot get through the House of Lords. No Government will
again be tempted to try to fiddle around with the main question to be
asked on the referendum ballot paper, which we discussed last week. The
Bill has now established that and it would not be sensible to change
it. In future, Governments will be guided by the Electoral
Commission’s views on what the proper question would
be<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:19:12"></hs_TimeCode>. Again, if we
were to pass this amendment, it would be carried forward into any
future Bill, even if this Bill were not to be passed and this
referendum did not take place.</hs_para>

few moments ago, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said that if we had a
referendum the country would have a very stark choice. I entirely
agree. We all know that it will also be a very momentous choice, but it
will 
<?notus-xml column=1503?>actually be a rather uneven choice because the British public will be
asked to choose between a known and an unknown—between an
established and familiar fact on the one side and a purely hypothetical
speculation on the other. It is very unfair and very dangerous to put
the electorate in that position. It is dangerous because in those
circumstances there is great scope, and therefore great temptation, for
the promoters of the unknown option—those who, in this case,
want to leave the European Union—to replace the unknown with a
picture of their own devising which may be entirely fanciful, very
wishful and even deliberately and cynically deceptive. That would be a
very bad thing; it would be a very bad day for democracy to have a
dishonest campaign of that
kind<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>. Therefore,
it is very important that the electorate is able, as far as possible,
to choose between two explicit descriptions of the two scenarios that
are being offered. That is why I think that the amendment is enormously
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:20:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013131000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000184">There are some areas
where a relatively reliable statement can be made about an unknown. For
example, we all know that the Tory party does not like the Social
Chapter. If we leave the European Union, we will not, by definition, be
part of the Social Chapter, so it will be possible to say to people
that there will not be a part-time workers directive or a parental
leave directive, and anybody who is a part-time worker or who is
thinking of having children will know where they stand. There are areas
of greater uncertainty but they are ones where one can at least produce
a reasonable description of the sort of scenario that might eventuate.
For example, people are particularly concerned about whether we could
still have access to the single market. There is a precedent in Norway
and a precedent for EFTA, so there is a certain degree of credibility
and responsibility in saying that there is certainly a likelihood that
we could join EFTA if we wanted to. However, the rules of EFTA are
quite clear—they have already been mentioned this
morning—and it has already been explained why in many cases it
would be very unsatisfactory to a great many of
us<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

areas where nothing certain at all can be said about what the position
would be if we left the European Union today, and I fear that that is
becoming increasingly likely in relation to the great area of access to
the single market. Recently I have noticed that even those people who
have been advocating our leaving the European Union have ceased to say,
“Well, we could get a deal like Norway”. They have even
ceased to say that we could get a deal like that of Switzerland. There
is universal consensus on the continent among our partners and in the
Commission that no one would ever be allowed to do a Swiss-type deal
again. It is simply too complicated and difficult to administer with, I
think, 140 separate agreements with the European Union. That type of
scenario is out anyway, and anybody who takes a look at the situation
will realise that it is not a
possibility<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:22:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

increasingly hears—we hear it increasingly often in this
House—Eurosceptics and promoters of our leaving the European
Union who say, “We’ll do better than Norway or
Switzerland”. What do they mean by that? It seems to be far from
clear. I detect in conversations with continental colleagues 
<?notus-xml column=1504?>that in the type of circumstances in which we would leave the European
Union there would be very little inclination to come up with special
favours for us. Some have said, “Oh well, we have a deficit with
the European Union. The rest of the European Union exports to us more
than we export to them”. However, in point of fact, it is not a
question of how big the deficit is for us or how substantial our
imports or exports are; the leverage consists of the extent to which
our trade is a proportion of the trade of our continental partners. It
is generally never more than
25<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:23:47"></hs_TimeCode>%. Therefore,
I am afraid that we probably do not have a
leverage<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:23:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

no point in speculating about this, and it would be very dishonest to
do so. It is important that a serious effort is made to sort out the
consequences of our leaving the European Union. That should be set down
in black and white by a Government who are then committed to making
sure that they do not say anything which is deliberately untrue. They
would have to have had serious discussions with our colleagues and
partners in the rest of the European Union about what would and would
not eventuate from our leaving. The British public could then be
offered a genuinely honest choice between two scenarios, the details of
which would have been set out as truthfully as
possible.</hs_para>

Armstrong of Ilminster (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be brief.
The core purposes of this Bill are that there should be an “in

referendum should be; it is about whether there should be a referendum
and that it should be before the end of 2017. This amendment has no
bearing on those purposes. It leaves them unaffected. It requires the
Government in certain circumstances to do something which any
self-respecting Government would or should do in those circumstances.

Liddle (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I will not detain the House for
long. I think that there is pretty strong support all around the House
for this amendment. It certainly has the support of the Opposition, who
will vote for the proposition in the name of the noble Lord, Lord
Turnbull, if he chooses to test the opinion of the House. What is
needed in any “in or out” choice is an authoritative
assessment of Britain’s intended relationship with the European
Union should the people decide to withdraw from it. That does not have

any Government have taken to such an important issue and points to the

discussion. I am grateful to noble Lords who have spoken,
overwhelmingly in support of the amendment. There are certain common
themes. First, we are faced with a momentous decision. That was made
very clear by the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, in his intervention during

complex. I am particularly grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Shipley,

the question but the implications of the question. It was also agreed

assessment was unnecessary because it was going to happen anyway.

should not have a similar document on the consequences of a yes vote.
There are two reasons why I have not included that in the amendment.
The first is that the Prime Minister has promised us his view of what
the consequences of a yes vote would be after a renegotiation. The
second is, as was perceptively pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord
Davies of Stamford, that there is an asymmetry of information. A lot
more will be known about being in and staying in than about moving out
and something is needed to rectify that imbalance.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, would accept the proposal from the noble
Lord, Lord Wigley, and others. I hoped that he would accept the
principle of it and come back with something better. He complained that
this is not a perfect amendment. He has had the opportunity to take it
away and improve it but he has decided to spurn that. On that basis, I
do not think we can take this argument further.</hs_para>

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> My Lords, my amendment relates to
Gibraltar. Many of us in this House have a special concern for
Gibraltar and therefore wish to 
<?notus-xml column=1516?>ensure that it has a separate count. We all have a special
responsibility for Gibraltar. That is seen, for example, in the fact
that Gibraltar is represented by one of the constituencies of the UK in
the European Parliament. It has a very proud history, not least in the
Second World War.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013131000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000235">Coming here today, I
was musing how the people of Gibraltar, which is relatively
small—perhaps not much larger than a ward in my own former
constituency—none the less represent so much of the
Mediterranean. The current Chief Minister, Fabian Picardo, has a good
Mediterranean name; Sir Joshua Hassan showed that there was a Jewish
community in Gibraltar; Peter Caruana, the former Chief Minister, has a
good Maltese name; and even Albert Poggio, who is the excellent
representative of Gibraltar in this country, has an Italian name. There
is currently a total linkage of the people of Gibraltar with many
Mediterranean countries.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013131000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000236"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:16:42"></hs_TimeCode>The
relevance to Gibraltar of the European Union is in part because of the
dispute with Spain. Most if not all of us would agree that Spain has
been extremely unwise in seeking not to build up relations with
Gibraltar. There have been the disputes leading to endless delays at
the border, which harm Spanish nationals who work in Gibraltar.
Equally, there has been the dispute over the territorial waters. These
matters are litigated in Brussels. The people of Gibraltar quite
properly criticise some of what goes on in the European Union in
respect of the Spanish judge who I think recently presided over a
judgment to the detriment of Gibraltar. We criticise sometimes the fact
that, although Britain should represent the interests of Gibraltar in
Brussels, sometimes the UK representative has perhaps failed to notice
matters that are relevant to those people.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013131000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0001.htm#14013131000237">On one thing, though,
the people of Gibraltar are clear: it is in their interest to have the
UK there in the EU, fighting the Gibraltar cause and putting up the
objections to any particularly nationalist and populist sentiments put
forward by the Spanish. It is therefore most important that the
Gibraltese, the people of the Rock, are able to show their opinion and
to do so clearly, and that Gibraltar is established as a separate
electoral unit with a separate result. It could be an interesting point
if the people of the Rock were to say yes, because they recognised the
importance of their relationship with the European Union through the
UK, and yet the UK were to turn its back on the European Union and
therefore, in effect, on Gibraltar. However, that is for another day.
Both in chairing the Foreign Affairs Committee and in other fora, I
have long stood shoulder to shoulder with the people of Gibraltar. I am
happy to do so again to ensure that there is a separate count,
separately recorded. I beg to

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sorry that I missed the opening
remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes. His brevity in speaking today
is no doubt recognised by all across the Chamber. Any accusations that
he could be filibustering would be absolute nonsense. However, the
question raised about Gibraltar is slightly different. I understand the
position that my noble friend Lord Anderson comes from, but the main
thrust of my support for the amendment moved by my noble 
<?notus-xml column=1517?>friend Lord Foulkes—and my amendment,
Amendment 67 —is the need
to ensure that the people of Wales, Scotland,
Northern Ireland and England know exactly where they stand on this
matter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000239">As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>
I indicated before in a more general debate, if there is no publication
of the results for each nation, there will be speculation—and
speculation could be much more damaging than facing up to the reality
of whatever the result may be. I believe that, because of the
importance of the economic question, to which I referred earlier, there
will be a yes vote in Wales—but whatever the outcome, the people
of Wales and, indeed, the people of Scotland, Northern Ireland and
England, have a right to know where they stand. The overall result will
no doubt be taken on a United Kingdom basis and would be the
aggregation of those votes, but at least people would know where they
stood, and for that reason, I support the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000240"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Triesman" PimsId="4335" UID="14013131001220" xid="1688" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131001220">Lord
Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a fair enough amendment. Were
we to have been conducting this debate 25 or 30 years ago, I suspect
that everybody would have thought it wholly appropriate to take the
temperature of the nation as a whole, because we would not have seen
the degree of change within the United Kingdom and the extent of
devolution. Of course, it will still be useful to have a United
Kingdom-wide picture at the end of a referendum, and it is essential
that there should be—but on its own, that will not do
now<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T12:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000241">Twenty-five
years on, the home nations of the United Kingdom are sufficiently and
significantly distinct. People see themselves as having very distinct
interests. Some of them are to do with the individual nations and some
are to do with the character of the relationship that those nations
have with Europe. There are distinct issues about the development of
social policy, economic interests and the trajectories of economic
interests. It is not just that those factors have emerged in the
overall politics of the United Kingdom, but that the experience has
some depth. There is real depth of experience. It is not just a
constitutional formality that these things have taken place; it
represents very real experience, which people generally
treasure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000242" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000242">As
with all the issues in front of your Lordships in these debates, it is
very helpful to look at this from all angles. Were there to be a vote
to leave—and I have said in the House before that I profoundly
hope, as many other do, that there will not be—especially if it
were a narrow vote, and a strong belief persisted in Scotland and/or
Wales that their electorates did not want to leave, that would create
stresses within the United Kingdom that unquestionably would push those
home nations towards still greater devolution or full independence. If
we did it as a single country, it is likely to promote the belief that
the results in effect hide the way in which people in Scotland and
Wales would prefer to conduct their relationship with Europe, and the
fact that they wish to do so in a way that is significantly different
from the approach of England. Knowing all that, there is a very good
case for believing that it would put energy into further
separation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14013131000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000243">If there is an overall
vote, and if people know what the votes are in each of the home
nations, that does not necessarily mean that people will say,
“Actually, 
<?notus-xml column=1518?>on our own, we might very well have chosen to leave”—but
there would never be an allegation that they were caught by the fact
that the vote was hidden or that there was something unreasonable,
unfair or deceptive about it. That argument about process is
potentially the one that is most damaging, because it can never be

express my support for the points that my noble friend Lord Anderson
made about Gibraltar. It was certainly my experience when in the
Foreign Office that the European Union mitigates—though not
always successfully, it has to be said—the character and
intensity of some of the disagreements that occur with Spain. Even when
other members of the EU are supportive of Spain, it none the less damps
down the intensity of the discussion. Of course, Gibraltar sometimes
criticises the EU, but it is without question that Gibraltar would
prefer to have the armoury of the United Kingdom around it in the
discussions of those issues than to have to face them on its own. For
those reasons, it is particularly helpful that my noble friend made

Falkner of Margravine:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the other things
that we want to seek in a referendum would be transparency, as the
Electoral Commission recommends. Of course, in general elections, the
public know precisely how people have voted in different parts of the
country because of the constituency system. So you can tell how many
people are returned from which party from the respective countries of
the United Kingdom, and it is very clear. In that sense, I am rather
tempted by the amendment, which would allow that level of transparency
to come in, not as finely defined as that but broadly, for us to be
able to tell where opinions lie in one direction or the other. It would
help us to reflect on what to do next and how we might best reflect the
opinions of those constituent parts of the United Kingdom, depending on
the outcome of the referendum, along the lines of the amendment that we
have just
agreed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:27:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000247"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kerr of Kinlochard" PimsId="1274" UID="14013131001222" xid="1717" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131001222">Lord

Gibraltar, I point out first that no one has an amendment tabled to
Clause 4; nobody in this House objects in principle to the idea of
Gibraltar voting in the referendum. Although it was not in the original
Bill and was added in the House of Commons, nobody here is objecting to
it, and I certainly do not do so. It is 
<?notus-xml column=1519?>a little anomalous that a British overseas territory should vote, of
course, but that the Gibraltarians should be able to vote is not nearly
as anomalous as the expatriates across the frontier in Spain being
unable to vote. Gibraltar is a country member of the European Union;
large numbers of European Union rules do not apply there—it does
not have VAT, and it is not in the customs union, the common commercial
policy, the CAP or the CFP. On the other hand, expatriates would see a
very serious change to what they might legitimately have expected, if
the referendum produced a no—but we will come to that under a
later amendment, and I shall not pursue it

very small point that I would like to make is on the Channel Islands,

Gibraltar. They apply the common agricultural policy, and their main

come to my bigger point about the nature of probing amendments. We
worked quite hard for quite a long time a week ago. A number of noble
Lords withdrew amendments, for which there was quite a lot of support
around the House, on the understanding that there would be reflection.
I have heard nothing from the sponsors of the Bill on the major
amendment I withdrew. I have heard from one distinguished Member of
this House—he is now in his place—but I am not going to
embarrass him by saying who he is or what he said. Probing amendments
are well worth it if they are designed to see whether the sponsors will
accept them or will come back with a different version of them.
However, on none of the amendments that were withdrawn in our
eight-hour debate last week with a view to coming back on Report, have
the sponsors subsequently been in touch with the proposers. What is the
point of a probing amendment? It seems to me the only way one can get
the defects in this Bill corrected is in the Division Lobbies. The
House has voted three times, and three times by substantial majorities
has amended the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

more than once that, once one amendment was carried and therefore the
argument that the Bill must stay intact had collapsed, there was no
cost to the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, in buying an amendment. Indeed,
there might be considerable advantage. I had hoped that today’s
debate would take place in a less confrontational way than last
week’s one started and that we would be more consensual and try
to find areas of agreement. However, on the previous amendment on which
we have just voted, the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, must have known from
the debate that the Division Lobbies would not give the
result he wanted. Why did he not feel that he could accept the
amendment? Why do we have to force it on him? If anything is wasting
time, it is this.</hs_para>

had an hour and a half’s debate and then a Division on something
that plainly was correct and was going to be written into the Bill one
way or another. The only argument that the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs,
produced against it was that it was unnecessary. He did not say it
would be damaging. I do not think he was right. The House did not think
he was right and clearly thought the amendment was necessary. If the
noble Lord thinks that it is unnecessary but does not do any harm why
does he not buy it? What does the House expect to happen when it puts
forward probing amendments and takes them away again? It expects
something to occur, perhaps in the gap between Committee and Report.
The gap is there for approaches. I had hoped that there would be an
approach to me about Amendment 10 by now and I am very sorry that has
not happened<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:33:49"></hs_TimeCode>. It

Woolmer of Leeds (Lab):</Member></B> Following up on that contribution
to the debate, the Isle of Man, which is a Crown dependency, is in the
same situation. Its relationship with the EU is determined by Protocol
3 of the 1972 accession Act. The United Kingdom has traditionally been
responsible for the foreign relationships and foreign affairs of the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. It would be helpful to
know—not necessarily today, but on another occasion—to
what extent the United Kingdom Government are committed to consultation
with the Crown dependencies, such as the Channel Islands and the Isle
of Man, on the effect of a possible withdrawal of the UK from the EU,
and doing so in advance of any referendum, to take their views and to
enable them to be made clear. If the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, is able to
comment today, which is possibly unlikely, that would be helpful. If
not, perhaps we could return to it on a future

course there would be very little cost. However, let us be real. We

that the people of Gibraltar should be able to vote on this issue.

citizens living in the United Kingdom who are taxpayers—the

greatly help the proper consideration of the Bill if, between now and

people who want to help noble Lords draft measures and who can suggest
amendments and schedules. It would be good to have a schedule on the
conduct of the referendum, as we have had in previous Bills. In the
hope that the noble Lord might listen to our plea—it is not just
my plea, but our plea—and that we do not have to divide so often

Williams of Elvel:</Member></B> This is a probing amendment. The
question is: how can the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, and the House involve
devolved Administrations in the conduct of the referendum? There are
two issues. This, in a sense, follows on from the previous debate.
First, there is the potential for a disaster if we do not get this
right. Secondly, there is the question of how devolved Administrations
can indicate to their constituents what their considered view
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000277">Let me
take the first issue. I give your Lordships a rather irreverent
description of the United Kingdom. Not long ago, the former First
Minister of Wales, Rhodri Morgan, had a meeting with Alex Salmond.
“The United Kingdom”, Rhodri said, “consisted of
one large mammal: an elephant and three fleas”. The elephant was
England and the three fleas were Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
As it happened, Mr Salmond 
<?notus-xml column=1525?>was not entirely pleased with this analogy, nor would many of my
colleagues in Wales or Northern Ireland be. Nevertheless, let us
consider the truth of the matter. England, in population
terms—hence, in terms of votes—outweighs the combined
total of the three devolved Administrations by a factor of roughly
five. In other words, the elephant can easily vote on any issue to
squash the fleas. To be more precise, England might vote in any UK-wide
referendum by such a wide margin that the matter would be settled,
regardless of how the votes fell in Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:51:03"></hs_TimeCode>. Therein
lies the
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:51:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

“in or out” referendum as proposed in the Bill of the
noble Lord, Lord Dobbs. By the way, in the light of what my noble
friend Lord Giddens said about referendums, I should note that, in my
experience, they always start off with one question and end up with
another, usually on whether the electorate want to give the Government
of the day a kicking. That happened in France, for instance, in the
referendum there. I hope that that will not translate into the
referendum that the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs, proposes. If all
constituent parts of the United Kingdom, the elephant and the fleas,
voted in the same way, there would be no problem. All would be harmony.
As for the specific referendum proposals that we have in front of us,
if Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland showed the same appetite as
England for staying in or leaving the European Union and all were as
one, there would be no
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>. Alas,
on the current evidence on this issue, that may not be

situation as I understand it to be in the four regions that make up the
UK and try to gauge their attitudes to UK membership of the European
Union. I cannot speak for Northern Ireland as I have no great knowledge
of the feeling there on this issue. I have had to consult colleagues.
All that I can say is that it would look odd, to say the least, to see
Northern Ireland out of the European Union and the Republic staying in.
This matter, I am told, worries the Republic a lot. That might please
some people but it would surely disconcert others. After consulting
noble colleagues on the spread of opinion, I am led to believe that a
vote in Northern Ireland would go, on a best guess, 60:40 in favour of
remaining in the European Union. As is normal, some noble colleagues
think that it might go the other way, but I am not there to judge
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14013131000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000280">As for
Wales, the position is equally unclear. A distinguished academic wrote
only a few days ago that as far as he
knew,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14013131000438" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000438">“nobody

that Wales has benefited greatly from UK membership. The protections
afforded by the EU treaties and consequent directives and regulations,
as well as the flow of funds from the EU, have been much welcomed.
Economic development, environmental policy and the protection of social
and employment rights are just a few examples. In short, it is hard to
see the Welsh electorate voting to reject all that has been of benefit
to them from UK membership of the European Union. Nevertheless, some
polling evidence in Wales suggests that there might be a substantial
“out” vote.</hs_parafo>

the picture is not entirely clear. After all, the Scottish National
Party has spent a good deal of energy, and quite a lot of money on
legal fees, arguing for continued Scottish membership of the European
Union in the event of Scotland leaving the United Kingdom. It would be
almost absurdly idiosyncratic for it to advocate the UK leaving the EU
if Scotland itself voted to remain part of the UK. That being so, and
given the relative weakness of the Conservatives and UKIP in Scotland,
I think that it would be safe to assume that the Scottish vote would
fall in favour of the UK staying in the European
Union<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:55:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

England—well, who knows? It seems clear that a large section of
the Conservative vote and, I imagine, the totality of the UKIP vote
would be in favour of the UK leaving the European Union. Of course, I
very much hope that I am wrong but I very much fear that the English
vote may go quite powerfully in what I personally regard as the wrong
direction. Worse still—and here is the major point—I fear
that it would go in the wrong direction to the point where an English
majority might overwhelm the totality of the vote in the Celtic
fringe<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:56:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

It could easily be that my worst-case scenario comes about: England
votes for exit in sufficient numbers to overcome the Celtic fringe
voting to stay in. With an overall majority in its pocket, the
Conservative Government of the day would then presumably proceed to
dismantle all the arrangements between the UK and the European Union
which have been put in place since we first joined all those years ago.
So far, so relatively simple—or disastrous, according to your

at present a theoretical problem becomes a constitutional nightmare.
The new Conservative Government set about legislating for the exit of
the United Kingdom from the European Union. However, how would that
play with the Celtic fringe countries if the result of the “in
or out” referendum had been a thumping “out” in
England and an equally thumping “in” in Scotland, Wales
and Northern Ireland, and the overall vote in the UK—including,
of course, Gibraltar—when totted up amounted to

Ireland, noble Lords with better knowledge than mine will no doubt have
their own opinion. All I can say is that there would probably be, as
usual, political fireworks, and possibly real fireworks as well. As for
Wales, I am afraid that I imagine there would be the customary sullen
acceptance of the historical domination of the English—expressed
yet again—over their Celtic neighbour, but it would be sullen
anger to be fed into resentment in the future. As for Scotland, I
cannot even begin to imagine the reaction of Scots when they hear that
the English have kicked them out of Europe. It just does not bear

have to be honest and say that I doubt whether it will be possible,

the UK Government. In the normal course of events, this is a

it does<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T13:58:37"></hs_TimeCode>.

amendment is that devolved Administrations should have the right to
request of the Secretary of State what amounts to an opt-out from the
referendum proposed in the Bill. In deciding whether to make such a
request, each devolved Assembly or Parliament shall debate the grounds
for such a request and explain them to the Secretary of State in a
memorandum after consulting, in one form or another, their electorate.
It goes, I think, without saying that each one would take into account
the advantages and disadvantages for their electorate in taking part in
the “in or out” referendum—in other words, the
debate would be a responsible one and not just a petulant gesture.

leads me to my second issue. Let us suppose that Wales, for instance,
was to make such a request. The Secretary of State, under my proposal,
would have the right to refuse it. The Welsh memorandum would be the
property of the Welsh Assembly, which might and almost certainly would
wish to publish it. If the Secretary of State were to accede to the
request to make an order removing Wales from the United Kingdom for the
purposes, and only for the purposes, of the referendum, he would be
obliged to publish the memorandum to support his decision. In either
event, the formal view of the Welsh Assembly, whose Members are elected
by the citizens of Wales, would be in the public
domain<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:00:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Scotland were to make such a request. Judging from what I have heard in
previous debates in this House, I think it goes without saying that if
the Scots voted for independence next September, the Secretary of State
would be pretty well bound to accede to its request since Scotland was
removing itself from the United Kingdom however defined. In fact, even
if my amendment is not accepted, the Scottish vote for independence
would bring with it legislation in some form to exempt Scotland in the
UK referendum<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:01:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, if the Scots were to remain in the United Kingdom and the
Secretary of State rejected the Scottish Parliament’s request

also be argued that foreign affairs are no business of the devolved

handled by Members of the UK Parliament on their behalf. It is
precisely those policy areas which are the responsibility of the
devolved Administrations—environment, education, culture and so
on—where UK membership of the EU has been most beneficial. They
have a right, and I would argue a duty, to defend that. Otherwise,
there is no point in them being there.</hs_para>

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, after speaking to Amendment
75 in my name, I shall come back to the interesting points put forward
by the noble Lord, Lord Williams. Amendment 75 is simple and I would
have thought that, if the owners of this Bill were in a mind to accept
amendments, this would be the sort of amendment that should be built
in. It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:04:27"></hs_TimeCode> purely
and simply makes provision—were the Scottish to vote for
independence in the referendum, and we do not know whether they
will—to take Scotland out of the Bill. That may not be what the
majority of noble Lords in this Chamber want, but it could happen, and
it strikes me as being a little short-sighted to put through a Bill
that does not make provision for one of the eventualities that we have
spent considerable time discussing, including just yesterday in this
Chamber. I therefore put this forward as a constructive amendment to be
considered at the appropriate stage—if not now, in fine-tuning
the Bill—to meet that
eventuality<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000294" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000294">The
amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Williams, touches on some
pretty sensitive areas. I, like the noble Lord, want to see all parts
of the United Kingdom voting yes to remain within the European Union.
Certainly, there need to be changes to the European Union, but I want
Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and England—the UK, as it is
now<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:05:38"></hs_TimeCode>—to be
members of the European Union. That is my starting point and that is
what I will be campaigning
for<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:05:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000295" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000295">However,
issues arise in the context of the referendum because the interests in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are, to some extent, different
from the mainstream interests in England. For example, in Scotland,
there is 
<?notus-xml column=1529?>the question of fisheries. A lot of attention has been given to that
in recent months and the Government have made some
progress on some issues. But Scotland always wants to have its
Ministers associated with any UK team. The problem at present is that,
within the UK ministerial team negotiating in Brussels, Ministers from
the devolved Administrations have to follow the lead of the UK
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:06:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000296">That
is fine if there is unanimity of view on these issues, but there are
occasions on matters such as fisheries where there may not be. Whatever
our relationships are with each other in the United Kingdom over the
coming years, our relationship with the European Union must develop in
a way that allows flexibility to take that consideration on board. That
must arise in countries such as Spain as well, where Catalonia or the
Basque country may have a slightly different view from Madrid on some
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:07:01"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
European Union insists on being a totally centralist organisation,
which I do not believe in its essence it has to be if the principle of
subsidiarity works through, then the European Union must work towards
an ability to take these variations from area to area on
board<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:07:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000297">I
mentioned Scotland and now I come to Wales and the farming regime,
which I mentioned earlier. On the sheep-meat regime, particularly as
sheep are the greater part of the Welsh agricultural economy, there
have been times when the Minister from the Government in Wales spoke in
the UK team in Brussels on these matters. But if there is an idea that
the well-being of vital sectors such as fisheries in Scotland and sheep
farming in Wales is going to be lost, swamped by the English vote in a
referendum, that can build up tensions. This needs to be thought
through<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:08:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I do
not think that the noble Lord, Lord Williams, necessarily sees this as
the formula to provide all the answers, but he is raising the questions

clearly, the co-operation that has developed over the past 15 years or

movement, which is so easy. If the Irish Republic were in the European

Liddle:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be very brief on this point, but
my noble friend Lord Williams has raised an issue of fundamental
importance with this amendment. It covers the role of the devolved
Administrations, their views on EU membership and how those views are
communicated to their electorate, and the risks that this whole venture
poses to the union we care about most, the union of the United Kingdom.

Liddle:</Member></B> I am talking about an “in or out”
referendum, which this Bill is designed to generate in quick time. It
is quite possible that the different parts of the UK will vote in
different ways. As I said at Second Reading, the risk is that
independence is defeated in the Scottish referendum this autumn, but
that an EU referendum in which Scotland voted to stay in and England,
by a majority, took the United Kingdom out would just reignite the
whole argument about Scottish nationalism once again. The Government
have to think very seriously about this problem. I quite accept that it
is not easily dealt with through amendments to this Bill, but it is a
very serious issue for the future of the

and Lord Wigley, for the way they introduced this very important
issue—there is no denying its importance. The noble Lord, Lord
Wigley, himself readily acknowledged that the amendments go beyond the
scope of this very simple and very narrow Bill, and the technical
answer to them is that the UK’s relationship with the EU is not
a devolved matter. However, that of course is not a sufficient answer

55 is a probing amendment, which has been put in a dignified and
detailed matter, and I want to try to deal with it in that spirit. I
have specific concerns about the amendments. The logical consequence of
this group of amendments would be to raise at least the possibility
that some parts of our United Kingdom might be denied the opportunity
to vote. It would render a national referendum pointless because of the
involvement of devolved parliaments, which I am sure is not the
intention of the noble Lords who tabled these amendments at all. Noble
Lords have waved the flags of the various constituent parts of our
United Kingdom with pride, and I congratulate them on that. They have
raised useful points which we should all be sensitive to, such as the
possibility of Northern Ireland and the Republic being on opposite
sides of the fence. It is a very serious, complicated issue. However,
along with all the other issues that have been raised, that is
fundamentally a political challenge. They are not ones

those residents who may be affected directly by the outcome should be
allowed to express an opinion through the ballot box. I concur with
that decision in Scotland, rightly made on behalf of EU voters living
in Scotland—although in my view voters entitled to vote in a
parliamentary election in Scotland but resident elsewhere in the UK or
overseas should be allowed to vote as well. But that is not the
proposition in Scotland so, be that as it may, the principle
established in Scotland is that the local election register should be
used in that referendum so that all residents living in Scotland can
register to vote.</hs_para>

ensure that all persons entitled to vote in a local authority election

entitlement is larger than that of those who have the parliamentary

rightly, levied in this state—we should have respect for a fresh
maxim, “No taxation without participation”. There is a
valid, basic and democratic case that should permit them to vote in a
referendum deciding on the future in the European Union of the country
in which they have residence and in which most of them work. Would it
not be odd if these people had the right to elect their councillors, or

areas. The forthcoming Scottish referendum has exactly the same

want to illuminate my request that European Union citizens be included
in this vital matter affecting them from a personal perspective. I
therefore declare an interest. I am married to a German citizen. There
are many reasons why large numbers of EU citizens live in our country,
which has the largest number of expatriate EU citizens of all the EU
countries. However, one fact is indisputable, as other noble Lords have
mentioned: that they pay taxes in this country. We incurred the wrath
of the Polish Foreign Minister, Mr Sikorski, only five or
six weeks ago when, in the hostile debate against eastern European
workers on the whole, he reminded our country that those people live
here and that they contribute, work and pay taxes here. I do not think
that we won a friend in Poland by having gone out of our way
intentionally to annoy member countries whose citizens have made such a
positive contribution. No one who has had to have construction work
done, or who needed babysitting or anything else, in the south-east in
the past 15 years can doubt that.</hs_para>

Conservative Benches might wonder why, if some of these citizens make
such a positive contribution—in the case of the one I know, it
has been a contribution of 20 years—they do not become nationals
of this country. In that case, they would be entitled to vote. I want
to address that specifically. There are certain countries which have,
as Germany had in place, a statute against the holding of dual
nationality. That can be one reason why people do not take the
nationality of the country in which they have worked and lived. It does
not diminish for a second their loyalty here. If you look at their
voting records, in terms of their entitlements, they take up their
entitlements when they can.</hs_para>

possible reason, and in my case this is a very personal one. I travel
to lots of countries where a white person or—I am afraid to say,
after the Iraq and Afghanistan wars—a person associated with the
foreign policy of our country may not necessarily consider themselves
safe. My origins lie in Pakistan. My daughter was young and we went
back to Pakistan frequently to see my aged parents. I requested my
husband not to adopt British nationality in the light of the Daniel
Pearl murder because I could see, palpably 
<?notus-xml column=1536?>around me in Pakistan, that no white person ventured into the country.
You could see that even in the queue for immigration. There was a
period when business investment and everything collapsed because the
Pakistani state was incapable of guaranteeing people’s safety.
There were particular attitudes in these countries towards the West in
general and the United Kingdom specifically.

basis, there may be numerous other reasons why all sorts of people come

contentious because I am not sure I completely agree with the argument
put forward by my noble friend Lord Shipley. I feel strongly that
Britain should remain within the European Union, unless it might be as
the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, just said and at some point in the
future Britain becomes rather destructive to the European Union and we
might come out. I do not know. I think we have to take this issue as a
responsibility that British citizens take upon themselves to make up
our mind what we are going to do. I do not know that the local
government or national electoral rolls are the right ones. If I were
given a logical choice, I would say it should be British citizens and
perhaps I would add those with 10 years’ residence or less or
something like that. It is very difficult to do in a list that has to
be brought together and it would probably be impossible for residency.
I do not know. However, I do not think the arguments are compelling one
way on this. I think that if we come to a referendum, it is up to
British citizens to make up their own mind and, if they want to commit
suicide economically and in every other way, that is up to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000337" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000337"><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Whitaker" PimsId="4578" UID="14013131001256" xid="1494" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131001256"><B>Baroness

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:11:41"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
should state that I have dual Irish and British nationality. I am
putting forward an argument. I do not think there is a perfect answer
to this, but I would exclude purely Irish citizens under this
definition. In fact, you could argue very strongly that the Republic of
Ireland would be by far the most affected other EU member state and
therefore perhaps you should include all Irish citizens. I do not think
one could sustain that. I just want to make the point that as Britain
we need to make up our mind on this area, and we need to be responsible
for our decision. I do 
<?notus-xml column=1538?>not think the argument is total, so I put forward  a potential
opposite view. I take a great interest in this small
debate, but I do not think it
is quite as
straightforward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:43:38"></hs_TimeCode>

Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, I have been very concerned to
understand how the conduct of the debate in the course of a referendum
could be most useful. Noble Lords will recall that we debated
parliamentary constituency boundaries at great length; it was argued
that they work for parliamentary elections despite the fact that the
homogeneity of almost any of the constituencies was significantly
disrupted. Some of them were essentially very artificial; they were no
longer built around any kind of core principle but were to meet a
numerical target, which I did not agree with but I fully
understood<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:44:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:44:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000344" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000344">I
make that point because, by and large, local authorities are not
constructed that way. Some of the very large ones may be, but a very
significant number are constructed around entities where you can see
the degree of homogeneity of the economic system that applies in that
part of the country. That seems to me to be very important, because I
believe that one of the telling debates during any referendum would be
on the balance of economic interests for us as a community. Do we see a
future? Will our kids continue to want to live here? Will the economic
community be capable of sustaining the sorts of schools and kinds of
medical provision that we want? All those will be live issues. It is no
accident that chambers of commerce and a great many other economic
entities in all those communities are organised with that kind of
boundary in mind. That is where many of these most telling debates will
take place—they will not take place on the grounds of
constituencies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:45:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:44:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:46:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14013131000458" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000458">2.45

realise that this is about voting, but the voting will be at the end of
a process of debate, and if we can help to formulate a mechanism in
which that debate is likely to be most relevant and successful, that
seems to me of very considerable benefit in the whole process that
could lead up to the referendum. Could the noble Lord, Lord Dobbs,
reflect on that? I take the point that this is about making
arrangements so that people get a chance to express a view on the
future of the United Kingdom in the EU. I would like to believe that he
thinks, and I feel sure that he will, that it is important to know that
the quality of the debate will be as fundamental before that decision

issues that need to be properly and thoroughly addressed before we put
arrangements in place for any kind of referendum on our future in the
European 
<?notus-xml column=1539?>Union. On this side of the House, Members would be very sympathetic to
the principle that my noble friend Lord Kinnock set out that we should
have the broadest possible vote on this fundamental issue. I know the
sort of arguments that some people might make against this. One is that
that it would set a precedent for voting in general elections and local
elections, but I do not think that it would. An EU referendum is
fundamentally different; it is certainly not a vote for a councillor,
an MP or a Government. It is a vote not for eternity, perhaps, but for
generations ahead. The Prime Minister’s phrase about “no
return ticket” comes to mind. It is a different type of vote
from any other that we are likely to have in this country in the near
future, and therefore needs to be considered
differently<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:48:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:47:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000349">There
is a second, more low-level political point. Even now, with the debate
that we have had, I am sure that we run the risk of seeing some

imagine that being the headline—and I see that the noble Lord,

such a headline would be
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14013131000350" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131000350">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-31T14:49:34"></hs_TimeCode>

enormous enhancers of human freedom. Let the UKIP people say how they

Report, because no doubt we shall discuss this again in great detail at
that stage. I will say, in response partly to my noble friend Lord
Teverson and also to my noble friend Lord Dobbs, that we have to think
through the question: is this only for British citizens? If it is,
citizens of the Republic of Ireland would have to be excluded, in which
case my noble friend Lord Dobbs would have to amend the Bill because
the relevant clause is out of date on the basis of what he just said.
Is this for British citizens or for all those who will be directly
affected by the outcome? In moving Amendment 57, I said that a change
needed to be made because those who will be directly affected by the
outcome should have a vote. That same principle will apply when we get
to Amendments 59 and 63, and others later in the debate. For the
moment, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14013131001311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140131-0002.htm#14013131001311">Amendment

very carefully to what the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said. My role as
government Chief Whip is very clear. In scheduling Private
Members’ Bills, it has always been the practice of all
government Chief Whips in all parties to consult the sponsor of the
relevant Bill in that scheduling. My role in the proceedings has been
to facilitate the scrutiny of this Bill by this House. As ever,
progress is in the hands of the House. We are a self-regulating House.
Therefore, the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, is, indeed,
a legitimate Motion. As he says, it is unusual for a Back-Bencher to
move it, but it is by no means not available to him. That is a double
negative, but I mean that his action in moving the Motion is

it will progress so slowly that it will not rise, at this rate, until
