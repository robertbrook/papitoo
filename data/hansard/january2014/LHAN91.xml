about the direction in which the European Union is heading is out there
and ignoring it will not make it go away. Therefore it is right that
the Conservative Party’s political view is that we will
negotiate a fresh settlement and then hold an in/out referendum before
the end of 2017. We on these Benches feel that we need to let Britain
decide, and I hope noble Lords will follow in the referendum Bill we

Attlee (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is too early to provide such an
assessment. We have taken the advice of the independent Migration
Advisory Committee, which concluded that it would not be sensible or
helpful to policymakers to make predictions about likely volumes. The
Government are doing everything they can to ensure that people who come
to the UK from the EU do so for the right reasons—to work hard
and to contribute to our economy and
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000024"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T14:45:12"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Balfe" PimsId="3860" UID="14010750000773" xid="2210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000773">Lord
Balfe (Con):</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for his reply. Does
he accept that migrants from these countries, many of them highly
skilled, come to Britain because the expanding, vibrant and welcoming
economy gives many opportunities for self-advancement? Secondly, has he
sympathy with Romanian Ministers who have pointed out that, with
866,000 persons in the UK being registered unemployed for more than a
year, the UK Government might be well employed in reviewing benefit
levels for the UK unemployed to a level at which they might be
encouraged to apply for some of the vacancies currently being filled by

labour around the community, so if one country is doing better than
another we can get a flow of labour to equalise things. On the second

unpleasantness in parts of the media over the past few weeks about
Romanians and Bulgarians, has the noble Earl had the time to see the
study recently published by a team from University College London,
which shows that immigrants from the EU over the past 10 years have
contributed far more in taxes and national insurance contributions than
they have consumed in public services and in benefits, unlike the
position of the native population? In other words, they have supplied
us with a substantial financial and fiscal surplus, to the benefit of
every taxpayer in this country. Is there not every probability that
hard-working Romanians and Bulgarians will follow in the same

remind the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, that when we debated the question
of former satellite countries joining the European Union, some of us
were considerably less than wholehearted. In fact, we queried whether
the figure of 13,000 likely new arrivals was accurate. As it turned
out, of course, it was nearer a million than 13,000, so our

Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister said in
his Answer that it was too early to make an assessment of the numbers.
However, some of the language from the Government has been quite
alarmist rhetoric. Would it not be better to look at measures to stop
any workers being exploited, such as stronger and better enforcement of
the national minimum wage, and also to tackle those loopholes that
allow agency workers, often from overseas, to be employed at much lower
rates than home-grown

Baroness. One thing that we have done is to increase very significantly
the fixed penalty for employers for not paying the minimum wage. We
also need to look at a number of instances where immigrant labour is
being abused—for instance, agricultural workers from eastern
Europe. The noble Baroness is
right<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T14:50:14"></hs_TimeCode>; we need

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble
friend for raising this important matter. As noble Lords have just
heard me say, we define the term “troubled families” by
using specific criteria. Often that does not give the true picture of
just how entrenched those families are in terms of their dependency 
<?notus-xml column=1393?>and how some of them have to deal with violence,
drugs and crime in intergenerational families. In the past, lots of
agencies have worked with them but got nowhere fast. On the point my
noble friend raises, many social workers want to come forward and be
the key worker in charge of working with those families. There has been
no problem whatever with recruiting for that, and the local authorities
have been very proactive in moving forward with this programme. As
regards turning those families around, this programme is about reducing
their dependency on the state and giving them, and especially their
children, the chance of a decent
life<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T14:54:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Howarth of Newport" PimsId="4870" UID="14010750000798" xid="1872" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000798">Lord

substantive issues between the two parties, rather than procedural
matters, it would be the wrong time to try to attribute blame. It is

that the present conflict arises from the power struggle between Riek

an existing programme but additional aid to help these people in such a
desperate situation? With regard to the negotiations that have begun in
Addis Ababa, what discussions are the Government, as a member of the

issues with President Salva Kiir and his original team. The fact that
negotiations are taking place in Addis Ababa is, of course, welcome, if
the participants take the process seriously. The United Nations
Security Council passing a resolution demanding a ceasefire while the
negotiations took place would at least indicate the world’s
abhorrence for this violent outbreak. I do not believe that it would

of statements in which he has called for the violence to stop.
As the noble Lord is aware, the United Nations Security Council
resolution, which I think was passed on Christmas Eve, was specifically
intended to ensure that further troops were put on the ground quickly
to try to stop the situation deteriorating. They also strengthened the
existing UN mission in South Sudan to support its humanitarian work so
that the human rights abuses that were occurring were properly
documented to ensure that responsibility follows these acts. The
negotiations between the representatives of the two parties are
ongoing. We have done a huge amount of work in the background but also
in leading these negotiations. The Foreign Office’s political
director, Simon Gass, was there throughout the Christmas period,
working with the US and his other counterparts. If it is felt that a
further UN Security Council resolution is required over and
above the statement issued on 30 December, I will certainly
take the noble Lord’s views
back.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000066"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:05:38"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Alton of Liverpool" PimsId="3643" UID="14010750000816" xid="1050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000816">Lord

important point. In relation to the UN Security Council resolution, a
further five battalions were committed, which amounts to about 5,500
troops. 
<?notus-xml column=1397?>Three police units were
specifically granted, which amounts to about 480 personnel—those
are the increased numbers at this stage. The noble Lord makes an
important point about regional challenges, but one of the positive
features of this current tragedy is how, for example, Ethiopia, Uganda
and even Sudan have acted in a much more responsible way. There has
certainly been a suggestion that there could be some joint working
between Sudan and South Sudan, maybe in relation to keeping the oil
flows

1.5 million children with special educational
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Without
strong accountability mechanisms, families will have no way of ensuring
that the services they need are available and it is likely that parents

local authority must publish comments from children with SEN and their
parents about its local offer, as well as the authority’s
response to those comments. I am pleased that the Government have
strengthened this further with Amendment 33C, requiring local
authorities to publish what action they intend to take in response to
comments from parents about the local
offer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:10:58"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
I and, indeed, the Special Educational Consortium, which is backing
this amendment, have serious concerns that the Government’s
Amendment 33C has been placed in the wrong clause and will
therefore fail to have its desired effect. Clause 30 refers to the
local offer only as a source of information and advice and not
to the provision contained in the offer, and
therefore the impact of the Government’s very
welcome amendment will be felt only in terms of the quality of
information and advice. It is Clause 27, relating to reviewing
education and care provision, that must be
amended<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:11:51"></hs_TimeCode>. Will
the Government therefore commit to moving Amendment 33C to Clause 27 to
ensure that improvements to local services are made? If they
commit to doing so, this will make a huge difference and go a long way
to reducing the battles that parents face. However, I fear that it will
still not go far enough in ensuring that local authorities are held to
account and that essential improvements to local services are
made<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:12:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

27 would require a local authority, after publishing comments on the
local offer, to involve parents and young people in producing an action

revise the local offer accordingly, ensuring that local support was
sufficient to meet local needs. This would ensure that local 
<?notus-xml column=1399?>authorities and parents, along with other parties
including school governors and children’s centres, worked
together at the earliest possible stage to ensure that local provision

amendment would ensure that local authorities not only work with
parents and other interested parties to develop an action plan to
improve service provision in the local offer but review and report on
progress against their action plans. This is exactly the robust
accountability measure that will ensure that local support is
responsive to local needs—something that the Government have
said time and again they wish to see.

least, can the Government confirm that the code of practice will
include further information relating to the action that local
authorities will take in response to parents’ comments about the
local offer so that parents and other interested parties, listed in
Clause 27(3), will be involved in drawing up an action plan to improve
the local offer along with the necessary mechanisms for reviewing and
reporting on progress against such an action plan? I beg to

the name of the noble Lord, Lord Low, to which my noble friend Lady
Hughes of Stretford has added her name. We also add our support to the
amendment proposed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and to the
arguments she eloquently made in proposing it. There is a compelling
case for local authorities to be expected to take action where
education and care provision is judged to be insufficient and it is
important that we have adequate means to address
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000074">Our
amendments relate to Clause 30, which introduces the concept of the
local offer and places a duty on local authorities to publish the local
offer for children and young people with special educational needs, to
keep it under review and to revise it periodically. Obviously, we
welcome the principle of the local offer, as does most of the sector,
but our concern is to make the local offer tangible, accessible and
responsive. One concern which our amendments seek to address is that
the wording of subsection (1)(a) requires the local authority to set
out in the local offer only what it “expects to be
available”. We believe that this wording is ambiguous and could
be used by local authorities to duck out of their responsibilities to
deliver a quality package of
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000075">Parents,
children and young people have expectations that the local offer will
be an improvement on what has gone before, but, understandably, they
want a more formal understanding with the local authority about the
service that they can rely on being provided. Many parents have spent
their lives fighting for basic 
<?notus-xml column=1400?>support for their children and are naturally
suspicious of wish lists. We believe that our amendments to
replace “expects to be available” with “which is
available” will give those parents the added guarantees they

very much welcome a culture of innovation in this sector and families
will, of course, be interested in being kept informed of newly
developing services. This should all be part of a greater commitment to
information sharing and dialogue between families and the local

very different from the function of the local offer, which should be
about what is available to families and what they can access now with
some degree of
certainty.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14010750000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000079">The
Minister also drew our attention to the draft code of practice, where
more detail is provided. Again, it is useful to have this additional
information for parents. However, it does not answer our central
concern about the status of the local offer and the extent to which it
can be relied on. In fact, while the draft code of practice contains
good supplementary guidance, it continues to use the phrase that the
local authority should provide information about services which it
“expects to be
available<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:19:19"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Also, as we have debated before, it is important to have the
fundamental principles set out in the Bill and we believe that this is
a key feature which will give parents, children and young people
confidence in services for the future.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:19:31"></hs_TimeCode> is more
than an argument about semantics. Our amendment will help to make the
local offer a real, living commitment that will help to make the new
proposals a
success<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:19:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000080">My
noble friend Lady Hughes of Stretford has also added her name to
Amendment 33D standing in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Low, who, I
am sure, will speak on it shortly. The amendment seeks to give families
confidence in the quality of the local offer by requiring the Secretary
of State to lay regulations specifying the standards and quality of
education, health and social care provision which local authorities
must meet. These regulations would need to be approved by both Houses.
In addition, it would require the Secretary of State to issue guidance
on how to meet the regulations and publish information on the
regulations on the department’s
website<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:20:24"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendment addresses the continuing concern in the sector that services
across the UK will be patchy and that a postcode lottery of services
will develop. Without the amendment, families will be at the mercy of
local authority budgets, with all the uncertainty of provision that
already occurs as a result of budget cuts, and so
what starts 
<?notus-xml column=1401?>out as a promising new regime of integrated services may quickly descend
into a fight to retain any kind of minimum
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:20:54"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is the added challenge that there is little incentive for local
authorities to develop high-quality provision as it will simply attract
clients from other areas, letting the poorer providers off the
hook.</hs_para>

amendment also addresses the knowledge gap that arises from Clause
21(1)(a), which defines SEN provision in a local area as being relative
to all mainstream schools in England. However, without minimum national
standards, all a local authority can do is define the offer relative to
its own local provision. When we debated this issue in Grand Committee
we explored whether setting minimum standards of provision might be the
answer, but we accept the limitations of this solution, which is the
danger that minimum standards might become the norm. Therefore, our new
amendment seeks to address this problem in a different way, allowing
scope for services to be different around the UK to meet local and
individual needs but nevertheless requiring that they meet overall
quality standard benchmarks.</hs_para>

be a measure against which parents could judge the acceptability of

which will give parents confidence in the new provision and guarantee
the success of the new regime, the principles of which, as I have said,

I would like to say a few words on the government amendment in this
group. In Grand Committee we raised the concern, shared by many, that
the obligation on local authorities to publish comments on the local
offer from parents, children and young people did not sufficiently hold
them to account or require them to be responsive to the views
expressed. Giving a more powerful voice to those, often isolated,
individuals struggling to access services ought to be at the heart of
these improvements. That is why we welcome the government amendment,
which would require local authorities to publish the action they intend
to take in response to the comments received. However, picking up on
the theme of the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, there is a
further stage to be addressed if we are serious about making change,
which is that the local authority should also be required to work with
those who have been consulted to produce an action plan to address any
identified
failings<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:23:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000084">It
would be helpful if the Minister could explain how this additional
challenge will be addressed. It may be that the requirements could be
included in the regulations, but we need to be assured before we make a

young people are joint partners in developing an action plan to improve

responsive only to the needs of local authorities and not local
families? While welcoming the Government’s amendment and

I said, we<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:27:08"></hs_TimeCode> had a
couple of very good debates in Grand Committee on the provisions of the
Bill relating to the local offer. I moved an amendment which sparked a
discussion about the kind of framework which needed to be put in place
to regulate the local offers that local authorities made, to ensure
that they met certain standards of consistency. The amendment took its
cue from the animating principle underlying much of the legislation
emanating from the <I>Support and Aspiration</I> Green Paper, which was
that parents of children with special educational needs needed to be
freed from the tangles of bureaucracy that were making it so difficult
to access the services which could best meet their children’s
needs. The amendment was couched in terms of the minimum standards
which local authorities must meet in their local offers. The flaw in
such an amendment was quickly pointed out: it could all too easily lead
to local authorities simply working to the bare minimum and usher in a
race to the bottom. At the same time, it provoked a bit of reaction
from noble Lords who had a history in local government, who were at
pains to point to all the good work local authorities do, the
undesirability of constraining their room for manoeuvre too much and
the need to leave them alone to get on with things.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:28:46"></hs_TimeCode> was at pains
to be conciliatory and to acknowledge that in my reply but, on
reflection, I think I may have gone a bit too far.</hs_para>

underlying thrust behind this legislation is the need to free families
from the bureaucracy which ties them in knots and to redress the
balance between local authorities and families attempting to assert
their rights. I remember the noble Baroness, Lady Morris of Yardley,
making the point very persuasively that, although one did not want to
hamstring local authorities and unduly constrain them in what they can
do, it was not wise to set up a completely new system like this
without exercising a measure of central oversight. That is a very
familiar distribution of responsibilities between central and local
government and the education
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000090">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:29:40"></hs_TimeCode>
amendment is not unduly prescriptive in dictating to the Secretary of
State what he must do; it merely requires that he make regulations
setting out, as I have said, the standards and quality of the special
educational provision, health care provision and social care provision
which local authorities must meet in their local offer, issue guidance
to local authorities on how to comply with these regulations and
publish information on the regulations accessible to the families of
children and young people with special educational needs. This
is a very moderate obligation to lay on the Secretary of State

Eaton (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I can understand why the noble
Lord, Lord Low, tabled Amendment 33D, which would regulate
the special education provision to be provided by local authorities.
That sounds sensible and reassuring. However, the practicalities of
regulating provision in such a way would, despite what has been said in
the contributions from noble Lords, cause unnecessary restrictions on
provision and prevent innovation and creativity that could bring about
new and supportive
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000092">The
duties on local authorities and other bodies to assess needs and secure
provision are already set out elsewhere in the Bill. There are already
some excellent examples of local offers—for example the
pathfinders in North Yorkshire that worked with parents and young
people to produce an interactive map and colour-coded diagram,
including a version for children and young people, showing precisely
what the local offer would
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000093">Funding
allocated to councils by the Government for education, including SEN
provision, can vary greatly, even for similar or neighbouring local
authorities. That is one reason why provision may vary between areas.
We know that the new national funding formula will not be introduced
until after the next election. SEN provision also varies from one local
authority to another because of the nature of the population.
There are higher levels of need in some areas, which require the local
authority to provide more specialist services than in others areas that
may have no such requirements or quite different
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000094">Defining
in law a minimum level of provision may actually mean that resources in
some authorities are diverted from other areas of special need simply
to meet a legal requirement. Health needs also differ
between 
<?notus-xml column=1404?>local areas. That is reflected in the local joint strategic needs
assessment, which is based on the needs of the local population. Surely
the key purpose of the local SEN offer should remain as a source of
information to parents and young people, developed by local authorities
working with them to reflect their choices and
preferences<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T15:33:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000095"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Storey" PimsId="5937" UID="14010750000826" xid="2146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000826">Lord
Storey (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I agree with the noble Baroness,
Lady Jones, that parents have fought for years to get resources and
what some might call justice for children with special educational
needs. That is why the Bill is so important: it is a progressive piece
of legislation that we can all be proud of. It will mean that, for the
first time, local authorities have to spell out clearly and precisely
what is available in their area and how that can be accessed. As we
know, people with special educational needs will, for the first time,
have a plan that joins up health, education and social
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000096">The
giveaway is in the title: “local offer”. It is not a
national offer but a local one. I suppose the Government could have
said, “Nationally, we have decided that this is what you will
do”, but I am quite sure that there would have been screams from
local authorities that this was national government again dictating
exactly what should happen. The local offer is
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000097">I
was grateful for the comments of the noble Lord, Lord Low, in Committee
but I still have grave concerns about creating a minimum requirement.
We have seen what happened in care for the elderly: if you have a
minimum requirement, councils under financial pressures jettison what
they do not need to provide. If you have a minimum offer in terms of
special educational needs, you will find that those authorities that my
noble friend Lady Eaton so eloquently described, the ones that are
progressive and look at new ideas, will say, “Well, if there are
some savings to be made, we do not need to do that”. So I am not
in favour of a minimum
offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000098">I am in
favour of what the Government have reflected on and come back to at
Report with Amendment 33C. Let us never underestimate the power of
local people. If the local offer is not meeting the local requirement,
you can bet that local people will say that they want something extra.
Cases will make that happen. That is why the government
amendment is so important. Let us celebrate where we are at so far,
because it is important for children with special educational

amendments tabled by my noble friend Lady Jones, which deal with the
“expects to be” versus “which is” dilemma,
just make sense, as I do not think that anyone here would not want
parents to know what is being offered rather than what might be
offered. The Government’s concern appears to be that something
innovative might happen during the year that could be added to the
offer, but the Minister might reflect that, if the offer was a living
document so that it could be updated as an innovation came through, was
proven to work, accepted as best practice and added to the 
<?notus-xml column=1405?>local provision, in a digital age it would not be
difficult to update the offer. The notion of “which is”
gives far more certainty to users of the service than the words
“expect to be”. In that respect, I very much support
those
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000101">I
just want to comment on the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Low. I
see both sides of this argument. We want local authorities to be free
to innovate, to reach for the stars and to be the best they can, and we
do not want the local offer in every local authority area to look
exactly the same regardless of where you are in the country. Neither do
we want to give permission to local authorities to go for a basic
minimum standard. I accept the concerns laid out by the noble Baroness,
Lady Eaton, and the noble Lord, Lord Storey, but we are still left with

code of practice talks a lot about the quantity that should be in the
local offer. There is a whole list of things that the code of practice
guarantees will be there. What is missing from the whole debate is
something that guarantees quality. Amendment 33D attempts to do that,
and I want the Minister to respond to it. None of us wants poor
quality, and I do not think that we would be in politics and would
certainly not be legislators if we did not know that we have to ensure
quality. It does not happen by itself or through a free-for-all, and it
will not happen if we just leave it to local authorities to do their
best. We want more than that. Minimum standards are not in the
amendment. I do not want to fetter those local authorities who will
provide very well; I want to protect those people who live in areas
where the local authority does not do very well. I am concerned about
how we protect people against poor provision falling below those
minimum standards.</hs_para>

government takes one of three actions. It leaves it to the
market—the noble Lord, Lord Storey, mentioned just now that if
people do not like it, they will complain and changes will be made. I
do not think that that will happen with the local offer. The only way
that the market usually works is if people are free to go elsewhere.
Then the poor provision that they did not want withers on the vine,
vanishes, closes down and gets off the playing field. That is not what
we want here. We do not want a local offer to be squeezed out of the
market so that people have to go over the local authority borders. I
cannot see how the market works as a regulator of standards for the
local
offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000104">Secondly,
we inspect. That is another way to guarantee quality. I would be
grateful if the Minister would give us an update on where the
department is with Ofsted inspecting the local offer. In Committee, he
undertook to write to me, and I must admit that I am not sure whether
that letter has been sent; I have not seen it. I would accept it if the

be the market, which I think is where the Government are headed with
this, because that will not work. We have to get the balance right

not just about safeguarding against low-quality provision: the
Government should, equally, be incentivising innovation and high
standards. If you only dampen down by inspecting, you will not get the
high standards and innovation to which the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton,
referred. We have had so many decades of experience in the delivery of
public services, and there are good ways of incentivising innovation,
rewarding high standards and making sure that those high standards are
spread to include everyone else. That is my ideal— to do
both. I think that we will see the good quality provision in the local
offer to which the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, referred, and that we
will find ways of making sure that other local authorities know about
it. Equally, for balance, we need something to set a basic standard
below which local authorities’ local offer should not fall so
that as regulators and legislators we can say that everybody, no matter
where they live, is protected from a poor standard of provision. In

Sharp of Guildford (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I return to the
introduction that the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, gave to Amendment 25E
and the issue of accountability. Government Amendment 33C is good so
far as it goes, but it puts the onus on parents and 
<?notus-xml column=1408?>young people using the service to police the sufficiency of the local
offer. Perhaps my noble friend the Minister could correct me if I were
wrong, but so far as I know there is no obligation on local authorities
to publish the findings of their own reviews, which, as was emphasised
by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, they are obliged to make under Clause
27. Therefore, there is not the obligation to proactively improve their
services that might arise from looking at whether their own reviews
were sufficient, and acting on that. That picks up the point made by
the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, that there are ways and means whereby
innovation comes organically and internally. Equally, she made the
point that for most parents there is not the opportunity to move
authorities: whether they like it or no, this is the authority that
they have to work

point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, that, when we are talking
about special educational needs, we do not mean only the few who have

now the schools’ responsibility to meet the needs of
these pupils. We shall be talking later about the training that is
necessary for SENCOs, and so forth. Most schools rely very much indeed
on local educational specialists being available. One of the problems
with the situation at the moment is that if there is no
follow-up on whether or not there is a sufficiency of provision, there
is a great danger that local authorities, whose finances, as we know,
are being squeezed at present, will not find it necessary to provide
outside the needs of those who actually have EHC plans, and that
specialists in language, communication and behaviour will not be
available to schools for them to be able to recruit to help them with

17 December, the House passed a number of government amendments
responding to important issues raised by noble Lords in Committee.
These amendments will include disabled children and young people
without SEN in key provisions of the Bill and ensure that local
authorities exercise their functions with a view to securing that they
identify both children and young people with SEN and disabled children
and young people, and that health bodies inform the child’s
parents and local authority where they are of the opinion that a child
under compulsory school age has or probably has a disability. Local
authorities will exercise their functions with a view to ensuring the
integration of education and training provision with healthcare
provision and social care provision for children and young people with
SEN and disabled children and young people where they think this would
promote their well-being, including in relation to their participation
in education, training and recreation. Local authorities and their
partner commissioning bodies making joint arrangements for the
commissioning of education, health and care provision for children and
young people with SEN will be amended to include disabled children and
young people. Local authorities will keep under review all the
education and training provision and social care provision for disabled
children and young people and consult disabled children and young
people and their parents when doing so. Local authorities will arrange
for disabled young people and the parents of disabled children to be
provided with information about matters related to disability—I
have also tabled an amendment, which we shall come to later, to extend
the requirement to cover children themselves as well as their
parents—and local authorities will include disabled children and

<?notus-xml column=1410?>young people both in relation to the information to
be published and in developing and reviewing the local offer and in
publishing comments.</hs_para>

how local authorities work with local people and those providing

the quality of the provision available and about any provision that is
not available. We make it clear in the draft SEN code that when local
authorities publish their response to comments they should include the
action local authorities propose to take. However, in view of the
concerns raised in Committee I have tabled Amendment 33C to make this

the views of children, young people and parents. As I have said, we
feel that substantive engagement with children, young people and
parents is the way to do this. However, we would be happy to make
stronger links in the SEN code of practice between the review duty in
Clause 27 and Clause 30 on the local offer. In answer to the point made

aim in requiring local authorities to publish the provision they expect
to be available in and outside their local area is to make the local
offer as relevant and useful to families as possible. It will not be so
informative if it can only set out what is already available rather
than what is expected to be available. If, for example, a new
specialist provision was due to open in an area, it would be useful for

engage fully with children, young people and parents. We share that
view; we have seen it in operation in the pilots. That is why

Lady Perry and the noble Lord, Lord Storey. All stressed the dangers of
a minimum-standards approach and urged us to resist the temptation to

understand why the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble

However, it is difficult to see how quality standards could be
developed for the local offer since it will contain a wide range of
services and support provided by a wide range of local providers,
including not only local authorities but organisations from across the
statutory and voluntary sectors. How would any standards be 
<?notus-xml column=1413?>meaningful without covering the full range of provision and without
taking account of local views, local needs and local
circumstances? There are fundamental differences between institutions
regulated by statute, such as children’s homes, where it is
necessary to set standards of care for children and young people to
which all institutions must adhere, and the wide range of services to
be embraced by the local offer from schools and colleges to
small local voluntary-sector groups. We do not believe that
standards—minimum or quality standards—are feasible for,
or consistent with the purposes of, the local offer which are to
provide children, young people and parents with easy access to
information about provision, and the opportunity to be directly

SE7 pathfinder developed its local offer specifically to answer the
questions local parents and young people want to have answered, not to
fit a predetermined regime imposed by the Government. As my noble
friend Lady Eaton mentioned, North Yorkshire has been developing an
interactive site map for the local offer, to improve access to
information about available support in a simple and direct way that
responds to local views. Leicester, through its parent carer forum, Big
Mouth Forum, has set up pop-up shops in local shopping centres for
families and young people to access useful information and ask
questions about the local offer. This has also allowed Leicester City
and the Big Mouth Forum to gather valuable feedback to inform continued

Greenwich, Cherry Orchard School gave a presentation on how the local
authority had worked directly with local schools from the outset to set
out a clear school offer. There is a real sense of shared objectives,
joint ownership and co-operation in these examples. We want to
encourage this to flourish, not to overburden local agencies with
further

amendments starting with Amendment 27A. These amendments
will strengthen provision for children and young people with special
educational needs in the youth justice system. Provision for young
offenders has been the subject of considerable debate during the
passage of this Bill, both in this Chamber and in the other place. This
is an issue that we must get right. Evidence suggests that nearly one
in five young people in custody has a statement of special educational
needs. I offer my sincere gratitude to the noble Lords who have pursued
this matter, particularly the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I have
benefited considerably from his expertise in this area, and I pay
tribute to his tireless efforts to secure better outcomes for those

noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has tabled Amendment 50, which I support,
removing Clause 70 of the Bill, which currently disapplies Part 3 of
the Bill to children and young people in detention. The
Government’s amendments would replace Clause 70 with new
provisions after Clause 65, which would enable education, health and
care assessments to take place for a detained child or young person;
require home local authorities and health service commissioners to use
their best endeavours to arrange the special education and health
provision specified in a plan during the period in custody; and require
relevant youth custodial institutions—that is, young offender
institutions, secure children’s homes and secure training
centres—to co-operate with the home local authority when
arranging support for young offenders with SEN. These
changes will ensure that needs are identified and assessed at the
earliest opportunity, that the best possible support is provided to
young people in custody, and that there is a single point of
accountability before, during and after their period in
detention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000152">The
first clause affected by this group of amendments is Clause 28, hence

will firstly explain the substantive amendments that we would introduce
after Clause 65<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:18:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
The point at which a child or young person is first detained is a
crucial opportunity to identify special educational needs. Amendments
47B and 47C would allow the custodial institution, and the detained
person or their parent, to request a full, statutory education, health
and care assessment from the detained person’s home local
authority. Under our amendments, a home local authority must also
determine whether to conduct an assessment when a detained child or
young person has been brought to its attention by someone
else—for example, a professional working with the child or young
person. This will support early identification of needs; it will also
make best use of the time that a young person is in detention so that
an assessment can get under way and support be put in place immediately
upon
release.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000153">Amendment
47D would extend the right to appeal to a detained young person or a
detained child’s parent when they were unhappy with a local

47E would require a child or young person’s home local authority
to use its best endeavours to arrange the special educational provision
specified in the EHC plan while they are in custody. This is a strong
and robust statutory duty, requiring the home local authority to do
everything in its power to arrange the specified provision, or
provision corresponding as closely as possible to it, or other
appropriate provision while the individual is detained. Placing this
duty on the home local authority will provide continuity and stability
that is not present under existing arrangements. It will significantly
improve accountability and ensure that, wherever a child or young
person is detained, there remains a single point of accountability and
a 
<?notus-xml column=1417?>single contact for their families. It also creates a
strong incentive for the home authority to arrange the best possible
provision, as it will remain responsible for that child or young person
throughout their period of detention and afterwards when they return
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000155">Amendment
47E would also create a parallel requirement for a detained child or
young person’s health services commissioner to use its best
endeavours to arrange the healthcare provision specified in an EHC
plan. Where a child or young person is detained in custody, the
relevant health services commissioner would be NHS England. This is a
new duty, which would require the health service commissioner to do
everything in its power to arrange the specified provision, or

appropriate provision while the individual is

27A to Clause 28 and Amendments 33HA to 33HK to Clause 31
would require relevant secure institutions—young offender
institutions, secure children’s homes and secure training
centres—to co-operate with the local authority. These amendments
will require governors of young offender institutions or those in
charge of other establishments in the youth secure estate to work with
local authorities to deliver the best possible support for those in
custody. These new statutory requirements will give local authorities
the backing they need to ensure that custodial institutions play their
part. This also reflects the Government’s ambition to place
education at the heart of youth detention, set out in the

addition to these substantive changes, we have also made a series of
technical supporting amendments to Clauses 36 and 48, and to Schedule

some work remains to be done to ensure that the intent outlined in the
Government’s amendments is brought to pass. I am very grateful
for the many meetings and discussions which have resulted in the
amendments that the Minister outlined, which make my Clause 70 stand

<?notus-xml column=1418?>irrelevant. However, both as a former soldier and Chief

refer to the intent behind my Amendment 49, which—despite much
of the content having been, like my stand part debate, made irrelevant
by the government amendments—remains very much extant in intent.
To me, “best endeavours” is too weak because it leaves
too much open for too many individuals to interpret to allow consistent
provision of what is intended. Therefore, I plead guilty to falling
back on a concept that underpins consistent provision of what is
intended in the Army, namely duty. In the long-term interests of young
people with special educational needs, quite apart from the best
interests of the country as a whole, I can see no reason why, rather
than leave such provision to chance, a duty should not be put both on a
local authority to arrange that provision be made for an EHC plan to be
continued in custody, and on places of detention to deliver what is
required in such a plan. That is what it appears that the Government
intend, because proposed new subsection (1) of Amendment 47C
states that a home local authority must secure that an EHC plan
is prepared for a detained person. Unfortunately, though, as I have
bemoaned on many previous occasions, such an intent is unachievable
because the Ministry of Justice cannot guarantee to deliver what is
arranged, prepared or
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000162">Unlike
any other operational organisation such as a school, hospital or
business, the Prison Service makes no one responsible or accountable
for the treatment and conditions of any group of people in custody such
as women, children or young people. Not only is the governor of any
place of detention not bound to continue any practice that was in place
when he or she took over, but alone determines what is or is not
appropriate and will or will not be provided. Having campaigned
unsuccessfully for 19 years to have this changed, and having seen far
too many promising initiatives and developments dropped—wholly
wrongly and unnecessarily—I suggest that if the Government mean
what appears to be the intent of this group of amendments they must do
something about the wording in proposed new subsection (1) of Amendment
47C and proposed new subsection (4) of Amendment 47E because, as set
down, they are incapable of securing anything. I put it to the Minister
that neither the Government nor any local authority should feel
comfortable that the Ministry of Justice at present lacks the means of
ensuring EHC plan provision in places of detention. Therefore, not
least to ensure the credibility of government legislation, he should be
seeking other means of securing
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000163">I turn to
the code of practice, which has been mentioned many times during the
passage of the Bill and is currently out for consultation. At present,
certainly to a lay man such as me, the code appears to be a vast
document, full of “musts”, without any specification
about who is to deliver them or oversee their provision. 
<?notus-xml column=1419?>The Minister has often emphasised the store the
Government set by the code, and I therefore ask him whether he sees it
as the vehicle by which the problem I have outlined is to be remedied.
If he does, I ask him whether he will reconsider the wording in the
government amendments and tell the House, probably at Third Reading,
exactly how the code of practice will be worded so that provision of
EHC plans is secure. I understand that NHS England is responsible for
contracting provision of the healthcare part of any plan from an
appropriate local provider, but I would be grateful for information on
how exactly that is to be secured. I use the word
“security” deliberately because local authorities, which
are responsible for the continuation of any provision after the release
of anyone from detention, will have a vested interest in the quantity
and quality of the provision of what they are told that they must
secure, but over whose provision they have virtually no control. In
other words, as I said at the start of my contribution, we are nearly
there but I suggest that we need one last shove before we
can feel certain that provision of what the Government want is
secure.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-01-07?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_01_07_PT_1/0BDE2738C5ED97B2D7306D8CAA338FD25EFE591D" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 7 January 2014">Tuesday,

Warnock (CB):</Member></B> I support everything that my noble friend
Lord Ramsbotham has said. This is an enormous opportunity and it would
be disastrous if the Government did not seize it. It has long been an
outrage that there is a large number of young people with special
educational needs in places of detention. Nobody disputes the evidence
that there is a huge number of such young people, and this is an
opportunity to remedy the neglect that these children have had. I
entirely agree that the present wording is such that local authorities
may very well make no changes whatever, and the Ministry of Justice has
no power to compel governors of such places to do what urgently needs
to be done. I do not think that there can be any dispute about that,
and I implore the Minister to come back with wording which is a great
deal tighter and which will make the change that we all know has needed
to be made for a long
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, we all know that 70% of these young
offenders have special educational needs. We also know that 10% or 20%
of them have statements. We know, too, that a huge number of
them—I do not know the exact figure but 70% or 80%—will
go on to reoffend. Therefore, it is really important that this group of
young people gets the best possible special educational needs support.
When this Bill first came out, I found it unbelievable that EHC plans
would not be going with these young people into their
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:32:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Bill has been the Minister’s desire to discuss, consult and
listen to what people say, and I pay tribute to him for doing that.
During the discussions on this matter, it has become clear to all of us
that the number of young people in these institutions is declining, as
is the time that they spend in them—thank goodness. The
practicalities of getting their EHC plans to go with them becomes very
difficult, particularly if you are talking about different local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:33:17"></hs_TimeCode>, and

also pay tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for his remarkable
knowledge in this area. I agree with him, and I hope that when the
Minister replies he will be able to refer to the concern that a lot of
us share about the words “best endeavours”. Sadly, the
justice system is not an educational system, and “best
endeavours” is too wide a hope—for example, “I use
my best endeavours to get up early in the morning but I
don’t”. I hope that noble Lords can see the point that I
am making. The use of this phrase is a recipe for not doing the sorts
of things that we in this House want to see provided for these young
people. Maybe the word to use is “responsibility” or
“duty”—I do not know—but I hope that the
Minister will indicate that he will look at this again and come back
with exact wording to make sure that the special needs provision that
we all want to see is

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall be brief, as I
usually am, but I want to say two things. One is that when I read these
amendments my heart leapt. I thought that if only the home local
authority could be made responsible for every young person in secure
provision on this basis with a proper plan for seeing them
through—as I remember, and as I am sure my noble friend
Lord Laming will remember, was the case in children’s
departments, where someone was responsible for a young person, with a
plan, wherever they were—that would be absolutely wonderful. Of
course, at that time there was much more focus on education in the
institutions, as childcare establishments, than there is in some of the
more penal establishments that exist
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000169">So I
was utterly delighted and was going to congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, whose tenacity of purpose has taken this through,
until I realised, as he did, the key flaw in this piece of legislation.
That flaw is that those who wish to take the plans through are not the
people with the capacity to provide the resource in order for it to
happen in the place it needs to happen.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:40:25"></hs_TimeCode> I am always
interested in implementation, I thought about how this would work.
There has to be a further step somewhere, either in some sort of
regulation or a change in the legislation, that ensures that these
plans are formulated into the institution—because, remember,
these are individual plans. In the institution they have to be put
together into programmes for groups of young people; it is not as easy
as simply saying that you can carry each plan through as it stands
without extra provision being brought in, with all the problems with
that in terms of
financing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000170">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that the Minister will look at this, take heart that many of us
have been very impressed with the way he listens, and take it forward.
Many of us are very concerned about young people in detention who have
been failed by everybody by the time they get to detention,
particularly those with special educational needs who should not be in
this form of provision at all. Surely they can get the right education
through this legislation, but they certainly will not with this

Walmsley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have a suggestion following
what the noble Baroness has just said about implementation, but first I
must say how pleased I am 
<?notus-xml column=1421?>to see that my noble friend Lord Nash has listened tremendously well and
gone away and done something about it. This has been a great example of
the way this House works so well behind the scenes. I am very pleased
that the blanket statement that all the good stuff in the Bill should
not apply to children in custody has been got rid of and that my noble
friend the Minister has grasped the opportunity that the Bill gives to
put something better in place. Let us see whether we can get it as
perfect as we would like to see
it<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000172">It
occurs to me that it is a very good thing that the responsibility moves
back to the home local authority. What we want to see when young people
come out of custody and go back to their home local authority is
continuity of provision. I know that the Local Government Association
has welcomed this provision, but the people actually delivering the
services while the young people are in custody are a company, an
organisation that has been contracted to deliver that service from
outside. They are not the prison authorities. These education services
are provided by external organisations under contract. Why should those
contracts not always have a proviso within them that says that there is
somebody within the organisation with the responsibility of liaising
with the home authority to ensure that the EHC plan is delivered, or
the assessment is made, whichever is appropriate, and that the services
are provided while the young person is in custody? That should be a
condition of the contract for delivering education services within the
prison. They should be obliged, under their contract, to provide what
EHC plans say should be provided. I see no reason why that should not
be a condition of winning a contract for providing services within a
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000173">My
final point is that I am particularly pleased about the duty that is
being put on health commissioners to provide services within an EHC
plan. I am aware, and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has emphasised
it on many occasions, that speech and language therapy is much needed
by a high percentage of young people in custody. Let us hope that those
services will be provided better in future under these new
provisions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000174"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:40:19"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hughes of Stretford" PimsId="5818" UID="14010750000842" xid="2080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000842">Baroness
Hughes of Stretford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, my name is attached
to Amendment 50 along with that of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. The
amendment seeks to take Clause 70, which disapplies the provisions of
Part 3 to detained young people, out of the Bill and I am pleased that
the Government have accepted that. I also support Amendment
49, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:40:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000175">I
can be brief because most of the points have been made. I welcome the
Government’s recognition that, as the noble Lord, Lord Storey,
said, it was unbelievable that the provisions in Part 3 ought not to
apply to detained young people and they have come some way, at least,
to applying some of the provisions to young people in custody. However,
I regret that, compared to the situation that will exist for young
people in the community, the provisions in the government amendments
are weak and that, as they stand, they will not give detained young
people the same rights to and expectations of support as those in the
community<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:41:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been raised and I would like to summarise two significant holes in the
proposals in the amendments as they hang together. First, where there
is an EHC plan in existence before a young person goes into custody,
the amendments will require the home local authority to maintain that
plan and be ready to re-implement it on the release of that young
person. That is good. However, as the noble Lords, Lord Ramsbotham,
Lord Storey and others have said, the amendments will require the local
authority and the healthcare authority to use only their “best
endeavours”. That is very different from the duty on the local
and healthcare authorities for young people in the community to secure
the provision in the EHC plan. That is a big hole and I should be
grateful if the Minister would address that issue and say why the
Government have diluted the duty on local authorities in respect of
detained young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:42:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010750000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0001.htm#14010750000177">The
other big gap, which has been addressed in different ways by different
contributors to the debate so far, relates to what happens to young
people while they are in custody. Most of the amendments address the
issue of what happens when the young person is released—they
ought to be able to go back home and the home authority should carry on
implementing the EHC plan that was in place—but there is nothing
in the amendments about what happens in custody. There is a duty on
YOIs and custodial institutions to co-operate with the local authority
but there is no requirement on the institutions to, for example,
identify if a young person has SEN if it has not been identified before
they go into custody. This may well be the case because many of them
have special educational needs. There is no responsibility on the
custodial institution to request an EHC assessment. They can, but there
is no requirement for them to do so. There is no responsibility laid on
the custodial institutions to take over the responsibilities that would
exist for a local authority if that young person was still in the
community.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to the contractors providing
the education, but the responsibility ought to lie with the public
sector organisation, or the quasi-public sector organisation in the
case of a privatised institution, which is holding these young people.
It ought to be its responsibility to address the special educational
needs of those young people while they are in custody, working closely,
of course, with the home local authority from which a young person has
come and to which they will return.</hs_para>

amendments stand at the moment, there is nothing that requires the
young offender institutions to pay attention to the special educational
needs of the young people in custody or to address them in any way at
all. That is a big gap. I do not know whether it has arisen because the
Ministry of Justice does not want to take on those responsibilities but
it is a glaring omission. It means that a young person may go into an
institution with an EHC plan and may come out with the home authority
ready to implement that EHC plan again but, in the middle, there is no
requirement on anybody to do anything. That is a big gap. As the noble
Lord, Lord Storey, said, these are the most needy young people in terms
of their special educational 
<?notus-xml column=1423?>needs, with huge issues. This is an opportunity,
when they are in custody, to address those issues very securely. I hope
the Government will rethink and strengthen these amendments. The
amendments are good, in so far as they go, but they need to be
strengthened further in those respects. I hope that the Minister will

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 48A is in my name. The
noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, made the point, also made in the
amendment, that hidden disabilities—my interest in dyslexia is
very well known in the House—are, by definition, difficult to
spot. We also know that they are grossly overrepresented in all
sections of the prison and youth justice systems. My amendment suggests
that there should be some duty on those institutions to try to identify
people in them with such disabilities. Providing education, training
and, indeed, even socialisation for people who have been denied the
ability, for instance, to access the written word and education is
going to be incredibly difficult. They do not respond well and it is
something that they cannot do. For example, you cannot even access
social security when you leave prison. That might be going slightly off
the point, but it is important that the Government give us an idea
about the pressure that will be placed on these institutions to try to
identify those who have these problems. Most of the work that has been
done in this area shows that there is a much better chance of them not
reoffending<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T16:47:27"></hs_TimeCode> if

that the needs of those young people with SEN are properly identified

have come a long way, but I am still nervous that we have people under

continue from nought to 25; and we have the problem of the over-18s who

and I spoke to it in our first debate this afternoon. When I spoke to
it, I said that I would listen to what the Minister and other noble
Lords had to say, but I reserved the right to move it and test the
opinion of the House when it came up in order. With your
Lordships’ agreement, I would like to do that. Never mind all
the arguments in favour of the amendment to do with the desirability of
a degree of central oversight of a wholly new system being introduced
and operated by local authorities, which those who spoke in favour of
it maintained is not unduly prescriptive. Irrespective of all that, the
main reason why I want to press the amendment to a Division is that I
think there has been a considerable misapprehension about the thrust of
the amendment on the part of those who expressed reservations about
it.</hs_para>

number of noble Lords said that they were unhappy about an amendment
which contained the idea of minimum standards and sought to impose them
on local authorities as that would give rise to a tick-box culture,
with local authorities merely operating to a bare minimum standard.
When I spoke to the amendment I indicated that I had taken this very
point when it was made in Grand Committee—that we should not
confuse a framework of standards with minimum standards, because if we
talked in terms of minimum standards that would lead to this very race
to the bottom, which nobody wants to see. I made it clear when I spoke
this afternoon that I have very much taken that point.</hs_para>

information you had given them unless it was in an appropriate form. I
hope that the code will take the best from some of the practice that
already exists in some local authorities and CAFCASS regarding the form
of information and the method of delivery to children and young people.
Young children in particular can be involved very easily in many
complex areas of their lives and indeed in decision-making if it is
explained to them in an appropriate way by an appropriate person. I

Baroness, Lady Howe, has said, this is in keeping with UN Convention on
the Rights of the Child and was clearly set out in Clause 19. It was
Clause 32, however, where there was an inconsistency in this approach
and this was where we had tabled amendments to ensure that the clause
also included the right for children to be involved in decision-making.

an ongoing issue about the wording in the code of practice and the

I welcome the steps that the Minister and the

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, there has been broad support across this
House for our ambition to create a system that raises aspirations and
helps young people with SEN to realise their full potential, achieve
positive outcomes and prepare for adult life. There has also been broad
support for the provisions in the Bill that extend additional rights
and support to 16 to 25 year- olds in further education and
training.</hs_para>

Bill enshrines in law the principle that local authorities must take
account of young people’s views, wishes and feelings, and
involve them in decision-making. It gives young people aged 16 to 25
the right to request an assessment of their needs. It ensures that
post-16 institutions will be consulted by the local authority when it
reviews its provision, and are included in the local offer. It places
FE colleges, sixth form colleges, 16 to 19 academies and free schools
under a new duty to use their “best endeavours” for all
young people with SEN, and ensures that they have regard to the new
nought to 25 code of practice. It gives young people the right to
request that these institutions—and approved independent
specialist providers—be named in their EHC plan and then admit
them, unless exemptions apply. It ensures that young people who become
NEET do not lose their EHC support, and are helped back into education.
Also, for the first time, it gives 16 to 25 year-olds in
further education and training the right to appeal to an SEN first-tier
tribunal if they are unhappy with their arrangements. There is a great
deal here that we should be proud of and I am grateful for the support
that noble Lords have shown on all sides of the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000003">However,
I also know that there has been genuine concern about the provisions in
the Bill that require local authorities to “have regard
to” the age of young people aged 19 to 25 when determining their
support. We had a particularly helpful round-table discussion on this
when a number of noble Lords, including my noble friends Lady Sharp and
Lady Cumberlege and the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Howarth,
made a number of really
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:28:48"></hs_TimeCode> comments
in this regard. Noble Lords have particularly expressed
their fears that the Bill as currently drafted would provide local
authorities with an excuse to deny or cease support to a young person
based solely on their age. This is not, and has never been, our
intention. Young people with SEN aged 19 to 25 should be supported to
remain in formal education where this will enable them to complete or
consolidate their learning, achieve their outcomes and make a
successful transition to adulthood. In achieving this important aim we
must not inadvertently create an entitlement or expectation that all
young people with SEN remain in education until age 25. That would not
be in the interests of many young people, who may need just one or two
years of additional education to progress into adult life and
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000004">I have

what many of us consider to be the most important time of transition in
their lives. I am very grateful for his recognition that some young
people with special educational needs require more time to complete
their education beyond the age of 18. Of course, that has now been
translated into the amendment in the Bill. This requires local

the cessation of an EHC plan, to have regard to whether the education

is much more important for young people with complex special

one remaining concern, however, and a request to my noble friend. I am
worried that some people may mistakenly interpret the phrase
“education and training outcomes” in too narrow a way and
relate these primarily to formal accredited learning and
qualifications. I know from my noble friend’s visit to the
Chailey Heritage Foundation that he understands that, for some young
people with complex needs, the learning educational outcomes they
achieve will not be appropriately assessed and recognised through the
usual formal accredited qualifications. It would be most unfortunate if
local authorities sought to stop EHC plans for young people with
complex needs because the outcomes they wanted to achieve post-18 were
not ones that could be formally
accredited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000013">The

it was suggested in Committee that some young people over 18 might not
need the help and support they had been getting. That would
provide local authorities with an excuse for dropping such
support after 18 by using those words “to have regard to
age”. Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it was said that
the wording was too flexible. We all know that circumstances can vary
enormously and that some young people with SEN are ready by the age of
18 to stand on their own and that—partly thanks to the help and
support they have received—they are well able to cope without
further support. However, others mature later and need to be given
extra help and support. Indeed, they often need to take longer, as the
noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, indicated, over the process of
learning and acquiring skills and qualifications. The Minister agreed
with those arguments and stated very clearly in his response that the
provision of continuing support was not a matter of age but of whether
the young person concerned was ready to move into adult life. He was
not prepared to move initially in Committee

be inserted. As the revised wording implies, the clear intention is
that local authorities should be flexible in their approach, and should
above all consider whether the young person has reached a point where
they can do without the extra help and support that an EHC plan would
give them. It is clear from the various case studies provided to us by
those who are anxious to see the wording changed, that many young
people need and will benefit from this flexible approach. I again thank

there is some unhappiness among those providing education and training
to over-18s with special educational needs about the current wording of
the draft code of practice. In particular, they think that there is a
degree of inconsistency in it. At some points the draft code rightly
emphasises—as the wording of the amended Bill does—the
needs of the individual, whether the outcomes specified in the EHC plan
have been achieved and whether the young person is ready to enter and
cope with adulthood. At other times the code seems to point to the
cliff edge—that once a young person reaches the age of 18, it is
no longer necessary to maintain the plan. Could the Minister and his

two brief points. First, this will convey a message to the young people
themselves. It is not often that legislation matters to the
recipients so directly in sending a message. Transition is a
very difficult time for people with special educational needs and
severe disabilities. Added to all the difficulties that they have of
movement of placement and, often, of changes to the personnel involved
in their care, has been the suggestion that their age mattered. To
them, it does not matter to the transition that they will make to the
adult world, because they are not like everyone else who is 18; they
are all difficult, but certainly not like most 18 year-olds. This will
mean that, in the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, the needs of
the individual will be met. That is a really important

rise briefly to make two points. First, I welcome the
amendments. The wording of the government amendments is very sensible
and I am pleased that the Minister has listened. 
<?notus-xml column=1440?>The critical moment was when the Government
published their policy position on this issue when it was crystal clear
to everyone that the position as outlined was not reflected by the
words “having regard to age” in the Bill. That was a kind
of “light bulb” moment, and I am pleased that they have
recognised that. The wording in so far as it goes is fine, and I am
very pleased to support

I commend the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege,
repeated by the noble Baronesses, Lady Sharp and Lady Howarth. It is
important that the Government pay attention to the way in which the
code of practice reflects this change and make sure that the wording in
the code is expansive rather than restrictive on local authorities and
other service providers, so that they can look in the round at these
young people as they approach and go beyond 18, in terms of their
various needs, and not limit it only to a formal definition of
education and training. I look forward to the Minister’s remarks
on that, but I very much welcome the

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank again my noble friends Lady Sharp
and Lady Cumberlege, as well as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, for
their insights during Grand Committee. I welcome the opportunity that
the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, has given us to clarify how we have
secured continuity of adult care for young people with EHC plans. I
also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, for her kind

the point made by my noble friend Lady Cumberlege, yes, we are making
it clear that the outcomes that we are looking for are wider. The
outcomes specified in the plan do not have to be formal or accredited;
we are happy to make sure that that is clear in the code. On a
point made more generally by my noble friend Lady Sharp, the
draft code predates the amendments, and we will make sure that
the code fully reflects the amendments, including making it
clear that outcomes rather than age must be
considered<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:48:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000031">In
response to the important issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord
Pearson, I am delighted to state categorically that no young person who
turns 18 and is in receipt of children’s social care will face a
gap in provision while consideration is made about their adult care.
This applies if they move to a new local authority or if their EHC plan
comes to an end at that point because they are leaving
education<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:48:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
Clause 47 provides for regulations that ensure continuity of support
and provision when a child or young person with an EHC plan moves to a
different local authority. For those turning 18, Clause 50 enables
local authorities to extend children’s services beyond the age
of 18 for those with an EHC plan where that is the best option.
Provisions in the Care Bill ensure that there is no gap in care
services when a young person moves to a different area, turns 18 or
their EHC plan comes to an end. Those 18 year-olds who have eligible
needs for care and support will in future receive a statutory care and
support plan. Both we and the Department of Health are clear
that this will form the care part of their EHC plan when one is in
place and would continue in its own right as a statutory plan once
their EHC plan is no longer
maintained<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

and 38 of the Care Bill ensure that support is continued when someone
with a statutory care and support plan moves to a new local authority.
When a young person turns 18, Clauses 59 to 67 of the Care Bill ensure
that assessments for adult care are carried out in good time so that
support can be put in place
promptly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:50:08"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:50:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
In particular, Clause 67 requires local authorities to continue to
provide existing support under Section 17 of the Children Act 1989 or
under the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act 1970 until adult
care begins, or a decision is made that an adult care and support plan
is not required. Young people who have made a successful transition to
adulthood and are now in employment, higher education or adult
learning, will continue to receive support in those settings that will
enable them to maintain and build on the outcomes achieved while in
formal education. For example, Access to Work is available for those in
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000033">As
regards the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, about the
reading of the words “for some other reason”, the
Department of Health is clear that this phrase does not in any way
change a local authority’s duty to meet an adult’s
eligible needs for care and support under Clause 81 of the Care Bill.
“Other reasons” could refer to, for example, a person
changing their place of residence to a different local authority area
before the assessment has been completed. It does not provide carte
blanche for local authorities to refuse to provide services for
spurious reasons. I hope that is helpful. I believe that the amendments
I am moving today represent a genuinely positive change to the Bill,
which, along with reforms in the Care Bill, further strengthen
arrangements for young people making the transition to adulthood. I
hope that noble Lords will support
them.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="14010758000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000145">Amendment

Rix (CB):</Member></B> Noble Lords will have noticed, no doubt, that
Amendment 38 would place a duty to deliver the social care element of
the forthcoming education, health and care plans, which gives me an
excuse to indulge for a short time in a worry that has bothered me for
more than 30 years. In the 1980s, I began to have discussions with
civil servants, politicians and administrators, particularly at the old
DHSS—then located at the Elephant and Castle—about
increasing co-operation between education, health and social care, and
was told on many occasions that this was the recognised way
forward. The will seems always to have been there, but meaningful
co-ordination and collaboration on the ground has failed to emerge. It
has been entirely dependent on local circumstance. We need to change
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000035">To the
Government’s credit, they have recognised the problem and have
taken the very welcome step forward of amending the Bill so
that clinical commissioning groups are under a duty to provide the
health element of the plan—but, alas, social care remains the
poor cousin. This could easily be remedied by aligning the duty to
provide social care services, as laid down in the Chronically Sick and
Disabled Persons Act 1970, with the education, health and care plans
that appear in the Bill. In this suggestion I am supported by not only
my fellow signatories to the amendment but by the Special Educational
Consortium and the Every Disabled Child Matters
campaign.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000036">Currently<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:55:06"></hs_TimeCode>,

I wish to give my full support to my noble friend Lord Rix, who moved

social care services identified in education, health and care plans.
The contention of the noble Lord, myself and the other noble Lords who
have their names on the amendment is that there is very little point in
assessing a child or young person’s needs, identifying social
care needs and putting them in the education and health plan, and then
not making the plan enforceable in respect of social care as it is in
respect of education
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:56:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000038">As
I think the noble Lord, Lord Rix, indicated, the amendment would add no
new duties to local authorities to provide social care in addition to
those that already exist. It merely brings together the legislation on
education, health and care plans and existing social care legislation.
There is currently a misconception that the social care duties in
respect of disabled children are not specifically enforceable for an
individual child. However, as I think the Government accept, this duty
does already exist under Section 2 of the Chronically Sick and Disabled
Persons Act 1970. The proposal contained in this amendment would help
to correct this
misconception<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T17:57:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010758000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010758000039">The
Government have argued that a proposal to create an individually owed
duty in relation to social care would prioritise one group of children
in need over another. However, there is already an individually owed
duty to disabled children in Section 2 of the Chronically Sick and
Disabled Persons Act, as I indicated, which is not enjoyed by other
children in need. We had a good discussion about this in one of the
Minister’s meetings with Peers, which I think we all found very
valuable in developing our understanding of the Bill. I think we
managed to elucidate in that discussion that if one were going to
establish priorities between different groups of recipients of social
care, it would have to be done at a prior stage to the formulation of
the education, health and care plan. If the authority has got to the
point of identifying social care needs and putting them in the plan, it
really does not make any sense in terms of integrated education, health

families, this could not be further 
<?notus-xml column=1444?>from the truth. Good social care plays an important part in helping the
child or young person achieve their educational goals. That is
accepted, whether it is in relation to independent living, supported
employment, employment or moving on to further learning. Good social
care prevents burnout in families. I understand and am glad that the
Government have accepted that there is an issue here, and I look

health, you cannot fail to include the social care element. What I am
hoping is that the Minister will give the same answer that he has just
given on my previous point—that such provision is contained in
the Care Bill. Having looked at the progress made in the way that these
services are delivered, that Bill will ensure that the social care
element can be provided along with the health element. That is really
important because the three are inseparable in the provision of

where a local authority maintains an ECH plan it must secure the
special educational provision. Where the plan specifies healthcare
provision, the responsible commissioning body must provide the
healthcare. The amendment would simply place a parallel duty on local
authorities to provide the social care that is outlined in the plan.
This is a key issue for parents as well as, obviously, for many noble
Lords in this House. As the legislation is currently drafted, the ECH
plans would offer no more legal entitlements to support from social
care services than current statements do at the moment. Let us remember
that social care provision can be detailed in those statements in a
separate section from educational provision. However, the aim of these
reforms and the Bill is to provide a simpler system for disabled
children and young people, and those with special educational needs and
their families, that integrates the different forms of provision into
one piece of legislation. One assessment and one plan is what the
Government are trying to achieve for those families. There is an
opportunity in the Bill to bring everything together. One of the main
aims of the Bill is to provide clarity, transparency and integration,

noble Lord, Lord Low, reminded us, the first argument put by the
Government was that other legislation—the Chronically Sick and

provide for that duty. A second argument deployed at later meetings was

that local authorities are able to decide how to prioritise expenditure

ensure that including the 1970 Act in the Bill will not cause confusion
if other relevant legislation is not also listed. We must also ensure
that we do all we can in the SEN code of practice to explain the
existing legislation clearly to parents and professionals. However, I
am hopeful of a positive outcome to these discussions and hope to bring
forward an amendment at Third Reading to reflect this. In view of these
ongoing discussions and my undertaking, I urge the noble Lords, Lord
Rix and Lord Low, the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, and my noble friend

which I am sure is totally unassailable, and trust that the amendment
that he brings forward at Third Reading will, indeed, support all of us
who have wished for Amendment 38 to be accepted. Obviously, he will
bring forth something which is not quite Amendment 38, but I hope that
it will satisfy all of us here concerned and ensure that social care
is, in some form or another, in the Bill. With that assurance ringing

Amendment 38A is a technical amendment to Clause 42. In the current
system, set out in the Education Act 1996, when a statement is
maintained for a child or young person the local authority is under a
duty to secure the special educational provision specified in it. If a
local authority names an independent school or college in the statement
as special educational provision it must, under Clause 59, meet the
costs of the fees, including any boarding and lodging where relevant.
However, the local authority is relieved of its duty to arrange the
special educational provision in the statement, including securing a
place in a school or college named in a statement of SEN, if the
parents or the young person have made suitable alternative arrangements
for special educational provision to be made, for example, in an
independent school or college or at

wording is problematic and could have unintended consequences, since it
could be interpreted to mean that when a parent or young person
makes alternative arrangements for only some of the provision the local
authority or health body is only relieved from its duty to make that
provision and must secure and arrange the remainder. This would not be

require local authorities to satisfy themselves that those arrangements
are suitable; and it would enable local authorities to assist parents
in making their own arrangements suitable, if they consider it
appropriate, without imposing any duty on them to do so. It has not

authority need not name its nominated school or college in the plan and

having to keep a place free that the parents have no intention of
taking up. If the local authority is not satisfied that the parent or

Lingfield (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I put down a probing amendment
in Committee which was meant to draw attention to the position of young
people with EHC plans at school when they enter university. Your
Lordships will remember why we welcomed the EHC plan carrying on to age
25 for those engaged in further education and other courses, but the
process seems—illogically—to start again for those
entering higher education. During the debate there was a general view,
with which I concurred, especially from the noble Lord, Lord Low, and
my noble friends Lord Addington and Lord Lucas, that regulation and
guidance should focus on making the transitional arrangements between
school or college and higher education as easy as possible for the
students concerned. The point was made that it was not clear how the
Bill would improve the current imperfect
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T18:31:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010761000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010761000003">The
Minister’s reply was encouraging; she agreed with this aim but
stated that universities, not local authorities, were the best places
to support young people at this transition period. She also said that
local authorities should encourage young people to make an early claim
for disabled student’s allowance so that support is in place
when their courses begin. No one could disagree with this.</hs_para>

not all local authorities are good in their communications with young
people with disabilities and, of course, the earliest that a student
usually can begin these negotiations with universities is at the end of
August, when A-level results lead to the confirmation of the offer of a
course to begin some seven or eight weeks afterwards. Whereas
universities—as the Minister pointed out—have a good
record of publishing their objectives for the disabled, their record in

complaints and appeals happen in the NHS, and it is not quite clear
where parents who are concerned about the health component of the plan

the NHS complaints system was confusing, lacked accountability

course, the problem is the current systems that we have, so the notion
is that we establish a Bill that creates single education, health and

health appeals mechanism is not very transparent and on patient or

vary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010761000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010761000029">What do
we need to do? First, the code of conduct very much highlights the need
for mediation—but it talks about mediation in terms only of

three strands of the plan. In my view, mediation could considerably
reduce the number of people wishing to

you come to the appeals mechanism itself. Whatever happens here today,
I am utterly convinced that, in the years that follow, there will be
one tribunal for these plans. The difficulty is the
bureaucratic systems, as eloquently extolled by the noble Lord,
Lord Low. Currently, the bureaucracy is not fit for purpose. My
great fear is that we push the bureaucracies to agree one tribunal,
they go kicking and screaming, and the whole thing does not work. We
have to negotiate and make sure that everybody is on board to make this
happen. Having talked to Ministers in health and
education—though having been slightly disillusioned by
officials—I am sure that we can achieve that eventually. We need

those technicalities at this point, we have tabled Amendment 40B,

noble Lords have said, the issue is simple: the Government want to
establish an integrated system for meeting better the needs of disabled
children and those with special educational needs. That integration

apart at the point of appeal. As we have heard, parents and young
people would potentially have to go through three different routes of
appeal simultaneously for the three different elements of their plan.

behind this is the considerable resistance from the Department of

am sure he will have tried to mobilise those complaints procedures on
behalf of his constituents. It takes for ever, it is labyrinthine, it
is completely not transparent and it is very bureaucratic. The idea of

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 40A

of Amendment 40A but believe that the complexities that need

need some sort of driving
project.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010761000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010761000039">However,
I sincerely believe that we need that single point of entry. Everyone
has said how difficult it is for families to negotiate the different
kinds of tribunal. I remind noble Lords that these families are
struggling with children with severe disabilities. One thing they do
not have is time. If you have a disabled child, it takes three times as
long, if not more, to do anything, so you are immediately short of
time. These negotiations then cut into what time you have. You are also
short on emotional energy. If you have been through any sort of
tribunal—I have been through a few in my time in a number of
different positions—you know the emotional energy that it takes.
Disabled children drain emotional energy, much as you love
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010761000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010761000040">The
other thing is that the information you need for the different points
of entry is extremely complex. Many families are poor, have not had
educational advantage and do not always have the help of someone to
take them through the information to enable them to understand it. Were
the Government to achieve one different kind of tribunal, perhaps an
independent tribunal, it would be more efficient and more economic,
because there would be fewer people involved and less time used

have to say that no Government have achieved that yet. No Government

have problems with the Department of Health and social services and we

the capacity to handle initial phone, electronic, or face-to-face
inquiries. It will also encourage clinical commissioning groups to
ensure that relevant information is available at this single point of

extending the remit of the tribunal is difficult, the issues here are
extremely complicated. It is tempting to extend the tribunal’s
remit across health and social care, but there are legitimate reasons
why we cannot do so at this point. Local authorities’ duty to
arrange provision that will meet the special educational needs of a
child currently with a statement, or, in future, a child or young
person with a plan, is absolute. The local authority has to arrange
that provision no matter what the cost. This means that when the
tribunal makes a decision that will increase the special educational
provision for one child, that will have no effect on other children
with statements because the local authority has the same absolute duty
to arrange provision that meets their needs as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010761000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010761000053">The

the whole population. We have already discussed the issues around

tribunal were to be given powers to make decisions in those areas, any
decision the tribunal made to increase provision for one child or young

even greater health or social care needs could be deprived of provision
they require. It would therefore be wrong to give the tribunal the

extent it answers the noble Lord, Lord Storey, on his problems, and the

before Third Reading, it will be quite incredible. I would obviously
welcome that, because my amendment is asking for immediate effect, but

introduced an amendment to require local authorities in England
to establish and maintain a register of sight-impaired and severely
sight-impaired children and young people ordinarily resident in their
area. The Care Bill currently going through Parliament lays a duty on
local authorities to establish and maintain registers of sight-impaired
and severely sight-impaired adults. It seemed odd, therefore, that no
such obligation in relation to sight-impaired and severely
sight-impaired children was included in this Bill. These registers play
a critical role in enabling local authorities to assess
population-level need for specialist visual impairment services and
support, and to plan for their provision. The Government argued 
<?notus-xml column=1464?>that an obligation to maintain registers of disabled
children exists under the Children Act 1989, but there is a lot of
evidence to suggest that this obligation is widely disregarded and, in
any case, is not effective. The RNIB—and here I declare my
interest as a vice-president of that organisation—has recently
discovered by means of a series of freedom of information inquiries

requirement to maintain further impairment-specific registers. The
Government’s view is that the best way forward is to make the
requirement to maintain the registers of disabled children effective
rather than start setting up further impairment-specific registers.
This amendment is therefore designed to assist the Government in this
enterprise and give them the necessary tools by providing that the
Secretary of State should issue guidance on how local authorities can
most effectively discharge their duty to maintain registers of disabled
children under the Children Act 1989. It is a modest and, I hope,

lack the detail needed to support effective planning of services, in
particular for blind or visually-impaired children. It may well be that
some local authorities do not adequately maintain their registers at

that noble Lords welcomed these amendments, which are a significant
change to the Bill. They also provide a greater incentive to use the

different sets of guidance. The guidance in the code will ensure that

hope that we will see rather more happening in the area, but we
should not forget the importance of ensuring the early intervention
that has already been mentioned, and on which there was an interesting
question today during Questions. It indicated that the earlier you can
get to grips with this, the better. There must also be areas of
retraining for teachers—not just initial training, because it
will take a long time for that to infiltrate right across the spectrum.
With retraining, teachers can be made much more up to date in the
current needs of this vital

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I support these amendments
in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Addington. I echo the comments that
have been made about his diligence and determination in pursuing these
issues. He has today, in his usual style, made a compelling case for
the quality of special educational needs co-ordinators in schools to be
ensured though appropriate professional development and training, and
for all teachers to undergo an SEN module.</hs_para>

all teachers were aware of the range of SEN characteristics that could
be identified and the range of services available to support and 
<?notus-xml column=1468?>assist all young children. It would also avoid the SEN responsibility
being given to a member of staff who was not prepared to undergo the
training to carry out the functions seriously. In other words, it would
protect children from the possibility of it becoming a box-ticking
exercise in which the school could claim that the requirement had been
met without anyone with the requisite skills actually being available.

inspects in

rehearsed these arguments in Grand Committee, and the case was well
made then for the importance of early identification and intervention
to support children with special educational needs; that can make all
the difference to the child’s subsequent education

comprehensive range of SEN co-ordinators is of course a good step
forward, which we welcome, but these amendments would build in the

important.</hs_para>

possible regulations in this area and obviously some of the detail of
these requirements could, quite rightly, be included in regulation.

tabling these amendments and leading the debate on this important issue
of ensuring that schools and other institutions have the right
expertise within their workforce to support children and young people
with special educational needs. I cannot disagree with my noble
friend’s intentions. Ensuring that we have a well trained
workforce is essential, and is something that this Government are
committed to doing. I hope that I can reassure my noble friend that it

development and in their performance management arrangements for all
teaching and support staff. The chapter also requires schools to review
teachers’ understanding of strategies to identify and support
vulnerable pupils, and their knowledge of the special educational needs
most frequently encountered. This would particularly cover issues such
as dyslexia, which my noble friend has spoken passionately about on a

training in SEN as poor, while 69% of primary teachers and 74% of
secondary teachers 
<?notus-xml column=1469?>rated their training as good or very good in helping them to teach

unfortunate events, people with dyslexia taking apprenticeships have
been unable to obtain the final qualification because they could not
take the necessary English or maths test. It is an absurd situation
about which I have bent the ear of numerous Ministers over the past few

but under the Equality Act, this should not have happened, and the
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act did not preclude it
taking place. We have come to a situation that should not have
happened. My noble friend rather took the wind out of my sails for a

amendment is to ask my noble friend what should happen now. If it does
not happen, what will be done about it? We have a situation in which
practice has been established. Providers of apprenticeships do not have
to get people with dyslexia through this. They do not have to make the
adaptation provided here. The examining bodies and colleges have not
been doing it, so if we are changing this now, which I believe will be
the case—I hope it will be the case—

this, the need for Amendment 46D became apparent to me when

about an appeal, the expression “no good deed goes
unpunished” must have been running through their heads because
there is now another issue. There are people who have been failed
because people have been saying it is a legal requirement. What happens
to them? Potentially, there is a legal challenge here. If we do not do
something about it, there will be a legal challenge about loss of
earnings or lower earnings for life because of not being qualified. Are
we going to employ the plumber, the carpenter or so on who has the
apprenticeship or the one who does not? If you do not get some form of
redress here, somebody has let you down. There is a challenge. I
suggest that a reassessment or an appeal of some sort is the most
sensible thing to do. I look forward to what my noble friend will say

the process and criteria, there will be some cases that will be easy to
assess. If you have completed the course but failed the English test
and you are dyslexic, it is not that difficult. There are problems
because we have changed the name of the English test and have slightly
changed its nature—it has gone from “key skills”
to “functional skills”—but it should not be beyond
the wit of man. It has been going on for less than four years and there
are records. We should be able to follow them up. I owe my noble friend
a great deal of thanks for making sure of and correcting the legal
situation—unless there has been another bolt from the blue over
this—and I hope he will be able to give me some assurance that

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, we are very grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Addington, for raising these concerns about the access
of apprenticeship trainees to SEN support. As he pointed out, they
already have some entitlements that were laid down in previous
legislation, but the rights and provisions are not being supplied
consistently. This is leading to otherwise excellent trainees failing
particular modules of their training because their learning support
needs have not been properly identified. It seems that once again
apprenticeships are in danger of being the poor relation in the
education
hierarchy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000051">There
are two ways that these inconsistencies can be addressed. First, all
employers and trainers need to be aware of their responsibilities to
make proper provision. This echoes the point the noble Lord is raising
here. Secondly, apprentices themselves should have greater awareness of
their rights, how to access the help they need and how to appeal if
they are unhappy with the provision
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000052">These
amendments go some way to addressing these issues. Amendment 46D deals
more specifically with the testing regime. We would expect apprentices
with SEN to have their needs identified at an early stage rather than
waiting until they have failed a component. However, we would also
expect provision 
<?notus-xml column=1473?>to be made for an appeal if the failure is felt to
be caused by inadequate support for their special educational needs. I
very much endorse the arguments the noble Lord made and hope that the
Minister will be able to provide reassurance today that these issues
are being addressed so that no young apprentice will suffer because of
inadequate support for their learning and skills
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T19:48:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="14010769000300" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000300">Lord
Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, progress on this issue has been far too

the reasonable adjustments that could have helped them to demonstrate

Lord Addington for bringing this very important issue to the attention
of the House. He has been an assiduous campaigner for children and
young people with dyslexia, and I pay tribute to the way in which he
has presented his concerns in this House, particularly during Grand
Committee debates. I pay tribute to his passion and persistence. Saying
that I managed by my letter to take the wind out of his sails is high
praise indeed. I want to take this opportunity to clarify the system
allowing reasonable adjustments to qualifications and appeals, and I
hope I will be able to reassure him that additional action will happen
with an urgency that has been
lacking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000055">As my
noble friend knows from our discussions, I share his desire to
see reasonable adjustments offered to all young people on an
apprenticeship who need them, so that they have a reasonable
opportunity to achieve the required qualifications in English and
maths. I want to take this opportunity to clarify the clear duty in
Part 6 of the Equality Act 2010 on learning providers and awarding
organisations to make reasonable adjustments so that disabled people
are, wherever possible, not put at a disadvantage compared to other
learners. I share my noble friend’s concern that this duty
should be applied in every relevant case.</hs_para>

this duty, individuals may bring a challenge in a county court. The
county court can grant any remedy which the High Court could grant in
proceedings in tort or in a claim for judicial review. Available
sanctions include damages, injunctions and a declaration. In addition,
repeated breaches may lead us to challenge the body’s ability to
deliver training or to award qualifications. Following the important
points that my noble friend Lord Addington made in Grand Committee, I
am pleased to be able to place on record that there is nothing in the
Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Act, or in the
associated specification for apprenticeship standards in England, that
prevents the use of assistive technology for functional skills
qualifications.</hs_para>

has for some time been working with awarding organisations and the
British Dyslexia Association to continue to widen opportunities to use
assistive technology as a reasonable adjustment. The Access
Consultation Forum meets three to four times a year. The next meeting
is on 30 January, and this will be on the agenda. Ofqual assures me
that it takes the issue of equality very seriously. I understand that
the BDA and my noble friend have examples of 
<?notus-xml column=1474?>individuals who have been disadvantaged, and I invite them to provide
details of the specific cases to Ofqual, via officials if that would be
helpful. Ofqual has committed to investigate the circumstances of all
these cases. In addition, we will include new text in the skills
funding statement to remind education and training providers of their
duty to support young people with learning difficulties or disabilities
and of their responsibility for providing reasonable adjustments,
including the use of assistive technology where appropriate.</hs_para>

noble friend that we can do more to provide straightforward advice and
information on the support available to individuals with learning
difficulties or disabilities, so that they understand their rights and
can challenge appropriately if they are not properly supported. Noble
Lords will be aware that I wrote to the noble Lord, Lord
Addington—as he mentioned—on 2 December and committed in
that letter to some additional steps to raise awareness of the support
on offer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000059">I
know that my noble friend is also concerned that young people should
make a good transition out of school and into their next stage of
learning. The system that we are replacing has not always served young
people well in this respect. The nought to 25 system created
by the Bill will ensure a much greater continuity of support between
different phases and types of learning. Local authorities will be under
a duty to identify all young people aged up to 25 in their area who
have, or may have, special educational needs, and to consider whether
local provision is sufficient to meet their needs. They may publish a
local offer setting out the full range of post-16 education and
training provision, including apprenticeships. Young people who need
the most support will receive an EHC plan regardless of whether they
stay at school, go to FE college or to work-based provision in
the private sector, unlike the current disjointed
system.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010769000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000060">The

As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T19:53:38"></hs_TimeCode> a result of
my noble friend’s recent appeal, we are working with the
Dyslexia Trust to produce clear information explaining the support
available to apprentices with learning difficulties or disabilities.
This will be made available through the National Apprenticeship Service
website and will also include information about assistive technology
and reasonable
adjustments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000062">In
response to the concerns raised by the noble Lord, Lord Addington, I
also asked officials to look into the process of complaints, retakes
and appeals to ensure that it is as fair and transparent as possible.
Although a process is in place and is consistent with other national
qualifications such as GCSEs, I believe 
<?notus-xml column=1475?>that more could be done by centres and training
providers to publicise it. My officials checked several apprenticeship
provider websites, and, although there were examples of good practice,
many do not provide details of their procedures. This contrasts with
information on school or university websites, where it is generally
very clear how to get advice about support or exam results, and about
how to complain. I will ask officials as a priority to find a way to
ensure that centres and provider websites publish good information
about complaints and appeals on their websites in future. I hope that
my noble friend will recognise that, taken together, these measures
represent improvements for those undertaking apprenticeships. I hope
also that the House will acknowledge the outstanding personal
commitment that the noble Lord, Lord Addington, had demonstrated in
bringing this about.</hs_para>

appeals for those who failed key skills tests because of failures to
make reasonable adjustments. As noble Lords may know, key skills
qualifications have been replaced by functional skills qualifications.
The last possible date for certification was in 2013. Key skills were
phased out very gradually, allowing plenty of opportunities for
learners to resit them. Nevertheless, as my noble friend has so
eloquently set out, we cannot ignore cases where there is evidence that
legal duties have not been adhered to. I have therefore asked officials
to work with the British Dyslexia Association and Ofqual to gather
evidence and seek a solution to any issues identified, whether current
or historic. Officials will be able to advise on specific cases or
systemic issues.</hs_para>

further specific commitment. Where an apprentice with learning
difficulties or disabilities has previously completed all other
requirements of a particular apprenticeship, but was not able to pass a
key skills qualification, for example because reasonable adjustments
were not made, they will be able to sit the alternative functional
skills test. They will be entitled to the appropriate support and
reasonable adjustments. If this test is passed at the appropriate
level, the Government will enable the individual to receive an
apprenticeship certificate, even if a year or two has
elapsed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0002.htm#14010769000065">I
hope that this will reassure noble Lords that the issue is of great
concern to the Government and that we are taking substantial and

him. Unfortunately he should not—as I should

Wilkins:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment is in my name and that
of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, and the noble Lord, Lord
Low of Dalston. It would require an independent regulator to be
appointed to scrutinise the provision of local authority services for
children with SEN and their families. It is a further attempt to
address the widespread concern about the lack of accountability in this
Bill. As my noble friend Lady Morris of Yardley said in Grand
Committee, the whole Bill could fail if parents do not quickly have
confidence in the offer. There must be a clear message to parents that
there will be a voice speaking on their behalf to make sure that the
offer is of good quality.</hs_para>

same debate, several noble Lords echoed the point of the noble
Lord, Lord Low, that, in the introduction of new assessed systems such
as this, it would be rash not to build any element of accountability or
quality control into the process. This is also a key concern for many
in the sector, including the Special Educational Consortium, the
National Deaf Children’s Society, Sense, RNIB and the National
Sensory Impairment Partnership. In particular, there is a real lack of
scrutiny of local authorities’ specialist SEN services. They
remain the Cinderella service, and the missing link in the SEN
accountability framework within Ofsted. This is despite recognition
from the department and Ofsted that such services are vital. If these
services are as important as the department says they are, they need to
be properly scrutinised to ensure that they are effectively raising
outcomes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T20:00:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

therefore fill this gap in the SEN accountability framework. Action

underachieving. For example, government figures show that just 37% of
deaf children achieved five good GCSEs last year. Given that deafness

already limited 
<?notus-xml column=1482?>the scope of this review by Ofsted. He confirmed by
letter to Sir Malcolm Bruce that his department had no plans to
introduce inspections of local authority SEN services, as it would
impose significant new burdens. It therefore looks highly unlikely that

the arguments which the department has given for not inspecting local
authorities’ SEN services. The department has said that it does
not believe that Ofsted inspection of local authority SEN provision is
needed, because it is already indirectly covered by their inspection of
mainstream schools. However, this ignores the crucial role that many
services play in supporting families with pre-school children. For
example, the British Association of Teachers of the Deaf supports
parents of deaf children in advising them on their children’s
language and communication development. Without this support, far more
deaf children would be starting primary school without age-appropriate
language skills. We know how vital early communication is.
More<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T20:03:34"></hs_TimeCode> than

this argument presupposes that Ofsted inspections already pay close
attention to the quality of local authority SEN support to schools. I
am sceptical. Particularly in the case of low-incidence needs, such as
sensory impairment, where there may be only one child with that
condition in that school, does it really seem likely that an Ofsted
inspector will have the time to closely scrutinise the quality of that
support?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000074">I
understand that Ofsted’s recent annual report made no reference
to the quality of local authority SEN provision. I also understand
that, of the nine Ofsted regional reports, only one made any reference
at all to SEN. The department has also suggested that inspection of
local authority SEN services might send a signal to schools that they
are no longer responsible for SEN. In that case, by the same rationale,
Ofsted should immediately cease their inspections of local
authorities’ school improvement
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000075">The
Minister has also argued that increased transparency will support
greater accountability, and that the Children and Families Bill
supports this. Of course, increased transparency is welcome, but I
remain concerned that the burden of keeping local authorities in check
lies far too heavily with parents. The proposed requirement that local
authorities be required to respond to comments left on the local offer
by parents is not a substitute for real accountability. If it were, we
could do away with Ofsted inspection of schools altogether. Why not
just allow parents to leave comments on a website about their school?
We must remember that many parents are busy being parents. Parents do
not always know what they do not know. They do not have the time to
research and analyse how good their local authority services are and
many parents do not wish to rock the boat. The support that a child
receives should and must be determined by what they need, not by how
pushy or confident their parents
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000076">The

achieved by children with SEN, something that will cost us greatly in
future years. The proposal that Ofsted simply studies this issue and
reports back next spring is too weak and vague. Moreover, based on what
the department has told Members in the other place, it will not deliver

the majority of school-age children with sensory impairments attend
mainstream provision and often rely on support from specialist visiting
teachers and services. Whether the support comes from outside or inside
the school, the development of mainstream provision for children with
sensory impairment is of sufficiently recent origin for it to be the
case that many schools in which children with sensory disabilities and
impairments are being educated are still unfamiliar with the methods of
educating children who are blind, deaf, or deafblind, and with the
special skills that they need, the communication methods that they use,
and how to inculcate those skills. It is vitally important that there
should be a system of inspection

transition to mainstream, services are not yet of the quality that we
want to see; it is in the nature of the case that you do not always get
services of the quality that you want just at the beginning of a new
development. But I want to argue that the existence of a system of
inspection and accountability is absolutely vital to raising standards
and avoiding bad practice just by default. The lack of scrutiny
afforded<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T20:14:15"></hs_TimeCode> to

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, I warmly support the intent behind
the amendment in the names of my noble friends Lady Wilkins, Lady Howe
and Lord Low of Dalston. However, as a former chief inspector, I have
to admit that I am a little concerned about the confusion between
inspection and regulation that is implied within it. Three separate
functions are involved in oversight: audit, regulation and inspection.
They are all different and are carried out in a different way. An audit
can be a largely internal activity. Regulation must involve somebody
directing that something has to happen. Inspection, if it is to mean
anything, should be both independent and objective and therefore able
to consider all the nuances of what is to be inspected. I note with
interest that the current lack of accountability, which was described
as weak accountability by my noble friend Lady Howe, has already been
mentioned many times during the course of this

amendment is really a plea to the Government to think very carefully
about how they are going to ensure oversight of an essential local
authority provision, because currently there are no inspectors capable
of carrying out that function. I refer the Minister to a precedent
which might be followed—namely, the inspections of the
safeguarding of children which were carried out by the old Commission
for Social Care Inspection, which was abolished by the previous
Government. It consisted of inspectors from Ofsted, the prisons
inspectorate, the Department for Education, the Audit Commission,
because it had a responsibility to look at local government and, of
course, healthcare. The reports that were produced on safeguarding
children are models that could be followed in this case as they covered
many aspects which Ofsted does not have the skill to cover given that
it is essentially concerned with education and a lot of the relevant
provision concerns either healthcare or social care. Ofsted is not
responsible for healthcare and I do not believe that it is very good at
social care

other thing that has to be remembered is that when we are talking about
special educational needs, we are talking not just about the under-18s
who come under the school regime but about the age range of nought to
25, as was mentioned earlier today in connection with detention.
Therefore, we have to consider the inspection of local government
provision for people other than those at school. The review that has
been announced for next spring, carried out by Ofsted, 
<?notus-xml column=1486?>should be stopped as I do not think that it is
adequate. What the Government should do is consider very carefully a
much wider examination of who is needed to conduct the oversight of all
the activities that have been mentioned at various stages of the Bill.

something as important as this, on which we have made so much progress

concerned not just with those classed as having special educational
needs but with the wider community of children who have special
educational needs. That is a very large number of children, as has been
mentioned already. Some 1.4 million children fall into that
category and are served by their schools but depend very much at the

Picking up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, I believe
I am right in saying that Ofsted currently inspects children’s

children’s services, including protection services, it would not
be so difficult for it to take account also of the special educational
needs services provided by local authorities. It seems to me that this

comments from disabled children and young people, those with SEN and
the parents of such children, about the local offer, including the
quality of the provision available and about any provision that is not
available in their area. We make clear in the draft SEN code that when
local authorities publish their response to comments this includes the
action local authorities propose to take. Amendment 33C makes this
explicit in the Bill. Local authorities cannot simply publish their
response to comments but then ignore them. They must say what action
they intend to take. As with every other part of the development of the

focus on the extent to which local areas ensure that children and young
people with SEN and those who are disabled are identified and
their needs met. It will look for improved outcomes
and the satisfaction of parents and young people. It will
establish a baseline from which to evaluate progress in implementing
the reforms; provide guidance to local authorities about the
development of effective practice and advice about aspects requiring
further development; and consider how, if required, effective
accountability could take
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000095">The

study. Should Ofsted recommend that an inspection framework is needed

accountability, schools are ultimately responsible for the progress of
all pupils where additional support is needed. Schools should use their
best endeavours to ensure that those needs are met. The Ofsted
inspection framework introduced in September 2012 places a clear
emphasis on meeting the needs of disabled pupils and those with SEN.
Inspectors must consider the quality of teaching and the progress made
by these pupils. Where a school has a specialist resource base or
integrated unit, these are covered as part of the inspection. Ofsted
also inspects special schools, which provide support for sensory
impaired children and others who may currently have a statement of SEN.
This means that any deaf child in a mainstream or specialist school
would have their education inspected as part of the Ofsted Section 5
framework. I want to stress that the SEN reforms will provide legal
protections for families wanting to challenge councils through their
involvement in determining local provisions. Not only do the SEN
reforms in the Bill provide legal protections, they will also establish
a better system for identifying need and commissioning services across
education, health and social care to ensure that services 
<?notus-xml column=1488?>provided match local needs as accurately as possible and so that
families do not have to battle to get those
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T20:28:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000098">Of
course, the success of the reforms will depend on changing culture and
practice locally. We cannot just pass this Bill, walk away and hope
that things happen. I agree entirely with the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, about ensuring that local authorities perform.
That is why my department is monitoring closely the readiness of local
areas to implement these reforms in preparation for September 2014.
There is already a package of support for implementation delivered and
co-ordinated by our strategic delivery partners—the Council for
Disabled Children and pathfinder champion lead via the pathfinder
support team at Mott MacDonald. The Minister for Children and Families
has written to all chief executives of local authorities and clinical
commissioning groups about the reforms. We will be monitoring local
authorities’ progress in implementing the reforms from September
2014. We will consider what further steps may be needed in the light of
this information and the findings of the study being conducted by
Ofsted into local authority practice in preparing for and taking
forward these reforms. I will certainly ensure that we look at the
prior art to which the noble Lord referred and that we take seriously
the whole issue of ensuring that delivery happens on the
ground.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14010769000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000099">I

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T20:33:31"></hs_TimeCode>by introducing
the employment allowance, employer national insurance contributions

addition to the two measures just mentioned, the Bill contains three
principal other measures. First, it gives effect to the general
anti-abuse rule, or GAAR, for NICs. Secondly, it amends existing powers

regulations to be made for the certification of non-UK employers of oil

part of the Government’s efforts to grow the economy and
increase employment, the Chancellor announced in his 2013 Budget the
creation of an employment allowance, which will come into effect from 6
April this year. The intention is that businesses, charities and
community amateur sports clubs in the UK will be entitled to an
allowance of up to £2,000 towards their employer NICs liability.
The objective of the allowance will be to support businesses with the
cost of employing their staff by reducing their employer class 1 NICs
bill each year. It will support thousands of small businesses which are
aspiring to grow, perhaps by hiring their first
employee or expanding their workforce, as well as those already
employing others or facing temporary cash-flow problems.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1491?><hs_para UID="14010769000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000108">Up
to 1.25 million employers will benefit from the allowance, with around
450,000 employers—around one-third of all employers in the
country—being taken out of the requirement to pay employer NICs
altogether. The benefits of the policy will be most keenly felt by
small businesses, with more than 90% of the benefit of the
allowance going to businesses with fewer than 50 employees. The
allowance will be a permanent feature of the national insurance scheme.
It will be simple to administer, delivered through standard payroll

second main element of the Bill implements the announcement by the
Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Autumn Statement that employer class
1 NICs will be abolished for employees under the age of 21 from 1 April
2015. This is brought into effect by introducing a zero rate of
secondary class 1 NICs for all employers on the earnings of those
employees under the age of 21. As the Chancellor made clear, the
Government believe that this measure will help to support young people
and make sure that no one is left behind as the economy recovers. The
measure will apply both to new and existing employees aged under 21 and
is not
time-limited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000110">There
are two important features of the new clause which I should like to
explain to the House. First, there are regulation-making
powers to add an age group to those in respect of whom a reduced rate
of secondary class 1 NICs applies and to specify what that reduced rate
is; and to reduce the rate of secondary class 1 NICs for a previously
specified age group. For example, the Government could in the future
allow for an increase in the age bracket of employees falling into the
zero-rate band of secondary class 1 NICs. This power is
capable only of placing an employee in a lower percentage bracket, so
will be a relieving power
only.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000111">Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T20:40:08"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is a regulation-making power to ensure that the benefit of the
zero rate, or a reduced rate of secondary class 1 NICs, can be enjoyed
only in respect of earnings below a certain level. This will initially
be set at the level of the upper earnings limit, expected to be the
equivalent of around £42,000 a year in 2015-16. In the year that
it is introduced, 2015-16, the abolition of employer class 1 NICs for
under-21s will cost £465 million. This effective abolition of
employer NICs for employers of those under 21 years of age has been

now turn to the other main measures in the Bill, starting with the
general anti-abuse rule, or GAAR. Noble Lords will be aware that the
Government announced in the 2012 Budget that they had accepted the
recommendations of the Aaronson report to introduce a GAAR targeted at
abusive tax-avoidance schemes. The GAAR was introduced by Part 5 of the
Finance Act 2013 and has been in force since July last year.
Provisions in the Bill apply the GAAR to NICs. The

GAAR is designed specifically to target those arrangements which are
regarded as abusive by considering whether the arrangement can be
regarded as a reasonable course of action. The rule, once it is applied
to NICs by the Bill, is estimated to increase combined receipts of tax

in 2017-18. However, the main purpose is not to raise revenue but to
deter abusive avoidance practices in the first

HMRC’s partnership review conducted between May and August last

partnership tax rules where the immediate entitlement to partnership
profits is restricted by the alternative investment fund managers
directive. The majority of fund managers will not be
affected—only those who operate through a partnership. Under
existing partnership tax rules, tax is charged to profits as they are
earned, rather than when they are received. An unfunded tax charge can
therefore arise on profits that are allocated to an individual partner
of an AIFM partnership and which are then deferred in line with the
regulatory requirements of the AIFMD. This is because the partner
cannot access the deferred profits before the tax becomes due and
payable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000119">The

certain LLP members as employed earners for NICs purposes, even when

record, that this is the first time in my 17 years in your
Lordships’ House in a Second Reading 
<?notus-xml column=1494?>debate that two-thirds of the speeches have been delivered by Liberal
Democrats. It goes without saying that we on these Benches support the
Bill very strongly. The Bill ought to be put into the context of the
package of measures that the coalition Government have introduced to
support the so-called SMEs in recent years, which were very much
supported by the Liberal Democrat members of the coalition—and
often, dare I say it, provoked by them.</hs_para>

them. We have corporation tax down from 28% to 23% and heading for 20%
by 2015. We have the proposed creation of the new business bank and the
various lending schemes designed to assist SMEs. We have the
establishment of the regional growth fund and the increase in capital

Member of Parliament for Burnley. We have the “one in, two

their employees’ class 1 NICs, and the Government’s
confirmation that HMRC will engage with the representative bodies of
businesses and others to ensure that the system works as simply as
possible, so as to minimise its impact. I think the Minister reported
the Treasury calculation that up to 1.25 million businesses will
benefit from the scheme, with around 450,000 being taken out of paying
employer’s NICs altogether. That is about one-third of all
employers. It is clearly a significant figure. The other issue here
that we very much welcome from these Benches is the effect of including
charities. It is calculated that up to 35,000 charities with employees
will benefit, reducing their tax burden, it is calculated, by around
£45 million in
total.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000127">At<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T20:50:01"></hs_TimeCode>

help SMEs. The Labour proposals of which I am aware would freeze
business rates for two years from 2015. It is calculated that this

presumption that limited liability partnership members are to be
treated as self-employed, which can be used as a tax loophole. It is
important that these changes will only target those NIC arrangements
that are regarded as abusive. As the Minister indicated, as with all

brief response, I am entirely happy to associate the Opposition with
the broad thrust of the Bill—particularly as the noble Lord,
Lord Razzall, indicated that we should concentrate on the Liberal
Democrat part of the coalition when discussing this matter. We will of
course seek to test the Government further in Committee, while
applauding the fact that the main principles of the Bill are those to
which we subscribe. In particular, we recognise the application of GAAR
to this area. GAAR is always going to loom up as a deus ex machina in
relation to a great deal of finance legislation. It does so here, and
we noted the optimistic assessments that the Minister put forward on
what it may achieve. The proof of that particular pudding will be in

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank both noble Lords for their broad
welcome for the proposals in the Bill. I am very grateful to my noble
friend Lord Razzall for setting the Bill in the context of all the
other measures that we have taken to support business, particularly
SMEs. The Bill contains useful and valuable measures but, as my noble
friend pointed out, they are only a couple of pieces in the large
jigsaw of provisions which, taken together, we believe will help to
sustain the recovery and put Britain on the path to strong, prosperous
growth in the years
ahead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000143">The
noble Lord, Lord Razzall, referred to the findings of the Federation of
Small Businesses’ survey in this area and what small businesses
said they would do with the additional resource. I thought that one of
the more interesting aspects of that survey was that a substantial
proportion of respondents said that they would increase wages. Given
that I think both the Government and the Opposition are keen that wages
at the bottom end are improved, if the measure does have the impact of
increasing wages—as well as generating new jobs in other
cases—that will mean that it has been
effective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000144">The

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord is of course absolutely
correct. He is also aware that the number of people in the Chamber is
normally in inverse proportion to the degree of support for a measure.

measure
is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-01-07T21:05:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14010769000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107-0003.htm#14010769000147">The
noble Lord slightly chided the Government on the fact that the regional
employers’ NICs holiday had not been as effective as we had
originally hoped. That is undoubtedly the case. However, it did support
over 90,000 jobs, and I suspect that the people in those jobs think it
was a pretty good scheme. It certainly did not have the scale of effect
that we were looking for. Although that was in no small measure because
of the overall economic environment into which that programme was
launched, having a nationwide permanent scheme rather than a temporary
targeted scheme is likely to make the impact of the scheme that much
more

slightly chided me on the fact that we were not bringing in the
abolition of employer NICs for under-21s quicker than 2015. That is
largely because of the need for computer systems to be changed. The
view taken by HMRC in consultation with business was that it would be
extremely difficult to get all that sorted out by next April, which

noble Lord also said that it would be impossible to accurately assess
the impact of the scheme because we had not introduced it on a pilot
basis. Of course the conundrum is that, if you do something on a pilot
basis, you are only allowing a small proportion of the overall audience
that you seek to affect to be part of that pilot. Particularly with the
employment allowance, we wanted to make the scheme available to
everybody as soon as possible. As the FSB survey suggests, we are
confident that it will be

agree with the noble Lord that quite a lot of the implementation of
this legislation will obviously be done by secondary legislation. The
primary legislation is already pretty complicated; the secondary

today, the Government believe that the Bill does and will enable the
reduction of taxation of labour nationally through the employment
allowance, and provides support to employers of under-21s. As I have
said on several occasions, the Bill is good for growth and good for
jobs. I commend it to the House.

and widespread medical uses but which can also affect a
patient’s ability to drive and are sometimes misused. We know
that the vast majority of people who use these drugs are doing so
responsibly and safely and that is why our approach does not unduly
penalise drivers who have taken properly prescribed medicines. The
limits we proposed follow the recommendations of the Expert Panel,
which in the vast majority of cases, will avoid the new offence
catching out drivers who have taken properly prescribed or supplied
drugs in accordance with the directions of a healthcare professional or

boost jobs and growth by: advancing trade; ensuring everyone pays their

this contribution with minimal operational impact or burden on the

consultation also sought views on whether any changes should be made to
the categories of non-residents who should be exempted from charges. A
proposal to provide more generous exemptions to ex-pats, many of whom
should be charged for treatment provided when returning on visits,
received broad support. The response proposes to confirm the principle
that exemptions should be consistent with criteria applied to UK
pensions and other state benefits, but further work is required to
confirm specific qualifying criteria and financial

open review of current exemptions generated requests for a number of
new or extended exemptions for maternity, victims of domestic and other
violence

do not intend to establish an exemption for children or for pregnant
women. In both cases we believe there is significant risk of abuse by
visitors either seeking maternity care for themselves or care for their
children with existing serious illnesses, and may act as a draw to
illegal migrant families. We will listen to arguments about how best to
cover other vulnerable children who might otherwise be unable to access
treatment. All of these potential changes will be subject to further
final Cabinet approval following further

consultation also proposed extending the scope of NHS services for
which charges should apply for non-exempt visitors. Charges currently

response signals our commitment to charge visitors for treatment in
hospital A&amp;Es, but this will not be introduced until improved
systems can support its effective administration, including the safe
and efficient delivery of A&amp;E services, avoiding unintended
charging of legitimate residents and ensuring immediately necessary
treatment is not refused. It also confirms the intention to extend
charging to other services and treatment that are part of primary care,
including community-based healthcare, prescriptions and dental services
(which are already subject to charges for many residents). Officials
will work with the NHS to determine how appropriate and cost-effective
non-resident charging should be defined and

The Government has devolved direct long-haul rates of air passenger

the unique position of Northern Ireland, which is the only part of the
UK sharing a land border with another EU Member State, which has a
lower rate of aviation

out in the response to the Silk Commission, the Government is not
convinced of the case for devolving APD to Wales given the potential
effects across the country as a whole. In particular, a report
published by HMRC in 2012 highlighted that different rates either side
of the Wales/England border would be likely to lead to market
distortions that redistributed passengers between airports without

privately, to the Israel authorities our serious concerns about the
actual or threatened demolition of Palestinian homes and infrastructure

The work of the magistracy is most often promoted through events such

Warsi:</Member> The BBC has full editorial, operational and managerial
independence. Both the issue of BBC World Service broadcasts to North
Korea and any decision by BBC Worldwide to provide BBC drama and
documentary programmes for broadcast on North Korean television are
matters for the BBC. As I said in my reply to Lord Alton’s
question of 18 December, we understand that the BBC World Service is
not currently persuaded that a Korean language service would be an
effective use of its funds. In the case of the broadcasting of BBC
Worldwide programmes on North Korean television, this is an initiative
which is under active consideration by the BBC and on which the British
Embassy in Pyongyang has been able to play a role in facilitating
contacts. We believe, as my colleague the Minister of State, my Rt.
hon. Friend the Member for 
<?notus-xml column=287?>East Devon (Mr Swire) said on 16 December, that it has the potential to
expose significant numbers of North Koreans to aspects of the outside

2011 the British Embassy in Rangoon supported conservation work in
wildlife sanctuaries in the Mandalay Region and Southern Rakhine State
respectively. Embassy officials met the 
<?notus-xml column=310?>Minister of Environmental Conservation and Forestry in Naypyitaw in
April 2013 and raised concerns over the conservation of rare animal
species in Hkakabo Razi in Northern Kachin State. Embassy officials
also met the Ministry of Environmental Conservation and Forestry in
Naypyitaw on three occasions earlier this year to discuss wildlife
conservation and protection, and urge Burma to attend the London
Conference in February 2014. In addition, the Embassy made requests to
the Burmese Government to permit the BBC to film in Burma for the
‘Wild Burma: Nature’s Lost Kingdom’
programme.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14010768001330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140107w0003.htm#14010768001330">Young
