Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs Theresa
May):</Member></B> With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a
statement on the deportation of Abu Qatada. Yesterday—more than
10 years after this ought to have happened—Abu Qatada was
deported from the United Kingdom and sent back to Jordan. On arrival in
Amman, he was handed over to the Jordanian authorities and formally
charged with the two offences of which he had previously been found
guilty in absentia. He is now held in Muwaqqar
prison.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000207">As
hon. Members know, successive Governments have sought to deport Qatada
since 2001. The long delays and significant costs that his case has
incurred are down to the many layers of appeal rights that were
available to him, and real problems with our human rights laws. I will
turn to those issues later, but first I want to make it clear that the
Government have succeeded in deporting Qatada by respecting the rule of
law at each and every stage of the process. We did not ignore court
judgments we did not like. We did not act outside the law. We did what
was right. And for a civilised nation, that is something of which we
should be immensely
proud.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000208">Qatada’s
deportation, which took place on Sunday morning, followed my issuing of
a fresh deportation decision on 27 June, and my further decision to
certify any appeal that Qatada might have brought on human rights
grounds as “clearly unfounded”. That meant that the only
choice open to Qatada was between challenging my decision through
judicial review or conceding that the game was up. Given the strength
of the agreement we reached with the Jordanian Government in March, he
accepted the
inevitable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000209">It
is important to remember that the UK Government already had assurances
about Qatada’s treatment in Jordan—assurances that have
been upheld in the courts—but in February last year the European
Court of Human Rights moved the goalposts and declared that his
deportation would be unlawful because of the risk that evidence
obtained through the mistreatment of others might be used against him.
That was the first time ever Strasbourg had blocked a deportation on
that basis. The treaty we agreed with the Jordanian Government puts the
answer to that final question beyond any doubt. The treaty guarantees a
fair trial for anyone deported from either of our countries. The treaty
benefits both countries and I thank hon. Members in this House for
ensuring its rapid ratification. It was the key that unlocked the door
to
deportation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000210">Qatada’s
deportation demonstrates both our commitment to abide by the law and
our resolve to deport foreign nationals who threaten our safety and
security. It also demonstrates the legal validity of our policy of
deportation with assurances.</hs_Para>

turn now to the lessons we need to learn from the case. The deportation
of Abu Qatada has taken 12 years and cost more than £1.7 million
in legal fees for both sides. That is not acceptable to the public, and
it is not acceptable to me. We must make sure it never happens
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000212">First,
we have to do something about the legal fees spent by defendants and
paid by the taxpayer, not to mention the benefits they also claim.
Secondly, we have 
<?notus-xml column=24?>to remove the many layers of appeal that are available to foreign
nationals we want to deport. Thirdly, we have to do something about the
crazy interpretation of our human rights
laws.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000213">The
Government are taking action to address all three concerns. First, on
legal fees and benefits, in the case of Abu Qatada £220,000 of
his legal fees were funded from his own accounts, which were frozen by
the authorities, but the rest—some £430,000—was
funded by the taxpayer, and in many other cases foreign nationals we
ought to be able to remove have their legal costs paid in full
by the public. That is something my right hon. Friend the Justice
Secretary is addressing in his reforms to the legal aid system and I
can also tell the House that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions is considering how we can curtail the
benefits claims made by terror suspects and extremists whose behaviour
is not conducive to the public
good.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000214">Secondly,
we need to do something about appeal rights. Through the Crime and
Courts Act 2013, the Government have already legislated for the
principle that in national security cases individuals should be able to
appeal only following deportation to their home country, except in
cases where there is a risk of serious, irreversible harm. But we will

this year. That Bill will stop illegal immigrants accessing services to
which they are not entitled; it will make it easier to remove foreign
nationals; it will make it harder for them to prolong their stay with
spurious appeals; and it will make clear to the courts once and for all
that foreign nationals who commit serious crimes shall, other than in
exceptional circumstances, be deported. I hope hon. and right hon.

back to Jordan to stand fair trial. This is a good result for not just
the Home Secretary, but the country. In his home country, Abu Qatada
stands accused of plotting terror attacks against a school and

Abu Qatada was granted asylum in this country in 1994, he began
preaching hatred and praising terror attacks. He is a dangerous man
whose values we in this Parliament condemn, and that is why successive
Home Secretaries—Labour and Conservative—have worked to
deport him with the cross-party support of the House and that of the
country. I strongly welcome the work of the Home Office and the Foreign
Office to keep pursuing the case over many years, and we should also
welcome the work of the Jordanian Government and Parliament to pass the
treaties that were
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000222">My
right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) agreed
the first memorandum of understanding with Jordan in 2005, which led to
the agreement of the British courts that Abu Qatada could be deported
without the threat of torture, and the Home Secretary rightly built on
that agreement after the 2012 European Court judgment. She was also
right to pursue the legal route, rather than listening to those who
urged her to ignore the law. Without the rule of law, we are not
free.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000223">We
should be in no doubt, however, that the case has taken far too long,
so change is needed to deal with such unacceptable and costly delays.
The attempt to deport Abu Qatada started in 2005. It took three years
for his case to reach the Court of Appeal, another year for
it to reach the Law Lords and a further three years for it
to reach the European Court, and it is a further 18 months
since then. That is far too long—too long in the British courts
and then too long in the European
Court.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000224">We
will examine the Home Secretary’s proposal that layers of appeal
should be removed for immigration cases, because we believe that the
process needs to be speeded up and that slow justice is in no
one’s interests, but I urge her and the Secretary of State for
Justice to consider the practical and administrative reasons why such
cases take so long. The European Court now has a backlog of 150,000
cases and badly needs major reform. However, Ministers promised
progress while Britain chaired the Council of Europe, yet little of
substance was achieved. The borders inspectorate has said that a
quarter of foreign criminals are sent home and a third are given leave
to remain, but that 40% are not deported simply for administrative and
bureaucratic reasons, so those cases need to be tackled.</hs_Para>

Secretary referred to the qualified right to a family life
under article 8 which can be used in immigration cases, on which we
have supported the Government, although that was clearly not the issue
in the Abu Qatada case. She concluded by saying that she wanted to
abolish the Human Rights Act and to consider withdrawing from the
European convention, yet she herself has drawn on the Human Rights Act.
She used it to prevent Gary McKinnon from being deported to the USA,
but without the Act, she would have had no legal justification for
doing so. It is unclear whether she wants no Bill of Rights at all,
which would consequently mean that there would be little restriction on
what the Home Secretary’s decisions could be, but will she
confirm that the Government’s commission on a draft British Bill
of Rights has replicated article 3 of the Human Rights Act, on the
absolute prohibition of torture? As she knows, the central issue in the
Abu Qatada case was always torture, which is something that we in
Britain have always abhorred, so ditching the Human Rights Act and

respecting the rule of law and holding no truck with torture. The Home
Secretary rightly claimed credit for all those things in her statement,

deportation, and issues around the speed with which these cases are
dealt with in the courts. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State

is the concern that Government Members have about the role of
Parliament in setting laws that operate in the United Kingdom. That is
one of the issues that we are looking at in relation to the European
Court and its ability to deal with cases that are taken through the
courts in the UK. Secondly, she rather churlishly suggested that
nothing happened when we chaired the Council of Europe. A considerable
amount of work was put in by the former Justice Secretary, the
Attorney-General and others, and it led to the Brighton declaration,
which is bringing about change in the way in which the European Court
operates, so that is another success for this Government, who took that
opportunity to make some
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000231">My
final point is very simple. Members of the public cannot understand
why, under the human rights laws that we currently operate, somebody
who is a threat to this country is able to remain in it, year after
year, without being deported. Frankly, if the right hon. Lady cannot
understand that, she simply does not get it, and will not get an

just a few months ago when it looked as if he might be freed from
prison and freed from bail. The only option the Home Secretary would
have had at that point would be to put him on a terrorism prevention

occasions. The Government brought in the Terrorism Prevention and
Investigation Measures Act 2011 and we are operating those TPIMs
against a number of individuals, as he knows. As he is also aware, when
TPIMs were introduced instead of the control orders that his Government
had brought in, we also introduced, through some extra funding,
measures to enhance the ability of the Security Service and the police
to deal with these individuals, and we are confident in the package
that was produced.</hs_Para>

have been co-operating with the Jordanian Government on this matter for

because of the time it took, because of the various stages of appeal
that were available to Abu Qatada and the fact that the European Court
moved the goalposts in the unprecedented decision that it took early
last year. It was because of that that we had to undertake further
discussions with the Jordanian Government about the assurances that
could be achieved, and of course our own Special Appeals Immigration
Commission last autumn decided that despite those further assurances
and its view that the Jordanian Government would bend over backwards to
make sure that Abu Qatada got a fair trial, this one issue about
whether evidence that was allegedly obtained by torture could be used
had to be addressed. That is addressed, among other things, in the
general treaty that we have signed. It is because there have been so
many opportunities to appeal and because of the decisions that have
come as a result of those appeals that the legal bills have built
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000250"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Edward Garnier" PimsId="3388" UID="13070810000721" xid="221" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0001.htm#13070810000721"><B>Sir

the enactment of the Human Rights Act, we probably would not have
deported a terrorist suspect to be tortured or to face trial on the
basis of evidence extracted by torture or to a country which might have
used the death penalty upon that person? Does she also 
<?notus-xml column=31?>agree that the core to the success that she has had has been the

is important that we have these assurances and agreements with other
countries where there is a possibility, or where the courts have
suggested that there is a possibility, that it would not be possible to
deport an individual because of the situation they would find
themselves in once deported. When the European Court made its judgment
last year, I think that it failed to appreciate the changes that have
taken place in Jordan and the work the Jordanian Government have done,
for example to change their constitution in relation to torture. In a
sense the judgment was unfair with regard to the Jordanian situation.
Nevertheless, as a result of the judgment, we had to undertake further
discussions with the Jordanian Government and put in place exactly the

removing the current national curriculum levels we create space for
more sophisticated methods of tracking. One of the problems with
current level descriptors is that they are opaque and confusing, and
sometimes different schools register different levels of achievement at
different levels. The new method we propose will mean that there is far
greater rigour in how assessment is carried out. Secondly, Darlington
is a model local education authority, because it has encouraged more
and more schools to take on academy freedoms. I hope that more Labour
local authorities follow where Darlington has

of a ring-fenced body by reference to which the group restructuring
powers are exercisable is for the purposes of this Part a
“qualifying parent undertaking” if
—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) it is a body
corporate which is incorporated in the United Kingdom and has a place
of business in the United Kingdom,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) it is not itself an

are—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) to dispose of
specified property or rights to an outside
person;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) to apply to the
court under Part 7 for an order sanctioning a ring-fencing transfer

powers are exercised (whether or not that body is to remain a
ring-fenced body after the implementation of the disposal or scheme in
question).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) It is immaterial
whether a requirement to be imposed on an authorised person by the
appropriate regulator, or by the other regulator at the direction of
the appropriate regulator, is one that the regulator imposing it could
impose under section 55L or
55M.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JC Procedure:
preliminary notices</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) If the
appropriate regulator proposes to exercise the group restructuring
powers in relation to any authorised person or qualifying parent
undertaking (“the person concerned”), the regulator must
give each of the relevant persons a first preliminary notice
stating—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
that the regulator is of the opinion that the group ring-fencing powers
have become exercisable in relation to the person concerned,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) its
reasons for being satisfied as to the matters mentioned in section
142JA(1).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) Before giving a
first preliminary notice, the regulator
must—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) give the
Treasury a draft of the
notice,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) provide the
Treasury with any information that the Treasury may require in order to
decide whether to give their consent,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) obtain the consent of
the Treasury.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) The first
preliminary notice must specify a reasonable period (which may not be
less than 14 days) within which any of the relevant persons may make
representations to the
regulator.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) The relevant
persons are—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the
person concerned,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the
ring-fenced body, if not the person concerned,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) any other authorised
person who will, in the opinion of the appropriate regulator, be
significantly affected by the exercise of the group restructuring
powers.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) After considering
any representations made by any of the relevant persons, the regulator
must either—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) with
the consent of the Treasury, give each of the persons a second
preliminary notice, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) give
each of them a notice stating that it has decided not to exercise its
group restructuring powers.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6)
A second preliminary notice is a notice
stating—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) that the
regulator proposes to exercise the group restructuring powers,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the manner in which it
proposes to do so.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) The
second preliminary notice must specify a reasonable period (which may
not be less than 14 days) within which any of the relevant persons may
make representations to the regulator about the
proposals.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) The regulator
must after considering any representations made in response to the
second preliminary notice give each of the relevant person s a third
preliminary notice stating—</hs_AmendmentLevel1> 
<?notus-xml column=52?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) whether it has made any revisions to the
proposals, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) if so, what
the revisions are.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JD
Procedure: warning notice and decision
notice</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) If the appropriate
regulator has given a third preliminary notice, it must
either—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) if it still
proposes to exercise the group restructuring powers, give each of the
relevant persons a warning notice during the warning notice period,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) before the end of the
warning notice period, give each of them a notice stating that it has
decided not to exercise the
powers.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The “warning
notice period” is the period of 6 months beginning with the
first anniversary of the day on which the third preliminary notice was
given.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Before giving a
warning notice under subsection (1)(a), the appropriate regulator must
—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) give the Treasury
a draft of the notice,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
provide the Treasury with any information that the Treasury may require
in order to decide whether to give their consent,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) obtain the consent of
the Treasury.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) The action
specified in the warning notice may be different from that specified in
the third preliminary notice
if—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the appropriate
regulator considers that different action is appropriate as a result of
any change in circumstances since the third preliminary notice was
given, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the person
concerned consents to the
change.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) The regulator must,
in particular, have regard to anything
that—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) has been done
by the person concerned since the giving of the third preliminary
notice, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) represents
action that would have been required in pursuance of the proposals in
that notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) If the
regulator decides to exercise the group restructuring powers it must
give each of the relevant persons a decision
notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) The decision notice
must allow at least 5 years from the date of the decision notice for
the completion of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
any disposal of shares, securities or other property that is required
by the notice, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any
transfer of liabilities for which the notice requires arrangements to
be made.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) The giving of
consent for the purpose of subsection (4)(b) does not affect any right
to refer to the Tribunal the matter to which any decision notice
resulting from the warning notice
relates.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(9) “The
relevant persons” has the same meaning as in section
142JC.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JE References to
Tribunal</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) A notified person
who is aggrieved by—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
the imposition by either regulator of a requirement as a result of
section 142JB(2)(a) or (b) or (3)(a) or
(b),</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a requirement to be
imposed as a result of the giving by one regulator to the other of a
direction under section 142JB(2)(c) or (3)(c),
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) the giving by either
regulator of a direction under section 142JB(2)(d) or
(3)(d),</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>may refer the matter to
the Tribunal.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2)
“Notified person” means a person to whom a decision
notice under section 142JD(6) was given or ought to have been
given.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JF Subsequent
variation of requirement or
direction</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) A regulator may
at any time with the consent of the person concerned
vary—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a requirement
imposed by it as a result of section 142JB(2)(a) or (b) or (3)(a) or
(b), or</hs_AmendmentLevel2> 
<?notus-xml column=53?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a direction given by it as a result of section
142JB(2)(c) or (d) or (3)(c) or
(d).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The person concerned
may at any time apply to the appropriate regulator for the variation
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a requirement
imposed by it as a result of section 142JB(2)(a) or (b)or (3)(a) or
(b), or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a direction given
by it as a result of section 142JB(2)(c) or (d) or (3)(c) or
(d).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Sections 55U, 55V, 55X
and 55Z3 apply to an application under subsection (2) as they apply to
an application for the variation of a requirement imposed by the
appropriate regulator under section 55L or
55M.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JG Consultation etc.
between regulators</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) Where a
notice under section 142JC or a warning notice or decision notice under
section 142JD relates to a requirement to be imposed in pursuance of a
direction to be given as a result of section 142JB(2)(c) or (3)(c), the
appropriate regulator
must—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) consult the
other regulator before giving the notice,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) give a copy of the
notice to the other
regulator.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The appropriate
regulator must consult the other regulator before varying under section
142JF a direction given as a result of section 142JB(2)(c) or
(3)(c).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Directions given by
the FCA as a result of section 142JB(3)(c) are subject to any
directions given to the FCA under section
3I.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JH Relationship with
regulators’ powers under Parts 4A and
12A</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) Subsection (2) applies
in relation to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a
ring-fenced body which is a member of a mixed group,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a parent undertaking of
such a ring-fenced body.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) A
regulator may not exercise its general powers in relation to the
ring-fenced body or parent undertaking so as to achieve either of the
results in subsection (3).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3)
Those results are—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
that no existing group member is a parent undertaking of the
ring-fenced body;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) that the
ring-fenced body is not a member of a mixed
group.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) In subsection (3)(a)
“existing group member” means a person who is a member of
the ring-fenced body’s group at the time when the requirement is
imposed or the direction
given.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) Except as provided
by subsections (1) to (4), the provisions of sections 142JA to 142JG do
not limit the general powers of either
regulator.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) For the purposes
of this section, a regulator’s “general powers”
are its powers under the following
provisions—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) section
55L or 55M (imposition of requirements in connection with Part 4A
permission);</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
section 192C (power to direct qualifying parent
undertaking).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) For the
purposes of this section, a ring-fenced body is a member of a mixed
group if a member of the ring-fenced body’s group carries on an
excluded activity.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>Failure of
parent undertaking to comply with
direction</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JI Power to impose
penalty or issue censure</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1)
This section applies if a regulator is satisfied that a person who is
or has been a qualifying parent undertaking as defined in section
142JB(4) (“P”) has contravened a requirement of a
direction given to P by that regulator as a result of section
142JB(2)(d) or (3)(d).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The
regulator may impose a penalty of such amount as it considers
appropriate on—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) P,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any person who was
knowingly concerned in the contravention.</hs_AmendmentLevel2> 
<?notus-xml column=54?><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) The regulator may, instead of imposing a penalty
on a person, publish a statement censuring the
person.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) The regulator may
not take action against a person under this section after the end of
the limitation period unless, before the end of that period, it has
given a warning notice to the person under section
142JJ.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) “The
limitation period” means the period of 3 years beginning with
the first day on which the regulator knew of the
contravention.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6)
For this purpose a regulator is to be treated as knowing of a
contravention if it has information from which the contravention can
reasonably be inferred.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) The
requirements that a regulator may be required to impose as a result of
a direction under section 142JB(2)(c) or (3)(c) include requirements
that t he regulator would not but for the direction have power to
impose.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JJ Procedure and
right to refer to Tribunal</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1)
If a regulator proposes to take action against a person under section
142JI, it must give the person a warning
notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) A warning notice
about a proposal to impose a penalty must state the amo unt of the
penalty.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) A warning notice
about a proposal to publish a statement must set out the terms of the
statement.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) If the regulator
decides to take action against a person under section 142JI, it must
give the person a decision
notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) A decision notice
about the imposition of a penalty must state the amount of the
penalty.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) A decision notice
about the publication of a statement must set out the terms of the
statement.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) If the regulator
decides to take action against a person under section 142JI, the person
may refer the matter to the
Tribunal.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JK Duty on
publication of statement</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>After
a statement under section 142JI(3) is published, the regulator must
send a copy of the statement
to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the person in
respect of whom it is made,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any person to whom a
copy of the decision notice was given under section
393(4).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JL Imposition of
penalties under section 142JI: statement of
policy</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) Each regulator must
prepare and issue a statement of policy with respect
to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the imposition
of penalties under section 142JI,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the amount of penalties
under that section.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) A
regulator’s policy in determining what the amount of a penalty
should be must include having regard
to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the seriousness
of the contravention,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the
extent to which the contravention was deliberate or reckless,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) whether the person on
whom the penalty is to be imposed is an
individual.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) A regulator may
at any time alter or replace a statement issued under this
section.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4)
If a statement issued under this section is altered or replaced, the
regulator must issue the altered or replacement
statement.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5)
In exercising, or deciding whether to exercise, a power under section
142JI(2) in the case of any particular contravention, a regulator must
have regard to any statement of policy published under this section and
in force at a time when the contravention
occurred.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) A statement under
this section must be published by the regulator concerned in the way
appearing to the regulator to be best calculated to bring it to the
attention of the public.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) A
regulator may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a
copy of the statement published under this

senior bankers—those found guilty could face a jail sentence;
working with the regulators to implement the commission’s
proposals on pay, specifically to allow bonuses to be deferred for up
to 10 years and enable 100% clawback of bonuses where banks receive
state aid; and reversing the burden of proof so that senior staff are
held accountable for regulatory breaches within their areas of
responsibility. We will also ask the regulators to implement the

will be in addition to the Financial Conduct Authority’s
existing competition objective. In addition to introducing seven-day
account switching later this year, the Government will ask the new

portability and whether the big banks should give up ownership of the

who did not have the privilege of being part of our discussions in
Committee, let me set the context. The Independent Commission on
Banking set three objectives for the ring fence: first, to insulate
essential day-to-day banking services against shocks originating
elsewhere in the financial system; secondly, to make banks more
resolvable; and, thirdly, to curtail the perceived implicit Government
guarantees to banks, which follows from the first two. The Bill turns
those ring-fencing objectives into law by making them part of the
statutory objectives of the regulators—the PRA and the
FCA.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070810000532" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070810000532">5

1 amends the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 to require the PRA
to seek to ensure that a ring-fenced bank’s business is carried
out prudently and protected against risks that might threaten the
continuous provision of core services. FSMA is also amended to require
the PRA to seek to ensure that the failure of a ring-fenced bank will
not interrupt the provision of core retail banking services in the UK.
Like any other bank that is poorly managed, a ring-fenced bank will be
allowed to fail, but to avoid serious harm to the wider economy
essential core services must be kept running, which requires the PRA to
ensure that the business of a ring-fenced bank is structured in a way
that allows it to be resolved in an orderly fashion, if that bank
fails. Questions were raised in Committee about whether the
resolvability element fully captured all circumstances in which the
regulators might need to ensure that a ring-fenced bank could fail
safely, so the amendments clarify the fact that the PRA must seek to
minimise damage to the continuity of core services caused by
not only the failure of a ring-fenced bank, but the failure of any
other member of its corporate
group.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000421" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070810000421"><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Edwards" PimsId="5701" UID="13070810000825" xid="1034" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070810000825"><B>Jonathan

underline that. The right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr
McFadden) asks a specific question about whether RBS, in which we, of
course, have a very substantial stake, should be broken up in that way.
It is important that we have regard to value for the taxpayer. I

members of the Bill Committee will recall, I made a commitment to
introduce on Report amendments to implement electrification,
and here they are. The amendments give powers to the regulator, with
the consent of the Treasury, to require a group to separate completely
its retail and wholesale banking operations. The regulator would be
able to require the group either to sell its interests in ring-fenced
or non-ring-fenced entities, or to transfer specified businesses to
outside ownership. The regulator will be able to require separation if
it is satisfied either that the group’s ring-fenced bank is not
sufficiently independent of the rest of the group or that the conduct
of any member of the group is such that it undermines the
regulator’s ability to achieve its new statutory objective to
ensure the continuity of core services.</hs_Para>

amendments set out a process for the exercise of that power. The first
step is that the regulator must notify all affected members of a group
that it is minded to exercise its powers and how it proposes to do so.
The affected bank has the right to make representations following the
receipt of each notice. Following that stage, the regulator is required
to allow members of the group at least a year to take action to
rectify the position. If, after that period, the regulator wishes to
proceed it must issue a warning notice before a requirement to separate
is imposed. The regulator would then allow five years to complete the
separation required in line with the disposals required under
competition law, particularly state aid interventions.</hs_Para>

parliamentary commission recommended, the Treasury’s approval is
required before that action can be taken. We agree with the commission
that providing for a deterrent against any bank that seeks to game or
evade the ring fence is a sensible reinforcement in keeping with the
recommendations of the Independent Commission on Banking. Government
amendments 11,12, 13 and 14 make technical adjustments to ensure that
all the necessary components of structural reform comply with the ring
fence and are brought within the scope of the ring-fencing transfer
scheme.</hs_Para>

Clark:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. The use of state
aid is often a response in the context of difficult circumstances. That
was certainly the case in the financial crisis, and it happens in other
industries as well. Five years is the standard period for these
arrangements to be executed or completed, and that is the reason,
anticipating an intervention from my hon. Friend, that period was
chosen. I dare say, however, that that there can be reflection on that:
my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester may have a different view that

amendments 15 and 16 reflect concerns expressed both by the Commission
and in Committee that the use of ring-fencing transfer schemes to
restructure groups could provide unscrupulous banks with an opportunity
to shirk their responsibilities, such as liability with past
misconduct. The requirement for PRA approval is a substantial safeguard
against that, but Government amendment 16 requires that before the PRA
can consent to a ring-fencing transfer scheme it must commission an
independent report to assess whether anyone other than the bank itself
would be adversely affected by the transfer. Government amendment 15
requires the PRA to “have regard” to that report in
deciding whether to approve a ring-fencing transfer.</hs_Para>

Member for Nottingham East will of course have more to say about
amendments tabled by the Opposition, but his first amendment was
debated extensively in Committee. It requires a review of ring-fencing
every two years. I am certainly not set against an independent review.
Indeed, the Bill builds in future reviews, including the PRA being able
to report annually on the operation of the ring fence, and being able
to report every five years on whether the detailed rules it has made
are still delivering the objectives of the ring fence. Requiring
another review specifically to look at the case for full separation
risks in many ways achieving the opposite of the Bill’s
intention, which is to secure consensus, as far as that can be
established, and to provide for a stable regulatory
structure.</hs_Para>

paradoxical for such a review to be confined to looking at ring-fencing
or full separation, but not any other remedy for deficiencies that the
review might uncover. Amendment 18 is identical to an amendment that
was debated in Committee. The Government’s position is clear: in
the Bill, we are following the advice of the commission chaired by Sir
John Vickers, which considered the case for full separation—that
relates to the point made by the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion
(Caroline Lucas)—and rejected it. It is a different policy. I
know that it has some distinguished advocates, but it is a different
policy. Of course, any future Government could adopt it, but they

parliamentary and public
scrutiny.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070810000449" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070810000449">It
is worth reminding ourselves briefly of the history of the proposals
before us. They were not invented during the past few weeks
or months. They go right back to 2010, when the Government established
the Independent Commission on Banking under the chairmanship
of Sir John Vickers. The commission produced three reports,
instigated two public consultations, considered
1,500 pages 
<?notus-xml column=66?>of written submissions and hosted more than 300 separate meetings. The
Government produced a response and a White Paper, on which they again
consulted fully before coming to Parliament. At each stage there was
full cost-benefit analysis. Now in Parliament each detail of the policy
is being debated—and has been debated in Committee—and in
many cases
improved.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070810000533" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070810000533">5.15

the hon. Gentleman, as I hope to do. He, being a fair man, will reflect
on the fact that his distinguished commission undertook pre-legislative
scrutiny of the proposals made by Sir John Vickers and his
commissioners. Sir John did not recommend that there should be the
power to separate. In fact, he has been persuaded by the
institution-specific power of separation that his commission proposed,
but has reflected in evidence to his commission that to go further and
introduce a system-wide power is a separate matter and should come
before Parliament in an explicit way rather than, as would be the case
here, through a statutory instrument following an independent

very far short of the degree of scrutiny and rigorous assessment,

proposals have gone through. Parliament would not have the ability to
present amendments to proposals and at that stage to take account of
the recommendations even of the independent review. So the procedures
proposed are less than adequate to the scale of the policy change that
would be embodied in them. If we are to be serious about the need to
respect the views and the role of Parliament—as I have made
clear, these are important matters—we must accept that the only

about the sword of Damocles keeping the feet of the banking industry to

because of course any attempt to evade the ring fence or to nibble the
electric fence, as dangerous to health as that would be, could be
undertaken only on the part of a particular institution, not the
system. That is why we agreed with the Commission’s
report—it was not part of the Vickers report—that it was
necessary, for exactly the reasons the hon. Gentleman mentions, to have
a sanction against that type of behaviour, and that is what we have

further power to separate the whole system could not be triggered by an

Leslie:</Member></B> It is characteristic of the Minister, with his
emollient tones, sometimes to give the impression of smoothing
over all these issues. He is ever the swan on the surface, yet beneath
the water line the chaotic paddling is evident from the
Government’s response to the work of the parliamentary
commission. That response was rushed out today, in accordance
with the Government’s own artificial deadline of a
debate on Report, which they could have scheduled so that we had time
to consider where the Government stood on some of these
issues.</hs_Para>

Minister’s hon. Friends did not seem to realise what he was
recommending today on RBS—ruling out a review that might
consider a regional banking network, for example. The message did not
get through to the Government’s own Back Benchers. I do not know
whether that is a whipping issue or whether other channels need to be
reviewed, but something is not quite right. It would be remiss of me to
pass over the fact that we are debating this Bill on Report having had
in Committee no consideration of all the hard effort undertaken by the
poor souls who had to serve on the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards. Hours, days, weeks and months of their lives went by, never
necessarily to be regained. There was no response to that in Committee
and there has been barely a nod in its direction on
Report.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070829000656" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000656">5.30

Leslie:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman is right. Of course I
thank them, but it is my sympathy for them that now requires us to
speak in their favour. The Government ignored all those amendments. It
is true: I have been channelling the wishes of the hon. Member for
Chichester (Mr Tyrie) and, indeed, the rest of the commission. They
dutifully drafted all those amendments and they were then totally
ignored by the Government. The Government set up the parliamentary
commission. They did not want to go for a broader independent inquiry;
they wanted to take this route. They set up all 
<?notus-xml column=70?>the members to do all the work and have all the hearings. Their final
report was more than a ream of paper— 570 pages. Not a
jot of those amendments was accepted by the Government in Committee,
and, significantly, the same applies on Report.</hs_Para>

clear about this. House of Commons consideration of this Bill is not
worth anything; all the business is to be done in the other place by
members of the commission who are there. It will go to them in October,
presumably they will consider it in October and November, and then we
will get a little chunk of time at the end of the process for Commons
consideration of Lords amendments. I hope that the Minister will allow
us a little more latitude to have a look at what is put into the Bill
at that time.</hs_Para>

Clark:</Member></B> I think the hon. Gentleman is labouring under a
misapprehension. The amendments in this group are a response to the
commission’s first report. The essence of this Bill is the
ring-fencing of the banking system. This is a response to the
independent commission to which the parliamentary commission responded.
The amendments implement these changes. The Government always made it
clear that the final report on standards and culture would be taken on
board during the Bill’s passage through the House of Lords. The
situation is exactly as envisaged and perfectly orderly. He is not
seeing the wood for the trees. This is about the ring-fencing of
banks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Leslie" PimsId="1471" UID="13070829000668" xid="354" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000668">Chris
Leslie:</Member></B> Well, pardon me for daring to suggest that the
Government have got this totally upside down and the wrong way round.
They set up the commission and asked its members to come forward with
recommendations, as they dutifully did, for which I thank them, and
then ignored them in the Commons Committee and Report stages. That
means that it is all to be debated in the detail that is required when
the Bill reaches the House of

situation was ever thus, given the parliamentary majorities. This has
not been a chaotic process but, understandably, a holding

the House of Lords, and I have absolutely no doubt that they will do a
magnificent job of scrutinising the Bill. However, this is the

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Leslie" PimsId="1471" UID="13070829000672" xid="354" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000672">Chris
Leslie:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is 100% correct, and we have made
our point; I now want to move on to issues of substance. There is a
lack of time and we have to 
<?notus-xml column=71?>finish debating this group of amendments by 7 o’clock. It is
ridiculous that the commission spent hours on these matters but only a
tiny amount of time has been allocated to debating them
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000016">Government
amendments 1 to 4 seem to be generally welcome with regard to the
extension of the regulatory perimeter and the definitions of the
Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority. It
is intriguing that amendment 4 centres on clarifying the definition of
“failure”. It is very tempting to ask if they know what
failure is, especially given their weak response to the parliamentary
commission today, but I will move swiftly
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000017">Government
amendments 7 to 10 also seem to be fairly unobjectionable, although
there appears to be a drafting error in amendment 8. Why has the

ahead of subsection (2) of FSMA? Something seems to be amiss, but that
is only a minor
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000018">More
importantly, will the Minister talk about the tribunal to which a lot
of the issues will be referred? What sort of tribunal will it be and
where will it be situated? Will its work add to the functions of an
existing tribunal? That is a small point, but I would be grateful if
the Minister would address
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000019">Government

first main issue of substance relates to our amendment 17 on the need
for a thorough review process of the ring-fencing of retail banks, such
that it augments what ought to be the electrification of the ring
fence. We suggested this in Committee and it was a clear recommendation
of the commission. It would be better to have a proper and independent
review of the adequacy of ring-fencing every two years. We think that a
more robust review process would be better than the Government’s
PRA-led approach. It would be inadequate for the regulators to lead the
process. We need a broader and more substantial review process to
ensure successive
ring-fencing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000021">Ultimately,
as the commission itself has said, the jury is out on whether
ring-fencing will work. It is fine in theory, but in order to keep a
close eye on things—especially as these issues fall out of the

must have a process in place that makes sure that we test, watch and
scrutinise what

As our First Report noted, crucial doubts remain about whether all the
intended reforms can be put in place and, even if they are, whether
this will be enough to prevent the Government from having to step in
next time a crisis hits. In particular, we identified the possibility
that the partial separation of a ring-fence may prove
insufficient.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13070829000023" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000023">That

shortly, suggesting a clear back-stop power for the full separation of
retail and investment banking across the board, in case ring-fencing
does not work. We believe that we should give ring-fencing a chance,
but it is important to note that the jury is still out on
whether it will work. We just do not know. The Bill gives us the
opportunity to ensure, as the commission recommended, that nobody has

Leslie:</Member></B> It is true that we want to give ring-fencing a
chance. That seems to be the broad consensus among those who have
seriously considered the issue, either on the commission or elsewhere.
However, it is important that we keep in our pocket the chance to do
something serious and rigorous in case that plan does not work. I
suppose we might call it a plan B, although I know the Government have
an aversion to ever considering anything outside the narrow tram lines
down which they career. It is important that we take this opportunity
to put that plan in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000028">That
brings me to the Government’s rather pathetic, lettuce leaf-like
attempt to claim that they are adopting a back-stop electrification
power. I am not sure what voltage the Minister has opted for, but for
the Government to claim the provision as a firm-by-firm back-stop power
is an insult to back-stop powers. As my right hon. Friend the Member
for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden) said, the process in
Government amendment 6 will take six years should ring-fencing fail,
which is a snail’s pace. I urge hon. Members to look at the
various stages involved in that amendment. First, the Treasury will
look to the regulator to issue not just one preliminary notice but
three—the idea of three preliminary notices seems like an
impossibility—all of which will have different timetables. I do
not know whether three preliminaries means, “We’re coming
to get you, but not quite yet.” It is like the Education
Secretary, with his firm, disciplinarian hand, saying to children,
“We’re going to come and get you, but we’ll 
<?notus-xml column=73?>give you three preliminary notices before we do
so.” The kids would be crawling all over the ring fence for
months and
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000029">After
those preliminary notices, a warning notice will be issued, followed
very swiftly—not—by a decision notice. There will be at
least five steps over a six-year period. “Five
strikes and you might be out in six years’ time” does not
strike me as an effective back-stop power for galvanising and
electrifying the ring fence. If the Government recognised for six years
that there was a flaw with ring-fencing but did nothing, their
culpability would be almost equal to that of the banking sector.
Amendment 6 could be an amendment to a misrepresentation of
the people Act, and the Financial Secretary needs to take it off the
table and instead consider the amendments that the Chairman of the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards has
tabled.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000030">This
is a back-stop power in name only, and just because the Government say
it is a back-stop power does not make it so. We need the ability, on a
firm-by-firm basis at the very least, to take firm action to a
timetable that shows flexibility and can be enacted swiftly if need be.
I am afraid I tend to agree with the amendments tabled by the hon.
Member for Chichester. The provision needs to be truncated and the
Government must withdraw amendment 6 as it is wholly inadequate. It
would have been more effective to go with amendment 19 as drafted by
the commission, which was a far more effective truncated version of a
back-stop power on a firm-by-firm basis. That was far clearer, the
drafting was improved, and it is a mystery to me why the Government
have resisted it at every stage of the process. Whether that was due to
lobbying from the banks, or because they do not believe in standing up
to the sector and taking on this tough issue, the weakness of the
Government on this matter surprises many
people.</hs_Para>

Field:</Member></B> Two things come to mind. First, there should be a
sense of due process, which I think is present in the Government
amendment. Secondly, there is genuine concern about uncertainty and the
notion of an electrified ring fence. As the hon. Gentleman will know, I
have questioned the whole issue of ring-fencing and the potential
uncertainty it provides in this business, particularly in the
fast-changing world we have seen over recent years. This is therefore a
sensible response from the Treasury to the whole concern, which goes
well beyond special pleading from the banking fraternity.</hs_Para>

Leslie:</Member></B> Most of the debate we have had in the short time
available has pressed for firm action to be taken towards a sector
that—let us not forget—brought down the economy, created
massive deficits in our public finances, and required rescue by the
taxpayer because of a blurring of the lines between issues that
affected ordinary households up and down the country and high-risk
investment banking activities that needed strong safeguards.
Simply saying that we will have ring- fencing with no means to
enforce or police that—no “electrification”, as it
has been termed—would make that concept totally redundant. That
is why members of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
were surprised that the Government always seemed to take the path of
least resistance—“Let’s not upset the banks too
much; let’s try and go back to business as

Leslie:</Member></B> Those issues were covered pretty substantially by
the commission in its first and second reports, and this was the
conclusion it reached. Nobody wanted to go for full separation if it
could be avoided; we wanted to ensure that ring-fencing arrangements
could be upheld and made to work. There are some arguments in favour of
that universal model, and therefore it was felt preferable to have such
a power in reserve, but in the Bill. It is no wonder that the
banking sector breathed a heavy sigh of relief today, when it saw the
Government’s response on this and other issues. The markets
judged that the banking sector got off lightly, and that there was
nothing tough or difficult for the sector. That is why we have seen the
market reaction today. The notion of business as usual seems to be back
on the
table.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070829000036">I

but thrown back in the face of the commission by the Government today.
It is important to have this on the statute book. A back-stop power
will incentivise the banks to comply with ring-fencing. If the
Government are correct in believing that ring-fencing will be adequate,
the amendment will do no harm to the policy. It will sit dormant on the
statute book. But if the Government are wrong, and this backstop power
is not in place when it is needed, serious consequences could arise. It
is nonsense for the Minister to ignore this risk, especially as the
other place will want to come back to this issue. He may be forced to

<?notus-xml column=75?>my first—to explain some of the reasoning
behind that work. The two key amendments that I have tabled would
empower the regulator to split up a banking group if there were serious
failures in the culture and standards of the ring-fenced body or
another member of its group. In deciding whether these serious failures
have occurred, the regulator would be required to take account of the
recommendations contained in the reports of the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, which I
chaired.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070837000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070837000002">We

task now is to get the report implemented, primarily by regulators and
banks, and, where necessary, supported by statute. The Government have
today responded to the commission’s most recent
report—our fifth. I have had a chance to flip through the

about 80 pages—and, of course, no time for anyone to table
amendments as a result. In view of the extent to which it looks
as if the Bill has been changed, I would be grateful if the

argumentation for them appear to have been accepted in full. But I am
not fully reassured. The Government appeared to have accepted the
commission’s proposal on a specific power to force the
separation of an individual bank, but here we are, at the eleventh

weakened by the Government. In fact, as I will explain, the

Tyrie:</Member></B> I strongly agree with the hon.
Gentleman and I have already made both those points, which he just
reinforced. All the amendments that I have tabled on behalf of the
commission are about standards. Banking continues to suffer from the
effects of poor standards. Even in the seven months that we took oral
evidence, we had two more major LIBOR scandals, the interest rate swap
scandal, a major bank found to be involved in money laundering in Latin
America, and another fined $670 million for sanctions busting in
Iran.</hs_Para>

sometimes suggested that trying to do much about this will drive banks
overseas. But all of the evidence we took pointed to exactly the
opposite conclusion. Far from imperilling the UK’s global
competitiveness, high standards will make the UK a more attractive
place to locate. Many good things can flow from higher standards in
banking, among them is a restoration of trust. Trust is an essential
bulwark to the UK’s reputation as a global financial centre. It
is also vital for the British economy. While banks are not trusted by
their clients and particularly by SMEs, there will be less lending and
less economic
activity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070837000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070837000011">The
crisis of standards and trust in banking—and it is a
crisis—is multi-faceted and, so are the necessary remedies. None
the less, the nub of the problem can be characterised as twofold.
First, there has been a lack of individual responsibility at the top of
banks. Collective decision making has diffused responsibility and a
sense of duty to be vigilant. Secondly, there has been colossal failure
of judgment by regulators, with an approach based on pointless data
collection on a huge scale and needless box
ticking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070837000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070837000012">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T16:27:08"></hs_TimeCode>

backs, but their lapses were
inexcusable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:59:56"></hs_TimeCode>.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T17:59:58"></hs_TimeCode> lack of
personal 
<?notus-xml column=77?>responsibility in banks has been aggravated by
misaligned incentives. By that I mean bonus and remuneration
structures. They encouraged bankers to make short-term gains while the

course, many others played a role in the crisis: Governments failed to

auditors and risk rating agencies took large fees and were found to be

commission examined whether banks could be relied on to sort this out
themselves, and we concluded very early on that they could not. We
concluded that action was required on many fronts to improve standards.
First, it would need to come from the ring fence, but that needed to be
reinforced. Secondly, improvements to markets and competition would be
needed—competition can often be the best regulator. Thirdly,
corporate governance needs to be improved. In particular, it
is vital to ensure that remuneration does not, as it has in
the past, incentivise excessive risk-taking. Fourthly, regulators need
to be better held to account. They need to be incentivised to do their
jobs more effectively—a primary duty for Parliament. Fifthly,
standards need to be supported by more powerful and effective sanctions
in the hands of regulators.</hs_Para>

will improve and the incentive to game the Vickers rules will diminish

find holes in the ring fence, they should be at risk of full
separation. We argued in our first report that that power should lie
primarily in the hands of the regulator, and we called this additional
power the electrification of the ring fence. The risk of the shock of
separation would be an essential incentive to improve
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T18:02:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

nature of the way in which one looks at regulation to try to find holes

at a regulation or law and trying to find a way around it. Obviously,
one should try to do so without breaking the spirit of the rule or
regulation, but if we live in a highly regulated society it is surely
inevitable that those who are regulated will look to try to find ways

activity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T18:06:03"></hs_TimeCode>. We
concluded that further statutory support was not needed for that
approach now, because the Prudential Regulation Authority might already
have the powers to implement an effective separation of prop trading.
We asked the PRA to present a report to the Treasury and to Parliament
on its use of a range of monitoring and corrective actions, which could
serve as the subsequent basis for a full and independent review of the
case for full separation of prop trading. Unfortunately, as
far as I can tell—I have had very little time to absorb
this publication, which came out only at 12.30 pm—the Government
have rejected even examining the proposal for prop trading. That is a
mistake<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T18:06:55"></hs_TimeCode>. I

to amendment (a), the Government accepted the case for ring-fencing,
arguing that banks that test the ring fence should be strongly deterred
and, if necessary, prevented from doing so. However, I am afraid that
that will not be the effect of the Government’s amendments. On
the contrary, the Government amendments almost guarantee that banks
will not get a shock, and will not be discouraged from testing or
gaming the ring fence. The regulator needs a useable and credible
deterrent. This proposal creates too many obstacles and delays to the
sanction of full separation.</hs_Para>

it is inadequate for three main reasons. First, it requires the
regulator to issue—we have already heard a little about
this—no fewer than three preliminary notices and a warning
notice before it can act. Secondly, it then requires the regulator to
obtain permission from the Treasury no fewer than three times while the
process is in train. Putting that requirement on the statute book would
transfer most of the effective regulatory decision-making power away
from the PRA and the Bank of England to the Treasury. It cannot be
appropriate for the Treasury to be the
regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T18:08:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
commission argued for a Treasury override at the end of the process,
not at the beginning or in the middle, but the Government’s
amendment requires the regulator to secure the consent of the Treasury
on three occasions prior to that point. Even so-called preliminary
notices—in effect, expressions of concern by the
regulator—will require Treasury consent. That is absurd and
compromises the regulator’s
independence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T18:08:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070837000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070837000026">The
third objection has also been alluded to. The Government’s
amendments allow at least five years for the completion of the
separation after a decision has been made. That would create enormous
scope—indeed, it would make it ideal—for lobbying for a
change of heart in the interim. It would create far too much room for
that and we can do without it. It also flies in the face of what the
Minister said in Committee, where he alerted Parliament to the risk of
what he described as an “inordinately long” delay in
implementation. A tool that is so difficult and slow to use is likely
to deter no one and that is why I have proposed a number of amendments
that would remove some of the obstacles erected by the Government to
taking action to separate

would like briefly to refer to the main other areas that are needed.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T18:12:11"></hs_TimeCode>To improve
competition, we recommended a range of measures. We asked the
Competition and Markets Authority to initiate a market study of
the retail and SME banking sectors. I noticed that the
Government were so enthusiastic about that recommendation that they
announced it as soon as they received the embargoed copy of our report.
We asked the Government immediately to establish an independent panel
of experts to assess ways of enabling much greater personal bank
account portability. The Government appear to have ridden back a little
from that in the proposals they published today, although I cannot be
sure.</hs_Para>

also took a good deal of evidence on RBS. Competition is weak partly
because RBS is weak. Further restructuring may well be needed. In our
view, the Government will need to be bold. We recommended that they
undertake a detailed analysis of a good bank/bad bank split as part of
an examination of the options for the future of RBS. That is vital
work. In the field of banking reform, a healthy RBS, with the
restoration of normal lending to the SME sector, is probably
the biggest tonic that could be given to the British
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-08T18:13:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070837000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070837000032">The
way in which banks run themselves also needs reform. An accountability
firewall had grown up that allowed senior bankers to deny
responsibility for their failings. That wall has to be taken down. To
give effect to that, we proposed the introduction of a senior persons
regime. This would ensure that the direct personal responsibilities of
board members, particularly the chairman, reflected the importance of
their roles, so that it was clear to bankers and regulators who should
reasonably be accountable when things went wrong, and for what. Our
study of HBOS—our fourth report—provided a clear example
of exactly the opposite. It guided our thinking on this and a number of
other areas. Senior board members at HBOS did not take responsibility
for what went wrong.</hs_Para>

crisis of standards was partly caused, and considerably inflamed, by
the fact that bankers were rewarded for doing the wrong thing. Bonuses
were often paid out well before the risks of the actions that they
ostensibly rewarded became apparent. Bankers took huge rewards and when
the risks turned sour, taxpayers picked up the tab. That has to stop.
The Government and regulators should not set levels of remuneration.
However, much more radical steps are needed to incentivise better
behaviour among all staff whose actions or behaviour could seriously
harm a bank, its reputation or its customers. Deferred remuneration for
executives should not be viewed as an entitlement. People
should keep their deferred bonuses only when it is clear that they have
really been earned. That will mean long deferral, in some cases up to
10
years.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070837000043" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0002.htm#13070837000043">6.15

really stuck in the gullet of the electorate is the fact that many
senior bankers, having received huge pay-outs for doing a bad job and

those bonuses and even their massive pension entitlements. That has to

<?notus-xml column=81?>bank to require direct taxpayer support, the regulator should have the
discretionary power to forfeit the remuneration of those responsible
and the unvested pension entitlements. That might require changes to

for regulation, there is no point in creating a vast regulatory
apparatus if it fails when we most need it; and we can now see the full
scale of regulatory failure. Consumers have been ripped off in a series
of shocking episodes, among them payment protection insurance and
interest rate swap mis-selling. Taxpayers have also been ripped off.
They have paid—and are still paying—the full price of the
bank bail-outs. These were needed not just because banks were
irresponsible and undercapitalised, but because regulators were not
doing their job. Aspects of the Basel process have been farcically
inadequate. In many cases regulators were scarcely even monitoring
systemic risk in the run-up to the crisis. Much of their work was
frankly a waste of time and money—ultimately, consumers’
money. That is partly why we proposed that, at least for the time
being, regulators should operate within existing cash limits, except
where they have taken on new responsibilities. We need better

make sure that regulators and supervisors are more alert, but we also
need to empower them. In theory, they already have a full range of
civil sanctions, but we discovered that in practice they felt
constrained from using them. The senior persons regime and licensing
system that we propose will enable much more effective use of those
civil sanctions. Responsibility for specific failures will be much more
straightforward to identify once those regimes are in place. A major
failing of the approved persons regime was that even where poor
standards of behaviour were identified, those responsible were unable

from the banking

Institutions involved in banking are not islands cut off from one
another. They lend money to one another. They engage in the same
practices. Their culture is often shared. They place similar bets. When
one falls, it often has the capacity to drag others down with it, as we
learned to our great

same is true of the standards and culture questions we examined in such
detail after Christmas. The LIBOR fixing was the straw that broke the
camel’s back in terms of the establishment of the commission,
but that did not just happen within one bank. Groups of traders within
banks were co-operating with one another to rig the interest rates, and
groups of traders across different banks were co-operating with one
another to rig the interest rates. Against that background, it makes no
sense at all to restrict the policy armoury that this Bill establishes
to respond to the undermining of the system by taking powers that will
affect only individual banking groups and not the sector as a whole. As
the hon. Member for Chichester said about our recommendation on new
criminal offences, some of those powers may never need to be used, but
their existence on the statute book should focus the minds of those

the issue of the power to separate in respect of one institution or the
sector as a whole, my overall reflection, having served on the
commission for the past year is that, although its recommendations
should be supported, even if we take all the steps set out—even
if we put a new system of regulation in place, including the twin peaks
system, even if we have the ring-fencing powers on structure that are
in this Bill, and even if we faithfully implement the standards and 
<?notus-xml column=84?>culture recommendations to which the hon. Member for
Chichester referred—it would still be rash to come to the
conclusion that we had fully resolved the problems of too big to fail
or too complex to manage. These reforms should be implemented and they
can make a difference, but if we think we have fully resolved the
problems of this huge sector, we will be guilty of complacency and
possibly kidding ourselves. The problem of too big to fail is still
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000089">Our
recommendations will make a difference but we also need powerful
weapons, even if their use is unlikely, to enforce good standards and
to make those running banks think long and hard about the consequences
before they decide to test or game the system in any situation in
future. That is why I think my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham
East (Chris Leslie) is right to say that a periodic review of
ring-fencing and how it is operating is a good idea. It is why I
support a more general power, to be held by the Government, to allow
broader separation if the ring-fencing reforms do not work. That is
what amendments 17 and 18 are designed to achieve and they are very
much in line with the recommendations of the commission’s first
report.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070829000660" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000660">6.30

say that there is nothing partisan or party political about the
amendments, and the Government do not need to be over-defensive when
discussing them. All that my hon. Friend has been guilty of is trying
faithfully to reflect in his amendments the work of the cross-party
commission. So I encourage the Minister to respond with an open mind
and not to think that it will reflect badly on the Government if they
change their minds at this stage or have a second thought. I do not
think this situation is like that, given the cross-party nature of the

wish to say a word or two about the hon. Gentleman’s amendment
19 and amendment (a) to Government amendment 6. That is about the
separation of individual groups, and there are two visions of how that
should be done. The Government’s vision, as set out in
amendment 6, has too many barriers and will take too long.
Hon. Members will have been shocked at the notion that an in-principle
decision could be made to act and things still would not be complete
six years later. The amendment gives the appearance of accepting a
recommendation to electrify the ring fence but does not give the
reality. The Minister’s electrified ring fence would not shock a
mouse, let alone a powerful, well-resourced, well-financed industry
that is used to lobbying, used to gaming the system and used to getting
its own way. So he should give careful and positive consideration to
the amendments tabled by the hon. Member for Chichester.</hs_Para>

said in his opening remarks, “Of course we will look at this. We
will look at the wording and so on again.” I hope that the hon.
Member for Chichester does not accept too readily such assurances,
which can mean little in the long run. I hope he does not sell himself
too cheaply when he decides later this evening whether to put his
amendments to the vote, because, as he set out, there is a vast
difference between deciding to go down this road in fairly sharp order
and waiting six years. There is a big difference, in terms of
both the bureaucracy and the number of hoops to be jumped through if
one is serious about this, between the hon. Gentleman’s
amendment and the elongated approach set out in Government amendment 6.
There is a big 
<?notus-xml column=85?>difference between the Minister’s approach and that set out by
the hon. Member for Chichester. We need more than warm words that the
Government might think about this a little more in future. I hope that
the hon. Gentleman will insist on a bit more than that before deciding

conclusion, we are dealing with a very important part of this
discussion; it is stage two of these reforms, if we regard the
regulatory changes as stage one. The commission believed that there was
a relationship between structure and culture, and that is at the heart
of the amendments. The recommendations for electrification aimed to
reinforce that relationship to stop the kind of gaming of the system
that has happened in that past and to make sure that the
intention of the Bill is faithfully reflected in practice. That
intention is well worth
supporting.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/65037D03C199ACF804496DAB6C886B43152757A4" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 July 2013">Monday

echo the words of my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie)
in praising the staff of the commission, who did a truly outstanding

had individual staff, and they were very impressive and
helpful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000096">I
wish briefly to address a question raised by the hon. Member for
Chichester, who chaired the commission, by explaining why I feel it is
of the utmost importance that the proposals we made are not only taken
seriously but passed into statute, and why we came to some of our
conclusions. We deliberated on the issues for hours and hours. As
anyone who has read the transcripts of the Treasury Committee’s
meetings from years gone by will know, I started out seeing things from
a full separation point of view. I am a fairly unreconstructed
Glass-Steagall supporter, but I do think that one needs to be guided by
the evidence. The commission received a great deal of evidence, and I
came to the view that although that principle is still one that I
adhere to and think is right, there were greater complications in
today’s modern operation of the financial services and markets
than perhaps had existed when Glass and Steagall got together and that
it was wise, therefore, to listen on that. So what I looked for, as did
other colleagues who came at it from different angles, was to give the
best effect to what we were seeking to achieve.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr McFadden) rightly said
that the commission linked structure and culture, and I was struck by
the way in which the different cultures in banking are competing. One
of the easiest ways to look at this, whether we are considering the
Volcker rule, prop trading or whatever, is that there are two distinct
cultures in every large banking organisation. The first of those is the
professional culture of the people seeking to work with and help
individual clients, who are involved in investing or looking after
depositors. I do not gainsay that the vast majority of people operating
in the world of banking are professional, wish to be professional and
wish to have high standards. The second is the completely separate
trading culture, where there is no client at the end of the day; it is
a zero-sum game where 
<?notus-xml column=86?>two people, or two sets of people, are trading specifically to make
money and to beat the guy on the other side of the trade.</hs_Para>

so often was that although trading was necessary to give effect to that
desired on the investment side, when the trading side took over in
terms of profit and culture it infected the other side. The whole thing
is about seeking to keep the cultures apart. People have talked about
high-street commercial banking as being good and investment merchant
banking as being a casino and being bad, but I do not take that view. I
would split the types into three, because there is retail and
commercial banking, investment banking and trading. All three have
their uses, and how they relate and how they are governed is the
important thing.</hs_Para>

Thurso:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes exactly the point I am in
the process of making, but he does it more simply, and I thank him for
that. That is the key point about the ring fence. The utility aspects
of banking, which are operating the payment system and taking deposits,
should be so constructed within an entity that when a bank
fails—I say when, not if, because there will be another bank
failure and our purpose is to try to make it easier for banks to be
resolved so there is less likelihood of taxpayer intervention, meaning
that the bank will be more likely to be allowed to go under and that
bankers will be likely to be more prudent—the ring fence enables
that while protecting the ordinary depositor and the payment
systems.</hs_Para>

point, which I completely accept, is that the compromise we came to is
the ring fence. The compromise holds good, however, only if the ring
fence works properly. Our conclusion was that it would not work if it
were not reinforced, and the term “electrified” was
coined. The point made by the right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South
East was that if one has at one’s disposal the ability to do
something—the armoury, call it what you will—those who
are engaged in the activity will check whether they are being looked at
before they engage in it. It is the modern equivalent of 
<?notus-xml column=87?>the Governor’s eyebrow. If we do not have
that, we will simply have a lot of regulation that might lead not to a
successful conclusion but to a long dialogue that leads nowhere between
the regulator, the Treasury and the institution. People must believe
that when the weapon, whatever it is, is deployed, it will have a
consequence. That is the essential point.</hs_Para>

Singapore—this would apply to the remainder of the major four
banks—its balance sheet would be about 1,100% of the
country’s gross domestic product, and no regulator would
enthusiastically receive a bank of such a size. Secondly, we should
remember that several factors in this country are incredibly important
to banks, such as our robust, transparent and tried-and-tested legal
system. We are a member of the single market, which gives banks access
to the whole of Europe; we speak English, which is the language of the
international business and banking community; and we are also at the
centre of the time
zones.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000118">Our
regulatory regime is also absolutely crucial. A great deal of our work
was to try to get rid of the implicit guarantee whereby the Government
are seen as standing behind the banks in case they fall over. That
guarantee can be worth anything up to £40 billion a year,
depending on the stage of the cycle, and that gives the big four banks
an advantage. The problem is that that anti-competitive advantage
represents another barrier to entry for challenger banks, so we need to
get rid of the implicit guarantee. However, by regulating firmly, well
and efficiently, and by winning the race to the top on regulation, we
will replace the implicit guarantee with a cheaper funding rate for the
UK banks, because they will see large amounts of international capital
coming to the UK to take advantage of the protection that our
regulatory and legal regimes provide. I therefore urge the Minister not
to be shy about coming forward and to consider carefully the amendments
proposed by my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester (Mr Tyrie), which
reflect the recommendations of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards and have a great deal of
merit.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/6E46DFE1BDAD34C4B4165BABEB76BB2F31CA3E8B" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 July 2013">Monday

Clark:</Member></B> We have had a fascinating, high-quality debate. I
am grateful for the contributions of all hon. Members, but especially
for those of the Members who served with such distinction on the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards: my hon.
Friend the Member for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier); the
right hon. Member for Wolverhampton South East (Mr
McFadden); the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love), who is no longer in
the Chamber; the Chair of the commission, my hon. Friend the Member for
Chichester (Mr Tyrie); and the hon. Member for Caithness, Sutherland
and Easter Ross (John Thurso). With the help of Members of the other
place, they laboured hard to produce a report that not only will stand
the test of time, but will be a reference document for many generations
in this 
<?notus-xml column=90?>country and throughout the world. The report will be seen as a major
contribution to addressing the less tangible aspects of culture and
standards, which is something that has eluded regulators throughout the
world. I am sure that the report will be read with a great deal of
interest.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070829000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000120">The
report’s central judgment includes the acute point that for too
long questions of standards and culture have been contracted
out to regulators, rather than being an intrinsic part of the
institutions themselves. That aspect of the report stood out as the
essence of the required change, because it should no longer be simply
for the regulators to decide on such questions, as the culture
throughout the institutions should reflect the correct standards that
we
expect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000121">I
spoke at length at the beginning of the debate, so I shall deal briefly
with several of the points that hon. Members raised. I was asked about
timetabling. On Second Reading, I made two commitments, the first of
which was that the House would have adequate time to consider all
provisions, including amendments proposed by the parliamentary
commission. I hope that hon. Members will concede that I have been true
to that in Committee and throughout our two days on Report, and I
repeat that that commitment remains as the Bill goes to the other
place. I also said explicitly on Second Reading that the
recommendations of the commission’s final report on standards
and culture would be reflected in amendments to be made in the House of
Lords. Of course, those measures will subsequently be considered by
this House, so our intention has not changed. It was right to expedite
the response to the report so that it  available much more
quickly than usual. It has been useful in informing today’s
discussions, as will be the case tomorrow, and it will be available to
their lordships during their consideration of the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000122">The
hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) asked several specific
questions, including about whether Government amendment 8 contained a
typo. It does not, but it would require more than the four minutes
remaining for me to explain why, so I hope that he will trust me on
that at least. The upper tribunal is not a new invention; it is the
court that considers all references made under FSMA for
adjudication.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070829000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070829000123">The
hon. Gentleman made a substantive point about the notice period, as did
my hon. Friend the Member for Chichester and the right hon. Member for
Wolverhampton South East. I was asked whether an elongated process in
some way diminishes the effectiveness of the ring fence. Our intention
was—and is—to implement faithfully the parliamentary
commission’s recommendation on the institution-specific
ring-fencing rule. As I assured my hon. Friend the Member for
Chichester, I am confident that if the Government’s proposals
can be improved during the Bill’s passage, all his concerns
about the use of the power can be addressed. In fact, the procedure
under consideration has been described as pressing the nuclear

grateful to the Minister. I am also grateful that the response was
published at the earliest opportunity—it could have been
delayed, so at least we have had a chance to look at it. That shows us
that the Government are listening, and the response will be helpful in
the other place. Above all, it gives us more 
<?notus-xml column=91?>confidence that there will be full implementation of
the proposals. The Government have indicated their general support for
them, so I hope that we will not have to go through a rigmarole to get

will understand that I cannot give way. The proposal that there
be five years to implement the action has been discussed with the
regulators; it reflects best regulatory practice. In point of fact, if
there were no time limit in the Bill, which is what one of the
amendments tabled by my hon. Friend would ensure, that would render the
use of the power without limit, so I think we are in the same
territory—the right territory—in wanting to specify that
there should be a limit. It should be clearly understood that there is
a limit to the use of the electrification powers, in terms of a
timetable, and a deadline for action. Of course it is right that the
regulators should advise on the appropriate use of that. In terms of

revisions are.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JD Procedure:
warning notice and decision
notice</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) If the appropriate
regulator has given a third preliminary notice, it must
either—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) if it still
proposes to exercise the group restructuring powers, give each of the
relevant persons a warning notice during the warning notice period,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) before the end of the
warning notice period, give each of them a notice stating that it has
decided not to exercise the
powers.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The “warning
notice period” is the period of 6 months beginning with the
first anniversary of the day on which the third preliminary notice was
given.</hs_AmendmentLevel1> <hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Before giving a
warning notice under subsection (1)(a), the appropriate regulator must
—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) give the Treasury
a draft of the notice,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
provide the Treasury with any information that the Treasury may require
in order to decide whether to give their consent,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) obtain the consent of
the Treasury.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) The action
specified in the warning notice may be different from that specified in
the third preliminary notice
if—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the appropriate
regulator considers that different action is appropriate as a result of
any change in circumstances since the third preliminary notice was
given, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the person
concerned consents to the
change.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) The regulator must,
in particular, have regard to anything
that—</hs_AmendmentLevel1> 
<?notus-xml column=95?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) has been done by the person concerned since the
giving of the third preliminary notice,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) represents action that
would have been required in pursuance of the proposals in that
notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) If the regulator
decides to exercise the group restructuring powers it must give each of
the relevant persons a decision
notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) The decision notice
must allow at least 5 years from the date of the decision notice for
the completion of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
any disposal of shares, securities or other property that is required
by the notice, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any
transfer of liabilities for which the notice requires arrangements to
be made.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) The giving of
consent for the purpose of subsection (4)(b) does not affect any right
to refer to the Tribunal the matter to which any decision notice
resulting from the warning notice
relates.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(9) “The
relevant persons” has the same meaning as in section
142JC.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JE References to
Tribunal</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) A notified person
who is aggrieved by—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
the imposition by either regulator of a requirement as a result of
section 142JB(2)(a) or (b) or (3)(a) or
(b),</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a requirement to be
imposed as a result of the giving by one regulator to the other of a
direction under section 142JB(2)(c) or (3)(c),
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) the giving by either
regulator of a direction under section 142JB(2)(d) or
(3)(d),</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>may refer the matter to
the Tribunal.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2)
“Notified person” means a person to whom a decision
notice under section 142JD(6) was given or ought to have been
given.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JF Subsequent
variation of requirement or
direction</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) A regulator may
at any time with the consent of the person concerned
vary—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a requirement
imposed by it as a result of section 142JB(2)(a) or (b) or (3)(a) or
(b), or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a direction given
by it as a result of section 142JB(2)(c) or (d) or (3)(c) or
(d).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The person concerned
may at any time apply to the appropriate regulator for the variation
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a requirement
imposed by it as a result of section 142JB(2)(a) or (b)or (3)(a) or
(b), or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a direction given
by it as a result of section 142JB(2)(c) or (d) or (3)(c) or
(d).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Sections 55U, 55V, 55X
and 55Z3 apply to an application under subsection (2) as they apply to
an application for the variation of a requirement imposed by the
appropriate regulator under section 55L or
55M.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JG Consultation etc.
between regulators</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) Where a
notice under section 142JC or a warning notice or decision notice under
section 142JD relates to a requirement to be imposed in pursuance of a
direction to be given as a result of section 142JB(2)(c) or (3)(c), the
appropriate regulator
must—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) consult the
other regulator before giving the notice,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) give a copy of the
notice to the other
regulator.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The appropriate
regulator must consult the other regulator before varying under section
142JF a direction given as a result of section 142JB(2)(c) or
(3)(c).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3)
Directions given by the FCA as a result of section
142JB(3)(c) are subject to any directions given to the FCA under
section 3I.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JH Relationship
with regulators’ powers under Parts 4A and
12A</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) Subsection (2) applies
in relation to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a
ring-fenced body which is a member of a mixed group,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2> 
<?notus-xml column=96?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a parent undertaking of such a ring-fenced
body.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) A regulator may not
exercise its general powers in relation to the ring-fenced body or
parent undertaking so as to achieve either of the results in subsection
(3).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) Those results
are—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) that no
existing group member is a parent undertaking of the ring-fenced
body;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) that the ring-fenced
body is not a member of a mixed
group.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) In subsection (3)(a)
“existing group member” means a person who is a member of
the ring-fenced body’s group at the time when the requirement is
imposed or the direction
given.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) Except as provided
by subsections (1) to (4), the provisions of sections 142JA to 142JG do
not limit the general powers of either
regulator.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) For the purposes
of this section, a regulator’s “general powers”
are its powers under the following
provisions—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) section
55L or 55M (imposition of requirements in connection with Part 4A
permission);</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
section 192C (power to direct qualifying parent
undertaking).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) For the
purposes of this section, a ring-fenced body is a member of a mixed
group if a member of the ring-fenced body’s group carries on an
excluded
activity.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1 Justify="centre"><I>Failure
of parent undertaking to comply with
direction</I></hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JI Power to
impose penalty or issue
censure</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) This section
applies if a regulator is satisfied that a person who is or has been a
qualifying parent undertaking as defined in section 142JB(4)
(“P”) has contravened a requirement of a direction given
to P by that regulator as a result of section 142JB(2)(d) or
(3)(d).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The regulator may
impose a penalty of such amount as it considers appropriate
on—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) P,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any person who was
knowingly concerned in the
contravention.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) The
regulator may, instead of imposing a penalty on a person, publish a
statement censuring the
person.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) The regulator may
not take action against a person under this section after the end of
the limitation period unless, before the end of that period, it has
given a warning notice to the person under section
142JJ.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) “The
limitation period” means the period of 3 years beginning with
the first day on which the regulator knew of the
contravention.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) For this
purpose a regulator is to be treated as knowing of a
contravention if it has information from which the contravention can
reasonably be inferred.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) The
requirements that a regulator may be required to impose as a result of
a direction under section 142JB(2)(c) or (3)(c) include requirements
that t he regulator would not but for the direction have power to
impose.</hs_AmendmentLevel1> <hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JJ Procedure and
right to refer to Tribunal</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1)
If a regulator proposes to take action against a person under section
142JI, it must give the person a warning
notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) A warning notice
about a proposal to impose a penalty must state the amount of the
penalty.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) A warning notice
about a proposal to publish a statement must set out the terms of the
statement.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) If the regulator
decides to take action against a person under section 142JI, it must
give the person a decision
notice.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) A decision notice
about the imposition of a penalty must state the amount of the
penalty.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) A decision notice
about the publication of a statement must set out the terms of the
statement.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) If the regulator
decides to take action against a person under section 142JI, the person
may refer the matter to the Tribunal.</hs_AmendmentLevel1> 
<?notus-xml column=97?><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JK Duty on publication of
statement</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>After a statement
under section 142JI(3) is published, the regulator must send a copy of
the statement to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
the person in respect of whom it is made,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any person to whom a
copy of the decision notice was given under section
393(4).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel0>142JL Imposition of
penalties under section 142JI: statement of
policy</hs_AmendmentLevel0><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) Each regulator must
prepare and issue a statement of policy with respect
to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the imposition
of penalties under section 142JI,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the amount of penalties
under that section.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) A
regulator’s policy in determining what the amount of a penalty
should be must include having regard
to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the seriousness
of the contravention,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the
extent to which the contravention was deliberate or reckless,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) whether the person on
whom the penalty is to be imposed is an
individual.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) A regulator may
at any time alter or replace a statement issued under this
section.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) If a statement
issued under this section is altered or replaced, the regulator must
issue the altered or replacement
statement.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5)
In exercising, or deciding whether to exercise, a power under section
142JI(2) in the case of any particular contravention, a regulator must
have regard to any statement of policy published under this section and
in force at a time when the contravention
occurred.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) A statement under
this section must be published by the regulator concerned in the way
appearing to the regulator to be best calculated to bring it to the
attention of the public.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) A
regulator may charge a reasonable fee for providing a person with a
copy of the statement published under this
section.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) A regulator must,
without delay, give the Treasury a copy of any statement which it
publishes under this
section.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(9) Section 192I
applies in relation to a statement under this section as it applies in
relation to a statement under section 192H.’—<I>(Greg

House—<I>[</I><I>Interruption</I><I>]</I><I>—</I>and,
indeed, the Minister will know, a bank’s leverage is the ratio
of its assets to equity capital. Its equity capital is equal to the
value of its assets, minus the value of its liabilities. Higher
leverage rates magnify returns, because any growth in assets will be
proportionately greater if equity is thin, but—and this is why
it matters—the corollary is that any losses are magnified if
leverage is greater. Its equity can be wiped out by a smaller shock
than would wipe out the equity of a less leveraged
institution.</hs_Para>

Independent Commission on Banking was clear on this matter, and said
that it supported the use of leveraged ratios as a back-stop. It called
for a tapering of the requirements when a bank crossed a certain size 
<?notus-xml column=103?>threshold by increasing the minimum leverage ratio
from 3%—the Basel proposal—to over 4% on a sliding scale,
as the risk weighting of assets to GDP ratio increased from 1% to 3%.
The Opposition believe, as do many commentators—this is a
question that came up in the recommendations from the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards—that reforms are needed to
leverage, as well as the risk weighting of assets. In the aftermath of
the global financial crisis, regulators introduced the risk weighting
of assets process as an antidote to the high-risk, high-reward culture
pervasive in banks. That process, however, has been partial, somewhat
self-defined by the banks themselves in some cases, and in the European
Union, the zero risk weighting attributed to some palpably risky
sovereign debts has brought that system into disrepute.</hs_Para>

the trouble to look at the new clause, because it is our second attempt
to cajole or persuade the Government to look at this issue. In
Committee, we took a different approach to the question of leverage,
and tried to clarify that there was a clear power for the Government to
act. I hope in the spirit of consensus and trying to move the arguments
forward, the Minister and the House will accept that we have taken a
new approach, thinking about leverage as it affects the UK economy as a
whole. Leverage—and I shall come on to make this
argument—is part and parcel of the way in which an economy
works, and in the new clause we have looked at a particular design that
would encompass other institutions. I do not want to be misinterpreted:
we mention foreign banks, for example, but I do no intend any
extra-territorial reference in the new clause. It simply makes it clear
that the provision has to encompass effective leverage on the UK
financial services sector as a whole.</hs_Para>

giving way, but I want to be clear about his proposition. A target
would imply that a bank that was just 10 times leverage would have to
raise its leverage ratio to 25 times if it was a 4% target,
whereas if it was a 4% minimum leverage ratio, that would be totally
different. The bank that leveraged 10 times would not be in breach of
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070833000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070833000022"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Leslie" PimsId="1471" UID="13070833000048" xid="354" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070833000048">Chris
Leslie:</Member></B> I understand the hon. Gentleman’s point.
Let me be clear. The target that should be set would be for the
financial system as a whole. It would be for the regulators to make
judgments about firm-by-firm leverage arrangements, so it would be on a
more sophisticated 
<?notus-xml column=105?>basis. There is a case to be made for a regulator to look at each
individual institution. Some institutions are significantly different
from one another. Some of the building societies, for example, have
recently been making the point that they have different asset
structures and so on, and that exactly the same leverage arrangement
across the board for all firms simultaneously would not necessarily be
appropriate. In an effort to work towards some way of dealing with the
issue, this design is one that I have

inflation target, clearly the Chancellor has been setting out his
inflation target. It has been missed on a number of
occasions—quite a few months and quarters have gone by—so
the interplay between the Chancellor and the Bank of England is
critical here. I am more than happy to come back to the issue. My point
in the new clause today is that we need to start seriously discussing

If the regulator could set it for each individual bank, that would give
a very strong arbitrary power to the bank to meet that overall target.

particularly good ones and better than others, that is exactly what
they said in the crisis and it turned out not to be

invidious for us as politicians to try to delve into the specific
analysis of bank-by-bank asset or liability, quality and the risk
weighting of assets. That is why we have regulators and what their job
should be, but it is important that as a body politic, so to
speak, we make a judgment about the level of leverage
that we should have in the economy as a whole. That is
why I raise the issue

us, tackling the leverage question is incredibly important. We should
not wait for the European Union to decide these things for us. We
sought in Committee to clarify this in part. Rather than put it in the
“too difficult to handle” box, as the Government seem to
be doing, we should try to move forward constructively. The approach
that we have taken is on the amendment paper. First, it is necessary to
prevent the banks from over-extending themselves beyond the point of
safety. 
<?notus-xml column=106?>Ring-fencing does not do that. We think ring-fencing

we have been hearing arguments recently about the leverage ratio as
anathema to bank lending into the real economy. Sometimes it is
characterised as one or the other. I do not necessarily agree that
there is a seesaw trade-off between the two. Andrew Bailey at the
Prudential Regulation Authority has recently made the particularly
pertinent argument that capital can be lent onwards in any case, so it
should not be a case of one or the other.</hs_Para>

of clarity, in new clause 9 we looked to address this explicitly by
framing a leverage target strategy for the system as a whole, which
must be constructed in such a manner so as to maintain adequate
credit availability to support a growing economy. It is important to
recognise that we will always operate with a degree of leverage. That
is part and parcel of the way our banking system works, and our
constituents rightly want us to focus on getting the economy moving,
while preventing excessive risk-taking. In the spirit of constructive
engagement, we hope the amendment strikes the right
balance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070833000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070833000031">It
is sometimes argued that leverage should be a back-stop rather than a
front stop. The argument about what is a back-stop and what is a
front-stop can get rather theological. Andy Haldane makes the point in
his famous “The Dog and the Frisbee” speech that leverage
needs to be brought much further forward as a primary tool for
the regulators, and that other capital and risk-weighting issues should
be subordinated. The main point is that leverage should be
recognised as a key dynamic in our economy and needs to be
regulated in a way not dissimilar to the regulation of
inflation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070833000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070833000032">For
us, there are three essential elements: set a leverage target for the
system as a whole, which is a task for the Government; measure that
risk—the threats to whether loans are going to be
repaid—more accurately by sector, to determine which sector
needs more capital to make it safe if leverage is rising and which
could dealt with in a normal way; stress-test to back-test the
pressures in those particular institutions to be clear that the choice
of the leverage target is correct. The regulator should do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070833000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070833000033">New

know that other Members wish to speak and so will not take much more
time. It is not good enough for the Government simply to leave this out
of the Bill completely, to leave the regulators slightly powerless on
this point and to leave the EU to deal with it. There are ways of
overcoming the impact that leverage questions might have on non-plc
institutions, such as those building societies, and having the
regulator make those operational judgments is one of them, but we must
have the safeguard in place. We must also eradicate once and for all
the concept of a bank being “too big to fail.” I think
that action on leverage would certainly be one way of doing
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/E0528106C13F55CB70637EBAB149E00B004E400B" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 July 2013">Monday

allows us to discuss something that is at the heart of what regulators
need to do to have a strong banking sector and economy and to have the
comfort at night of knowing that we will not live through another
dreadful crisis like the credit crunch of the previous decade. The new
clause goes to the heart of the issue: what action should the
Government and regulators take to try to ensure that large banks and
other institutions advancing credit that can be a risk to the whole
system are kept under sensible control, so that we can be pretty
confident that, if something goes wrong or the world economy dips, they
have the necessary money to pay the bills and deal with any losses that

arise?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000003">If
we look at the tragic history of the previous decade, we can see that
the then banking regulator in the United Kingdom—I think that it
has now admitted this—got it wrong both ways. It wanted the
banks to have too little capital, cash and protection, and in the
run-up to the credit crisis in 2008 it allowed the most enormous
expansion of leverage, which previous generations of regulators had not
permitted. Then, in the ensuing panic, when interest rates had to rise
to tackle the problem of inflation, it lurched to wanting very high
amounts of capital, but at the time the banks could not generate profit
and so found that very difficult. That resulted in the previous
Government’s decision, in two of the worst cases, that capital
should be forthcoming from the state and taxpayers themselves. I think
that we all agree that we do not want to go back around that course or
to get to the position again where some Members of this House feel that
the only option is for the state to provide taxpayer support for
organisations that have been too
leveraged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000004">New
clause 9 suggests that it is possible to set a leverage ratio for the
system as a whole, and it might be, and that might be desirable, and I
look forward to the Minister’s response. Of course, the
regulator already does that in a way because it sets individual target
ratios or capital requirements for all the major banks in the system,
so if we aggregate those we get to its view of the aggregate amount of
leverage. As the hon. Member for Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) has
rightly said, if that overall leverage were to be set for the system as
a whole, the regulator would still need to interpret that bank by bank.
Some banks would be super-prudent and some would be straining at the
other end of the spectrum and might be under special measures with the
regulator to try to get their balance sheets into
shape.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000005">My
particular worry at the moment is that it is never easy managing the
transition. We would all be delighted to wake up tomorrow and discover
that all the banks are super-safe, but if the price of getting to that
stage too quickly is no growth in the economy or, worse still, the
onset of another recession because the banks cannot finance the
recovery, that would be a bad idea. Many of us would like to see the
banks get to better ratios by writing more profitable business and
generating more legitimate and sensible levels of profit, rather than
having the regulator run the risk of moving too quickly 
<?notus-xml column=108?>to demand that they have much better ratios. The
banks would then have to achieve those better ratios by not writing any
new business and by trying to get old loans back ever more quickly from
businesses that might find it difficult to repay them. Some of those
banks, not being very profitable, could not trade themselves out of the
difficulties that they found themselves
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000006">We
also need to be conscious of what is happening globally, because
although we should not chase the rest of the world if it has a group of
regulators that are being far too generous and wish to re-enact the
boom-type crisis of the previous decade—I do not think that we
are in that position any more; I think that the regulators of the world
are all generally trying to be more cautious—we need to ensure
that we do not do anything in Britain that is particularly penal. What
we need in order to have a prosperous economy is banks with sufficient
profit, reserves and capital to be able to finance a normal recovery.
It is very unpopular in this country to speak up for banks making
profits at the moment, or indeed at any time, but it is important that
they generate reasonable working profits, because that is the best way
to make them more

previous Labour Government and in the early days of the coalition, we
were running a strange policy in which, on the one hand, the Bank of
England was trying to depress the vehicle’s accelerator by
creating a lot of extra money and saying, “We really need to get
some of this money out there to do some good in the economy.” On
the other hand, the banking regulator was depressing the
vehicle’s brake, saying, “No, you can’t possibly
spend that money to create more credit and do more things. The priority
is for the banks to sit on the money to have better cash and capital
ratios. They probably need to wind down their loan books, which we
think are too big.” My observation is that if we try to drive a

consequence of insufficient capital. I put that to Mr Bailey a few days
ago in the Treasury Committee. I asked him about the net new lending

we cannot have tighter adequacy requirements on capital and lots more

improve quickly enough and it will then not be in a position to lend

making the same point to the Minister. Yes, I want us to get to
stronger banks with tighter ratios, but I want us to get there through
growth and growth in bank profits—particularly for HBOS and RBS,
in which we have a large state stake and whose results have been
disappointing for a number of years. If we can get to that happy
position, we can have a bit of growth and some more profitability and
then the regulator will have to have a sensible conversation with the
banks; it will say that some of the money has to be put into cash and
capital so that they are stronger. We will be the better for
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr McFadden" PimsId="4815" UID="13070836000556" xid="909" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000556">Mr

argument is really about complexity versus simplicity in how banks are
regulated. One of the points that my hon. Friend the Member for
Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) is trying to bring out is the inadequacy
of the over-complex Basel regulations, which have allowed banks to game
the system and say they had hugely different capital ratios on similar
classes of assets in different institutions. The truth is that the
Basel system is so complex that it does not give confidence about the
safety of our banks. That is why this debate about leverage is so
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000021">In
all the debate about ring-fencing, separation and so on, what has
perhaps been under-discussed is the fact that not enough attention has
been paid to leverage—a basic measure of banks’ safety or
resilience against future risks and very important in respect of
banks’ ability to absorb losses. One of the features
consistently pointed out, both to the Treasury Committee and the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, was that in the run-up
to the crisis banks were hugely over-leveraged. That meant that their
capacity to absorb and deal with problems when they came was
minimal.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070836000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000022">Our banks
still have very high gearing today. The banks lobby hard on the issue.
I counsel caution on the basic trade-off that has been raised about
lending and leverage. There are other ways for banks to improve their
capital ratios than simply by reducing lending. They could, for
example, look at the proportion that they give out in remuneration
every year; that could make a difference to their capital ratios. Over
the past decade or two, vast amounts of money have been paid out in
remuneration that could have improved capital ratios without having any
effect at all on lending. Let us not fall for the argument that we can
either have banks that lend, or safe banks, but we cannot have both. It
would be wrong of us to fall into that false dichotomy. We should aim
for banks that are both safe and have the ability to
lend.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070836000543" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000543">7.45

is also the international dimension. Part of the rationale for the
Government’s current position on the 3% leverage
ratio—or a leverage ratio of 33:1, if we want to put it that
way—is that it is part of the new Basel regime. However, we have
a particular issue in the UK. We are a global—some would say the
main global—financial centre, but in a medium-sized economy.
That gives us many great strengths, to which the hon. Member 
<?notus-xml column=111?>for Wyre Forest (Mark Garnier) alluded in the earlier debate. There are
the associated services of law, consultancy and the rest of it. That is
true. Those provide good employment and tax revenue and make Britain an
attractive place to do business. However, we must not be so blinded by
that that we do not take the necessary measures to insulate the rest of
our economy from the risks.</hs_Para>

those risks are real, because we are still living with the consequences
of them following the crisis. The leverage ratio is absolutely at the
heart of that, so there is an important British reason why we should
think twice about simply going along with minimum international
requirements.</hs_Para>

also share the concerns raised by the parliamentary commission about
the importance of having a robust minimum leverage ratio required by
the regulator. As my right hon. Friend the Member for
Wokingham (Mr Redwood) said, there is clearly support among
Members on both sides of the House for that notion. We have
consistently argued for a binding minimum leverage ratio to be
implemented internationally, to supplement the risk-weighting
requirements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000030">As
has been said, the Basel III standard of 3% will come into force in
2018, following an observation period beforehand and a final
calibration of the leverage ratio in 2017. Of course, national
supervisors must be equipped to respond to new risks as they emerge in
banks and financial markets. The PRA, in this country, is empowered to
ensure that banks’ risk models are appropriately conservative
and, where necessary, to set higher capital
requirements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000031">As
every hon. Member will be aware, the PRA has recently announced that
major UK banks need to set out and implement plans to improve their
leverage ratios and so to migrate further towards the new
Basel III standard even now. The FPC has already been given
a number of directive powers, including a counter-cyclical 
<?notus-xml column=112?>capital buffer and the power to set time-varying sectoral capital
requirements. The Government have also made clear their intention to
give the FPC the power to vary through time the baseline leverage ratio
requirement, always subject to its never being below the requirement
determined by Basel
III.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000032">Let
me address the new clause, in whose support the hon. Member for
Nottingham East (Chris Leslie) spoke. The first thing to say is that it
requires the Treasury to give the Bank of England a target for the
overall leverage of the UK’s financial system; I think I
understand the hon. Gentleman correctly when I see an
allusion to the inflation target perhaps given to the Bank of
England. I have to say, though, that that pulls in the opposite
direction to the parliamentary commission’s recommendation,
which calls for the FPC—in other words, the Bank of
England—to be given the power to determine leverage ratios. In
its first and final reports, it noted
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13070836000540" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000540">“the

politicians.”</hs_brev>

the new clause would require a target for the overall leverage of the
UK’s financial system. Again, this is not quite the right
approach. Banks should certainly be subject to individual leverage
requirements to ensure that they have sufficient capital to absorb
losses, but an average leverage ratio for the entire financial sector
could serve to conceal the risks in particular institutions. It would
seem perverse to require the Treasury to set a target for overall
leverage and so create an onus on the FPC to allow some banks to remain
highly leveraged as long as this is offset by smaller or more
conservative institutions running with less leverage. A system-wide
average, or net, leverage ratio might be of little value in tackling
excesses of leverage, and it could be positively
counter-productive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070836000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070836000035">Another
feature of the new clause would be dangerous. The proposal for a target
requires the FPC to pursue action to meet the target. It is suggested
that the FPC take action to increase leverage in the system when it is
less than the target level that the Government are required to set. I
am not clear how or why the FPC would want to do that. The target
approach seems to me to be wrong. Financial stability is not like price
stability; it cannot be boiled down to a single, symmetrical target. As
a recent Bank of England paper

move towards what we want, which is a better, safer level of leverage
within the overall system. It is worth reiterating that we want to do

arguing not only that the extra capital could be lent out but, as he
said, that compensation ratios, as they are sometimes known—the
remuneration levels within banks—could also be tackled. Given
that we are the major financial centre worldwide, we should not just be
leaving this to international regulators. We certainly should not be

leverage ratios of the banks be published, but if that information were

Barclay:</Member></B> In speaking to new clause 2, which I will
not press to a vote, I wish to follow the line of argument pursued by
my right hon. Friend the Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood) on new
clause 9. He drew attention to the tension created by building up
capital while also lending more and used the analogy of driving with
one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake. If I may, I
will take a step outside the car. With new clause 2, I wish to
draw the House’s attention to a similar, I am sure unintended
tension. The Government are taking a positive step forward, because in
paragraphs 2.13 and 2.14 of their response to the parliamentary
commission’s report, they make the welcome announcement that
they accept the premise of reversing the burden of proof. In doing so,
however, they will adopt a measure suggested in paragraphs 1170 and
1171 of the commission’s report that will create a potential
handicap. A new condition will be attached to using that burden of
proof, whereby the regulator must have concluded a successful
enforcement action against the firm prior to doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000013">I
do not think there can be any doubt about the merits of reversing the
burden of proof. It is clear that if the regulator is required to sift
through reams of e-mails looking for evidence to incriminate a senior
banker, it will be a time-consuming and costly exercise. It is also
highly likely that it will fail, because senior executives are not so
stupid as to write boastful and wilful e-mails such as we saw from some
of the LIBOR traders, who bragged of having their bottles of Bolly.
Most senior executives are wise to the risks of e-mails and would not
fall into such a trap. It is proportionate and reasonable to argue that
senior executives who say that their hands-on leadership is sufficient
to justify very high individual bonuses should also, on the other side
of the coin, be able to demonstrate that they have personally acted
reasonably.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000014">The
Government’s announcement that they will reverse the burden of
proof is extremely welcome. However, the acceptance of paragraph 1171
of the Commission’s report could lead to a real impediment. If
we open the door to personal enforcement, why would a chief executive
wish to settle on behalf of their firm? We are trying to make it easier
for the regulator to focus in a time-efficient and cost-effective
manner on the individuals who should be held responsible, but that will
be impeded by the additional requirement for enforcement to be
concluded against the firm. The senior leadership whom we want to
target will be incentivised to drag out proceedings and impede any
settlement with the firm. I do not believe that is the
Government’s intention, but I wished 
<?notus-xml column=120?>to draw the Minister’s attention to it so
that the issue could be discussed in more detail and tackled in the
other
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000015">I
do not share the confidence of some colleagues who have spoken about
the ability of criminal sanctions to operate effectively. They are a
welcome tool to have, and many of our constituents would like the
golden handcuffs to be replaced with the prison variety. Indeed,
the images on US television of white-collar arrests and
convictions have a powerful deterrent effect. My concern, however, is
that if we look at the individual fines and enforcement to date, we see
that the regulator has struggled to reach the evidential level required
to prosecute individuals successfully. Now we are suggesting that it
will have to meet a higher standard of proof to secure criminal
convictions. It is a bit like asking a hurdler who has just failed at
one level to jump over a much higher
hurdle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000016">The
reversal of the burden of proof is one aspect of what we need, and the
deterrent effect of criminal sanctions is another, because it brings
with it the power of the headline. The question is, will we fall into
the trap that we so often fall into in this House of passing
legislation that sounds tough but proves difficult to use in practice?
My fear is that the standard of proof required of the regulator to
deliver a criminal prosecution will make it a tool that is rarely
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000017">We
therefore need to consider how we can target individuals, not firms,
because that will drive the culture of firms. Currently, where there is
wrongdoing, a firm will settle quickly and get a 30% discount. The more
junior staff—the heads of the divisions responsible—are
quickly exited, and the senior staff wilfully claim blindness, because
the most controversial briefings are usually done orally. Reversing the
burden of proof will address part of the ill, but through the new
clause I wish to draw attention to the limitations of fines on firms,
which at the end of the day penalise shareholders and pension funds.
Our constituents pay twice—first for the bail-out, and then
through the impact on their shareholding.</hs_Para>

is why I would resist the temptation, however siren the voices, to
follow the US model of much higher fines, even though the
Government’s change, whereby fines will now go to good causes,
is welcome. Under the Labour party, fines bizarrely benefited other
banks, so the more banks behaved badly, the more other banks benefited.
That was a bizarre incentive in the regulatory model that the current
shadow Chancellor put in place, and I welcome the fact that we have
fixed it. However, high fines against firms invariably punish the
shareholders, not the senior executives
responsible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000019">When
the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 first went through the
House and was debated for many hours in the Chamber, it was felt that
reputational harm would be a deterrent to firms. Indeed, the Act made
specific reference to the fact that firms should be named, as though
customers would be so shocked by the bad behaviour of a specific bank
that they would take their business elsewhere. I think it is reasonable
to conclude that shame has not had the intended effect. Indeed, when an
executive can name a horse Fatcatinthehat, it is clear that shame is
not a
deterrent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000020">New
clause 2 would build on a fix that the Government have already put in
place, the reversal of the burden of proof. The objective behind it is
more modest than the 
<?notus-xml column=121?>aspiration for criminal sanctions, which are
attractive but, I fear, limited in their practical
application. It is also intended to address a potential flaw
in the parliamentary commission’s report, which was otherwise a
first-class piece of work, whereby there will be a potential
disincentive for executives to settle any enforcement action against
their firm if in doing so they leave themselves open to individual
fines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000021">We
need not more laws but to address the culture within banks and
financial services. We pay senior executives in those institutions to
assess risk. If the highest fine associated with the 2008 banking
collapse is less than the bonuses of those executives in the preceding
year, as is currently the case, it is logical that executives will
assess the risk of being caught and of a paltry fine as being a risk
worth taking. If the penalty is against the firm and not
against them as individuals, that will further embolden them to
take risks from which they personally benefit. That is why I seek to
draw the Financial Secretary’s attention to the opportunity
offered by new clause 2 to reverse the burden of proof without
condition, so that we can hit those responsible for future failure
personally and where it hurts most—in their
pocket.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000022"><Member ContinuationText="Cathy Jamieson" PimsId="1152" UID="13070842000120" xid="1099" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0003.htm#13070842000120"><B>Cathy

aware of which provisions the Government intended to accept, and we may
have tabled a number of them differently—or not at
all—had we known their intentions. Nevertheless, there are a
couple of issues that we believe are not covered by the report and the
Government’s response.</hs_Para>

remarks in context, the areas where quick implementation can be taken
forward have been highlighted and the issues that require more detailed
work have been identified. Where the Government do not agree with the

the new clauses, but it is worth

Government have announced plans to implement measures to improve
individual accountability, and some of our new clauses relate to that
in the overall context of conduct and remuneration. The
Government have mentioned the tough new senior persons regime governing
the behaviour of senior bank staff, outlined a willingness to take
forward work on new banking standards rules to promote higher standards
for bank staff, and—this was controversial in some
quarters—we are pleased that they have at last decided to
introduce a new criminal offence for reckless misconduct for senior
bankers. We have heard from the hon. Member for North East
Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay) about reversing the burden of proof so
that bank bosses are held accountable for breaches within their areas
of responsibility. The Government have made further commitments to work
with regulators to implement the commission’s proposals on pay,
allowing bonuses to be deferred for up to 10 years, and
enabling 100% clawback of bonuses where banks receive state aid. All
those areas are relevant to our discussion.</hs_Para>

part of forthcoming EU legislation, in some cases specifically relating

2, the hon. Member for North East Cambridgeshire spoke eloquently about
the culture involved. We can debate legislation and change as many
regulations as we like, but if we do not get into the heads of those
who make decisions and create that culture, we will not change enough
to ensure that past scenarios do not happen in the future. The hon.
Gentleman said that he did not intend to push the new clause to the
vote. I had assumed that perhaps the Government would
have agreed to it and that he would have been acclaimed
as the favoured son who had tabled a new clause that the
Government accepted—and therefore his record would have been
better than mine; throughout the Bill’s time in Committee, I
managed to get only one word changed, much to the chagrin of my hon.

Committee we argued that similar regimes have applied to other
professionals, and there is no reason in principle why that should not
be the case in the banking and financial services sector. Just as with
lawyers, doctors or other professionals, misconduct in banking and
financial services causes potential injury, injustice or financial

for consideration in this Chamber? In his opening remarks I think the
Minister gave an assurance that there would be ample opportunity to
discuss those issues in the Chamber, but it is worth noting that when
the Bill passes into statute as a result of all the work done to it, it
will be very different to the one initially introduced, and it is right

will be familiar with the amendment that we tabled in Committee on the
duty of care, and we have now tabled new clause 4, which would
introduce duties of care for ring-fenced bodies—first, a
fiduciary duty in relation to the carrying out of core services, and
secondly a more general duty of care across the financial services
sector. As I outlined in Committee, we bring this forward because we
feel that it would send an important signal to the general public, who
still have some way to go before trust is restored in the banking and
financial services sector.</hs_Para>

fiduciary duty, which characterises the requirement to serve in good
faith, would help the banking sector focus on and return to some of its
earlier principles connected with helping and informing customers,
generating prosperity and not making a profit inappropriately from
consumer inertia or ignorance. We know that the idea of the duty of
care is supported by several external organisations because of the
previous failures of the banks. For example, in March, a Which? survey
found that banks were failing to give the right advice in many
instances on transferring and managing cash ISAs. We had some
discussion on that in Committee. As a test of that issue, Which? placed
180 calls to 15 leading banks and building societies to assess the
quality of advice given to people who wanted to transfer their cash ISA
savings. It said that several banks, including some of the major,
well-known banks, failed to give correct answers to three simple cash
ISA questions in more than half of the calls. That is the kind of thing
that does not endear the financial institutions to the public, who want
to believe that the banks have their best interests at heart as well as
having the information on what would be best for them at their
fingertips.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070842000035">New

great deal to ensuring that consumers could have that full confidence

the banking industry and the financial services sector are not simply

we want to do is try to put them in legislation to give a clear signal

catch-all provision but, in the aftermath of the banking crisis, the
legal and regulatory structures, and the further changes that the

Jamieson:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman makes a useful and probing
point—I wish I had had the opportunity to probe the
Government’s proposals in the same way. The point is to look at
patterns of behaviour and conduct. The important thing is that this
change or anything that the Government introduce should be robust and
should stack up. That is why I was particularly keen to know how the
Minister sees this issue being taken forward. However, I recognise that
there is a wider context, so if he could respond by giving me some
assurances on this issue, I would probably be tempted not to press new

briefly mention new clause 11, which deals with criminal sanctions. New
clause 11 was also inspired by the work of the Banking Commission. It
would require the Government to bring forward proposals for the new
offence of reckless misconduct in the management of a bank covering the
people licensed under the senior persons regime and would seek civil
recovery of money from people found guilty of the offence. Although
that might be controversial in some areas, it is important. I welcome
the fact that the Government now seem to be moving on this, and I await
the detail with interest. It is 
<?notus-xml column=127?>vital that bankers are held to account for their actions. That is
important not just for any action after a future crisis, but as a
deterrent, should any bank executives be tempted to take unnecessary or
reckless risks.</hs_Para>

Financial products are becoming ever more complex, and they are being
traded faster, and increased resources could enable specialist police
officers to develop their expertise. There are huge financial
incentives in looking at developing this, too. It is worth remembering
that fraud costs Britain about £73 billion a year, according to
the Home Office’s National Fraud Authority. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Nottingham East recalled in Committee, Andrew Bailey,
the PRA chief executive, said it was “more than odd” that
bank directors had not faced formal charges over the events leading up
to the crisis. The Serious Fraud Office has a bit of a mixed record on
tackling the high-profile cases. The Home Secretary was forced to
perform a bit of a U-turn on her plans to abolish the SFO. It is clear
that the SFO needs to be improved. The LIBOR scandal again shows that
misconduct in financial services can have ramifications for

it considered that point, and rightly so. In the intervening 12 months,
I have dealt with constituents whose businesses have been put at risk
because of the fraud of interest rate swap mis-selling and whose lives
have been rent asunder by payment protection insurance mis-selling, and
the Government have also taken action on the fiddling and fixing of
LIBOR. Beyond that, some of us have been dealing with regulatory
failures on Equitable Life. My view is 
<?notus-xml column=130?>that jail for such bankers and for those responsible is the only fair

to mention that in a minute. First, let me ask the Minister a couple of
questions. In the senior persons regime and the actions that would be
covered by new clause 11, the focus is on named individuals at the top.
As we saw in the interest rate swaps, a lot of the decisions made by
the senior ranks at the banks were translated into budgets and business
plans and transferred down through the hierarchy of the banks. Perhaps
the Minister, when he considers the issue of conduct, could answer the
question of how those extensions beyond the senior persons regime will

sub-panel that considered below board level corporate governance I can
say to him that the management structures of banks are so fiendishly
complex that there is little way that the senior managers of banks can
translate their wishes all the way down to the bottom. Other evidence
gave reasons why the senior management in banks can effectively set up
what amounts to an accountability firewall, thereby putting wilful
ignorance between them and the activities that go on in the front line
and absolving themselves from any responsibility for any misconduct at
the bottom end of the bank. That is a very serious

by and doled out knighthoods, but never thought about jail.
Where on earth was the thought about the people who were suffering
owing to the scandals that were under way at that time? I was
pleased that she did not press her point aggressively because, as we
deal with the current problems, it is clear to many of us whose fingers
are all over the crime. We do not need an Inspector Luther or a Miss
Marple to know that people in government were
responsible for setting the framework under which criminal
activity was allowed to run rife. Many of us believe that it

when David Strachan conducted his review at the Financial Services
Authority following the Legal and General case and brought forward his
recommendations for a light-touch enforcement regime, the vice-chair of
the FSA was Sir James Crosby, who is one of the three figures who are
especially criticised in the banking commission’s report? We
have a multi-layered, light-touch enforcement regime that often creates
a disincentive to the regulator—this is why market abuse often
involves criminal sanctions, not civil sanctions. One of the people
criticised in the banking commission report actually designed the
system that applies to the
regulator.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070842000086"></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070842000087"><B><Member ContinuationText="Richard Fuller" PimsId="5734" UID="13070842000143" xid="1004" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070842000143">Richard

not only to my body of knowledge, but to the commonly held disgust
that, following all these efforts involving the best minds we can put
in place, no one is going to jail. In the absence of anyone
going to jail, we have gone through all the fraud, all the
mis-structured, light-touch regulation and all the mis-positioning of
responsibilities without a single person being truly accountable. If
there is a point on which I disagree with my hon. Friend, which I
rarely do, it is that he said in his speech that financial penalties
are likely to be more successful. He might have a point in saying that
there will be more successful prosecutions, but the loss of
one’s liberty cannot be put in a discounted cash
flow—there cannot be a beta high enough. If we want to change
behaviour, we have to show that people will go to jail and lose their
liberty. If, having gone through the worst financial recession that we
have experienced in our lifetimes, not a single person goes to jail as
a result of all our work, I do not care that there is a

some of these things. In the past, they have been more successful than

Love:</Member></B> I will comment on the commission’s thought
processes on some of the issues that the hon. Gentleman mentioned. He
will remember, as we all do, the evening on which we set up a special
parliamentary vehicle in the wake of the LIBOR rate-rigging scandal.
Since 2008, there have been a variety of critical events, including the
credit crunch and the recession. All that led to a catastrophic decline
in the reputation of the financial services sector. Trust in bankers
sank to an all-time low, and frankly LIBOR was the last straw. This was
truly shocking behaviour on an unprecedented scale. Something had to be
done, and the focus was very much on our terms of reference on
standards and
culture.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070842000092">As
a result, the commission had to answer some tough questions, and the
hon. Gentleman has posed some of them: why had so few bankers been held
to account for their failings? Why had it appeared that bankers
pocketed the gains, but passed on the losses to the taxpayer? Why were
customers who should have been treated fairly treated in the exact
opposite way—a point that my hon. Friend the Member for
Kilmarnock and Loudoun (Cathy Jamieson) raised? We tried to answer
those questions through three themes that came out in our report. The
first theme is individual
responsibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070842000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070842000093">When
all the head bankers came before us, we were genuinely shocked to hear
that they denied any responsibility for what happened in their banks.
Whether it was ignorance of the serious failings happening under their
noses, or because there was collective decision making, the result was
the same: no one could be held to account. That, we
discovered, was the result of the failure of the approved
persons regime, which did not attribute responsibilities to senior
staff, who, as a result, could not be held to account.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070842000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070842000094">Two steps are
proposed to try to address that problem. First, we have already
mentioned the new senior persons regime, designed to ensure that the
most important responsibilities are assigned to specific individuals,
who will more easily be held to account for them. Secondly, for a much
wider group—not every employee, but those who could do serious
harm to the bank, or its customers, due to their customer-facing
position—we propose a new licensing regime, with a set of
banking standard rules that enable them to be held to
account.</hs_Para>

people to be held to account, we need more effective sanctions, and
that is the second theme of the commission’s report.
Identification of those responsible under the new regime will provide a
stronger basis for the regulator to enforce existing civil penalties,
such as 
<?notus-xml column=133?>fines, restrictions and bans. One of the great difficulties was
assigning responsibility; we hope that individual responsibility will
address that.</hs_Para>

seriousness of the wrongdoings—an issue mentioned in earlier
contributions—the commission is recommending two new,
far-reaching powers. New clause 2 does not address this
point, but under certain conditions, the regulator should be able to
impose a full range of civil sanctions, unless the person can
demonstrate that reasonable steps were taken to prevent or mitigate the
failing. In effect, that does what new clause 2 suggests: it reverses
the burden of proof, but only under certain
conditions.</hs_Para>

Barclay:</Member></B> In essence, the hon. Gentleman is describing the
purpose of new clause 2. Earlier, I alluded to the fact that there is a
condition that militates against the effectiveness of the new clause:
the tool can be used only if there is a successful prosecution, which
gets in the way. As much as I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for
Bedford (Richard Fuller), does the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love)
agree that we need to be careful about changing the law
retrospectively, particularly on custodial sentences? One of the issues
that we are addressing today is how we get it right for the future, and
what the sanctions should be.</hs_Para>

was not considered by the commission, which does not make any
recommendations on it. I suspect, however, that none of its members

change is the much publicised criminal offence of reckless misconduct
in the management of a bank, which normally carries, as has been
suggested, a custodial sentence. Importantly, we have laid down
preconditions before a charge of that nature can be brought.
There must be a cost to the taxpayer—the bank has turned to the
taxpayer to bail it out; or there are consequences for the financial
system—stability is critical, and anything that destabilises the
system should be subject to a criminal sanction; or there is serious
harm to customers. We think that we have framed a big change in the
law. Bankers continually ask why they are singled out as the only
commercial group that can be charged in that way. It is a delicate
balance, and I hope that the Government will look seriously at what we
are trying to do.</hs_Para>

area I want to touch on is remuneration and incentives. The reality is
that rewards have been huge, and still are huge for a more limited
supply of senior bankers. That incentivises excessive risk taking and,
occasionally, misconduct. The commission concluded that risk and reward
are still misaligned, particularly when making pay awards over a short
period. It therefore sees advantages in making a significant portion of
remuneration variable, rather than fixed. We do not have much sympathy
for the European solution in relation to that, but we think that reform
is necessary in this area. More variable pay should be deferred to take
into account changing circumstances at the bank at which the banker
works, with power for the regulator to extend the period for up to 10
years. To those who say that that is a long time, many banks have a
good year, but then some less good years, and the commission wanted to
recognise that that can go on for an extended period.</hs_Para>

should be able to limit or prohibit sales-based incentives. We were
shocked at the way in which sales-based incentives were used to create
the mis-selling scandals of PPI and interest rate swaps. There was a
cascading group of incentives from senior management through to the
customer-facing end of the bank, and we think that that made a major
contribution to the problems that arose. We want to give the regulator
much stronger powers. Where a bank requires taxpayer support, the
regulator should have discretionary power to cancel all deferred
compensation. It is shocking that, as happened in some banks, they were
still paying remuneration to employees after the bank had taken on
taxpayer funds.</hs_Para>

conduct and remuneration that I have raised lie at the heart of what
the commission thinks needs to be done in respect of culture and
standards. These recommendations have been much debated and discussed.
We have done everything we can to make them practical and realisable,
and I hope that, when there is an opportunity to debate them in the
other House, or when they come back to this place, the Government will
give serious consideration to those
recommendations.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_08_PT_1/A16744AE9E831E1D41D630F2F7798B099E879EE2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 July 2013">Monday

Ruffley:</Member></B> I shall make two brief points.
First, I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for North East
Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay) on drawing attention to something very
important to the House—that it is this Government who have got
behind the idea that there should be, in certain limited circumstances,
a custodial sentence for breach of a new criminal offence. It is worth
reminding ourselves that although the crash occurred in autumn 2008,
the then Labour Government had 2009 and the first five months of 2010
to do something about it, but it is this Government who have made their
intentions clear regarding custodial sentences. For that, Ministers
should be
congratulated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847000013">The
second and final point is that we cannot let this debate pass
without reminding ourselves of the fact that existing criminal
law was not being enforced in relation to the allegations of
LIBOR rigging. The Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards came
into existence as a direct result of the allegations about rigging the
LIBOR market. The custodial sentences available for those activities
were not seriously taken on board by the Serious Fraud Office, for in
2011, it is said, the SFO inquired into whether existing criminal
offences had been committed by those manipulating the LIBOR market, and
concluded that they had
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847000014">This
time last year the Chancellor of the Exchequer told the House that he
would ask the Serious Fraud Office to take another look to see whether
criminal offences had been committed under existing criminal law.
Leading counsel advised me and I said in the Chamber that there were,
on the face of it, breaches of section 2 of the Theft Act 1968 through
false accounting, the common law offence of conspiracy to defraud,
breach of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and possibly even breaches
under the Fraud Act 2006.</hs_Para>

Minister clearly cannot intervene in investigations by the Serious
Fraud Office because prosecutorial authorities are quite separate from
the Executive, which has always been the case and will, I am sure,
continue to be the case for centuries to come, it would be useful for
him to indicate what the state of 
<?notus-xml column=135?>play is in relation to breaches of existing criminal
law that might give rise to custodial sentences in the case of those
engaged in LIBOR

initial discussion of the parliamentary commission’s

commission’s report has at its heart the essential point that
the UK banking system depends totally on the trust it commands. If it
cannot count on the trust of its customers, it cannot truly serve
businesses and people, which is the only purpose of banking. If it
cannot count on the trust of businesses and people in this country, it

directors of banks be able to preside expensively over failure or

accountable for breaches within their areas of responsibility. We will
work with the regulators to implement the commission’s proposals
to defer bonuses for up to 10 years and to enable 100% clawback of
bonuses where banks receive state aid. We will ask the regulators to
implement the commission’s recommendations on corporate
governance to ensure that firms have the correct systems in place to
identify risks and maintain standards of ethics. As I have said in
earlier debates, where legislation is required, we will propose
amendments in the autumn in the other place.</hs_Para>

specifically with today’s amendments and new clauses. New clause

are regulatory failings by a firm in that person’s area of
responsibility. As the hon. Member for Edmonton (Mr Love) pointed out,
that is one of the parliamentary commission’s recommendations,
but I think 
<?notus-xml column=136?>that my hon. Friend campaigned for that even before
the Commission reported, drawing on his own experience as a regulator.
I say to the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun that my hon. Friend

the chain just because, as the Commission put it, the e-mail trail goes

of course, a major feature of its report, which we accept. We will
bring forward amendments to introduce the new senior persons

commission recommends, the new regime will ensure that key
responsibilities within banks are assigned to specific individuals who
are aware of those responsibilities and have formally accepted them. As

Friend the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller) is absolutely right: it
is plausible that the deficiencies in the approved persons regime may
affect not just the banking sector but other parts of the financial
services industry. The relevant FSMA provisions apply to all parts of
the sector, so it might be operationally simpler to apply the regime to
the industry as a whole. The Government will consider, with the
regulators, whether the relevant provisions should allow for the wider
application that my hon. Friend has in
mind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847000026">As

also reflects a debate that we had in Committee. The commission did not
recommend the introduction of a fiduciary duty or duty of care, but it
did recommend an alternative route. It said that the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills should consult on changing the duties
of the directors of ring-fenced banks, to prioritise the safety and
soundness of the firm first, over the interests of
shareholders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847000028">The
Government strongly believe that bank directors must maintain an
awareness of their responsibility to safeguard the security and
stability of the firm. Changes that will support a focus on stability
and soundness—for example, giving directors specific duties
under the proposed senior persons regime—will help. We will
indeed consult on whether changing directors’ duties will help
further to accomplish those intentions. I hope that that will reassure
the hon. Lady.</hs_Para>

care specifically towards customers across the financial sector is
difficult to make sense of, as we have previously discussed. Would it
mean, for example, that a bank had a duty of care not just to its own
customers and those of its competitors but, as the proposed duty is to
customers across the financial sector, the customers of an insurance
company with no relevance to the firm itself? The new clause has been
tabled to confirm the Government’s intentions on the wider
duties of banks and their directors, and I hope that the hon. Lady is
satisfied.</hs_Para>

refers to remuneration. Of course, the Government have already taken
significant steps in that regard; under the remuneration code, large
parts of bonuses must be deferred and paid in shares, and cash bonuses
must be limited. However, it is a question of not just the quantum of
bonuses, but how they are decided in the first place. Next year,
shareholders will have a binding vote on executive
pay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847000031">We
strongly support the proposals made by the parliamentary commission. In
particular, the commission has recommended that the regulator should
have the power to require a substantial part of remuneration to be
deferred for up to 10 years when that is necessary for
effective long-term risk management. There is a subtle but critical
distinction between the commission’s recommendation and the new
clause. The power should be with the regulator to determine whether and
in what circumstances to require extended deferral; my hon. Friend the
Member for North East Cambridgeshire made that point.</hs_Para>

commission has commented that no single deferral period is appropriate
but that it should be determined in accordance with the nature of each
business and the risks and activities of the employee in question. The
Government agree and will ask the PRA to consider the powers that it
has to extend deferral periods as part of its consultation on
implementing the commission’s proposals. I hope that that
commitment will reassure the hon. Member for Kilmarnock and Loudoun and
that she will not feel the need to press the matter
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847000033">New
clause 7 deals with protections for whistleblowers. As the hon. Lady
said, we debated this in Committee, so I do no want to detain the House
further today other than to reassure her that, as I explained on that
occasion, these provisions already exist in legislation. Disclosures
about criminal offences are already covered by the Employment Rights
Act 1996. Disclosures about regulatory 
<?notus-xml column=138?>breaches are covered by FSMA. This proposal would cover, for example,
disclosures about the breaches of the regulatory requirements in
relation to the ring-fence. I assume that the second requirement is
designed to give effect to the commission’s proposal that a
non-executive board member, preferably the chairman, should be given
specific responsibility under the senior persons regime. Again, the
powers to enact this are already available to the regulator under FSMA,
and we have indicated that we support the thrust of these
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13070847001099" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847001099">9.30

covered by the regime that is being set up. The commission noted the
legal challenges involved in mounting a successful prosecution, but we
absolutely agree that the creation of this offence should be justified
by the signal that it sends and the potential deterrent effects it can
have. We have to make it clear that reckless behaviour by those in
charge of our banks cannot be
tolerated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847000039">New

similar amendment was discussed at some length in Committee. I can
assure hon. Members that the Government fully recognise the importance
of tackling financial crime. There is to be a dedicated command within
the new National Crime Agency responsible for directing the national
response to economic and financial crimes. The economic crime command
will have a clear remit to reduce the threat from economic and
financial crimes, working collaboratively across the different sectors.

David Ward</B> (Bradford East) (LD):</Member> The very first time that
a son or daughter is asked by one of their parents, “And who
exactly are you?”, is a chilling and frightening experience. It
is a question of good days and bad days. In most cases there will be
many good days—many fun days. It is not the end of the world,
but it is very much the end of a world that the son or daughter knew.
My hon. Friend the Minister is more conversant with the figures than I
am, but they are startling for us as a nation. Some 800,000 people
suffer from dementia. We are told that the figure will increase to 1
million in the next 10 years or so. The Alzheimer’s Society
believes that the cost to us as nation of supporting those people is
£23 billion, and that is with only half of those who have
dementia being diagnosed with it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070847001054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847001054">However, I am
here to tell a good story, about the work going on in Bradford. I would
not be forgiven by Cathy Henwood, the dementia-friendly communities
co-ordinator in the Alzheimer’s Society, if I did not point out
that we were doing dementia-friendly work in Bradford before the Prime
Minister’s challenge, which I will return to later. The dementia
measures taken in Bradford have been well supported by the council.
Stage one of the work included the recruitment of a small pilot group
of organisations, such as the gurdwara, the Church of England, the
community centre, a local branch of Lloyds TSB, a pharmacy and others.
They were asked to review their organisations and write action plans. A
checklist was produced by the Alzheimer’s Society to help them
do that. That list was developed with people who had dementia and those
who cared for people with dementia.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13070847001055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847001055">The second
stage of the work is where my patch of Idle, where I live, came in. It
is a village—yes, I was an Idle councillor for 26 years. The
Alzheimer’s Society developed a community-based approach to
supporting people with dementia which started in Idle and Thackley. The
area happens to have three Liberal Democrat councillors, I am pleased
to say, and they were determined to put together supportive structures
for those with dementia in their ward development plans. Councillor
Jeanette Sunderland leads the Lib Dem group. She and her colleagues
Councillors Griffiths and Reid, working with the Alzheimer’s
Society, held a community meeting on a bleak and snowy day in
January—we do have some bleak and snowy days in Bradford in
January. It was nearly cancelled but it went ahead despite the weather,
and 40 participants turned up and 14 people signed up and agreed to
stay involved. That meeting was partly for awareness raising, with a
speaker who had dementia, and with information about the effects of
dementia and how to help, and it was also partly a consultation, with
discussion about what is good about living in Idle and what would be
problematic for people with memory problems—what could be
changed, and so
forth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847001056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847001056">A
number of subsequent meetings have been held, as was a support group
meeting, with both carers and those with dementia, at a volunteer
event. All was going well. As of April, with some funding from the
Joseph Rowntree Foundation and Bradford council, this work 
<?notus-xml column=149?>was looking to expand out of one ward out of the 30 in Bradford to work
with 20 communities in total over a two-year
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847001057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847001057">There
was an announcement in the <I>Telegraph and Argus </I>about the
Bradford District Dementia Action Alliance, which had brought together
lots of groups and organisations, including the Yorkshire police, the

background to this at the national level is as follows. There is a
£2.68 billion reduction in adult social care funding either so
far or through to March 2014, and locally a 16% reduction over the last
two years in adult and community service budgets, which amounts to
£23 million in Bradford. A joint survey by Age UK and the
College of Social Work found that 94% of people witnessed a squeeze on

integration of health and social care, but integration can happen at
any level of support, of course. Eligibility is the gateway to support;
it provides the level at which a person can access support. As the
Minister well knows, Bradford’s council is consulting on
changing the criteria in Bradford, and that consultation will run until
4 August. I am pleased to say that on 15 July the former
care Minister, my right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam

campaign, which is supported by Scope. It is running a national
campaign, but we will run a local version of it, in which we
will seek to persuade the people of Bradford to support our campaign
against the council’s proposed changes. We feel it is
particularly relevant to those with dementia because, as the Minister
knows, people with dementia are often physically able. With a little
help and support, they are quite capable of looking after
themselves.</hs_Para>

services; creating dementia-friendly communities, which is exactly what
is happening in Bradford; and a much greater focus on research so that
we can find cures, understand better how to prevent some types of

Local councillors got the community involved and that is exactly what

challenges of the future, with an ageing community, there must

65 and over, about 14% of its total population. Bradford’s joint
strategic needs assessment for 2012 predicts that by 2033—not

we debate access to care and support services, I am aware that
City of Bradford metropolitan district council sets its eligibility
criteria at moderate. The report that my hon. Friend published earlier
in the year indicated that 97% of people who replied to his survey
welcomed setting the eligibility criteria at that level. Bradford
council now proposes to change its band to substantial, because of
pressures on its budget, and that would affect about 25% of people who

their lives, rather than waiting for people to reach crisis point. They
will also put people in control by giving them a far greater say about
their care and support, as well as by ensuring that services are
designed around what people actually want and by putting their
priorities and preferences above and beyond the needs of the
institution. My hon. Friend will be aware that the Care Bill, which has
been widely welcomed, will be a single, modern statute for care and

opportunities, including education and employment, and realise their
potential. Assessments will remain an

gateway to the adult receiving care and support—or not, if they

“Fair access to care services” framework was introduced
in 2003. It aimed to provide a fairer and more transparent system for
the allocation of social care services. The assessment and eligibility
framework was reproduced in the “Putting People First”
guidance that was published in 2010. The current assessment and
eligibility framework is graded into four bands: critical; substantial,
which is the case for most local authorities; moderate, which applies
to Bradford and some 15 other authorities; and low, which covers only
two or three councils. Local authorities can choose which band they
wish to set for their local criteria, and Bradford has the legal power
to change its eligibility criteria, as long as it consults its local
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13070847001080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/debtext/130708-0004.htm#13070847001080">People
continue to tell us, however, that the process for determining who is
eligible for care and support is confusing and unfair. Decisions are
not transparent and there is variation across the country, and the end
result is that people can be left without the support that they need.
The existing assessment and eligibility framework is therefore not
working effectively, and that is widely recognised. That is why we are
introducing a national minimum threshold for eligibility through the
Care Bill. The Bill will set out the eligibility criteria—the
point at which local authorities must meet an adult’s care and
support needs, or a carer’s support needs. Local authorities
will remain able to meet lower needs locally, if they choose to do
so.</hs_Para>

system in April 2015. This is the beginning of engagement with
stakeholders before we formally consult on the 
<?notus-xml column=153?>regulations next spring. I assure my hon. Friend that the setting of the
threshold is about establishing a minimum standard, not taking away

protect access to care, but we know that not all the money that was
earmarked for care services has been spent in that way. Ultimately,
spending on social care is a matter for local people in local

decisions. However, we cannot improve care and support simply by
throwing ever more money into the system; on the contrary, we need to
work in more innovative and effective ways, exactly as is happening in

the NHS or the local authority. The £3.8 billion fund, shared
between the NHS and local authorities, will deliver integrated services
more efficiently for older people and, crucially, disabled people. It
covers ensuring that health and social care work together to improve
outcomes for local people, through better sharing of information, so
that people need explain their problems only once; intervening early,
so that older and disabled people can stay healthy and independent at
home, avoiding unnecessary hospital admissions and reducing visits to
accident and emergency departments; and delivering care that is centred

intervention that my hon. Friend discussed and it can address
isolation. He mentioned that pernicious problem. Many people live on
their own, and often lead lonely lives and, as he said, and both their
mental and physical health deteriorates. If we can get the community to

is right that every member of society should care about the content of

we should pass down from one generation to the

updated national curriculum framework that we are publishing today
features a number of revisions to the draft made on the basis of
evidence and arguments presented to us during the consultation period.
In particular we have revised the draft programmes of study for design

that it should be a rigorous and forward-looking subject that will set
children on a path to be the next generation of designers and
engineers.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13070813000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/wmstext/130708m0001.htm#13070813000034">We

significant changes include the inclusion of a stronger emphasis on
vocabulary development in the programmes of study for English and
greater flexibility in the choice of foreign languages which primary
schools will now be required to teach. And perhaps the most significant
change of all is the replacement of ICT with computing. Instead of just
learning to use programmes created by others, it is vital that children
learn to create their own

Government have expressed their regret about the way resettlement of
BIOT was carried out in the late 1960s and early 1970s. We do not seek
to justify those actions or excuse the conduct of an earlier

compensation was rightly paid. Both the British courts and the European

full and final

Government must be honest about these challenges and concerns.
Long-term settlement risks being both precarious and costly. The outer
islands, which have been uninhabited for 40 years, are low-lying and
lack all basic facilities and infrastructure. The cost and
practicalities of providing the levels of infrastructure and public
services appropriate for a 21st century British society are likely to
be significant and present a heavy ongoing contingent liability for the

well-functioning ecosystems and establish coherent ecological networks,
with more and better places for nature, for the benefit of wildlife and

Heath</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 4 July 2013]:</I> Figures from
Eurostat for 2009 indicate that the UK produced 6,000 tonnes of honey,
a significant increase on 2008 when 4,000 tonnes were produced. UK
honey consumption is estimated at 28,500 tonnes a year with a per
capita consumption of 0.5kg. Therefore UK production meets only 21% of
demand. This compares with an EU-25 rate of 60%. Climate is the key
factor in determining honey production. Both the Bee Farmers'
Association (BFA) and British Beekeepers' Association (BBKA) reported
on the impact last summer's rain and cold had on honey production with
the BBKA reporting that the annual honey crop per hive is down by 72%
compared to 2011.</hs_Para>

diseases and the husbandry skills of the beekeeper will also have
significant impact on the productivity of the bee colony. DEFRA
supports beekeepers and the services they provide (i.e. pollination and
honey production) through free apiary inspection and diagnostic
services for statutory diseases and pests and a free training and
education programme to enable beekeepers to become more self-reliant in
combating disease. Last year the National Bee Unit inspected over
36,000 colonies in nearly 8,400 apiaries, providing the opportunity for
one-to-one training with the beekeepers. Under its Healthy Bees Plan,
DEFRA has also co-funded education and training initiatives with
beekeeping associations.</hs_Para>

Suicide Vulnerability Risk Management (SVRM) policy is a preventative
strategy used by the Army. SVRM allows the identification of
individuals who may be at risk and signposts appropriate responses and
management tools to be used by the chain of command. However, the SVRM
register is a management tool which captures a total number of entries
rather than numbers of individuals, meaning that any one individual may
have more than one entry on the register. The register also captures
all those who come under service law, and as such includes a small
proportion of civilian dependents and entitled contractors. An exercise
to extract the numbers of service personnel who have been placed on the
SVRM register, as opposed to the total number of entries on the
register, could be performed only at disproportionate
cost.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13070835000037" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130708/text/130708w0001.htm#13070835000037">Army:

the proportion paid by cheque for the same period is 16% (we reported
78.9% and 21.1% respectively in October 2012). These are the latest
financial data available. Last year the figures were 97% for electronic
payments and just 3% for cheques. However since these figures were
published the Department has increased the scope of its Shared Services
provision and there is now a higher proportion of small value, one-off
supplier payments that are being made (in line with the larger volume
of SMEs engaged, who are without electronic payment systems).</hs_Para>

1986, allows a more generous level of support for people who have not
claimed in the preceding 12 months and who could afford their rent when
they took on the commitment. It was designed to provide protection for
people on higher incomes who lose their jobs, allowing them a buffer
period before their rent support is reduced to the local housing
allowance level. We do not believe that this differential level of

continue to be reported each month via the ONS Vacancy Survey. A user
consultation by DWP on the changes to the Jobcentre Plus vacancy series
was conducted last year and has been published on the DWP statistics
web pages. Statistical information for some geographies below national
level is already available via the Universal Jobmatch Ml tool and some
improvements, including the addition of breakdowns by parliamentary
constituency, have been suggested. DWP is currently agreeing with
Monster Worldwide Ltd, the Universal Jobmatch supplier, a timetable for
prioritising and implementing these improvements, subject to funding.

reviews for all people in learning disability or autism inpatient
assessment and treatment services have been completed in line with the
commitments made in the Concordat: Programme of Action. 1,317 patients
in inpatient assessment and treatment services have been identified for
review by clinical commissioning groups and 97% of these reviews have
been completed. The outstanding reviews will be completed by 31 July
2013. Further work is under way to ensure all reviews have been
completed of patients in secure Child and Adolescent Mental Health

been conducted satisfactorily. People who use services, their families
and the organisations that represent them will be involved in the

into the community and those who will remain in in-patient settings.
Government policy is clear that hospitals are not homes and that all
individuals receive personalised care and support in appropriate
community settings no later than 1 June 2014. NHS England and the Local
Government Association, through the Joint Improvement Programme set up
under ‘Transforming Care’, are working with local areas
to make sure everyone gets the individual care that they need. The
Winterbourne View Joint Improvement Programme is currently undertaking
a 
<?notus-xml column=91?>stocktake; information gathered by NHS England alongside other data from
partners will be triangulated to support the monitoring of progress so
that individuals move into the community and do not remain in hospital
inappropriately.</hs_Para>

collects anonymised reports provided by commissioners relating to the
48 former patients of Winterbourne View. The last data collection
identified that of the 48 former patients, 34 were in social care
settings and 14 in health settings (a further data collection has
recently been completed, and is awaiting analysis). The current
information collected does not include distance from original family
homes; however, of the 14 patients in health settings as of the 1 March
2013, 13 were in placements defined as out of area. As part of the
assurance process NHS England, working with the Winterbourne View Joint
Improvement Programme and key stakeholders, will be looking at the
reviews undertaken for these individuals to ensure they are
robust.</hs_Para>

National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) on research relating to
neurofibromatosis depends on the volume and quality of scientific
activity. The usual practice of the NIHR is not to ring-fence funds for
expenditure on particular topics: research proposals in all areas
compete for the funding available. The NIHR welcomes funding
applications for research into any aspect of human health, including
neurofibromatosis. These applications are subject to peer review and
judged in open competition, with awards being made on the basis of the
scientific quality of the proposals made.</hs_Para>

in 2006 to identify barriers to organ donation and to recommend what
action needed to be taken to increase organ donation and procurement,
within the current legal framework. In January 2008, the Taskforce
published its first report 'Organs for Transplants' and also looked at
the potential for the introduction of a presumed consent system in the
United Kingdom. They recognised, after extensive public dialogue, that
this is a sensitive issue that generates strong feelings both for and
against. They recommended against the introduction of opt-out,
concluding that while such a system might have the potential to deliver
benefits, it would present significant challenges, which might not be
necessary to deliver the desired increase in organ donation rates. On
balance the Taskforce recommended that effort and resources be focused
on the implementation of their 14

Cause of death was defined using the International Classification of
Diseases. Tenth Revision (ICD-10). Deaths were included where the
underlying cause was due to drug poisoning and where a drug controlled
under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 was mentioned on the death
certificate. More details on the definition of a death related to drug
misuse can be found in the background notes of the 'Deaths related to
drug poisoning in England and Wales" statistical

inquest, it can take months for a drug-related death to be registered.

courts to use mental health treatment requirement (MHTRs) by
simplifying the assessment process and ensuring that those who require
