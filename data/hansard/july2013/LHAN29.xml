domestic workers restored the original purpose of the route as a way to
accompany an overseas employer visiting the UK, and included measures
to minimise the risk of ill treatment. All overseas domestic workers
receive written information about their employment rights. The

investigate why, in 24 out of 29 cases, such workers were paid no wage
at all, while not being allowed out unescorted, having their passports
taken away from them and not even having a room to themselves? Will the
Government accept that their safeguards often prove ineffective, since
domestics are too frightened to go to the police or employment
tribunals? Is it not time to prevent such domestic slavery

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> I understand the noble Lord’s
concern and thank him for asking this Question. The Government are
aware of the report from Kalayaan, and my honourable friend Mark
Harper, Minister for Immigration, has agreed to meet Kalayaan the
Tuesday after next. I have been invited to join that meeting. I
understand that the report was based on the 29 individuals 
<?notus-xml column=1314?>on the new visa who sought Kalayaan’s advice in 2012. I have to
say that this contrasts with the 156 who went to Kalayaan under the old
regime last year and the 300 it would normally get in the
preceding years. In turn, that compares with the 15,000 to 16,000
domestic visas issued annually—a figure that has not in fact
varied since this new procedure was put in
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:09:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Cox" PimsId="2747" UID="13070440000415" xid="1182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000415">Baroness
Cox:</Member></B> Is the Minister aware that the new visa system, which
ties migrant domestic workers to one employer, removes all their
protections and deprives them of any resort in terms of challenging,
appalling conditions of employment and abuse, which, as the noble Lord,
Lord Hylton, said, is in effect a form of modern-day slavery? How will
Her Majesty’s Government ensure that such trafficked domestic
workers will receive legal representation if they need it, given that,
as their visas are limited to six months under proposed legal reforms,
they would not pass the residency test of at least one year’s
residence in the

Taylor of Holbeach</B><B>:</B></Member> I understand the noble
Baroness’s concerns, and indeed this is one of the issues that
the Minister for Immigration is considering. However, perhaps I may put
into perspective what the April 2012 reforms require. The control of
the scheme is itself one of the protections in place. Previously there
was a five-year period, and a six-month period obviously enables us to
discipline that particular application so much better. We require
evidence of an existing employer-employee relationship and 12 months of
overseas employment before the visa application can be made. We also
require that written terms of condition of employment accompany that
visa application and are produced with it. Employees are still entitled
to the protections in UK employment law, and they are provided with a
letter in a number of languages setting out their rights under the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:11:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Smith of Basildon" PimsId="5786" UID="13070440000417" xid="2058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000417">Baroness
Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, nobody wants to see the visa
system abused. However, I am confident that the Government do not think
it is right that anybody working in this country should be made more
vulnerable to slavery or physical, sexual or mental abuse, with
effectively no power to take action to protect themselves, as we heard
from<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:11:38"></hs_TimeCode> the noble
Lord, Lord Hylton. Will the noble Lord consider, in the meeting that he
will shortly have with Mark Harper MP, what action the Government will
take to ensure that those who are responsible for such crimes will be
brought to justice, and not allowed to get away with it by deporting

trafficking laws in this country is subject to the full force of the
criminal law. Given that individuals have already worked for their

of abuse of such people, most often Filipinos, by the embassies of
certain nations which we need not

diplomatic immunity, and they abuse those people, Filipinos in

of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Human Trafficking. One of the
great problems is that if these women who have been

sent home and may be re-trafficked. The Government need to

these people are not casually trafficked. They must be in the
employment of the employer for 12 months before they come to this
country. It is designed for people accompanying overseas visitors, who
I think this country seeks to encourage. However, I do not think that
the scenario that the noble and learned Baroness points out actually
exists. There is the national referral mechanism. Any information on

Does he also accept that the key to regeneration is infrastructure
investment, particularly to stimulate local economies? Why was it then
that, in the review last week, while Scotland and Northern Ireland
received an increase of 2.7% and 1.5% respectively in their capital
DELs—departmental expenditure limits—Wales received a
paltry 0.3%? As Anglesey has had the lowest GVA per head of any county
in the United Kingdom during the past decade, will the Government now
find capital funding for a much needed new road bridge over the Menai

stimulate economic development on the

Government’s capital budget for 2015-16 will increase by 0.3% in
real terms, but that is only part of the story in terms of government
capital expenditure in Wales. As he knows, south Wales is set to

the impact of the comprehensive spending review on Wales could have

cap and VAT, the next figures on the tax cap will be coming out in

collecting previously uncollected taxes from a range of sources and, as

like to know that within Public Health England itself there are almost

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend the Minister
for that reply. What conversations are the Government having with the
Republic of Ireland to prevent footloose and stateless subsidiaries
paying derisory levels of corporation tax in its domain? I come back to
my fundamental question. Is it right that my wife’s small
printing business last year paid its full dues of £22,000 of

billion, paid absolutely
nothing?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13070440000463" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000463">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord raises an important point.
Eighty-four per cent of Apple’s non-US operating income was
booked by an Irish subsidiary that was not tax-resident anywhere and
paid tax at a rate of 0.05%. That is clearly unacceptable and is why
the G20 will look at the issue later this month. It will be presented
with a report from the OECD that suggests not only what action is
needed but sets deadlines for taking it and makes proposals on the
resources that are going to be needed to implement the new
rules.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000056"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Sugar" PimsId="5442" UID="13070440000464" xid="2009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000464">Lord
Sugar:</Member></B> My Lords, the issue here is one of transfer pricing
policy by foreign companies such as Apple, where, to put it simply, the
prices of their merchandise are inflated and the margins that they make
parked outside the UK. The merchandise is then sold on for virtually
cost price in our country. Will the Minister consider making an
assessment of these companies’ sales and applying a profit
margin criterion, based on industry standards? They can argue about it
afterwards, including about the disclosure of their true
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000057"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13070440000465" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000465">Lord

is looking at currently. Along with the French and the Germans, we have
made a significant financial contribution in terms of getting experts
working on this. There are a number of ways of dealing with it. The

Flight:</Member></B> Pertinent to the last question, some 20 years ago
when transfer payments were introduced, I acted for the company that I
was running in discussing with the Inland Revenue, as it was at the
time, how they would operate. The arrangements were not based on legal
matters, but on commercial reality. We went through each area of
activity to see what was going on where and what would be a fair
allocation of costs, revenues and profits. I cannot understand why
transfer payments are not operated thus today. Will the Minister say
whether we are operating transfer payment regimes in the way that they
were intended and started 20 years
ago?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000059"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13070440000467" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000467">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> There is considerable scope for HMRC to undertake
the kind of discussions that the noble Lord describes. The additional
resources that we put into compliance have been spent in no small
measure dealing with exactly that. The amount of revenue that we have

<?notus-xml column=1322?>of billions, but this does not deal with problems such as the
ones that my noble friend Lord Teverson has

Woolf:</Member></B> My Lords, 40 years ago I was junior counsel to the
Inland Revenue for a time. At that time, I and the Inland Revenue
understood the legal position to be that every taxpayer had the right
to arrange their affairs to reduce their liability for tax. I
understand from what the Minister has already said that it is proposed
to reconsider that situation. So be it. However, until it is changed,
does the Minister agree that the principle that I have just enunciated
is still a good principle of law and one to which the Inland Revenue
still has to have
regard?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="13070440000469" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000469">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree that it is a good principle, but
the problem we face at the moment is that large multinationals are able
to order their affairs so that in some cases they end up paying
virtually no tax, or nothing that is proportionate to the tax regime in
any major country.</hs_para>

Tunnicliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government’s rhetoric on
this subject is good, but we need an action plan to follow up that
rhetoric. The Minister spoke about the OECD’s efforts, but what
specific efforts are the UK Government putting into this problem? What
additional resources will they be putting in and how do those
additional resources sit alongside the 5% cut for HMRC in the CSR? Why
did the Government resist the amendment in the other place calling on
the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report on the progress on this
important issue within six months? The abuse by these companies is
expensive to HMG and an insult to the public. To get something done, we

that we would all agree with every word that the noble Baroness said,
particularly in respect of a return to civilian democratic government
as soon as possible. One of the problems in the last election in Egypt
was that there were two sectarian non-liberal parties standing for
election as opposed to 40 secular liberal parties. Of course, Her
Majesty’s Government cannot intervene directly, but is it
possible for them to encourage agencies that already work with the
Department for International Development on these issues, such as the
Westminster Foundation for Democracy, to advise and mentor the
profusion of secular liberal parties in Egypt in order to provide
effective party organisation, which is so necessary in any democratic
society?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000067"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="13070440000476" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000476">Baroness

incredibly cautious about intervening in a way where we are trying to
affect the outcome of elections in any country, but I take the noble
Baroness’s point about working with parties in preparation for
an election. Indeed, that is what we have been doing through the Arab
partnership fund. I know from my experience when I was in Egypt that
the opposition appeared to be fractured, but the current situation is
much more complicated. The National Salvation Front, the Tamarod, the
main group that has been calling for the protests against President
Morsi that have resulted in the current situation, has secular parties
in it, but alongside the Defence Minister yesterday when the
announcement was made that President Morsi would be removed was the
Sheikh al-Azhar and the head of the Coptic Church. This is not just a
pure fight between secularists and parties that feel that religion
should be part of the state. It is much more complex than that. We are
urging all parties to go back to a democratic process. Military
intervention is not the way forward.</hs_para>

It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:41:27"></hs_TimeCode> is important
that we understand that, although some of the concerns that were being
raised by the opposition were of course right in terms of progress on
the economy and progress on inclusivity, concerns were also raised that
President Morsi was seen as being too close to the US and too close to
the Qataris—partners, of course, with whom we work incredibly
closely. That is why it is important to go back to saying that military
intervention to deal with disputes is not the way forward in Egypt.

It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:44:31"></hs_TimeCode> is important,
however, that we also take into account the will of the Egyptian

us hundreds of years to come to the conclusions and deal with the
issues to which he refers and there were long and bloody disputes over
the role of the church and the role of the state. These are discussions
that are taking place in Egypt and, of course, across the Middle East
and north Africa. We now require strategic patience. We must allow this
process to take place. Of course, there will be many bumps along the
way, but it is important that all parties are allowed to take part in
any future democratic process. That is why, among other things, we have
this morning called on the authorities to free any Muslim Brotherhood
senior figures; it is important that they, too, can take part in any

Egypt would be completely inappropriate and incorrect. We need to be
patient. We need to understand the situation on the ground. We need to
see how things play out over the next 24 to 48 hours. Of course, we
have our ambassador and officials on the ground who are looking at
this, but it is important that we play a supportive and helpful role
rather than being seen to be leading an agenda that clearly must be led

Lords present need no persuading that education is one of the most
important responsibilities of any Government. One of its key objectives
must be  to equip young people with the knowledge and
skills  to make them employable in a rapidly changing and
increasingly complex labour market. The possession of these skills has
never been more important than it is today. People without them can
face a future with little prospect of improving their lives and
realising their aspirations. In his most recent Ofsted report, the

that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13070440000359" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000359">“a

passes at grades A to C. In 2012, the figure was over 80%, with 59% of
pupils attaining grades A* to C in five subjects, including the
absolutely essential maths and English. The development of academies by
the previous Government and this one, building on the principle of GM
schools established by the Government before that, has opened up the
school system to new ideas and the very welcome involvement of business
and the voluntary sector in school governance. Increased autonomy for
heads has encouraged innovation and is helping to drive up standards.
In March this year, three-quarters of schools inspected were found to
be good or outstanding. The relentless emphasis on standards 
<?notus-xml column=1328?>from Government and from Sir Michael Wilshaw leaves the system in no
doubt about what is expected of it.</hs_para>

there is more, much more, to do, as the most recent Ofsted report,
<I>Access and Achievement</I>, published on 20 June, makes clear. I
said that the chief inspector’s use of the word
“equitable” was of key importance. That is because in the
UK children from the highest social class groups are three times more
likely to go to university than those from the lowest social groups;
and fewer than one in five degree entrants to the Russell group of
universities—the major research universities—come from
the four class groups that make up half the UK’s population.
This gap needs to be closed, for the clear economic reason that in an
increasingly competitive world we cannot as a nation afford to waste
the potential of any of our citizens, not to mention the obvious social
and moral reasons. Indeed, in the same report, while pointing out the
success of school improvement initiatives such as City Challenge in
urban areas, notably in London, Sir Michael highlights
significant underachievement in some suburban areas, and from my
perspective—which has always been a rural one—very
significantly, also in some isolated rural and seaside areas. Here, the
effects of isolation, deprivation of access and low expectation have
been ignored by metropolitan thinking and policy-makers for far too
long.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000085">I do not

may want to take issue with the robust and tough approach of the chief
inspector. I will leave his view floating in the air for coming
speakers. However, what is beyond argument is the importance of
early-years education. Gaps in achievement are clearly established by
the time children reach the age of five. The home learning environment
is of great importance, but so is the quality of early-years
professionals. That quality, too, can make a difference to
children’s life chances. There has been an impressive
improvement over the past three years in the standard of early-years
provision. There needs to be more of it, and more effective targeting
to help the most disadvantaged. The Government’s current
programme is providing good-quality, part-time early education to 40%
of the most needy two year-olds, alongside parenting support. That is
pointing the way. There are good initiatives such as Books for Babies
and Play and Learning Strategies. In this area the Government have made
good progress and are set to make
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000087">Another
area where there has been marked progress is in access to higher
education. Successive Governments, including the present one, have
given strong encouragement to universities to improve their outreach
arrangements. The result today is that almost 50% of people up to the
age of 30 are, or are becoming, 
<?notus-xml column=1329?>graduates, compared with around 37% in 1997. Given the importance of
graduate status for employment, as well as for
people’s aspirations, that is a great
advance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000088">It
might surprise some noble Lords to learn of the progress made by my own
university, Oxford, so frequently is it demonised by the
media—and in the past by some politicians—as being
elitist. Oxford now offers the most generous financial support of any
university in the country to the poorest students. One in 10 of its
United Kingdom undergraduates is from the lowest income band: that is,
£16,000 a year or less. State school admissions to Oxford are in
the majority. It holds more than 2,000 outreach events every year. It
has appointed outreach staff for every county and city in the UK. Their
job is to focus on schools with the smallest numbers of students going
to Oxford. Interestingly, anecdotal evidence from some schools shows
that teachers are sometimes depressing the aspirations of children who
wish to go to Oxford or Cambridge. That of course is unacceptable, but
at least we know about it. The work at Oxford extends to successful
partnerships with individual schools, down to primary school level, and
intensive work with teachers. Oxford’s successful summer schools
have seen more than two-thirds of all participants applying to Oxford,
with a success rate of double the average of all
applicants.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000089">However,
if 50% of people can now look to graduate status to realise their
aspirations, it means that 50% cannot. From 2015, all young people will
be required to participate in learning until the age of 18. This is
creeping up on us. It is not a raising of the school leaving age but a
change in the required participation age. These young people will have
to choose between a school or college sixth form, possibly—if
they are very fortunate—a university training college or studio
school, an FE college or an
apprenticeship.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000090">The
Wolf review of 2011 identified a number of problems with the routes
open to these young people. In the first place there is the most
confusing mix possible of qualifications, identified by acronyms. Their

exist. Far too many FE courses offer no help with poor English or maths
skills, the very ones most required by
employers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T11:59:49"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are perverse incentives for providers to recruit for the courses that

are not enough apprenticeships, of course, and much of the teaching in
FE colleges has been found by Ofsted to be poor. In response, the
Government have promised to create a further education commissioner
with wide-ranging powers. I think my noble friend will be able to
update us on that. Indeed, this person may already have been appointed.
In any case, it is an extremely welcome move. The Government have also
given much more attention to the importance of apprenticeships.
However, the underlying problem is still employer
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T12:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>. Most of
the new apprenticeships have gone to people over 25, which was not the
point. The Government could well consider creating more apprenticeships
within government departments to set an example. Meanwhile, they might
pay closer attention

second best. In all these areas, so vital to helping young people to
prepare for the world of work and to realise their aspirations, there

am sure that my noble friend will have been waiting for the
“but”, and it has come—there is one area, that of
careers advice and guidance, where, in my view, policy has gone
backwards. I personally find it more than obvious that, at a time when
there is high youth unemployment, when the statutory participation age
is being raised to 18, when the education and training routes between
16 and 19 are multiple and their outcomes are far from clear, and when
we need to encourage aspiration and not muddle it, there is an urgent
need to help young people to make the right choices. I find it hard to
believe that the link between aspirations raised by improved
educational standards and the need for unwasteful career choice appears
to be ignored by the Government. According to the Government’s
own National Careers Service, the cost to the economy of young people
making wrong choices amounts to some £28 billion. That same
National Careers Service revealed last week that only 1% of teenagers
had actually used its helpline. Instead, the Government have chosen to
transfer responsibility for careers guidance to schools, but without
funding and apparently without statutory accountability. The young
people worst affected by this move are inevitably, as always, the most
disadvantaged.</hs_para>

one wants a remote, state-run monolith to do this work. There is good
practice in some schools and colleges. They are well placed to help,
although only one in six increased its work in this area last year.
There is excellent input from the voluntary sector—for example,
Career Academies UK, the Prince’s Trust and Barnardo’s,
which perceive the need—and, of course, from employers
themselves, from academy chains and from other consortium arrangements.
However, for the young people the result is random, and that is not
good enough. At the very least, the Government should empower Ofsted to
inspect all schools for statutory compliance in their careers work,
thus ensuring transparency and accountability for a vital public
service. I look forward to my noble friend’s response on this
issue because, although it would be a small move, it would be a start.
Without it, and despite the excellent progress in so many other policy
areas, we risk stifling the very aspirations on which the future of our
country
depends.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/701B8EE8F2579F179A53B6ACB66C456EE90C7FD4" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 July 2013">Thursday,

employers think that there is a problem. Why is there this problem? As
the noble Baroness, Lady Shephard, said, the problem begins early and
is compounded as a child grows. I go back to the recent UNICEF report
card on child well-being, with its comparative data across 29 of the
world’s richest countries. The UK does not do well in these
comparisons. On well-being, we come 16th and across the other
dimensions of material well-being, health and safety and education, we
come 24th out of 29. Performance on other measures is recorded, such as
that on behaviours and risk—for example, obesity, bullying,
drugs and alcohol and housing and environment. Our record on young
people not in education is simply appalling. We are the only developed
country in which the further education rate is below 75%. We come just
above Cyprus and Malta. The report notes that this may be the result of
an emphasis on academic qualifications combined with a diverse system

I inevitably say that personal, social and health education in schools

following factors contribute to personal, social and health education
in schools: courses which support and protect children, like
anti-bullying; gatherings which inspire young people to feel part of a
community, like school assemblies; a curriculum which recognises that
children are individuals who grow and change and which provides
opportunities to discuss, at an appropriate age, sexuality and
relationships, resistance to dangerous pressures such as grooming and
internet hazards, healthy eating, safety and what being a good citizen
means. Children need opportunities to develop the skills of empathy in
personal relationships, self-respect and respect for others. They need
opportunities to enjoy physical activity, drama and other arts. Some
information will, of course, be gained across the formal curriculum.
Some may be in assemblies, inspired by positive role models. Some may
be inputs from the school nurse, first aid organisations, national and
local politicians, sports men and women, drama groups and so

report on personal, social and health education. I suggest that schools
where PSHE is not organised will be schools where children, and
particularly vulnerable children, may end up without those important
soft skills. As I said earlier, children who are at risk of being
unemployed are also vulnerable to joining gangs and be less likely to
form healthy relationships or conduct healthy lifestyles. Nor should it

when surveyed, say repeatedly that young people leaving full-time
education—whether at 16, 18 or after a first degree—often
lack employability skills and a real understanding of the world of work
and how they must adapt and learn to succeed. In June, John Cridland,
the director-general of the CBI, said that the quality of careers
guidance is not good enough and that many young people leave school or
college with little knowledge of the workplace. He warned that the

right to schools to run their own careers advice. Careers information,
advice and guidance—which I will shorten to IAG—are
critical to inform and guide young people and their families about the
opportunities for further education and work. We parents need our own
information to be updated; entering the workplace is very different to
how it was in our day. I shall focus principally on IAG.</hs_parafo>

present system is failing too many young people. Eighteen months ago,
the Association of Colleges surveyed 16 year-olds. Only 7% knew that
apprenticeships were a post-GCSE qualification. Less than 20% were able
to name BTECs, and only 9% could name diplomas. All these are very good
vocational routes into the world of employment. The BBC recently
reported Joshua Robinson, an apprentice at Cisco Systems, as
saying:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070440000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000349">“Apprenticeships

at a meeting of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Further
Education, Skills and Lifelong Learning, of which I am a member, we
heard from some major engineering employers about their excellent
apprenticeship schemes. We heard of a young man who had a clutch of
GCSEs at grades A and A*, and who was absolutely clear that he wanted
to do an apprenticeship at Rolls-Royce. Yet his teachers were telling
him that this was the wrong route for him and that he must go to
university. I suspect that they did not know that advanced engineering
apprenticeships have a strong progression route right through first
degrees and often into postgraduate study. I suspect that the teachers
did not know that there were 11 applicants for every apprenticeship
last year, with many, many more applying to organisations such as
Rolls-Royce, Babcock and others. Sadly, I suspect that their
aspirations for their students were to map out the same experience as
their own: A-levels and a traditional academic course at
university.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000110">The
employers yesterday were also clear that employability skills were an
issue. Some good practice existed but not enough, and they applauded
those further education colleges and universities that focused on them.
They involve exactly the skills to which the noble Baroness, Lady
Massey, referred. Communication skills are key but there are others,
including leadership and working as part of a team, which do not seem
to be taught in most schools and colleges. Employers are also often
concerned about literacy and numeracy in young employees. We alone of
the OECD countries allow young people to give up maths and/or English
if they follow an academic route such as A-levels. While our A-level
system has much to commend it, involving in-depth study of subjects, it
is possible to leave behind one of the two core subjects that every
employee will need in the 21st
century.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000111">With
the raising of the participation age in compulsory education to 18 by
2015, does the Minister agree that all students should continue with
both maths and English, whether pure or applied, or as literacy and
numeracy, until they are 18? The international baccalaureate insists
that students continue with English and maths, and there are real
benefits that young people often do not realise that they need until
later in their life at college or university, or when they start work.
It also allows pupils to utilise their broad education by bringing
creative solutions in from other disciplines to their future jobs and
apprenticeships.</hs_para>

those young people who follow vocational routes, there is a focus on
continuing with literacy and numeracy, and I am sure that this is
right. However, I suspect we need new courses that are particularly
relevant for the 
<?notus-xml column=1335?>industry that they are going into, such as English for engineers or
statistics for humanities students, that will give them the skills they
need. The key message to students must be that the lower your skills
level, the more chance there is that you will be out of work. Recent
youth unemployment statistics show that a quarter are without five good
GCSEs, 14% have good GCSEs but no further qualifications, and 8% have a
degree. That could not be clearer: the higher your qualification, the
less likely it is that you will be unemployed.</hs_para>

many young people, the best route into work is through an
apprenticeship. This Government have created over 1.2 million new
apprentices, and we need more employers to come on board and develop
apprenticeships. There are some excellent examples of employers working
in schools with both pupils and teachers, and it is evident that where
it happens, everyone benefits. I believe that this should start in
primary school, and I am grateful to the Government for starting IAG at
13, but business link days for 10 and 11 year-olds give children the
chance to design things, to create marketing ideas and to test out
experiments which can fire their imaginations and move them away from
the all too common aspiration of being a footballer or, even worse, a
footballer’s wife. It is also important to ensure that pupils
follow the right courses at the right levels. The engineering employers
we spoke to yesterday all commented that the lower level maths GCSE
exam at grade C does not provide a starting point for engineering
apprentices at 16, so pupils who want to go into engineering, and their
teachers, should push to do the higher level exam as a
minimum.</hs_para>

need to see if the new arrangements for careers advice in schools are
working, and I suspect that this will be a common theme of the debate.
Many concerns were raised in your Lordships’ House during the
passage of the Education Act 2011, not least the move away from
face-to-face advice for most young people. Can the Minister tell us
when a detailed review is planned and what the Government will do to
ensure that young people get access to information? That is because we
are still hearing about examples of schools refusing—and I do
mean refusing—to allow brochures from local FE colleges or
employers offering apprenticeships into their schools. How on earth can
our young people and their families come to an informed decision about
progression routes if they do not know about them? What action will the
Department for Education take with schools where this practice
persists<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T12:22:35"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Council report, <I>An Aspirational Nation: Creating a culture</I>
<I>change in careers provision</I>, provides an excellent perspective
on how we can improve IAG for our young people, and asks for the role
of Ofsted when reporting on IAG in schools to be strengthened. Can I
ask the Minister if he supports this specific proposal, as well as the
report more widely? Careers advisers are themselves coming together for
accreditation and for continuing professional development, which is to
be commended. We must not hamstring them by reducing the scope of their
advice because of the actions of some schools. The OECD has argued
that:</hs_para>

diversify, career guidance is becoming both more important and more
challenging. More complex careers, with more options in both work and
learning, are opening up new opportunities for many people. But they
are also making decisions harder as young people face a sequence of
complex choices over a lifetime of learning and
work”.</hs_quote>

have a strategic careers service that supports young people in their
early and later decisions about subjects and levels of subjects. It
should ensure that they have access to information about all the
options open to them, not just about progression in their current
school’s sixth form. Pupils should leave school, college or
university with a good, broad range of qualifications and skills that
will make them not just employable, but able to achieve their
aspirations and ambitions for their
lives.</hs_parafo></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/A2B3D1388B35550A60A8CB900456FB28522C3EBB" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 July 2013">Thursday,

Norton of Louth:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble
friend Lady Shephard on initiating this debate. I very much commend her
for the way in which the Motion is drawn—the emphasis on
aspiration is crucial. I declare an interest as professor of government
at the University of Hull. That interest is relevant to what I want to
say.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070440000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000117">The
focus on preparing young people for work tends to be on those in the 16
to 19 age range or younger, and especially those not in education or
employment. I will look at a different body of young people, those in
higher education, but the points I wish to make have a wider
application.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070440000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000118">As we have already
heard, employers variously complain that students are not well prepared
for the world of work and that they lack requisite skills and
understanding. When students are in higher education, they may expect
to gain jobs but, especially for those who may be the first generation
in higher education, they may not always appreciate the range of career
opportunities available to them.</hs_para>

addressing both these dimensions is through ensuring that students have
some opportunity for experience-based learning. Enabling students to
gain some experience in the workplace, as an intrinsic part of their
studies and not simply an add-on, can enhance their skills and widen
their opportunities. It has been recognised for some time that
experience-based learning enhances opportunities for students.
Increasingly, universities and other bodies are arranging placements
for their students with firms, public bodies and other
institutions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070440000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000120">I have been arranging
placements at Westminster for a quarter of century. I run a four-year
degree at Hull where the third year is spent on placement in
Parliament, and we also now provide opportunities for one-semester
placements for our students taking three-year single honours degrees in
the department. The experience of being in Westminster has enormous
value for students. In the time available, I want to draw out the
benefits of such experience-based learning and at the same time
identify what needs to be done to maximise the benefit of such
experience for the student. The principal but not only benefits of such
experience-based learning are threefold.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1337?><hs_para UID="13070440000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000121">First, and this is very
relevant to what we have already heard, students acquire practical and
transferable skills. Research shows that not all employers seek the
same attributes but what students acquire through placements are highly
transferable skills. I know this not only from observation but from a
funded study undertaken of our students in the 2004-05 academic year.
The vast majority of students identified a number of skills acquired or
honed as a result of a placement, including time management and
interpersonal skills. Having to deal with a range of
people—irate constituents, senior officials or some people who
may have a sense of their own importance—is great training for
later in life. Indeed, the students acquire the very skills identified
by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of
Darwen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000122">The
second value is pedagogic. Where students are placed not just to get
some work experience but are placed in a work environment of interest
to them, they get to learn about the institution and the process. They
may begin to develop their analytic skills—understanding why
things work as they do. As I shall explain, there are challenges in
achieving this
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000123">The
third benefit is that of personal development. Of the students
surveyed, 87% felt that the principal thing they gained from the
placement was self-confidence. Where students are given responsibility,
it enhances their self-esteem and their capacity to look after
themselves. They no longer feel dependent on others; they are able to
act in a more independent manner. There is a particular consequence
that flows from this. It widens their horizons. It makes them aware not
only of career opportunities that they may not have considered but it
gives them the confidence to apply for jobs that otherwise they may not
have contemplated. That is why I welcomed the wording in my noble
friend’s Motion. The reference to aspiration is so
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000124">The
generalisations I have made are not confined to work experience
placements of the sort for which I am responsible. The benefits can be
achieved from a wide range of work-based opportunities. They can be
life-transforming, especially for those from backgrounds where the
perception of career opportunities may be narrow. The more we can do to
ensure that such opportunities are made available to young people, the
better. However, experience-based learning does not fulfil its full
potential unless it is taken seriously by those arranging the
placements. It is not a quick fix or a cheap option. To be effective it
must be taken seriously, not only by those offering the placements but
also by the home body arranging them. As one study of work experience
in higher education
observed:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13070440000351" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000351">“The
quality of work experience is greatly enhanced by prior induction and

should not simply send a student off to a placement, in effect waving
them goodbye and welcoming them back when it is completed. One has to
prepare them for the placement and provide them with support during it.
On my degree I emphasise what I characterise as the three Is:
induction, integration and investment. I am responsible for an
induction process leading up to and including the placement, ensuring
that students are prepared and know what to expect from the experience.
The degree is integrated: students spend a year studying the
institution before taking up a placement, and continue to study while
on placement. They also draw 
<?notus-xml column=1338?>on their experience when they return and apply their knowledge of
Westminster in a global context, and in completing a dissertation. The
students receive support from the university while on placement. It is
an investment, not only by the university but more especially by the
students. The more they put into the experience, the more they get out
of
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000126">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T12:39:30"></hs_TimeCode>
result is that students not only get good degrees, but they also tend
to get the jobs to which they aspire. In the case of my students, that
often means taking up posts in Westminster and Whitehall. However, as I
emphasised, these points are not confined to this particular placement
opportunity. I believe that much if not all of what I said applies
generally to experience-based learning. It is a means of changing, and
indeed transforming, the opportunities and aspirations of young people,
whether through a short placement with a local employer or a particular
institution or something of a much more long-term
nature<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T12:31:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000127">The
more we can do to ensure that schools, colleges, universities and other
bodies that serve the needs of young people develop and offer such
opportunities, the better for young people and for generating a more
effective and contented workforce. The benefits are clearly enormous,
but achieving them requires a commitment of resources and planning.
However, that commitment can be enormously
rewarding.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/364E0FEEC3824CA1DB94BB86428905989F2005B6" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 July 2013">Thursday,

we find ourselves in a Westminster bubble, where we seem to be out of
touch with many of our people. New regulations might mean that those in
the other place can increase their allowances substantially. Imagine
how somebody who is going to lose their home, or is unable to buy food

under these regulations some will get richer while they get poorer.
Think of young unemployed Britons and their anxiety as they post

Eccles:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow my
noble friend, but I am afraid that I am going to come rather closer to
ground level than he was. I have one reflection on Germany: if it was
not in the euro and went back to the deutschmark, a Volkswagen would
cost 25% more than it does
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000140">I have
one other reflection. My noble friend Lady Shephard mentioned that
people get where they get by random processes. I am in that club: I got
here twice, both times by a random process. We should not discount the
ways in which people arrive at some destinations by random processes.
Of course, we are all to a greater or lesser extent creatures of our
own experience—a point I shall come back to in a number of
ways.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000141">Different
people take different lengths of time to grow up. When we refer to
young people, we need to remember that education does not stop at 18 or
21. Higher degrees can be gained by people who are much older than
that, having found out on the journey who they are, what they are
capable of doing and what they are not capable of doing. We have, quite
correctly, mentioned aspirations in this debate. At some point, of
course, it is always possible to have too many aspirations while, at
another point, it is possible to have too few. What we are really
seeking is reality. We 
<?notus-xml column=1341?>are trying to find out, as we go through the journey, where we really
want to be and where we are capable of
being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000142">To
illustrate that, I would like to talk about the foundry industry and
will do so in some detail. My noble friend will be pleased to hear that
I was introduced to the foundry industry by work experience. When I was
18, I worked for a number of weeks in Ford’s cylinder block
foundry in Dagenham. Most of the people who lived in that part of east
London and worked in the cylinder block foundry were of Irish
extraction. They were able to make sure that nearly everybody in the
foundry shop was of Irish extraction as they had their own methods of
creating a community. It was a fantastic experience—I shall not
go into it in any detail—but I finally hung up my steel-tipped
foundry boots 54 years later, having been continuously involved in the
foundry industry in one way or another throughout that
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000143">The
foundry industry is a very old industry—one thinks of bronzes
from China or Benin in west Africa—and it is never going to go
away. It is a method of making complicated shapes in different metals
which cannot yet be superseded—there may be this 3D,
building-up-in-layers process, but not yet. It is not a big industry in
this country: there are 20,000 people involved in it, in 400 foundries,
which make half a million tonnes of castings a year. In this latest
recession, not one single foundry of any note has had to close down,
which is in contrast to the way that things were happening in the
middle of my foundry career. This is an industry which is quite small,
quite specialist and absolutely necessary. Every single motor car has
castings in it. There are many other things that have to have castings
in them, but every single motor car does. That demonstrates the
necessity of the
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000144">The
question is how anybody arrives in the industry and how they can be
prepared for a career in it. I shall briefly tell your Lordships about
a foundry with 250 people in it making steel castings. The
shifts were days, not days and nights. The first person got to the
foundry at 6 am to get the furnaces going; the last person would leave
between 6 pm and 7 pm. Once the hot metal came down, there was no
stopping for tea breaks; it was a continuous process. Despite that,
they all had tea and were very ingenious at keeping it hot. There are
plenty of places in a foundry where you can keep your tea
hot.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070440000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000145">The work
was relatively dangerous. It could not have been done without a
workforce who really knew what they needed to do and did not have to be
told anything. I do not exaggerate. Only when something went wrong were
the managers, who were all foremen and charge hands in those days,
involved. The interdependence of that workforce, the discipline and the
willingness to be sure that they were looking after each other were
absolutely vital. Who would prepare a young person for that sort of
disciplined existence? Clearly, if you are on a small team and somebody
does not turn out, it is pretty
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000146">There
has been a lot of talk about schools, and I shall talk about them, but
I do not see how you get round the idea that some sort of
self-discipline and a willingness to be interdependent has to start in
the 
<?notus-xml column=1342?>home. If it does not, I do not know that you are doing too well.
Anything else is a substitute, because, however you look at the way in
which people grow up, the home is more important than the school. Okay,
sometimes, the school becomes a substitute in some sense but in the
foundry industry—it may be different today—the schools
were not much help. They did not like foundries. Good Lord, if you
invited schoolteachers into foundries, they would go out saying,
“For goodness sake, don’t go in there. It’s hot
and it’s dirty, and the men look pretty rough to me”. The
lads in the foundry did but, of course, they arrived in one set of
clothes and then changed into their foundry clothes. When they went
home again, having had a shower in the foundry showers, they were very
different and could do well in the pub more or less straightaway. There
is a thing about conformism and expectations among the academic
community, and I do not think we have got that right yet. We need a
much broader acceptance of difference and diversity, and of people
getting careers and satisfaction in places which school teachers, on
the whole, do not know about and do not
like.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000147">If the
careers system is not working in favour of foundries, another way is
that of community and shared experience. I remember well the office
manager, George Warner, coming to me and saying, “There’s
a woman and a boy in your office and they want to talk to you”.
She said to me, “This is William and he’s useless.
He’s 16 and he doesn’t know what he wants to do. He
won’t make up his mind about anything, but as you know my
uncle”—she had family in the foundry—“will
you give him a job?”. We had a bit of a conversation and we gave
him a
job.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000148">Again,
there is a whole raft of things about having too few aspirations. Who
is going to solve them? It is not going to be central government nor,
in my view,  is it going to be academic institutions on their
own. There has to be some willingness within a community and a society
to look and see how we solve this and give people opportunities and
back-to-work experience again.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070440000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000149">The other thing that
has happened in the foundry industry, alongside discipline, is the
amazing sophistication of the technology. The materials technology
during the time that I have been involved—I am now only an
observer—has been quite amazing. The equipment technology has
also been quite amazing. For example, in automotive casting foundries,
you will find a machine called a Disamatic, which is made in Denmark.
The guys on that machine are individually responsible for about
£200,000 of capital equipment. It is very unlikely that they are
graduates; I do not know that we would actually find it very
satisfactory to employ graduates on a
Disamatic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000150">As
you increase the sophistication of a foundry, the cost of capital is no
higher in the United Kingdom than it is in China—arguably, it
can in fact be lower. Therefore, the greater the extent to which you
can make the mix of your assets more capital and less labour, the more
competitive you are. This operates in two directions: it means that
western economies can remain competitive but also that the number of
jobs available will not increase and is quite likely to go down. It
also means that the people in that foundry 
<?notus-xml column=1343?>have to be, on average, better educated and more willing to accept the
disciplines of a continuous process. That is a big
challenge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000151">One
must not forget that the guys on the Disamatic also need manual skills.
This is not something that central government can solve in any way. I
am happy to say that another college has been set up just to look at
foundries. My final message is that we should be much more open-minded,
reject conformism and stereotypes, and actually go and look at the
details of what people can do and how they can get a very satisfactory
career out of it if they find their way into the foundry
industry.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/849ECDA44D9CE371EA035DBEFC5C928ADEB56A36" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 July 2013">Thursday,

my noble friend Lady Shephard, not only on introducing the debate, but
on the wise and firm manner in which she spoke. There is no one who is
better at admonishing people with charm than my noble friend. I hope

never forget when I talked to my honourable friend about some problems
in my constituency, and head teachers having various difficulties. She
said, “Bring them to see me”. I took half a dozen heads
from the South Staffordshire constituency, who were completely bowled
over when I said they were going to see the Secretary of State, and we
went and had what was, for me, an unprecedented experience because she
actually saw us on time. Ministers rarely do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000154">Today my
noble friend has given us an exemplary lead in what she said in her
speech, and I would like to take up some of the points that she made.
However, I would like to begin by saying that, as the noble Baroness,
Lady Massey, was kind enough to refer to the debate that we had last
week on citizenship, I think that this debate is in many ways
complementary to that one. I just hope that the Minister will be able
to give a slightly more positive response to this debate than he felt
able to give last
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000155">One of
the things that I will major on, following the noble Baroness, Lady
Brinton, is careers guidance in schools. This is absolutely crucial. It
is a sort of add-on extra in many schools, and it should not be. The
present Secretary of State is very good at telling people what he
thinks should happen, and I think that he is a most excellent Secretary
of State, but I believe that there should be a requirement for every
secondary school to have not only a careers staff but a careers panel
drawn from the local community. There would be industrialists relevant
to the industry of the area, maybe a foundry, or farmers if it was in a
rural area and, obviously, professional men and women. It would be a
group of people who really knew what they were talking
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000156">I
believe that it would also be sensible if, during the final year or two
of their course, every pupil had the opportunity to go and see how a
farm works, perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=1344?>how a foundry works, or how a solicitor’s office operates. If
they not only had the work experience—which is very important
indeed, and my noble friend Lord Norton does it absolutely
brilliantly—but had also seen how other places work, they would
have a breadth of knowledge when they came to make the choice. They
would also have something to aspire to. I really believe that the
careers service in schools in our country leaves a great deal to be
desired.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000157">The
other point that I would like to develop is this: in her speech the
noble Baroness, Lady Massey, talked about apprenticeships, a subject
which was echoed very eloquently by my noble friend Lady Brinton. There
is still an unfortunate attitude, and I choose my words carefully,
adopted towards those who work with their hands as though it is second
best. There is almost a looking-down on the vocational aspect of the
technical school or college. Frankly, I think that was compounded by
the, in my view, misguided decision to make all polytechnics
universities. They were different institutions that called for
different talents, and they provided different opportunities. It is not
a failure if a young man or woman does not go to university; it is a
failure only if that young man or woman is unable to realise the full
potential that they have within them.</hs_para>

for many years with a body called the William Morris Craft Fellowship,
of which I am chairman, and which I helped to found almost
30 years ago. Every year we give travelling fellowships to
young men and women, and I am pleased to say that many of them have
been women. They are craftsmen, builders, joiners, stonemasons,
glaziers, plumbers—we have run the whole gamut. These are young
people who have decided that they want to spend their lives repairing,
upholding and adding to our built heritage. Only last week at a
debriefing lunch in London, I was able to talk to last year’s

what we wanted to do at the beginning—where they themselves can
take charge of major projects. We have been running now for
26 years, with well over 100 fellows—once a fellow,

books, while others have taken over companies. They have achieved a

agree that current levels of unemployment for young people are simply
too high. From February to April this year, some 950,000 young people
aged between 16 and 24 suffered unemployment. When young people fail to
find work, their prospects can be bleak indeed. It is well documented
that long periods of joblessness when young translate into lower
lifetime earnings. In the worst cases, youth unemployment can inflict
lifelong scars on the individual, as well as increasing costs to the
Treasury. Indeed, the recent 
<?notus-xml column=1346?>ACEVO commission on youth unemployment found that current levels of
youth unemployment in 2012 would cost the Treasury approximately
£28 billion in the next decade

warmly welcome the strong emphasis that the coalition Government have
placed on social mobility as a central plank within their social and
economic reforms. I strongly support the Deputy Prime Minister’s
social mobility business compact to help to ensure that all young
people have fair access to job opportunities, the Government’s
commitment to deliver at least 250,000 more apprenticeships during the
spending review period and the support that they have pledged for young
people seeking work or further education and training through the youth
contract. These are positive steps, of course, but today’s
debate is an opportunity to think boldly about what more could and
should be done.</hs_para>

employers, they say that they are looking for several main things: a
good grasp of the basics, particularly English and maths; the right
attitude towards customer service; and what are sometimes

recent report from the all-party group entitled <I>Seven Key Truths
about Social Mobility</I> set out the key issues that policy should
focus on, looking at the unequal opportunities that start in the
earliest years of life and all too often persist and widen in later
life. These truths cover the importance of the early years in the home,
as we have heard today; the critical importance of education, including
both the quality of teaching and extracurricular activities; the
pivotal role of access to university; and the need for other pathways
to mobility such as apprenticeships, which we have rightly heard a lot
about today.</hs_para>

which I want to focus on, is that of character and resilience,
something that the all-party group saw as the missing link in the
chain. Character and resilience may be viewed by some as a somewhat
amorphous term, and some might choose to dismiss it as fluffy or
cosmetic soft skills. In fact, the very term “soft
skills” strikes me as something of a misnomer. Far from being
fluffy, developing character and resilience is about developing the
fundamental drive, tenacity and perseverance needed to make the most of
opportunities and succeed in life, whatever obstacles stand in the way.
It is about self-esteem, self-confidence, self-discipline, aspiration
and expectation. In everyday language, it is about believing you can
achieve, understanding the relationship between effort and reward,
sticking with the task at hand and bouncing back from the knocks life
inevitably
involves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000172">A
recent survey of evidence from the Prince’s Trust tells us that
young people from affluent backgrounds are more likely to be told by
their family that they can achieve anything and that more than one in
four young people from poorer backgrounds felt that people like them do
not succeed in life and that if they have failed an exam or been turned
down for a job they are more likely to feel that they have already
failed in life.  
<?notus-xml column=1347?>There is a growing body of evidence showing the link between developing
these social and emotional skills, and doing well, academically and in
the
workplace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000173">Research
by the IPPR indicates that social and personal skills have become 33
times more important in determining life chances, while soft skills
have become 10 times more important in determining future earnings in a
single generation. Paul Tough’s recent book, <I>How Children
Succeed</I>, which your Lordships may have seen, also illustrates the
ways in which character skills contribute to cognitive ability. In
addition, the American Nobel Prize winning economist, James Heckman,
has found that character traits are just as predictive of academic or
job success as more traditional cognitive
skills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000174">In the
light of all of this evidence the all-party group hosted the character
and resilience summit earlier this year. We heard from Alan Milburn,
chair of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission, who said
that it is not ability that is unevenly distributed, but opportunity.
That phrase has stuck with me. We heard great things about work going
on in schools—both in the state and the independent
sector—with examples of volunteering in the local community,
out-door activities that push pupils outside their comfort zone and a
wide range of imaginative extra-curricular
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000175">We
heard schools saying that developing traits such as these is now part
of their core business and that for employers, who are so relevant to
today’s debate, these less tangible skills of sticking at it,
not giving up, empathy and teamwork are precisely what they are looking
for in potential recruits. Overall, the message we heard from
academics, head teachers and employers is that whatever qualifications
you might have, where you are on the character scale will have a big
impact on what you achieve in
life.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000176">What
does this mean in practice? A recent Prince’s Trust Feedback
from the Frontline survey found that a third of young people apply for
more than 100 jobs before getting hired. With odds like this, it is all
too clear just how critical resilience is for young people entering the
world of work. In addition, recent research from the Joseph Rowntree
Foundation and York University found that when they sent off fictional
CVs that appeared to be from disadvantaged people, they fared worse
than those not from disadvantaged backgrounds. I find that scandalous,
but it demonstrates clearly how the odds are stacked against too many
of our young people. That is why I want to call on the Government to
take more account of the growing evidence surrounding the role of
character and resilience in improving social mobility and see how we
can put some of these ideas into practice.</hs_para>

have said today, international comparisons can be helpful. I was
interested in recent research by the IPPR that suggests that countries
with strong transition systems—to use the jargon—are
associated with far lower levels of youth unemployment and
disengagement. Key features of stronger systems include a wide range of
high-quality pathways into skilled jobs, such as apprenticeships, and
early exposure to the workplace through high-quality and regular work
placements. It is instructive for us to reflect, as 
<?notus-xml column=1348?>my noble friend Lord Roberts and other noble Lords have done, that
countries such as Germany which tend to have these features in their
education and training systems have been successful in lowering youth
unemployment since the economic downturn
began.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000178">I have
some more practical suggestions. The Prince’s Trust survey had
some important suggestions for what the Government should do to help
more young people, including the provision of face-to-face careers
advice for 16 to 19 year olds. That is vital and it is an area crying
out for reform. Like my noble friend Lady Brinton, who spoke so
eloquently on the subject, I would also like to ask my noble friend the
Minister whether he can say what steps the Government are taking to
improve careers advice for this age
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000179">In
response to its survey findings about the sorts of things that young
people want from programmes to help boost their self-esteem, confidence
and resilience, the Prince’s Trust has created the Team
programme. This is a 12-week personal development programme that
focuses on building resilience and encourages young people to pull
together as a group. When the programme ends, participants continue to
support each other through job clubs, some of which are completely
youth led. The Team programme has seen more than 115,000 participants
since its launch in 1990. Impressively, it boasts a 70% employment
success rate within three months of completion of the
programme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000180">We
should also look out into the community, beyond Government, to get
thoughtful advice on what more can be done to help prepare young people
for work. Last week I had the pleasure and the privilege of hearing
about the Campaign for Youth Social Action, which is led by His Royal
Highness the Prince of Wales. The campaign aims to provide a long-term
vision to drive a real change in culture toward making youth social
action, or volunteering, a universal norm. This is based on research
demonstrating that meaningful social action improves empathy and that
awareness of society around us leads to better engagement in education
and, particularly relevant today, increased employability, confidence,
problem-solving skills and resilience. I repeat the word
“resilience”, but do not apologise for the focus that I
am putting on it
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000181">The
focus of today’s debate has been on getting young people
prepared for the world of work and getting a job. But once this has
happened, if young people are to achieve their aspirations, there must
be opportunities for progression. Many employers understand this well
and ensure that progression opportunities are available. But to ensure
that progression is a reality for all young people, I strongly favour
the establishment of a national lifetime careers service, in
particular  for young people, and for adults on low wages. They
should be actively encouraged to engage with such a service and through
this be assisted to develop a career or training progression
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000182">In
conclusion, we have taken time today to reflect on the efforts being
made to prepare young people for the world of work. This debate has
clearly shown that a number of things are vital. They include improving
practical skills training and levels of English and maths attainment
and supporting the development of strong character and resilience.
These are key to ensuring 
<?notus-xml column=1349?>that all young people are able to make the most of their talents and do
well in the world of work. I urge the Government to build on the steps
that they have already taken to make a reality of this collective

reputation for trying to get the long-term unemployed into work and
staying in work, which is a key element. In its work trying to help the
long-term unemployed, it has realised that the problem is also at the

as well, which compounds the issue. It gets them together as a group
with two leaders who take them through about 12 weeks doing something
useful. It might be going off to climb a mountain or redecorating a
dilapidated old community centre, all kinds of things. The young people
work as a group and the leaders try to inculcate in them teamwork,
punctuality, reliability and initiative. At the end of those 12 weeks,
most of the young people have remained on the course. At that end of
the scale, you do get a few drop-outs, but the majority stay and most

also found that on many occasions Tomorrow’s People dealt with
people whose educational achievement was weak. It managed to get some
volunteers—I do not know how it did it—who had been
teachers to come in and teach simple English and simple arithmetic. I
sat behind a young man who was learning how to add up two columns of
figures and how to carry a figure to the next column. He was 16 or 17.
One wonders what had happened in the educational system. It had clearly
failed him, but at least this was a useful attempt to bring practical
skills and some academic skills to bear.</hs_para>

schemes led Tomorrow’s People to think that it should get those
young people before they left school and that it needed to operate in
schools. This has lead to an interesting experiment that is taking
place right now. Fourteen schools in a London borough are selecting
children of 14 or older who seem to be at real risk. Tomorrow’s
People is bringing in a Coach with a capital C—I suppose you
could say a mentor, but the expression does not matter very much. The
coach sticks with the children over a period of up to five years from
the age of 14 to the age of 18 or 19. There are one to one sessions and
group sessions. The children are taken on visits to places of work.
Then they graduate to going to workability workshops, which inculcate
the kind of soft skills that my noble friend Lady Tyler was talking
about. Tomorrow’s People then tries to get them work experience.
This scheme is apparently having considerable success. Admittedly it is
long term by the standards of most courses, and I am sure it is quite
expensive, but let us consider the expense of having those young people
for ever on benefits. When you look at it in that light, the more
remedial work that is done at an early stage, the better. It is a
reflection of what my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth was talking
about in relation to higher education. I am bringing it down to this

particularly the one in schools in Shoreditch. I do not think I
mentioned that before, but it is Shoreditch. I would be delighted if he
could find time to pay a visit and see it on the ground. Would he be
prepared at least to look at extending that kind of approach to schools
generally? It would be extremely valuable. In the end, actions speak
louder than
words.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070440000385" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000385"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:28:16"></hs_TimeCode>1.28

noble Baroness, Lady Shephard, for tabling this debate today and for
eloquently raising a number of important questions. I appreciated her
contribution. This debate has given us the opportunity to explore in
detail some very real challenges. In the course of this high-level
debate, we have come up with a range of practical and interesting
solutions to some of these challenges.</hs_para>

made the point that we had a very similar debate last week when we
debated citizenship. The debates have some common themes, because we
were looking for the need to create more rounded individuals, not just
academic achievers but active and considerate citizens with all the
skills to have successful and fulfilling lives in the broadest sense.
That is an echo that we have heard again today. We all want young
people to be ambitious—to stretch themselves and to achieve
their dreams—but at the current time it seems that the very
opposite is happening. We have youth unemployment remaining stubbornly
high at 20%, and over a million young people between the age of 16 and
24 not in education, employment or
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:29:50"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have a generation that is lost in depression and despondency. We are
losing their energy and their skills to the economy. Something is

urgently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:30:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000196">Some
of these challenges are wider than the UK. We are obviously impacted by
the global downturn. The noble Lord, Lord Roberts, spoke very
eloquently on that matter and reminded us that we have a combined
interest in having a proper international perspective. I was shocked at
the quotes he gave in that letter about how our Government Ministers
were not addressing and raising the issue of youth unemployment at an
EU level. I will be interested to hear, as that discussion goes on,
whether the Minister can give us a more positive update on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:30:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000197">We
know, for example, that there are an estimated 75 million unemployed
young people worldwide. Obviously, that figure masks countries that are
winners and losers. We want to be the best and to learn from the best
here in the UK. This is not rocket science. There are ways of creating
meaningful jobs for young people, and there are examples globally that
we can 
<?notus-xml column=1352?>learn from. We need to make sure that we take those lessons back so that

a number of noble Lords have said that we in the UK continue to have
concerns about school leavers not having the right experience. This has
been confirmed in the CBI report that was recently published, and the
point has been made by several noble Lords around the Chamber. The CBI
criticised the lack of key skills such as self-management, problem
solving and aptitude for work. These concerns were recently echoed by
the Federation of Small Businesses, which identified poor literacy,
numeracy and communication skills as a barrier to
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000199">Interestingly,
the CBI also identified a critical lack of skills in key sectors such
as manufacturing, construction and engineering, which might be the
driver for future long-term growth in the economy, where vacancies
already exist. So even where those vacancies exist we are not producing
the young people with the skills to seize those opportunities. We need
to start realigning young people’s aspirations with the types of
jobs that we know will be generated over the next two decades, many of
which will not even exist
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000200">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:39:33"></hs_TimeCode>,
I agree with my noble friend Lady Massey and the noble Baroness, Lady
Shephard, that we have to start at an early-years level. That
early-years provision is absolutely vital. Interestingly, the
Government have cut the early intervention grant by some 40 % since
2010, so they speak with mixed messages on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000201">Secondly,
education should<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:32:57"></hs_TimeCode>
be less about cramming facts and more about rounded skills that make
young people employable. Rather than learning vast amounts of technical
data, which may well be out of date by the time employment starts,
students need to demonstrate analytical and collaborative skills. They
need to learn how to speak confidently and articulate an argument, how
to listen to others, how to scrutinise established views, and how to
take an idea and work it up into a substantial, well argued piece of
coursework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:33:45"></hs_TimeCode> I spent an

demonstrate that they were articulate, confident and literate.
All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:33:57"></hs_TimeCode> the evidence
shows that these are the types of skills that employers welcome. We
know, however, that the Government’s education reforms are
having the opposite impact with their singular focus on cramming and
passing an end-of-course exam and the removal of speaking skills from
the English GCSE.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:34:18"></hs_TimeCode> have to ask
the Minister what evidence there is that employers approve of these

I echo the wide-range of criticisms of the careers service that have
been made by a number of noble Lords around the Chamber. We clearly
need to address the dire straits of the school careers service.
Regrettably<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T13:34:31"></hs_TimeCode>, all
our warnings about the dangers of moving careers advice into schools,

Commons Education Committee is devastating on this issue. It identifies
a worrying deterioration in the level of provision for young people and
highlighted concerns about the quality, independence, impartiality and
availability of careers advice. For example, the evidence from Careers
England has shown that only 16% of schools have maintained the previous
level of careers advice. Teachers report that they are pressurised to
encourage children to stay on in the sixth form regardless of their
aptitude, rather than considering wider options, as it has a positive
impact on the school budget. Surely this cannot be
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0001.htm#13070440000205">Teachers
also admit to having very little current experience of the world of
work. Indeed, some were quoted as saying that in the absence of that
they relied on giving the careers advice that they were given in school
to young people. They also overly relied on websites for advice in the
absence of that knowledge. As a result, young people are denied the
regular one to one, face to face engagement with a professional that
would help them make better career choices at an early stage of their
schooling.</hs_para>

on a career choice only to discover that they have studied the wrong
subjects to make that a reality. The Select Committee chairman
described the Government’s response that careers have been
delegated to schools and that they would not interfere as an abdication

being given urgent attention and that a provision that is fit for
purpose will be urgently introduced. I was very interested to hear the
noble Lord, Lord Cormack, say how this should be not just about
improving the professionalism of careers staff but about bringing more
careers panels into schools and having wider opportunities for young
people to make careers visits outside of school. Again, I hope the

we need to move away from the long-held belief that a degree is the
only route into well paid work. This includes challenging parents, who

too. In Austria, for example, careers education is given to both

noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, about his experience in the foundries. We
also need to develop apprenticeships in the developing sectors of IT,

make their way successfully through to the future jobs market. I very

the foundation recently organised work experience for state school
pupils with JP Morgan, Whitehall and Linklaters solicitors. They have
achieved a high take-up rate, but not without a good deal of

of our national borders and our openness to the world is an area of
policy in which the demands of the citizen can arouse the suspicions of
a libertarian. This is one of the perpetual and challenging problems of
protecting democracy. Any solutions must emerge from the reflections of
the philosopher and the imperatives of the elected politician. As a
mere observer and commentator on the political process, I seek only to
identify some issues, explore the options that are available in our
chaotic world and suggest practical decisions that need to be
taken.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000245">At no
time since 1945 has this country been as threatened by terrorism as it
is today. The threat is likely to continue and even grow during the
lifetimes of many of us in this Chamber today. During the Cold War, the
danger of conflict was both checked and mitigated by the nuclear
stalemate. Three decades of Irish terrorism were for us a local
difficulty, although certainly not a little one. Today, the world is
threatened by a conflict between the theocratic factions of
Islam—Sunni and Shia—and their complex and varied
subdivisions, such as the
Alawites.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000246">Religious
struggles can and do last for centuries, during which they wax and

of today demonstrate fragility, with maps taking on the instability of
a kaleidoscope. A cruel civil war is spreading through 
<?notus-xml column=1361?>much of the Muslim world, putting several nations in danger of
descending into the anarchy and agony of the failed state. The
factional terrorists of Islam seem to unite only in the overriding
mission of Islamist jihadists to install a worldwide caliphate under
Sharia law. An uneasy concordat between Muslims and Christians is now

virtue of democracy is its vulnerability to authoritarianism, which is

imported and home-grown. Many people arriving in Britain, including
some of those seeking asylum from persecution, bring with them their
own political, religious and cultural agendas. My premise is that if a
nation cannot defend its own border security, everything is at risk. It
is in that context that I suggest that where the survival of democracy
is at stake, the human rights of the ideal democratic state must be
subordinate, at least temporarily, to national security. The absolutes
of death are not part of life and never can be. Nor can our
democratically elected politicians put responsibility for our national

anywhere else. That is the road to

proposals that I shall make are neither dramatic nor threatening to our

intelligence services having the powers and facilities that they need
to protect us. Our deep-rooted sense of independent justice, and our
ancient system of parliamentary democracy, hold the ring against abuse,
either from inside or outside, by those powers. I have been to GCHQ and

coalition Government have, rightly, abandoned the proposals for a

even reliable means of immediate identification. Secondly, it has
historical overtones that are unacceptable. Identification numbers, and
passports for travel, are another matter. They have existed in various
forms for a very long time. Today’s technology offers far
greater efficiency. It goes without saying that the issuing of
passports must be protected by the highest security. Some years ago, my
noble friend Lady Anelay and I visited the Passport Agency. We were
able to identify serious and obvious weaknesses in the system.

absurd that the British passport authorities are unaware of what other
passports those with a British passport hold. I was warned by security

having more than one 
<?notus-xml column=1362?>passport, or multiple nationalities. However, for years I have urged the
Government to take steps to establish details of what other passports
UK passport holders have. There should be a strict obligation to
divulge full details to the British passport authorities, including a
photocopy of any other passports held. One response I have had in the
past from the Government was that people would not necessarily disclose
the fact that they had a second passport. The answer to that is simple:
anyone found to have concealed their non-British passport would be
liable to have their British passport cancelled. As a British passport
is issued under the royal prerogative, there should be no
administrative problem in doing that, although a judge could have a
part in endorsing the
decision.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000251" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000251">There
are many aspects to the visa question. However, as with nationality, it
is absurd that we should be inhibited from discriminating in favour of
certain categories of persons who should be given British nationality

requiring visas and others not. One of the silliest things I heard
recently was the Chancellor, when announcing that Mark Carney, his
nominee for Governor of the Bank of England, would take British
citizenship, emphasising that Mr Carney would of course not have any
preference or priority in his
application.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000252">Of
course there have to be fast tracks and priorities for those we want,
for example genuine businesspeople, as well as bars and vetoes on those
we do not want in our country. To deny this is egalitarianism gone mad.
Genuine students must be encouraged. They are the future trade links
for the UK. I welcome the Government’s new proposals to limit
health tourism in the NHS by non-EU nationals. We must also examine the
vulnerability of our borders to those arriving from and through Europe.
Our national interest must be paramount in formulating immigration
policies. This does not, of course, exclude us from continuing to act
as a haven for the persecuted, who are, incidentally, often obliged to
use false passports to escape from where they are coming.</hs_para>

that the processing staff who issue both passports and visas should be
of the highest integrity, and this has certainly not been the case. The
hub-and-spoke system of issuing visas from regional centres can
facilitate corruption and sacrifice quality to economy. The staff of
the border agency have not only been of inadequate calibre but have
proved to be seriously and systemically corrupt. In five years, some 30
members of Home Office staff have received heavy prison
sentences—up to nine years in one case and three, four and five
years in several others—for misconduct in public office, and the
great majority of these were from the border agency. This is so serious

March, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary announced that the
border agency, which is still not fit for purpose, is yet again to be

a grip of the show. He should be up to it, but time will tell.
Meanwhile, I would like to see some of the very able military officers
and non-commissioned officers, who are prematurely leaving our Armed
Forces because of defence cuts, recruited into the Border Force in
positions of command and control. Clearly, members of the Border Force

efficient advanced countries in the electronic protection of our

Israel and the United States. It is lamentable that, after enormous
expenditure on our e-Borders system, it is still not in sight of
completion. When there are so many people who may be intent on harming
our society and our nation, it is absurd that we do not know even
whether they are in the country. What is the point of laying down
conditions for entry that include requirements for departure, as most
visas do, when we have no way of knowing whether people who should have
left our shores have actually done so? The system will be complete only
when every entry and departure is electronically linked to an
up-to-date warning list, with records kept for as long as the security
forces think necessary. In my view, that is no threat to privacy. I

I come back to the controversial area of human rights and our national
sovereignty. In the debate on human rights on 20 June, my noble friend
Lord Faulks referred to the £1.7 million cost of litigation in
the Abu Qatada extradition case and the lack of any limit, apparently,
to what the taxpayer is expected to fund. Those who our courts have
declared a risk to our national security can at present twist and turn
at huge financial cost to the taxpayer to avoid or postpone
deportation. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, commented in that
debate on the “totally disproportionate” cost of British
advocates appearing in front of the European Court of Human Rights, who
are, apparently, “10 times more expensive” than advocates
from other jurisdictions. Resources are limited. Such costs cannot be
justified in the face of spending cuts in so many other areas. If
extradition is to continue to be subject to the European court, there
should be a fast track to that court, so that there is not endless
messing around before a case gets there. The European 
<?notus-xml column=1364?>court should itself have a fast track to deal with deportation cases.
That could save much time and money, I

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford,
for an interesting speech on such a significant issue. The relationship
between effective immigration controls and the interests of our
security—the words used in the title of his debate—is
certainly not the same as it was some years and some centuries ago. He
talked about the kaleidoscope that has twisted again, of course, just
in the past few hours.</hs_para>

wondered what security was in this context. My noble friend Lord
Alderdice tells me that in Northern Ireland during the Troubles they
used to distinguish between those involved in the Troubles and ODCs:
ordinary, decent criminals. I think that the distinction now between
organised crime and terrorism across the UK is quite blurred. As the
noble Lord has said, crime threatens security and funds terrorism.

wondered even more what was meant by a “border” in this
context; I mentioned this to the noble Lord yesterday. Our physical
border is hard enough to defend, with international aviation, a lot of
coastline, trading, parcel services and so on, but of course it is the
non-physical border and modern communications and their new challenges

House has debated cybersecurity, which the noble Lord has mentioned, on

home-grown rebellions through the ages. Disaffection may take new forms
now, although there was something very primitive about the attack in
Woolwich. Those attackers clearly felt a need to talk to the world, as

we learn from this? What are the needs which those who recruit them are
meeting? When talking about some people’s vulnerabilities
recently, particularly those of young people, I realised how those have
been exploited, how they are let down by the system, or feel that they
are, how they feel unseen and not responded to, and that we could have
been talking about grooming for sexual exploitation, gang recruitment

about their sons, and sometimes their daughters, and their
vulnerability to radicalisation and finding the language and a way to
talk to them about this. They said, although not quite in these terms,
that fathers may tend to applaud their sons as being masculine and
macho whereas mothers are much more inclined to say, “Stop and

could, of course, turn the question on its head and ask what security
we provide for migrants who are open to exploitation, but I suspect
that is not what the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, seeks from this

worth reflecting on the reasons why the United Kingdom is such a sought
after destination for immigrants. It is a commonly held view that this
country has over the centuries benefited from its immigrants: the
Huguenots, the Jews before and after the Second World War, and, more
recently, thanks to the farsighted decision of the Late Lord Carr of
Hadley, the Asians from east Africa, to name only a few. It is fair to
say that this country has been enriched by their contributions.
However, these groups’ numbers pale into insignificance when
compared with the huge numbers continuing to seek to settle in this
country, mainly from the Indian subcontinent, particularly from
Pakistan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000271">What
draws such large numbers? It is, I suggest, in part the legacy of the
empire, the shared English language, the basic familiarity with
institutions which they will have known in their home countries, the
attraction of the British way of life and the confidence that they can
reasonably expect a fair deal from British justice, with a race
relations regime that on the whole is a force for good. However, there
are problems, as my noble friend pointed out. We do not have a national
identity regime, the background of which he described very well.
However, we must face the fact that because of its absence it is
probably easier to “get lost” in the United Kingdom than
in any other country in Europe. There is also the multiplier effect.
The larger an originally immigrant community, the easier it is to hide
oneself in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:26:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000272">Many
of the immigrants are economic migrants or “health
tourists”, a subject very much in the news. However, as my noble
friend pointed out, all too many arrive with more sinister intentions.
My noble friend Lady Hamwee amplified that point. Many will have read
with horror and disgust that several of the 7/7 bombers had been
playing cricket the previous week. What better cover could they have
had? To deal with this, we have a border control regime that in the
recent past has proved not to be up to the
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:17:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000273">It
is worth remembering that in the matter of border control, this country
starts with several advantages not possessed by fellow members of the
European Union. To start with, apart from Malta and Cyprus, the UK and
Ireland are the only island members. We are not members of Schengen,
which means that we are not, at least directly, affected by the porous
links in the Schengen border chain, notably the Turkish-Greek land
border, which causes so many problems to the already beleaguered
Greeks, although I am encouraged by the steps which the EU has recently
taken to improve the policing of that border.</hs_para>

crime. The agency was faced

There are huge technological advances in this area, although in my

due to people ahead of me in the e-queue being as unfamiliar with the

as it surely does the activities of the international criminal. There
must also be a read-across to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs.

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, I also congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Marlesford, on obtaining this timely and important debate and on
his introductory speech. I suspect that we have come to the same
conclusions by slightly different routes. My personal experience with
immigration controls, and therefore with the immigration and asylum
system, began when I was appointed Chief Inspector of Prisons. When I
was made responsible for the inspection of what were then called
immigration detention centres in 1997, I was absolutely appalled by the
amount of inefficiency and waste that I found. Immigrants and
asylum-seekers were being detained for months, even years, while their
cases were allegedly examined in what I can only describe as a dilatory
manner. The process for foreign 
<?notus-xml column=1368?>national prisoners sentenced to deportation was started only after they
had completed their prison sentences. Legal arrangements for the speedy
resolution of asylum applications were totally inadequate. Detention
centres lacked detention rules and used totally inapplicable prison
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:31:54"></hs_TimeCode>. There
were many other
examples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000280">Later,
I was one of the commissioners of an independent asylum commission that
examined the whole system and reported in 2009. At the heart of our
concerns was the UK Border Agency, with its culture of disbelief, whose
word on performance figures we simply could not believe, making us
wonder quite how Ministers, deprived of actual facts, could come to
meaningful conclusions. Worryingly, appreciation of the faults in the
system was not helped by Ministers using that false UKBA evidence to
counter outside concerns about actual facts. That is one of the main
contributors to the unsatisfactory situation which the Home Secretary

resolve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>. This

interest as a member of the recently formed soft power Select
Committee, which is due to report to the House later this year or next

to protect and project the Army’s image. Our national
immigration policy should have both those same intents in mind. The
National Security Council reports on border issues every year, and I am
sure that the national security protection work of the National Crime
Agency and the Border Policing Command will come under its regular
scrutiny. The Select Committee has also learnt that the National
Security Council is responsible for the co-ordination of the projection

range of border security checks. I welcome introductions such as the
immigration and asylum biometric system. However, at that heart of all
that are people. We must be concerned about the people who use and
interpret the technology, not the technology itself. There are
currently 17 agencies working to secure our borders, which is far too
many, not least because there is a lack of clarity over who is actually

announcing the new organisation, the Home Secretary said that she was
doing this because the UK Border Agency was too big, lacked a clear
culture, lacked transparency and accountability, lacked adequate
information technology and was subject to a complex policy and legal
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000285" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000285">If
the UK is to project what the Home Secretary wants, which is a culture
of customer satisfaction among businessmen and legal visitors, it is
absolutely essential that our immigration controls are seen as being
focused on national security and are not seen by potential
international clients as an excessively bureaucratic and intimidatory
ordeal to be undergone before doing business with, studying in or
visiting this country. It is essential that the officials responsible
for such aspects as student and business visas are continually reminded
of how their attitude and efficiency rebound on our national
reputation. I have been very struck by the volume and strength of
complaint made by witnesses to our Select Committee about this. If it
results in the falling off of either business activity, which affects
our economy, or of student numbers, which affects both or economy and
our influence in the world, it could be said to be damaging our
long-term
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:37:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sure that the proposals announced by the Home Secretary have the
potential to be an improvement on what was in existence until March, I
fear that they were based on an incomplete and in-house assessment of
the main problem. True economic migration needs to be limited, as does
the abuse of student and family visas. However, every aspect of
immigration control is ultimately dictated by national security and so
the whole system, particularly if it currently includes 17 agencies,
needs to be reformed with a view to making it more accountable and
transparent.</hs_para>

constructive and worth reading. I would rather that his independence
was marked by him being a Crown official, and therefore Her
Majesty’s chief inspector, because that extra degree of
independence is always useful when dealing with myriad different
agencies. Who, for example, is responsible and accountable for the
non-circulation of and failure to act upon alerts produced by the
National Border Targeting Centre, an organisation that hopes to cover
every arrival in the United Kingdom by 2014 and which the Home Affairs

responsible for protecting the security and projecting the image of the
nation, were to institute an outside examination of the immigration
system, rather than rely on a series of in-house palliatives, to ensure
that this nation is protected and its image projected in the way we

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, I share the view
expressed by many other noble Lords that my noble friend Lord
Marlesford is owed a great debt of gratitude for allowing us to debate
this important topic. He has a great virtue: once he has got his teeth
into an issue, he does not let go. I had opportunities in another
Select Committee under his tutelage, when together we were able to work
on the chronic mismanagement of another agency, the Serious Organised
Crime Agency and its multiplicity of suspicious activity
reports—the SARs regime. My noble friend has done an admirable
job by filleting the UK Border Agency this afternoon. It is also a
pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. I serve under his
tutelage, too. He is the chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group
on prison reform, of which I am the secretary. I also serve with him on
the Select Committee on Soft Power and the UK’s Influence, which
has been in operation for a few months.</hs_para>

would impossible to go one better on either of those two distinguished
contributions, and I want to step back a little and consider the
country’s security needs in a slightly wider
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:42:03"></hs_TimeCode>. My
starting point is that mentioned by my noble friend Lord Bridgeman, the
shock that many of us felt on learning that the July bombers were not
foreign-born jihadists but native-born Britons who therefore had access
to the supposed benefits of our society—economic, educational
and cultural—and I and many other people asked ourselves: what
did this unwelcome news

that together have exacerbated tensions, sadly all-to-often present
when the sensitive but nevertheless important issue of immigration is
discussed. In my view, taken together, they carry significant
implications for the long-term security of this country. The first
issue is the scale of immigration in the first decade of this century.
Secondly, there is the potential crowding out of native-born
individuals in the economy. Please note that I used the words
“native born”, which are not alternative words for
“white”. I mean that the impact of crowding out is
equally, perhaps more, significant for recently arrived,
second-generation immigrants than it is for people who have been here
longer. Thirdly, there is the impact of the current, deep-seated
economic recession. Fourth is the way that all these together are being
exacerbated by the increasingly crowded conditions and population
density of England, particularly the south-east of
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:43:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

immigration over the post-war period between 1945 and about 2000
resulted in there being about 4 million ethnic-minority Britons, most
of whom came from post-colonial states. Since 2000, the pace has
quickened. In the years since, their number has doubled to 8 million.
To set this in historical context, it is said that if one omits the
years of the large Hugenot immigration after the revocation of the
edict of Nantes in 1465 and the impact of Irish immigration—for
much of the time Ireland was part of the United Kingdom—in each
year between 2004 and 2010 there were more immigrants to the United
Kingdom than there were in the whole period between 1066 and
1945<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:44:34"></hs_TimeCode>. There were
more immigrants in each year than there were in nine
centuries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000293">The
question that we have to ask ourselves is how quickly and successfully
can our society absorb such numbers, and what does
“absorb” mean? If they are not absorbed, what are the
possible consequences for our security? Our society rests on a delicate
balance of shared rights and responsibilities. Our welfare state in
particular rests on a generational balance. What do we ask of
immigrants? Undoubtedly, our life is enriched by their diverse
contributions, but what of our values, our beliefs and our approaches?
What are we entitled to ask, perhaps require, them to accept? There
evidence—admittedly much of it anecdotal, but equally much of it
widespread—as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Derby
mentioned in the global migration debate on 6 June, of introverted,
inward-looking communities, including schools and faith groups. These
must be breeding grounds for attitudes that do not form part of our
historic traditions and therefore present dangers to the
nation’s
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:45:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

exacerbated by the dangers of crowding out, which is well documented
among people in the lower range of wage and skills. My noble friend on
the Front Bench, with his knowledge of East Anglia, will have
first-hand knowledge of this situation in the Peterborough area.
However, there is potential crowding out higher up the scale. The
Higher Education Commission last year conducted an inquiry into
postgraduate education. My noble friend Lord Norton of Louth and the
noble Lord, Lord Boswell of Aynho, were members of the inquiry. The
report stated:</hs_para>

recent increase in postgraduate student numbers is due to rising
numbers of international students. Postgraduate enrolments have
increased by more than 200% since 1999, compared to an increase of just
18% for home and EU students. The Commission is concerned that this
increase masks stagnation in the qualification and skill level of the
home-domiciled population. We need an emphasis on up-skilling the UK
population, ensuring that British students are able to compete in the
global labour

third point. The general impact of the economic recession and the
psychological impact on young men and women of not being able to find
gainful employment, especially among first-generation arrivals, should
not be underestimated, particularly when they see the jobs they seek
being taken by
immigrants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:47:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the population continues to increase. The Office for National
Statistics has recently produced a press release covering last
year’s population 
<?notus-xml column=1372?>increase. The population of England and Wales grew by 396,900, 60% of
which was due to the excess of births over deaths but
40%—155,500—was due to international arrivals. Just to
put this figure context, this means that the population of England and
Wales is increasing by 1,084 per day. We are putting a medium-sized
village on the map of England and Wales every week. We are putting a
parliamentary constituency on the map every 10

stop at the White Cliffs of Dover. It is a ghastly, overused and
hackneyed phrase to say that we live in an ever more interconnected
world. If we do not want people to try to come here in large numbers
from that wider world, and within those large numbers there will
inevitably be some who wish this country ill, we have to find ways to
make life more tolerable for them at home. We may be feeling sorry for
ourselves about our economic plight but to the people in developing
countries, particularly those who have found development to be
difficult, the UK looks like Nirvana. Somehow, therefore, desperate
people are going to find a way to get

wider point. What these developing countries need is leadership. They
need their citizens to be trained in the skills that a modern state
requires. Yet, we see nothing perverse in setting out to recruit these
very people to come and work here. Let me give a practical example. I
am extremely pleased to see in his place the noble Lord, Lord Kakkar,
because in the debate on global migration earlier in June to which my
noble friend on the Front Bench also replied, the noble Lord, Lord
Kakkar, explained how this country is still creaming off health workers

are registered with the GMC, 160,000 of whom are the products of our 32
recognised medical schools, 25,500 of whom come from within the EU, but
67,000 of whom come from the wider world. If you do the maths, this
means that 26.5%, over a quarter of the doctors in this country, come
from outside the EU. They will not all be from developing countries and
some will be pursuing academic rather than clinical careers, but one is
inevitably drawn to the conclusion that there must be a measurable
adverse impact on health provision in developing countries as a result
of these

the noble Lord that this is not an attack on him or his parents. I have
no doubt that this country has benefited greatly from their work.
However, it is worth asking ourselves about the considerable
implications for other less fortunate parts of the world. For example,
in Malawi, following heavy migration, there are now 336 nurses for a
population of 12 million people. On the same scale, the UK would 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>have fewer than 2,000 nurses. When your child is dying of a preventable
disease in a developing country and you are told that the West is
recruiting your country’s scarce health workers, does this make
you more favourably disposed towards the West or does it make you more
receptive to the blandishments of the extremist? An important
by-product of the information revolution is that more people now know
more about other parts of the world than ever before. What we could, so
to speak, get away with 10 or 15 years ago is becoming increasingly a
matter of public record. Further, what is happening in healthcare is

friend Lord Marlesford is absolutely right to stress the need for
secure borders, but we also have to think strategically about what we
should demand of those who were born and reside here, what we should
demand of those who seek to live here permanently, how many of them we
can afford to admit, and what we offer them all in return. To fail to
resolve this conundrum means that we will put at risk that delicate
balance of rights and responsibilities on which our civil society,
honed over hundreds of years, depends. The security of the nation and

1940, with my mother and my younger sister I was suddenly migrated to
the United States for safety purposes, so we were told. A year later my
mother had to return to the United Kingdom because her own mother had
died, her brother had been shot down and killed, and there were other
family matters. However, she could not get back to us. As migrants or
immigrants, we were moved from the United States up to Canada, to a
form of nursery school run by a wonderful woman called Sister Hilda.
She had had a school in Rottingdean where she had looked after children
of empire while their parents were away and could not be with them. So
there I lived and I learnt to speak Canadian. I thoroughly enjoyed
myself. Occasionally I had to write letters to my mother, and when the

war.</hs_para>

worked out that we were probably not the children

it is not necessary to have an identity card, what is a passport? Is it
an identity card? I had a problem with this when I worked
internationally. Often my 
<?notus-xml column=1375?>passport was in for a visa somewhere or other. I did not think that it
would necessarily matter, so I would travel without a passport. Once
when I was on the board of a company I went to Italy and arrived there
without a passport. I thought that they would wave me through as usual,
but it was the day after the Heysel stadium disaster where, as noble
Lords may remember, British fans caused a lot of deaths in a stadium in
Belgium. The passport people, who I knew quite well, said that they
could not let me through without proof of identify. I said that I did
not really have anything, but then I realised that I had one of my
father’s suit. I showed them that from the label inside it was
quite an old suit and therefore it was proof of identity. They took the
jacket, then came back and said, “The jacket’s gone
through. If you take your trousers off, they can go through as well.
But under the current regulations we cannot let you through. You do not
have actual proof of identity”. I had to wait to be
identified.</hs_para>

carrying proof of identity here in the United Kingdom—nor do I

for Commonwealth countries to have a slightly different passport from
non-British nations, which would seem to be appropriate. Alternatively,

have tried to search and work out what the level of immigration is. The
best way to do it is to ask the immigrants themselves. This morning I
was woken up as usual by 11 Romanian builders. I complained to them
that there was a chap at the end of the road who was one of those who
sells you the gold ring that he drops on the ground. You pick it up and
it has got “19” on it and he says, “Can you give

McColl of Dulwich:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Marlesford, for introducing this debate. I will speak very briefly
about human trafficking or, as our Prime Minister describes it,
“modern day slavery”. Most people who have been
trafficked into the United Kingdom have been tricked into coming here
with the offer of work and the hope of making a better future for
themselves. Instead, they are exploited and abused in brothels, in
agriculture, as domestic servants, cultivating cannabis, and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000319">Trafficking
is not primarily an issue of immigration. Rather, as the Home Secretary
said recently, it is “international organised
crime”. By giving the Immigration Minister lead
responsibility for tackling human trafficking,

immigration aspects than the criminal justice response to
trafficking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070440000320" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070440000320">The
UK Border Agency is the body responsible for deciding whether there are
grounds for believing a person to be trafficked. It holds this
responsibility for all cases where the person comes from outside the
EU. The UK Human Trafficking Centre makes the decision in all other

outside the EU. The involvement of immigration officials in deciding
who is and who is not a victim of trafficking and who is eligible for
support under the national referral mechanism is problematic. It

course contributed to the difficulties was the impact and method of the
implementation of the Government’s changes. The financial cuts
of more than a third will certainly not have enhanced national
security, which is an important part of the subject matter of this
debate. There is immigration that works for Britain and immigration
that does not. We support policies to bring down the pace of
migration—particularly low-skilled migration—through
stronger controls on people coming to do low-skilled jobs and action
against bogus colleges. We need proper training programmes to help the
young unemployed get into the sectors that are recruiting most from
abroad—programmes such as Care First, which the Government
abolished.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000007">More
needs to be done to cut illegal immigration. By definition, this can
have an adverse impact on national security since the required checks
and controls, however technologically advanced, cannot be undertaken.
The Government’s net migration target is not targeting the right
things. Much of the drop since the election comes because more British
citizens are leaving the country and fewer are coming home. Most of the
rest is accounted for by falling numbers of foreign students. The
Government are targeting university students and entrepreneurs but
ignoring illegal immigration, which is of course outside the target.
Illegal immigration is getting worse, with fewer people stopped, more
absconding, fewer deported and backlogs of information on cases not
pursued. Illegal immigration is not exactly being deterred by the
continuing exploitation of migrant workers, which also undercuts local
workers. Stronger action is needed, which means national minimum wage
regulations which can be made to stick, with better enforcement and
higher fines, and a register to tackle rogue
landlords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000008">Pulling
out of the social chapter and co-operation on policing and justice
measures, as the Government appear to want to do, will not make it any
easier to manage and control migration, including illegal immigration.
No one would wish to suggest for one moment that this Government, or
indeed any Government, do not take their national security
responsibilities seriously or fail to give this the highest priority.
Effective immigration control is one of the building blocks that must
be in place to ensure that as 
<?notus-xml column=1380?>much as can reasonably and effectively be done to protect the security

sufficiently radical treatment. The committee of the noble Lord, Lord

in arriving at a good solution. Putting the admiral in charge of the
Border Force is very sensible, but the rest of it seems still very
amorphous. I suggest that the Government produce a Green Paper to
describe how the border agency, which has been taken back into the Home

problems of ensuring our national security through the borders and

of the scale at which Governments intercept communications. It is not
surprising that they do so, and it would be quite wrong if they did not
because the scale of communications has gone up so much. Everybody now
can communicate in very sophisticated ways, which enables those who are
inclined to crime or terrorism to do things that previously they could
not do. The technological revolution in communications has greatly
increased the danger from terrorism. The problem is enormous. There is
a lot more work to be done, and I hope that the Government will, after

public funds. Immediately before last July, that was equivalent to
income support—about £5,500. A number of sources and a
range of evidence of income were counted. Now the minimum income
requirement is £18,600, a level that is not attained by getting
on for half of British workers, and there are considerable regional
variations. The minimum income requirement is greater when there are
children and can be met only through limited sources. Those who are
successful at the initial stage of application must meet other criteria

study by Middlesex University suggests that preventing up to 17,800
migrant partners—the Government’s estimate—from
coming and working here will cost the UK as much as £850 million

Conversely, excluding a partner may increase claims on the state. A
single parent may need support, which would not be necessary if there
were two parents here to share the care of the child. Both sets of

reality of the finances of many families does not fall neatly within
narrow criteria. What about an incoming partner’s employability

sensible to review the exclusion of these. A lot of employment does not

being available. What about self-employment? It is subject to peaks and
troughs and it is not always evidenced in the easy ways that the
Government would want; but as a country we want entrepreneurial
spirits. What about the length of time that savings must be held and
their form when an applicant relies on savings in lieu of earnings?
This affects people over a range of circumstances. I have to say that I

child’s early months and years are hugely significant in his
development, not merely—if “merely” is the right
word—his well-being. In another part of the legislative forest,
a child’s welfare by statute is paramount; so says the UN
Convention on the Rights of the Child. Noble Lords are of course very
familiar with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights and
with Section 55. It was as recently as Tuesday that we discussed in
debate on the Children and Families Bill a government clause providing
for a presumption that the involvement of a parent in the life of a
child will further the child’s welfare. The four UK
Children’s Commissioners support an independent review and that

interests of the child should be referred to expressly in decisions. We
now even seem to see parents who are not allowed to live here being
refused a visitor’s visa. It is no answer that the Briton should
take his British children and live abroad if that is not the best for
his family. I heard someone affected by these rules on a radio phone-in

Parekh:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee,
for introducing this debate on changes to the Immigration Rules. I will
concentrate on three areas that worry me
greatly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:52:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000051">The
first has to do with the way in which one is not allowed to bring
one’s parents and grandparents from the country of one’s
origin. The new Immigration Rules require that if your parents or
grandparents are over the age of 65, ill, disabled or otherwise unable
to function, you may not bring them so long as they have a sibling in
the country of origin who can look after them, or can hire a nurse who
can look after them. I find this simply extraordinary for half a dozen
important reasons.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070446000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000052">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:54:17"></hs_TimeCode>,
looking after one’s parents or grandparents is a privilege to be
enjoyed and an obligation to be discharged. It is not something that
you outsource to your siblings or a nurse. Secondly, it is not just a
question of physical care, which a sibling or nurse can provide; it is
about emotional reassurance and support during the last days of
one’s parents or grandparents, which only you can provide.
Thirdly, people would leave the country if confronted with the choice
of either going to their countries of origin to look after their
parents or staying here. In fact, we heard a moving submission from the
British Medical Association written by Stephanie Creighton on behalf of
a large number of doctors and consultants, many of them saying that
they would leave the country. In fact, a couple of them have left
already, simply because they could not bring their parents to live with
them

I find the whole thing quite pointless. If our concern is to ensure
that no demands are made on public funds, that is already taken care
of. If people here bring parents or grandparents are prepared to look
after them—they used to be able to do so—those parents or
grandparents will not be dependent on public funds: in which case, what
is the point of this rule?</hs_para>

alternative for controlling immigration, I would at least concede the
point of it. Canada does not follow this policy. It has a super visa
under which parents and grandparents can be brought in for two years
until such time as their right to permanent settlement is decided. In
the United States there is no problem. In fact, a few years ago, when I
tried to bring my parents here—they were in their 80s—my
brother, who is settled in the United States, found it much easier for
them to spend their last few years with him.</hs_para>

our concern is to create a culture in which the aged are respected, I
should have 
<?notus-xml column=1389?>thought that letting people bring in their parents and grandparents
would be ideal. It sets an example to their
children and to wider society and helps to shift the culture in which
the old are seen as a liability or a burden. So far, I have accepted
the terminology of the rules, which talk about parents and
grandparents. There is a complete embargo on uncles and aunts. I come
from a civilisation where very often uncles perform more or less the
same role as parents, as they did in my case.</hs_para>

dead or disabled, you might feel that you have incurred the same moral
obligation and emotional commitment to your uncle as you have to your
parents. There is no reason why one should impose a complete embargo.
Immigration officers should be required to look at the nature of the
relationship. If the relationship with an uncle or aunt is of a kind
that one would recognise as filial, they should
qualify.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000057">My
first concern is therefore simply this, and I really want to emphasise
it: not allowing one to bring in parents and grandparents as long as
there is someone else to look after them is simply morally
unacceptable. It is also unworthy of a civilised society. We are asking
people to outsource their obligations to somebody else and saying,
“Do not worry, pass it on to somebody”. That is a culture
that we should not aim to encourage.</hs_para>

with the Immigration Rules involves family visitor appeals. These are
being disallowed and people whose applications have failed are being
told that they can apply again. Family visitor appeals make up about
one-third of all immigration appeals and a large number of them
succeed. The Government say that they succeed because very often new
information is provided at the appeal stage, but as I look at some of
the applications I do not find that. In fact, what is called new
information is often the exposure of implicit bias, important facts
that were mentioned but neglected, or bureaucratic irregularity that is
pointed
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000059">It is
certainly true, as the Government have said, that in some cases new
information was provided, but the House should bear in mind that this
is not the only factor. Other factors that appear at the appeal stage
include the way in which certain biases appear. It is therefore
important that we should allow family visitor appeals.</hs_para>

which the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, rightly pointed out: the way in
which one is allowed to bring in spouses. This is a long story and many
of us have spent at least 30 or 35 years fighting for the right to
bring spouses. The Government require an income of at least
£18,600. If a child is involved, it is £22,400. On
current estimates, just under 50% of people simply would not qualify,
because they do not earn that kind of money. For some of us in this
House, like me, a university professor, £18,000 is not even a
quarter of what one earns, but that is not what schoolteachers, nurses,
UK Border Agency officers or even some sections of retired people earn.
If we insist on this sum we will disqualify half the ethnic minority
population, as well as many
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000061">Equally
importantly, income fluctuates. In a volatile economy, jobs come and
go. I might have a job paying £18,600 today, but tomorrow it
might be much less. Nor do the regulations take into account the likely
income of the spouse, or the way in which, among 
<?notus-xml column=1390?>ethnic minorities and elsewhere, families generally chip in with their
savings. I very much hope that the Government will reconsider this

Teverson:</Member></B> My Lords, I pay tribute to my noble friend Lady
Hamwee for bringing this issue to the fore and for her work on the
inquiry that she led. One of the big differences between the United
Kingdom and, say, Egypt, is that there is a very broad political
consensus. Although we may argue between different sides of the House,
and on occasion even more on this side of the House, at least we have
fundamental principles that we believe in. Whether we are Liberal
Democrats, social democrats, socialists, libertarians or Conservatives,
we have certain values in common. They include, perhaps, the market
economy, democracy, the rule of law, and all the things that bind us
together and ensure that we have a stable, long-term
democracy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000063">Two
elements of that come within the area of family life. One is that the
state should not determine who you can or cannot marry. The second is
that families ought to be able to live together; the state should
always allow them to live together. We can all think of exceptions.
Sham marriages, of which there have been many, should be prevented;
forced marriages are illegal and wrong; and the state splits up
families when there is criminality by sending criminals to
penitentiaries and prison, which clearly is right. However, whether
families choose to live together, and who we marry, should be up to us
as citizens. In particular, they are our rights as British
citizens.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000064">We

live abroad. We think of all the citizens from other countries who live

150,000 of our citizens migrate from the UK for more than one year.
They are not necessarily retired people—or gangsters, who used
to go to Spain before the European arrest warrant but now go further
abroad. Some 90% of them are of working age. Perhaps more importantly
for this debate, two-thirds of them are single; they are not married
when they go. We also know—I know this from my own
family—that people go abroad, to university and to study, and
they go abroad on gap years. Those areas are

children. This has happened in my extended family, and it will be

Of course, that is easily explained. Representing Northern Ireland
during the 30 years of the Troubles, I found that no foreigners wanted
to come and live in Northern Ireland, so no visas were required. We got

to stress several points in the report before I go on to one particular
example, without mentioning names. One is the delay in deciding these
applications. I know of a case where a visa for a spouse, married to a
United Kingdom citizen in Northern Ireland, was applied for in February
2012. The decision was made by the Secretary of State in May
2013—15 months later. That is an intolerable delay for a family
unit as they wait to find out whether or not they will be awarded a
visa.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000073">On page
23 of the report, a submission from the Belfast Migrant Centre refers
to the problem of the minimum income requirement, which is of course
uniform throughout the United Kingdom. However, as the centre points
out, average wages vary throughout the different regions of the United
Kingdom, whether it is Scotland, Wales, the north of England or
Northern Ireland. Is it fair to have a standard minimum income
requirement when average wages vary in different regions of the United
Kingdom?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000074">I
know personally the people involved in a case where a girl from
Australia, loyal to Her Majesty the Queen, applied for a
spouse’s visa. She had been working in the United Kingdom and
had a work permit since 2008, five years ago. She is the unit sister of
a 38-bed nursing home in Northern Ireland and went back to her home
country of Australia in February 2011 to marry a United Kingdom citizen
from Northern Ireland. He is from the third generation running a family
firm in Northern Ireland, formed in 1975, which now employs 25 people.
There is therefore no issue of a minimum income requirement in this
case. However, the Secretary of State surprisingly reached the
conclusion that she is married to a British citizen—which, of
course, is correct—and went on to state in the decision:
“As both speak English there are no insurmountable obstacles to
both travelling to Australia together—as such your application
fails”. It is unbelievable that that could happen. Someone who
employs 25 people and who has been living in Northern
Ireland for seven or eight years goes back to Australia to get married
and is told that the application for a visa to live in the United
Kingdom has failed. It is terrible for the married couple and has very
adverse implications for a successful family
firm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000075">While

Queen, are being refused visas. Is it any wonder that support for UKIP
is increasing as more and more people realise the implications of the
present government policies on immigration and visas? I appeal to the

am deeply concerned by the situation in which we find ourselves because
it seems to me that when we talk about the kind of society
we want to be in—we spend an awful lot of time talking about
that—what really matters, and the values which we have as
central to that society, should be evident in all aspects of our life.
People, however reluctantly, can understand the need for immigration
controls and immigration policy. That is true of this country and of
our friends abroad. What upsets people is when, within that immigration
policy, we do not follow through the logic which we say is vital to
maintaining the values and behaviour which we see as being central to
our nation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070446000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070446000078">I
am really very disturbed that we are speaking with forked tongues on
the issue of family. We keep emphasising the importance of family in
our own society, but it does not apply to people who have been allowed
through the immigration system to come and join us and make a
contribution to our society. Either the family matters or it does not.
I found the evidence submitted by the BMA, to which my noble friend
Lord Parekh has already referred, very interesting. It talks not just
about the personal pressures but about the quality of work undertaken
by doctors if they are surrounded by their family or if they are
debarred from having their family with them. If we see these doctors as
essential to the operation of our health service—and, my God,
they make a huge contribution to our health and well-being—it is
terribly important that family values should
apply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:15:59"></hs_TimeCode>, to enable

friend, Lord Parekh, in a delightful but telling way, wove together the
principle and practicalities of this. We all know, in our own families,
how important grandparents are to the operation of the family, enabling
mothers to work and running children to school and to their activities.
Grandparents have a crucial part to play in the success of the family
as part of society. It is shooting ourselves in the foot to say that we
want people who are entitled to come through our immigration system,
and to welcome them so long as they are making a full, positive
contribution to our society, but then to deny those very aspects of
life which will enable them to maximise their performance. It just does
not make

also want to pick up on the more difficult, contentious issue of the
operation of our penal system. If people have had sentences over a
certain period of time they are subject to deportation. I have seen too
much evidence that the impact on the children is not taken into account
in these decisions. Sometimes there is a quite cynical neglect of any
consideration whatever of the children in the paperwork and the rest.
We were pioneers—I repeat, pioneers—in the creation of
the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, in which, I am glad to
say, the Conservative Party played a big part. We won great
international esteem for the part we played, as I was saying the other
night in our deliberations on the Children and Families Bill. We 
<?notus-xml column=1394?>have a long way to fall and I am afraid we are falling. What people
judge us by is not what we said at the time of the convention’s
creation but how we actually operate the convention, not only in detail
but in spirit, in our own society and the way we go about organising
our affairs. I am not going to say there have not been some marginal
improvements, and of course there are some very fine people working in
this area. However, are we absolutely certain that the child is central
to our considerations in all the work of the UK Border Agency and all
the work of the Home Office on deportation in connection with crime?
That is what the convention, which we helped to draft, demands. Is the
child central to our considerations? This needs to be taken very
seriously

us, whatever our party differences across the House, want to live in a
nation that feels at peace with itself—a nation that is

be seen as a nation that is not only successful and achieving in
materialist terms but whose characters of compassion, care and concern
are self-evident in everything that we do and the way that we go about
it. I am not denying the need for an immigration policy—of
course I am not, it would be nonsense—but those principles,
which are admittedly difficult and challenging, have to be seen as
applying in the operation of that policy. I am glad that the noble
Baroness has given us the opportunity to look at these issues. Some of
them need to be examined very carefully indeed.</hs_para>

From then until the end of October, only one visa was issued to a

whether anyone else in this category has

brothers asked me to help and I wrote to the Minister for Immigration
in April. Two months later, I had received no reply, and I wrote again

an illustration of this in the case of non-EEA victims of domestic

Rule 289A of the Immigration Rules, which is explained in the 48 pages
of guidance published under the imprint of the UKBA in April, even
though it had been abolished a month earlier. On page 5 of that
document, the applicant is told that she must also comply with E-DVILR,
an appendix to the Immigration Rules, and other obscure requirements
kick in for particular applicants. If the relationship is an informal
one, the abused non-EEA partner is clearly even more vulnerable. The
Black Women’s Rape Action Project says that the frequency of the
abuse and the severity is often more extreme when the victim is an
immigrant woman and even more so when she is not married and is in an
informal relationship. Even worse, the victim’s presence in the
UK becomes unlawful the moment she leaves the abuser. Informal

evidence from the BMA

much that we read in our newspapers seems to be there in order to
create hostility and stir up opposition to people outside the UK. Of

read one paper today and there were four stories about the immigrants
who are coming and how unwelcome they are, with headlines such as,
“Immigrants sponging off the taxpayer”. But the Office
for National Statistics says that while 13% of UK taxpayers claim
out-of-work benefits, only 7% of immigrants do. Another headline was,
“EU migrants take our jobs”. But the facts are that nine
out of 10 new jobs are taken by British nationals. We also hear that
the epidemic of health tourists is costing us billions. However, the
<I>British Medical Journal </I>reported that more Britons seek health
advice overseas than people from overseas seek health treatment here in
the UK. Scaremongering creates hostility, both for immigrants and
British citizens. It has no place in a civilised society.</hs_para>

asylum and immigration it seems that we are making the door narrower
and narrower and the obstacle course more difficult. Instances of this
include the UK citizenship test, which we mentioned here the other day,
and the low, frozen asylum support rates. An asylum seeker who comes to
the UK must wait 12 months before being allowed even to consider taking
a job. He must exist on £35.63 a week. That is the
income. It is not, as some suggest, that £1,000 cheques are
waiting for asylum seekers as soon as they arrive in this country. That
is not the truth. The truth is that we make it more and more difficult

thought that was a wonderful answer. People have dreams and they have

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a privilege to follow
the noble Lord, Lord Roberts of Llandudno, and his tribute to the
contribution that migrants have made to this country across time. We
have discussed many of those in our debate today. I join those who
thanked the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, for calling 
<?notus-xml column=1399?>this important debate and for the work of her all-party group and join
my noble friend, Lord Kilclooney, in emphasising the benefits that such
groups can bring to the parliamentary process. Only last week, three
new sets of consultations around children in care, covering children
missing from children’s homes, out-of-authority placements and
data sharing, were produced by the Minister for Children and Families.
These were a direct result of the work of Ann Coffey MP, chair of the
All-Party Parliamentary Group for Runaway and Missing Children and
Adults, and of that group’s report, produced jointly with the
All-Party Parliamentary Group for Looked After Children and Care
Leavers, on children who go missing from care. These can be very
effective
instruments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000002">Although
I have not looked in detail at immigration issues for some time, I have
an inkling of the challenges that the Government face in immigration
policy, as I served for five years on a sub-committee of your
Lordships’ EU Select Committee tasked with looking at
immigration policy. Indeed, I had the privilege of serving with the
noble Lords, Lord Avebury and Lord Teverson. That experience made me
particularly concerned that over-relaxed policies on migration allowed
businesses to neglect some of the less work-ready youth of this
country, because European Union labour could easily be found from
abroad. We have all become more aware of the need for managed migration
as we become aware of pressures on services, particularly school
places, and especially of the housing shortage, and how these have
contributed to social tensions. I pay tribute to the Government for
their attention to the need to manage migration more
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000003">However,
I am very troubled by the rules that we are debating today. The new
income requirement for sponsoring a non-European partner affects UK
citizens. Most of them are hard-working taxpayers and many are making
an important contribution to our health service and especially to the
care of the elderly. These points have been made various noble
Lords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000004">The
rules are pushing some women into dependency on the state, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, said. As lone parents, they can no longer afford
to work. Most importantly, the rules are depriving children of their
parents—their fathers in particular. They may have the effect of
increasing pressures on housing and school places in London, as it is
only here in London that mothers can hope to earn the income necessary
to be reunited with their spouses, because of London
weighting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000005">The

as shown in the report from the all-party parliamentary group on the
impact of the rules, shows that they are having the surely unintended
consequence of dividing children from their parents, in particular
fathers, with the potential for long-term damage. We all know the poor
outcomes for boys growing up without fathers and all lament the
increasing number of boys growing up without a father involved in their
life. Not so long ago, as I attended the juvenile court in west London,
it was drawn to my attention that the young people attending that day

this Tuesday, at Second Reading of the Children and Families Bill, as
referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, we heard the Schools

it is normally in the best interests of the child to have both parents

have several questions for the Minister. In formulating these
regulations, was consideration given to the impact that they would have
on children, particularly on those boys thus denied contact with their
fathers? Can he say how many boys are unable to have regular contact
with their fathers as a result of these rules? If not, can he say how
many children are affected? Are the Government concerned at the impact
on boys being denied access to their fathers as a result of the rules?
Will the Minister tell us whether the Government intend to review these
impacts and what steps they will take to ensure that any damage to
children is minimised? That is rather a lot of questions and the
Minister may prefer to write to
me.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000009">In
considering these regulations, I was reminded of the experience of
setting up the Yarl’s Wood immigration removal centre about 10
or 12 years ago. Again, this was to address a thorny problem with
immigration. When families had exhausted all the processes for asylum,
the Government needed to remove these families and some of them were
unwilling to go. Eventually it was determined that some of them would
be locked up in Yarl’s Wood. Unfortunately, that was a category
C prison and so we had children, babies, young children and their
mothers entering the reception area of the prison, being taken through
a prison gate and all the locked doors in that prison, and being cared
for by prison
officers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000010">The
Children’s Commissioner again played a very important role,
visiting on many occasions and campaigning on the issue. I congratulate
the coalition Government on deciding that this was not the right policy
and reversing it. Visiting on one occasion, I remember meeting a 16
year-old girl who had been in 
<?notus-xml column=1401?>that setting for, I believe, nine months with her younger sister. She
was so angry: how could she, as a child who had committed no crime, be
denied her freedom for all that time during her childhood? I had no way

really came across in the Yarl’s Wood experience was that there
was no clear thought at the beginning of the policy about the impact on
children and families. Over the 10 years, there was a great deal of
change and consideration and, eventually, the policy was overturned. I
hope that, in this case as well, we may see further thought from the
Government and I look forward to the Minister’s
response.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/DBB4135E2A1C47D013EEF1C9EDB68FD7FEDF82A1" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 July 2013">Thursday,

of our major companies, as well as sustain our National Health Service

also need to draw the distinction between immigration that works for

some changes that are made to immigration rules can have unfortunate
consequences, and today we are discussing one such change—a
significant one. In July last year, as we know, major changes to
family-related immigration categories came into effect. With limited
exemptions, British citizens or settled persons wishing to sponsor
their non-EEA national spouse or partner to join them in the UK must
now demonstrate a minimum gross annual income of £18,600, and
more if they are also sponsoring dependent children. New foreign
spouses or partners must also wait for five years rather than two, as
previously, before they become eligible to apply for permanent
settlement in the UK. More restrictive eligibility criteria have also
been introduced for adult dependent relatives of British citizens who
wish to settle in the

year the Government anticipated that the change would result in, I
believe, up to 17,800 fewer family visas being granted every year,
arguing that keeping the bar high for family migration could result in
savings to the welfare bill. At the time, we expressed our support for
strengthening the family migration 
<?notus-xml column=1402?>rules to protect UK taxpayers and said that if people want to make this
country their home, they should contribute and not have a negative
impact on public funds. However, we cast doubt on the
Government’s approach that focused so much on the
sponsor’s salary, and said that there needed to be a fair
framework for those who fall in love and build family relationships
across
borders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000018">The
report from the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration on these new
family migration rules, which has just been published, has already been
referred to extensively. It highlights the impacts of recent rule
changes on ordinary British citizens hoping to build a family in the UK
with a non-EEA husband, wife or partner. Among the report’s key
findings were that some British citizens and permanent residents in the
UK, including people in full-time employment, have been separated from
a non-EEA partner, and in some cases their children, as a result of the
income
requirement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000019">In
addition, some British citizens and permanent residents have been
prevented from returning to the UK with their non-EEA partner and any
children, again as a result of the income requirement. In some cases
the non-EEA partner was the main earner with a medium or high salary,
but that could not be counted towards the income requirement under the
new rules. On top of all this, the report found that some children,
including British children, have been indefinitely separated from a
non-EEA parent, once again as a result of the income
requirement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:52:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000020">It
looks as though the doubts raised about the Government’s
approach, which was focused so heavily on the sponsor’s salary,
have, unfortunately, been proved right. Among the recommendations made
in the all-party group’s report was that the level of the income
requirement should be reviewed with a view to minimising any particular
impacts on UK sponsors as a result of their region, gender, age or
ethnicity, and that family migration rules should ensure that children
are supported to live with their parents in the UK where their best

specific point about our Armed Forces. As I understand it, the
Government have now decided that members of our Armed Forces posted or
fighting for our country overseas should not be exempt from the new

noble Lords know, the Government are determined to reform the
immigration system and restore public confidence in it. In that context
we implemented in July 2012 a major set of reforms of the requirements
to be met by non-European Economic Area nationals seeking to enter or
remain in the UK on the basis of family life. The Government welcome
the report of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Migration on its
inquiry into the impact of the new family migration rules. In
monitoring this impact, we will consider carefully the findings of the
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000025">Many
noble Lords have spoken of their concerns about these new rules. The
passion of the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and the challenges from my noble
friends Lord Teverson, Lord Avebury and Lord Taylor of Warwick have
provided us with a test. I enjoyed the speeches of the noble Lords,
Lord Parekh and Lord Kilclooney. I am not entirely sure that I enjoy
the testing standards of my noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno, but
I am pleased that in his closing speech the noble Lord, Lord Rosser,
demonstrated that we agree on many of the key issues and recognise the
heart of them for government. I hope he does not believe that I presume
too
much.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000026">Perhaps
I can start by setting out the background to the changes introduced
last year. My noble friend Lord Teverson focused very strongly on his
concerns about family life in this country. The Government welcome
those who want to make a life in the UK with their families, to work
hard and to make a contribution, but family life must not be
established here at the taxpayer’s expense. That is fundamental
for the income test and is the reasoning behind the income threshold.
We expect the new income threshold to prevent burdens on the taxpayer
and promote successful integration. Those wishing to establish their
family life here must be able to stand on their own feet financially.
That is not an unreasonable expectation as the basis of sustainable
family migration and good integration outcomes, on which I am sure all
noble Lords
agree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000027">The
previous requirement for adequate maintenance was not, as it turned
out, an adequate basis for sustainable family migration and good
integration outcomes. It provided little assurance that UK-based
sponsors and their migrant partner could support themselves financially
over the long term. One of its considerable downsides was that it
involved a complex assessment of the current and prospective employment
income of the parties and their other financial means, including
current or promised support from third parties. This was not conducive
to clear, consistent decision-making.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070448000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000028">That is why the
Government decided to establish a new financial requirement for
sponsoring family migrants. The level of the threshold was based
principally on expert advice from the independent Migration Advisory 
<?notus-xml column=1404?>Committee. The levels of income required are those at which a couple,
once settled in the UK and taking into account any children, because
children can be included in the threshold by an additional threshold
sum, generally cannot access income-related benefits. The noble Lord,
Lord Teverson, and my noble friend Lord Taylor of Warwick said that a
family policy needs to be fair. The Government believe that this is a
fair and appropriate basis for family migration. It is right for
migrants, local communities and the UK as a whole.</hs_para>

with the Migration Advisory Committee’s conclusion that there is
no clear case for varying the income threshold across the UK. I hope
the noble Lord, Lord Kilclooney, will understand that it would be
impossible to set a threshold for migration to Scotland, Northern
Ireland or Wales. What would become of freedom of movement within the
United Kingdom? It is unreal, and that is the principal reason why it
has been ruled out. A requirement that varied by region could lead to
sponsors moving to a lower threshold area in order to meet the
requirement before returning once a visa was granted. It could also
mean that a sponsor living in a wealthy part of a relatively poor
region could be subject to a lower income threshold than a sponsor
living in a deprived area of a relatively wealthy region. A single
national threshold also provides clarity and simplicity for applicants
and caseworkers. I think all noble Lords will agree that the
Immigration Rules are complex enough. They have been complicated by
politicians and lawyers, and we need to make the rules as simple as we
can if we want an efficient and effective way of determining
outcomes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070448000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-0002.htm#13070448000030">We
have built significant flexibility into the operation of the threshold
allowing for different income sources to be used towards meeting the
threshold as well as significant cash savings. Employment overseas is
no guarantee of finding work in the UK, and the previous and
prospective earnings of the migrant partner are not taken into account
in determining whether the threshold is met. If the migrant partner has
a suitable job offer in the UK, they can apply under tier 2 of the
points-based system.</hs_para>

significant changes to the adult and elderly dependent relative route,
ending the routine expectation of settlement in the UK for parents and
grandparents aged 65 or over. A number of noble Lords were concerned
about this. The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, made an eloquent speech about
it. Close family members are now able to settle in the UK only if they
require a level of long-term personal care as a result of their age,
illness or disability that can be provided only in the UK by their
relative here. The route is now limited to those applying from outside
the UK. These changes reflect the significant NHS and social care costs
to which these cases can give rise.</hs_para>

some cases affected by the changes that we have introduced to this

27 creates an additional duty in respect of the statement on the carbon

Currently, the Bill requires that an annual statement must be made once
an order has been made and that that should include a summary of the
means by which the carbon intensity was calculated for that year and a
declaration of whether the carbon intensity has decreased or increased
since the previous statement. Amendment 27 adds an

mentioned, carbon intensity of electricity fell dramatically in the
1990s but has since levelled off and in 2012 sharply increased. This
was due to a change in the merit order thanks to high gas prices and
low coal prices. On Tuesday in Committee, I stated that coal was a
common enemy. What I meant to say was that inefficient, unabated coal
stations are the common enemy. I apologise for not being clearer about
that. Of course, coal can play a significant role in a low-carbon
electricity system if it is coupled with carbon capture and storage,
which is a very important technology. However, the longer these old
unabated stations stay on the system, the longer we will have to wait
for investment in low-carbon alternatives, since they are very
profitable and can crowd out new entrants to the
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000006">The
Bill must seek to create a legal framework for electricity market
reform that provides clarity of purpose and accountability. The Bill
contains significant and wide-ranging powers, but there is currently
insufficient accountability. Given the implications of the measures in
the Bill, it is only right that the Government should be held to
account over its performance against its stated objectives. One
objective is clearly to increase investment in low-carbon
infrastructure and a clear measurement of success is the carbon
intensity of our electricity. The requirement to deliver an annual
report under Clause 3 is therefore extremely welcome. However, it does
not go far enough. If progress is not being made, a statement ought to
be made about what will be done to address the reasons for lack of
progress.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070456000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000007">Of
course, increases in carbon intensity in any one year can come about
for a number of reasons—the relative price of fuels and the
carbon price are important elements that the Government are seeking to
correct using the carbon floor price policy. However, there are other
reasons why intensity may rise in a given year, such as weather
fluctuations, which may lead to an increased demand for electricity, or
low hydropower output. They may also be unplanned outages in our
nuclear fleet. There are therefore circumstances outside the control of
policy and government, which can affect intensity. In these
circumstances, any requirement to report on actions to be taken should
not commit the Secretary of State to having to act, but there should
remain the option to state the reasons for the increase and then to
make a case for not taking action. I want to be clear that
we do not wish to ask for the impossible, but we do seek slightly more
accountability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000087">If
intensity is increasing because of policy failure—for example,
if the carbon price is failing to dissuade coal burn or the number of
CFDs being signed is too low to deliver sufficient investments in the
infrastructure—it is right that the Secretary of State should be
required to report this and to detail actions he or she intends to take
to correct these failings. Another potential issue is that the UK could
seek to delay the closure of coal plants planned as a result of the
introduction of tighter clean air regulations. I hope that the
Government will not seek a derogation of this kind, because it would
have serious implications for the carbon intensity of electricity, and
corrective action would then need to be taken to compensate.</hs_para>

to achieve the target. Amendment 27 has a similar sentiment but offers
a much simpler way of achieving that goal. In the event that carbon

Lords, as the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, has said, Amendment 27
proposes that if carbon intensity has increased from the previous year,
the Secretary of State will report additional actions he or she will
take to reduce carbon intensity. I agree with the noble Baroness that
it is sensible that, in addition to setting up plans for meeting the
target range and the progress made towards it, the Secretary of State
should also explain the action he or she will take to stay on track
towards the target over time. However, I do not feel that the amendment

main concern is that the amendment would require the Secretary of State
to set out additional action in response to an increase in a single
year and this may not reflect, as the noble Baroness has rightly said,
a number of variants under which the power sector operates in practice.
There are many factors that can affect year-on-year measurements of
carbon intensity and she has rightly said that cold years often require
higher carbon intensities. Another factor could be power stations being
offline for maintenance. This has been the case in recent years with
some nuclear power stations, the emissions effect of which was reported
in our annual statement of emissions. While bearing these points in
mind, I support the aim of transparent reporting but it must be
meaningful for the power sector to do that in the context of long-term
trends rather than year-to-year variations. Therefore, while I support
the aim of the amendment, I need to consider further how to address it,
perhaps with a view to responding to it at a later stage. With that, I
hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> This is a probing amendment and in
some respects it follows on from what my noble friend has just been
talking about. The opportunity to adopt a decarbonisation obligation,
which would set decarbonisation targets for supply companies, arises as
a consequence of a 2004 European directive, which required electricity
supply companies to disclose the environmental impact—that is,
the CO<Sub>2 </Sub>emissions and nuclear waste of the electricity that
they supply to customers over a year. In 2005, this was given effect in
the UK by way of an SI. Therefore, since 2005 up to the year ending
2011—this is a matter of public note—we have published
information about the emissions that each of the major energy suppliers
has been responsible for in a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:10:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070456000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000014">I think that when the
regulations were initially drafted, it was assumed that people would
look at what they had emitted and try to reduce the total year by year,
given the general consensus for, and desirability of, securing a degree
of carbonisation. However, a deficiency in the regulations has meant
that there has in fact been very little in the way of an appreciable
reduction in emissions from 2005 to 2011—the period for which
data are available. The UK average for the year ending 2011 is 430
grams per kilowatt hour, which is a fall of 30 grams since 2005, so one
cannot really say that the existing regulation has been particularly
effective in reducing the carbon emissions created by the energy
generators. Indeed, for other reasons which I think have already been
mentioned in respect of the cheapness of coal, in 2012 carbon intensity
climbed to 530 grams per kilowatt hour because of the attractiveness of
coal as an alternative to gas and other sources at that
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:11:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment, as it obviously has not had the benefit of the hands of
parliamentary draftspeople. Nevertheless, the point that I really want
to make is that I do not think it would be unreasonable for the
Government to consider that we ought to use this information and not
let it just gather dust on the shelf. I should like to think that this
information would provide us with an approach to the problem. It is
pretty well spelt out in the amendment that within 12 months of the
Bill becoming an Act there would be a decarbonisation obligation, which
would be set by the Secretary of State after consultation with and
advice from the Committee on Climate Change. In effect, it would be a
target for carbon reduction for the main electricity suppliers. We talk
in the amendment about the relevant suppliers. By that, I mean
suppliers of a sufficient size. We are not talking about micromanaging
this. We could say the big six and one or two others, and that would
probably catch just about everybody.</hs_para>

it is not a massive exercise but I think we are missing a trick here.
We have information that is not very satisfying, and it ought to be
employed to some extent. If it is not, then in some respects it almost
begs the question: why bother gathering this stuff in the first place?
Why bother requiring the companies to make these returns if nobody is
paying any attention to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:13:32"></hs_TimeCode>? It may
well be that there are people within DECC studiously looking at these
data every year. However, again, that begs the question: why are they

here to explore the possibility of using the information as another
lever in trying to decarbonise, or certainly to reduce the
carbonisation of, our electricity supply. It is a fairly modest
amendment and would probably cost very little for the Government to set
in motion. It would probably be a source of complaint for the relevant
electricity suppliers but, given that they are always complaining
anyway, one more reason for complaint will not make an awful lot of
difference. It would give the Government the opportunity to take some
leadership on this issue, because the previous Government and this one
have been rather lax about it. We see quite clearly that virtually
nothing has been achieved on decarbonisation during six years of
recording. It is a fall of five grams per annum, which probably works
out at just about 1.1% per annum. I am not sure that any Government
would want to defend that record. I recognise that there are
circumstances where there are cheaper sources of fuel, which are
dirtier, but these sources will not be available for much
longer.</hs_para>

Deben:</Member></B> As the climate change committee is mentioned in

just been said. I declare an interest as chairman of that committee.
This is obviously a probing amendment and I am sure that the Minister
will want to look carefully at how it falls. However, it seems to have
two elements that the Minister might wish to look at rather carefully.
My noble friend Lady Verma is right to be very careful about additional
burdens and I am one of those who believe in that, because there is no
doubt that any kind of burden will be magnified. There is
today’s announcement from the Taxpayers’ Alliance, for
example, which has produced a figure for the cost of energy to a normal
taxpayer. Instead of the £100 in 2020 that it will be, it is
suggesting six times that by using figures which just do not stand up.
Whatever we do, we will have that kind of attack.</hs_para>

the Minister may find to be of value in these suggestions is that this
information is already required. There is no additional information
that needs to be acquired. Secondly, we also have a mechanism in
place—the climate change committee—to provide the
additional information that the Minister might want. Thirdly, it is a
way in which one could signify the great importance that we attend and
attach to electricity decarbonisation. It cannot be said too often that
this is the key to the future. If we cannot decarbonise electricity, we
have no hope at all of meeting the obligations that are statutorily
before us. It is important to say this again and again because people
seem very reluctant to understand why that is. But it is obviously true
that if you have decarbonised electricity, you can in fact provide many
of the things that people have grown used to having without destroying
the climate. If you look at the
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>, it means
that we can have electric vehicles, particularly with smart metering
and smart grids. However, we can also have all the other electrical
machines, like the ones we all use today, without feeling that we are
contributing to climate change. Therefore, it is absolutely essential
to what we need to do, which is why the climate change committee has
recommended that we should be very tough in showing that we have to
meet decarbonisation and carbon intensity targets by 2030, congruent
with where we have to be in
2050.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000022">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:20:15"></hs_TimeCode>

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I wanted to make a few comments
about how such an obligation might work. Of course, I completely concur
with noble Lords who have spoken already; this is clearly a probing
amendment, and a lot of work will need to be done to think through how
it might work in
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000024">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:20:51"></hs_TimeCode>
one thing that I would like to illustrate is that, on the fuel
disclosure requirements that we currently have, 12 suppliers are
required to report and many of those report very low carbon intensities
because they are specifically green suppliers. Of those that are mixed
suppliers, there is a very great difference between them; at the top
end of the scale, we have Scottish Power in 2011, whose CO<Sub>2</Sub>
intensity was 580 grams per kilowatt hour. At the bottom end of the
scale you have EDF Energy, with 253 grams per kilowatt hour. Obviously,
that is because the plant self-serves to those supply companies; they
are both energy generators and energy suppliers, so they choose to use
their own power. It would be hard to imagine giving one figure that
they should all meet, but an obligation might be that they should
demonstrate an improvement over time by percentage per annum on their
current levels, as recorded over the past six
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:22:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000025">There
are a couple of reasons why that idea might be a good one to explore.
We know that there is an issue among independent generators, which fear
that they will not be able to gain access to the market because of
self-serving—the tendency to use your own plant and be
vertically integrated. If they were required to shift to a low-carbon
footprint and intensity, they would have an incentive to find those
independent generators that can generate low-carbon electricity and
reduce their footprint. That could knock off quite a few issues in one,
if we looked at it in
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000026">Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>
thing to commend that idea is that the measures in the Bill are
designed to bring forward investment, but nothing is there to compel
anybody to come forward. You can set up a CFD strike price and offer
these contracts, but if no one wants to bother getting them they can
simply carry on with business as usual. If they had this obligation, it
would create a great incentive to find those CFDs, apply for them and
come forward. The alternative is simply to keep offering higher and
higher strike prices until the carrot becomes so attractive that they
have to come forward. So it is a good insurance policy for the Bill,
providing a way for the Government to link those targets that they
propose to set in 2016 with an actual mechanism for delivery. Let us be
honest: a target set by the Government to deliver carbon intensity of
any value will be delivered only if you find a way for the commercial
operators in the market to deliver it. This is one way, and it has

noble friend Lord Deben for rightly raising the important points about
the information that is already available and the cost burden that it

are concerned about accountability. The Bill places sole responsibility
on the Secretary of State to meet any target range. Once that is set,
recognising that it is the Secretary of State who is responsible for
setting energy policy in the UK, it is he who will be ultimately
accountable to Parliament. My concern about the amendment is that it
would be unfair for us to ask suppliers to manage their portfolios in
order to meet national carbon intensity limits because, as has been
said, it would be incredibly complicated to oversee and would confuse
the responsibilities of the state in setting the target range with
those of suppliers by specifying the annual level of carbon intensity

supporting a market framework that will make it more attractive. I

currently adequately address. I am getting e-mails daily from

going to buy our power?”. We are removing the obligation from
the suppliers to buy low-carbon power. One of the features of the RO

increase their renewable percentage and that gave them access to the

Amendment 37. Again, these are simply probing amendments to elicit more
detail. I have a genuine question about definitions of electricity
generation. We believe it would be helpful to have more information
about what would be included under that descriptor. It is important
that electricity is generated in a power station and is then
transmitted long distances along transmission lines and through
distribution networks. Quite significant losses accrue through that
process. One of the advantages of distributed energy is that by
locating the source close to the demand you get a potentially more
efficient
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:36:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I would

what might seem a technical point, within that transmission network,
there are sources of significant greenhouse gases other than
CO<Sub>2</Sub>. SF6 is a very powerful source of greenhouse gas. In
fact, it is the most powerful greenhouse gas. One kilogram of SF6 is
equivalent to the emissions of 22,200 kilograms of CO<Sub>2</Sub>. It
is significantly used in electricity substations. There are
requirements to report losses of SF6 because it is such a significant
pollutant. What policies do we have in place to reduce the emissions of
SF6? Mechanisms can be used to reduce it. There are obvious leak
detection and repair processes that companies should carry out. It is
possible to recycle equipment. Employee education and training is a

sorry to spring this on the Minister. It is quite a technical issue and

37, I reiterate my thanks for the letter we received, which addresses
the concern about how we are to marry up the fact that through the CFD
process we may well fund generation outside the UK. I happen to think
that is probably quite a good idea. Certainly, if Ireland is happy to
have onshore wind that can be directly piped to Wales in a direct
cable, that would be fantastic for us. I would prefer it if onshore
wind were in the UK, where we would get the benefit of the jobs but
there are problems associated with our being a very densely populated
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:39:19"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
not to challenge the principle that CFDs can be assigned in places
other than within the UK but merely to ask how we will account for that
within the carbon intensity targets. Will those plants receiving CFDs
count towards it? Will the noble Baroness say more about
that?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/61FE561FB8887159AE627549A982D82391F8C9D3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 July 2013">Thursday,

Teverson:</Member></B> This is a useful probing amendment. One of the
other areas that has not been mentioned is the interest that the
Government have had in geothermal energy from Iceland, which has
started to be explored. I would like to think that we could have
geothermal from Cornwall that we would be absolutely certain was within
this regime—maybe I will come to that later in the Bill. It is
useful to start to understand this and develop these arguments,
because, in terms of dedicated sources of renewable energy that we work
with other nations to bring to these shores, it would be regrettable if
we were not able to take the full credit for that work within the
decarbonisation targets. I would be interested to hear the
Government’s thinking in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13070456000150" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000150">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> Amendment 36 proposes that the Secretary of State
makes further provision about the meaning of “electricity
generation”. Clause 4 defines carbon intensity as a measure of
the amount of carbon emissions generated in grams per unit. Before I go
further, I will write to the noble Baroness on SF6, because my notes do
not cover that detail. I will make sure that next time they are here at
hand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000054">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:40:15"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill covers emissions from all electricity generated within the
territorial boundaries of the UK, both from power stations and auto
generators, and includes the emissions from electricity before any
transmission losses. This approach is consistent with our international
reporting system, which the noble Baroness will know about. I should
also like to reassure noble Lords that the power in Clause 4(4) enables
the Secretary of State to make further provision for the meaning of
carbon intensity of electricity generation and this includes any
changes to the definition of electricity generation. I think this goes
a little way to responding to the concerns of the noble
Baroness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000055">Turning
to Amendment 37, Clause 4 currently states that carbon intensity of the
power sector includes emissions generated in Great Britain only.
Although, 
<?notus-xml column=477?>as I said, this will apply to the UK power sector following the
Government’s amendments to extend the decarbonisation
provisions, this does not include emissions from interconnection or
non-UK low-carbon generation. The Government considered this very
seriously when we were designing these clauses. While
interconnection is important, the Secretary of State cannot
realistically be responsible for, and would have great difficulty in
measuring, the carbon intensity of electricity generated outside the
UK. Fundamentally, what is coming down the wires is simply electricity,
and we could not say for certain in most cases whether it is low-carbon
or not. If anything, my concern is that we would find ourselves
overclaiming, when in fact the electricity being imported was from a
wide range of generation sources. However, as I previously mentioned,
these provisions retain flexibility so that this approach can be
reviewed at a later date and changed if we feel it is necessary to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:43:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000056">I

do not expect a response from the Minister, but there is a qualitative
difference. I accept the point exactly about general interconnectors
but there is a difference between the specific
inter- connectors dedicated to wind energy and which are for
those sources of power, whether it is around Iceland or Ireland, and
general interconnectors. It may be useful for the Government to
remember that, but I thank the noble Baroness and the Government for

Worthington:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for her response and I
look forward to receiving the letter. On Amendment 37 it is important
to say, as the noble 
<?notus-xml column=478?>Lord, Lord Teverson, has just stated, that I was not necessarily probing
in regard to interconnectors. However, in the fuel disclosure that we
just described, suppliers are able to use electricity that they have
purchased through the interconnector to count towards their fuel
disclosure. They use an averaged amount that is worked out, in fact, so
it is possible to account for interconnection. I am not asking for
that, but I wanted to make sure that that was clear.</hs_para>

specific project, which I think is called Greenwire. That project may
be called onshore-offshore, being built on the land of Ireland but
connected by a direct cable to the UK. It is not an interconnector but
a direct transmission line. If that goes ahead, it would potentially be
a good and significant source of low-carbon electricity. It would be a
shame if that were then not to count towards our carbon intensity
target. After all, it would be UK suppliers and consumers who were
paying for it. It really is important that when we think about these
definitional issues, we get it correctly understood. The letter refers
to the difference between direct connection and interconnection, so we
are probably on the right track. I wanted to make sure and get it on
the record that those projects will count towards our carbon intensity
targets. On that basis, I am pleased to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

function under this part of the Bill should operate. Regrettably, I had
not read that report, which was published on 28 June, in time to meet

38E and other amendments in the group deal with the scope of the ONR
and its regulatory authority. The principal issue is the sites which
ONR will cover. The definition in the Bill is largely in relation to
sites rather than activities, although activities circularly define
sites that need to have licences. We need to know which sites we are
talking about because many sites which deal with nuclear and
radioactive matters will not be covered by the ONR or by the
regulations in the way that they are reflected in this section of the
Bill. There are, of course, substantial defence sites that deal with
nuclear matter and nuclear materials; there are transportation issues,
not all of which seem to be covered; and there are radioactive
materials, processes and operations being conducted in a wide range of
sites across industry, universities, research functions and the
National Health Service. Therefore, we need to be absolutely clear what
the ONR relates

of the non-nuclear industry sites are not really governed by the
nuclear regulations, although some of them are, and certainly not by
the ONR as it will be, but we need to be clear where those divides
operate. Therefore, this group of amendments seeks to make that a bit
clearer. Amendment 38B would make it clear that this provision relates
to civil sites. There may be some ambiguity here because defence
establishments, which are, as I understand it, regulated by the Defence
Nuclear Safety Regulator, often have some quasi-civilian activity. If
it is clear that even those activities are excluded from the ONR, we
probably need to make that clear in the Bill, and that is why I suggest
that we insert the word

that, once it is clear which sites we are operating on, the Secretary
of State or the ONR should be obliged to provide a public list of such
sites. At the moment, such sites are defined by whether they have a

reference in Clause 57 to “associated sites”. Whereas
there is a definition of nuclear sites by reference to the licence and
a definition of nuclear matter and nuclear material by reference to
other regulations, there is no definition of associated sites. I have
therefore offered a definition, although I think that it may be far too
wide. However, certainly unless we explain “associated
sites”, it will be difficult to know what is and is not covered

with the issue that I have just described—that is, sites that do
not yet have a licence but are moving towards being areas that would
require a licence. As the nuclear industry expands on the generation
side, as well as perhaps into other activities, we will expect sites to
be in various degrees of preparation. Not long ago, Hinkley Point C,
which I have visited on a number of occasions, did not have a licence
or planning permission and it had not met all the other requirements in
order to set up a nuclear 
<?notus-xml column=481?>power station. Obviously the functioning power stations and the ones
that closed had all those things covered, but the area of Hinkley Point
C could not yet be designated as a site because it did not have a
licence. Every prospective nuclear power station site will have a
period before it gets a licence to operate. We need to make sure that
that is also covered and that it is clearly the ONR’s
responsibility and, to some extent, the responsibility of other
organisations, which I shall come to in a separate group of
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T14:57:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of transport. It is clear that the ONR will now be inheriting from the
HSE not only road transport but rail transport, which previously came
under the ORR and the rail regulations. It is also clear in this draft
that the ONR will cover shipping. However, aviation is a rather
difficult issue. Although not much civil nuclear material will be
carried in aircraft, some will be, and, if the ONR is not the regulator
for its transportation by air, it needs to be made clear who is. At a
quick glance, I could not see whether the CAA’s responsibilities
covered this, and the Minister may be able to put me right on that, but
we need to know whether, if I am suggesting that we also cover air
transport, where that responsibility

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, on the comprehensiveness of his amendments. When we
approached this Bill, I was rather under the impression that there had
been so much thinking about the creation of the new independent body,
the ONR, and so much discussion about it that allotting most of
today’s session to considering it was perhaps a bit excessive.
However, having studied his amendments—and no doubt there will
be others who will wish to make points—I think that the
discussion may well take us until 6 pm, although I hope not.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070456000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000079">I approach this from a
number of different standpoints. First, I think that I am the only
Member of the Committee who took part in the debates on the Nuclear
Installations Act 1965. That was a few months after I had been elected
to the other place, but I have since reminded myself of the provisions
of that Act, which are very comprehensive. They have been amended down
the years since then—through the lovely system of LexisNexis,
one can get a very good summary of what the Bill originally was and how
it has changed with time. Therefore, to take issue with the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, I think that the main licensing provisions of the 1965 Act
are still going to be enforced and are not repeated in this Bill. It is
assumed that the authority, the ONR, will have those licensing
provisions. There is a substantial area where people will need to look
back. That is the first thing.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070456000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000080">Secondly, before I
entered Parliament I was an employee of a large chemical company and
one of the things that we did was to supply CO<Sub>2</Sub><Sub>
</Sub>to the Magnox nuclear power stations to be used as a cooling
material—  
<?notus-xml column=482?>I will refer to that later. I have also been one of those who over
recent years have been pressing very hard for this change to the ONR to
take place. The case that had been very firmly made to me was that
remaining part of the Health and Safety Executive meant that inevitably
inspectors on the nuclear regulation side were civil servants and thus
bound by Civil Service terms and conditions. In fact, experienced
inspectors are very valuable people, much sought after around the
world. They have been though a long period of training and have a lot
of experience. Sometimes people will say an inspector is not really
fully qualified unless he has been doing the job for about 20
years—and that has been said to me by more than one person.
Therefore, there was considerable pressure from this part of the HSE,
the nuclear regulatory part, to separate. I heard those arguments and
paid considerable attention to them. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, may
remember that when the Select Committee interviewed Dr Mike Weightman,
I raised this point and he was very kind to acknowledge that some of us
had indeed been pushing this case fairly hard.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070456000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000081">That is how I approach
the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. He makes some
good points but I hope that he will forgive me if I point out that some
of his amendments may indeed perhaps not quite be what he intended or
envisaged. However, as I make these criticisms, no doubt he will have
good answers. To take the amendments in the order in which they appear
on the Marshalled List, the first with which I take issue is Amendment
38D. The noble Lord made quite a point about associated sites and of
course he is quite right to refer to the issue—it is in Clause
57(1)(a)—but, as he readily acknowledged, his amendment may go
deeper and wider than he perhaps intended.</hs_para>

previous point. The distillers company for which I worked produced
CO<Sub>2</Sub>,<Sub> </Sub>originally as part of the process of
fermentation but eventually as a chemical process, and supplied it<Sub>
</Sub>to a large number of different industries, not least, of course,
the drinks industry. It would be absurd to regard those distilleries
and factories as anything to do with the nuclear industry. Of course,
when the material is delivered to the nuclear power station it has to
be of nuclear quality, which is, quite rightly, properly
regulated—but it is not the site where it is made that is
regulated but the material that is delivered. No doubt there are many
other
examples.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000083">I
have recently ceased to be honorary president of the Energy Industries
Council, which represents something like 600 firms in the energy supply
chain businesses, of which nuclear is clearly one. On the rare occasion
I was asked to talk to them, I always made the point that they had to
make sure that they were producing materials and products to nuclear
standards. This was something that quite a number of the firms found
quite difficult to do. Those standards are higher than most other
engineering standards, particularly for pieces of equipment, but that
does not mean to say that the sites where they are made become nuclear
sites. I hope that my noble friend the Minister will feel that it would
be quite wrong to expect the ONR to go around inspecting sites where no
kind of nuclear hazard could conceivably exist.</hs_para>

agree with the noble Lord. I do not see why this should not be extended
to air transport. There must be occasions when nuclear materials are
transported by air, although probably not very many, and clearly that
should be within the remit of the ONR. That seems to be a reasonable
change, but I have criticisms of some of the other
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070456000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000085">Amendment

is my impression that the nuclear regulator has always been able to

There are long and substantial memoranda of understanding that cover
that sort of field. I have made it my business to get a copy of the
current memorandum of understanding between the HSE, which was the body
that was running what is to be the ONR under this Bill, and the
Environment Agency. When I came to print it out, it was 14 pages and

shall not read more than that, but the annexe to the memorandum goes
into very considerable detail as to how it is to be done. Presumably
these will all remain in force. They may have to be signed by different
people because the organisations will be different. The one that I have
in my hand was signed by the noble Baroness, Lady Young of Old Scone,
when she was chairman of the Environment Agency, and by Timothy Walker,
the then director-general of the Health and Safety Executive. If there
are to be modifications in the memorandum, they will need to be signed
by the current people. I hope that my noble friend may be able to
address
that.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13070456000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070456000086">Amendment
40N would not be right. It would risk all sorts of difficulties,
duplication and so on. In particular, it would risk classifying a site
as licensed before a nuclear site licence is granted. I heard what the
noble Lord said about that, but of course there is the elaborate
process of the generic design assessment. He referred to Hinkley Point
C. That has been absolutely combed over by the existing nuclear
regulator. It was a hugely important step forward when it finally gave
approval of the design, but the noble Lord is right that there is not a
site licence yet. That will be the last stage. To argue that all this
should be taken into account  
<?notus-xml column=484?>without taking account of the whole GDA process seems a little unreal.
Therefore, I say yes as regards air transport but I suspect that the
other elements may not be quite what the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
intends. I hope that my noble friend may be able to take account of
these
representations.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_04_PT_1/F415F73E908312B7231FA3E7312DFFB0CEC82519" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 4 July 2013">Thursday,

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I congratulate my colleague and
noble friend on the rigour with which he has approached this area. It
is the nature of probing amendments to make sure that what it says on
the tin is what the Government are going to do. If we can get it right,
we can avoid the kind of problems which I encountered many years ago as
a constituency Member. I picked up the local newspaper to be told that
the local authority rubbish tip near one of my villages was a nuclear
dump. I then had a terrible job trying to find out who was responsible
for the nuclear element within it. It transpired that it concerned a
lecturer at Stirling University and that all we were really talking
about was the lowest of low-level waste coming out of the radiology
departments of the local
hospitals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:12:55"></hs_TimeCode>. For
about 20 minutes, it afforded one of the local hysterics an opportunity
to parade his anxiety about all things
nuclear<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:13:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, it also indicated that there is an awful lot of loose talk.
Therefore, if at this stage we can make the issue of associated sites
clear and explicit, and even if it is a somewhat tortuous process, as I
think my noble friend has indicated, that will be
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:13:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000002">We
should not lose sight of the fact that, at some stage or another, a lot
of low-level waste is gathered together and taken to Drigg, where it is
treated. As we say in Scotland, “Many a mickle maks a
muckle”. You end up with a whole lot of little bits of
radiological and nuclear waste being brought together on a site and
being treated. Therefore, it is important that we differentiate between
that which is a nuclear site and that which is
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:14:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

throughout, for example, the generic design assessment process, which
looked at the two new forms of reactors that we may well see in the UK,
the Environment Agency walked step-by-step with the nuclear agency at

point that I wanted to get at here is that we know that there are
problems with the successor agency. There is a proliferation of
agencies with which the nuclear agency will have to be associated and

Minister, probably somewhat tortuously, to make the matter quite clear.
In this day of judicial review and the like, what we say in these
Committees, when we are being sensible and relevant, is of some
significance outwith this place. Therefore, it will be guidance for
people. I still have some sympathy for constituency MPs confronted with
the prospect of a nuclear dump in their back yard. In my constituency,
it was almost in the field where we believe the Battle of Bannockburn
was fought, but it was not quite. They did not need to use nuclear
weapons in 1314, although we might have to use something akin to them

issue about sites and the checking of sites. Wherever the check can
come on the product, one is in a much stronger position. My noble
friend’s point is that, in many cases, the site is actually not
a nuclear site at all but the product is provided for a nuclear
installation. In those circumstances, it is very important that any
consideration of the checking of sites should be limited to those which
one has to check and not include those which one does not. That is more
important than one might think, given how difficult such checking

I support the point made by the noble Lord, Lord O'Neill, as I was also
previously a Member of Parliament—for a constituency with two
nuclear power stations. It is interesting how quickly people become
happy to have those nuclear power stations once they understand the
situation but how easy it is to stir something up when you have them.
The only way to overcome those things, as I know the Minister will
understand, is to have absolute clarity and to state matters in a form
and in language that people can understand.</hs_para>

we sought planning permission for Sizewell B, I held nearly
50 parish meetings. The trick was that the only people who could come
to those meetings were people who lived in the parish, so the
peripatetic protesters could not arrive and we could have a proper
conversation. The protesters had to go to their own parish meetings. At
most of them, they were well known and not altogether liked. Therefore,
the discussions, considered and reasonable as they were, ended up with
all those parishes supporting the opening of the new nuclear power
station<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:18:51"></hs_TimeCode>. My

simplicity and clarity with which we discussed the issue. I hope that
in answering what I think has been an interesting debate, particularly
the discussion between the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and my noble friend
Lord Jenkin, she will give us an assurance that we will continue to be
as clear as possible. This is a very dangerous area in which to be

10 miles due north-east of Sellafield. I also regularly use the A66,
which is used by vehicles carrying nuclear materials and waste, and I

shall start by reflecting on what my noble friend Lord Whitty said. It
is good to see that the department has taken these issues seriously in
the Bill. His amendments are extremely constructive and helpful in
strengthening what the department obviously takes seriously, and that

I may make a couple of observations. First, I should like to pick up on
what the noble Lord, Lord Deben, said. The Minister knows about my
preoccupations with the recycling and waste process. I believe it is
essential always to remember that this is a national responsibility and
that we have to be certain that the sites selected are the
best—or, at any rate, the least worst—available in the
United Kingdom. It is irresponsible to get this tangled up with
localism, local responsibility and so on. It is quite unfair to place
on a local authority and local representatives responsibility for
strategic decisions on such an important national issue. This is a
national responsibility and we must approach it in that
context<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course it would be appropriate, at the right time, to get involved with
local authorities on the implications, but we have to be satisfied that
we are acting responsibly as a
nation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000014">Secondly,
I have often reflected in life that one of the problems that we run
into as legislators is that we are inclined to think that legislation
provides the answer. Of course, it does not. Legislation at its best
underpins what should be in society’s behaviour and enhances the
opportunities for good, effective professionalism and so on. Inadequate
arrangements work exactly in the opposite direction and inhibit good
action. Although sometimes with imperfect structures wonderful things
can happen, it is much better and more reassuring to have the best
possible structures and
arrangements.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:22:27"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

matters most is the culture. It has to be a culture shared by workers
and management at all levels. It cannot be the responsibility of only
the safety experts or those named with a safety responsibility or the
inspectorate. That is a losing game; it is like a gamekeeper trying to
catch poachers. The responsibility must be central to the
professionalism and culture of all those involved in this work because
the hazards are considerable. From that standpoint, I hope that in our
deliberations we will look at this sense of shared cultural
responsibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:23:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000016">I
do not want to be sensationalist—it is easy to be sensationalist
in an area such as this—but for those of us who live in an area
like Cumbria there are too many stories of one thing after another
going wrong. We have just had another massive fine imposed in the past
few weeks. We have had stories of lorries coming from the Midlands with
waste dribbling from them all the way across to their destination in
west Cumbria. It is important to make sure that this issue is properly
seized and that there is an indispensable culture of 
<?notus-xml column=487?>commitment in the whole nuclear operation. I want nuclear to succeed but
this is essential to its success and contribution to

final point is simply this: there is probably room for us to explore a
little more the relationship between what we are talking about now and
health. There needs to be full co-operation between all those involved
and those operating the health services in the vicinity. Sometimes in
these areas matters come to light that need attention, and I hope that
that point can be taken on

Lord, Lord Whitty, for his careful consideration of this part of the
Bill. I will start by commenting on questions that have been raised
before going through my notes to be able to answer, I hope, each
amendment that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has raised. The noble Lord
mentioned the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee’s
report. We are extremely grateful to the committee and are giving
careful consideration to their recommendations and also working closely
with them to provide it with further documentation. I hope to get that

proposed installation sites, so the answer is yes. No safety critical

Verma:</Member></B> When my noble friend said 1965, I tried to remember
what I was doing then and I think I was probably playing around
in a nursery playschool. I am extremely grateful for the wisdom and
support of my noble friend and for being able to count on his great
experience when I need information and advice. He is clearly very
formidable in his experience and we all greatly benefit from that, even
though he sometimes poses incredibly difficult questions for me to
answer. One question he posed was whether ONR still has licensing
provisions in the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. The answer is that
ONR will be responsible for enforcing the nuclear safety sections of
the 1965 Act, including, for example, the granting of nuclear site
licences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000023">I am
also extremely grateful to my noble friend Lord Deben for his
contribution. He is absolutely right about engagement and clarity. I
hope that I will be able to respond with clarity to the amendments that
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has raised. I have also learnt a new
terminology today from the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill. I am always
amazed at these debates at what they turn up and I can then
use—probably at an event tomorrow, when I am going to be
speaking on “mickles” and “muckles”. I
perhaps need to get greater clarification on exactly what it means, in
case I end up in huge amounts of trouble.</hs_para>

Judd, and I share sometimes opposing views on the way in which we deal
with waste, but I hope that we remain in constructive dialogue on this
subject. The noble Lord should understand that I still firmly believe
in localism and the involvement of local people in how sites in their
communities are located. While a site is always in the national
interest, we must never forget that those communities have to live with
whatever site is on their
patch.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000025">I turn
to Amendment 38B. The noble Lord has asked that the definition
“GB nuclear site” in Clause 57 should be
replaced by “GB civil nuclear site”. While the
ONR’s role does not extend to regulating nuclear safety on Crown
nuclear sites—as the noble Lord has picked up—such as
those owned by the Ministry of Defence, there is a number of licensed
nuclear sites which are operated by civil contractors for defence
purposes. The ONR will have overall responsibility for these
sites, which include the Atomic Weapons Establishment sites at
Aldermaston and Burghfield and the Rolls Royce nuclear submarine fuel
production plant in Derby among others. Therefore, while I appreciate
the noble Lord’s efforts to add greater clarity to the Bill
here, I do not think that amending it in the way that he seeks will
make the definition any clearer.</hs_para>

the definitions included within Clause 57 to the rest of the Bill. This
amendment, however, is not required, as the terms defined in the clause
are not used without appropriate reference elsewhere in the Bill.
Therefore, the noble Lord should rest assured that the terms are
covered, if not at the front of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13070459000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000193">3.30

part of Amendment 38D requires the Secretary of State to hold and
maintain a list of nuclear sites. The transparency and availability of
quality information to the public is an issue that affects us all and I
am grateful that the noble Lord has raised it. He asked where it could
be put for easy public access. Perhaps I may direct the noble Lord to
the website of the Department of Energy and Climate Change, where,
along with maps of nuclear sites, he will find other
information.</hs_para>

requirement for the Secretary of State to hold such a list of nuclear
sites—I have directed the noble Lord to where it is—and
it comes under Section 6 of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965. That
section was pivotal enough to the operation of the ONR that it has been
redrafted in clearer language, which I think is what my noble friend
Lord Deben was asking for. The language is clearer and it appears in
Schedule 12 to the Bill, on page 180. I hope that that reassures noble
Lords that such a list will continue to be required and maintained in
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000029">The
second half of Amendment 38D seeks to define “associated
sites” in Clause 57(1)(a). I am grateful to the noble Lord for
his amendment. His proposed definition is broader than we intended, and
supporting the operation of any nuclear installation could potentially
expand the ONR’s nuclear safety remit beyond what is intended.
“Associated sites” in the context of this clause was
designed to cover any element of a nuclear 
<?notus-xml column=489?>site that was not a nuclear installation. For example, buildings and
roads, if improperly placed, could have the potential to affect the
safe evacuation of a site. Although we see the benefit in defining an
associated site, we are concerned that the noble Lord’s
amendment does not cover the intent of the clause. Therefore, I cannot
accept it as it is, but I will take it away, consider it further and
perhaps return to it at a later
stage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000030">Amendment
38F extends the ONR’s nuclear security purposes to include UK
aircraft transporting nuclear material. I should like to make it clear
that, without this amendment, the transport of nuclear material by air
within the UK, or to or from a UK nuclear site, is already within the
ONR’s nuclear security purposes. The effect of this amendment
would be to extend the ONR’s purposes to UK aircraft operating
elsewhere in the world—on transports with no connection to the
UK or its sites. This is an unnecessary extension to the existing
regulatory system and scope of the regulator, and it would not be
practical to enforce. The security of nuclear material transported by
air outside of the UK will continue to be regulated by the relevant
international regulators under the requirements of international air
safety and security
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000031">Amendment
38J also relates to transport by air—in this case, seeking to
extend the ONR’s purposes to include the safety of radioactive
material transported by air. This function is currently carried out by
the Civil Aviation Authority, with support, by agency agreement, for
certain aspects from the ONR. This is a well established split of
responsibility between safety regulators. It works very efficiently and
will continue to do so with the creation of the ONR. Therefore, it is
not necessary to alter the current approach through the Bill.</hs_para>

to Amendment 38D. It widens the definition of “nuclear
site” to include any sites that are yet to be granted a nuclear
site licence within a list of sites required by Amendment 38D. Under
the Nuclear Installations Act 1965, it is, as I have already said,
against the law to operate a nuclear site without a nuclear site
licence. Therefore, I am slightly unclear about what sites the noble
Lord proposes this amendment would bring within the definition. I will
of course work with the noble Lord to try to address and understand
some of his concerns ahead of Report, if he so wishes.</hs_para>

Amendment 40R relating to parliamentary procedure for regulations made
under Section 18 of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974, which
transfers “enforcing authority” responsibility from the
Health and Safety Executive to the ONR or the Office of Rail
Regulation. The current negative resolution procedure for assigning
enforcement authority status from the Health and Safety Executive to
local authorities or the Rail Regulator is well established and
therefore I do not see good reason for changing this with the creation
of the ONR. I hope that the Noble Lords are satisfied with my responses
and that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty will withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para>

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I will be very happy to withdraw the
amendment and I thank the Minister very much for the clarification. I
think there are still 
<?notus-xml column=490?>things which in some respects are not as clear as perhaps the noble
Lord, Lord Deben, and I would like, and I will quickly go through them.
I am grateful for the support of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, in
relation to air transport and his general intervention. He talked a lot
about the relationships with other organisations, which arise in the
group after next, and that also tempted my noble friend Lord
O’Neill down the same road. If my noble friend does not mind, I
will not respond to that at this point. I am also grateful for the
Minister’s indication about how the Government intend to deal
with the report of the Delegated Powers Committee, and no doubt we can
return to that at Report.</hs_para>

designation of “civil” and the requirement on the list of
sites, I regret that I failed to notice that there is a reference to a
list of sites on page 180. That would be extremely helpful. It would
clarify the issue, because I do not expect anybody would expect the
AWRE at Aldermaston to appear on a civil nuclear site list but I
suspect they might for the Rolls Royce engineering works. I also
suspect there will be others where it is not absolutely clear. I am not
arguing that they should be within the ONR’s remit, but from
first principles, it will not be obvious that it is not. So, while the
list will be helpful, some clarity is still needed.</hs_para>

am still not absolutely clear. Clearly the CAA does have some
responsibilities here, as does the international regulatory authority,
but the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, seemed to say that internal flights
were already covered. Both I and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, could not
see where that is in Clause 59, where it very clearly refers to
internal shipping and internal or territorial waters for shipping and
to rail and road, but not to air. I am not expecting an answer now, but
to me what the noble Baroness was saying did not seem absolutely
clear.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070459000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000037">On the
issue of “associated sites”, clearly my definition is too
wide and I would not expect the ONR to be regulating the activity of
the distillers that are putting bubbles in our bubbly. I think that
operationally there is a need for a definition of associated sites. As
the noble Lord, Lord Deben said, it is more product-related, but
whether they only regulate that at the point where it arrived on a
licensed nuclear site is at the frontier of the ONR’s
responsibility.</hs_para>

establish regarding the pre-licensing activity, which I think the noble
Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Deben, describe—and taking Hinkley
Point as an example—was that the HSE and the ONR as was and the
new ONR have a responsibility well before there is any nuclear activity
on that site. So that is within its area of responsibility. It is not a
licensed nuclear site until the activity begins, but it has a major
role in preparing for that. Therefore, it should be part of the
ONR’s responsibilities. That is all that amendment was

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment deals with relatively
bread-and-butter matters and with the effects of the transfer of
responsibility of non-nuclear health and safety functions on nuclear
sites from the HSE to the ONR. In various ways, we seek to ensure that
there is continued protection for the workers on those sites, even
though the ONR and not the HSE is now the appropriate regulator and
enforcer, and that the provisions of the health and safety Act of 1974
would continue to apply.</hs_para>

unambiguously, for clarity’s sake, that the workers on ONR sites
still have the rights provided under Section 2 of the 1974 Act. I was
involved in the discussions on the 1974 Act. I cannot go back quite as
far as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, did—to 1965—although,
within three years of that Act being passed, I worked on one of the
nuclear sites that it applied to. However, Section 2 of the 1974 act
provides the basic health and safety rights: to information, to
representation through safety reps and to consultation. I am concerned
here mainly with non-nuclear matters on nuclear sites, but I want it
made clear that that provision will still apply to those workers in
relation to both nuclear and non-nuclear matters.</hs_para>

Amendment 38U, which is perhaps a bit esoteric. It deals with existing
compensation schemes for workers on nuclear sites where there is the
issue of existing schemes, particularly in relation to radiation
damage, and where collective arrangements were established 20 or so
years ago. The change of regulations and the change in responsibility
should not alter the ability of workers on nuclear sites to receive the
compensation provided under those schemes, which avoid lengthy and
complex legal proceedings. The Minister is looking puzzled at this. I
am happy to talk to her officials outside but it is important that that
is retained.</hs_para>

Amendment 38T would delete the application to this sector of a change
that was made under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act a few
weeks ago. It was pretty controversial in this House and I suspect that
even those who voted for it here did not expect it to apply on nuclear
sites. Writing 
<?notus-xml column=492?>the implications of that Act into this Bill means that on nuclear sites,
whether for non-nuclear issues or for nuclear issues that are not
specifically provided for in the regulations, there is no ability for a
worker to seek compensation for a breach of statutory duty. Taking the
economy as a whole, “breach of statutory duty” can cover
a wide range of things—we had that debate the other week.
However, that a breach of statutory duty on a nuclear site, for
whatever reason, should not allow the worker to sue for that breach is
not what the public would expect.</hs_para>

sensitivity about this change applying to nuclear sites, whatever the
merits of a general change. Your Lordships can imagine the situation
arising where workers had been affected as a result of a breach of
statutory duty by the management or the contractors on a nuclear site.
If those workers were
unable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:45:00"></hs_TimeCode> to sue
for that breach of statutory duty, there would be outrage in every

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, on the controversial comment that was
just made, I find it very difficult because I do not believe that the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has quite got it right. The sort of error that
would cause there to be a special need to be able to sue would be
suable under the law without the breach of statutory duty, which is a
very narrow statement that you can sue for the statutory duty being
breached irrespective, in a sense, of the effect. The kind of concern
that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has raised, which he does not mention
but is pressing towards, is something that I cannot conceive could
possibly not be available in a law case for someone who was damaged by
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000046">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>
have a particular reason why I hope that the Government will not give
way to this proposal. One problem of nuclear sites—I have dealt
with them for much of my adult life, with Sizewell A and Sizewell
B—is that for the most part they are like any other site. One
difficulty of treating them as if they are always nuclear rather than
like any other site is that often quite unnecessary concerns are
raised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:46:50"></hs_TimeCode>. I always
remember a very small fire in a small shed a long way from the actual
nuclear site, but on the nuclear periphery, and the sort of headlines
that it got, whereas if it had been on an allotment there would have
been no news about it at all. It became a nuclear
accident.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000047">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T15:47:27"></hs_TimeCode>

special exemption here would cause a problem to those of us who have to
deal with those sites, because it suggests that they are so different
from other sites that they should have special protection, of the sort
that we talked about in the previous debate. I hope that noble Lords
opposite will remember that I was not entirely a supporter of the
Government on many aspects of that

not treat such sites any differently from any other sites. However, for
all sorts of reasons, nuclear sites are dealt with differently, and the
whole of this legislation deals with them differently. There is a
highly subjective dimension to it and, in effect, he referred to that.
If there is an incident on a nuclear site, it gets blown out of all

for in the nuclear regulations, whether it concerned an omission
regarding nuclear waste or nuclear material, or some other breach by
the management at a nuclear plant. The reality is that the level of
safety on nuclear sites, not only in respect of nuclear issues but on

seriously and differently. The Bill has a great deal of that difference
in it. The issue I raised was this. The noble Lord referred to
something that was not about nuclear sites but was a general statement
of workers’ rights, and in particular of their ability to sue.
The ability to sue here is based 
<?notus-xml column=495?>on a failure to meet responsibilities in a way that all of us would
deplore. However, it has nothing to do with nuclear matters. Any
failure in the nuclear area is already

the noble Lord that it is not sensible, even in his delicate way, to
give people fears that are not reasonable. This question is dealt with
fully in the Bill, and in other Acts. What the noble Lord is asking for

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I did not expect to convince the
Minister, but before he stood up I had a slight hope of convincing the
noble Lord, Lord Deben. Clearly, I have none whatever now. However, on
a site such as Sellafield there are things that can go wrong that are
not related to the handling of nuclear material but that could be
fairly disastrous not only for objective reasons in terms of the damage
they might do to workers and others on the site, but for the general
reputation of the site. The fact that that would then lead to an
inability to sue for a breach of statutory duty seems wrong. As the
noble Lord, Lord Deben, indicated, I think that it is wrong in other
sectors as well. However, we have special responsibility in going
through the Bill to make sure that the nuclear sector is not
vulnerable to things that government lawyers have changed in
other respects that will have a disproportionately negative effect on
the image of the nuclear industry. For that reason, I am not happy with

the one with the Environment Agency and there are others. When we talk
about the Environment Agency, we must also recognise that there are
also different bodies in Scotland and, shortly, in Wales that have
those responsibilities. All those facets of the ONR’s
responsibility need to be
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000065">Before
I come to the issue of general co-ordination, the first two of these
amendments, Amendments 38G and 38H, deal with a different matter: the
relationship between the ONR and government departments. I was slightly
surprised, to be honest, when I read quite recently the Commons debate
on this, to realise that the ONR was going to have the DWP as its
sponsor and not DECC. The logic of that is that the HSE’s
sponsor is the DWP; some people would query the logic of that but
nevertheless that is the situation. It seems absurd to have the ONR
dealing with such a vital sector of the Department for Energy and
Climate Change’s responsibilities but being the responsibility
of a different Secretary of State—so when we refer to the
Secretary of State in this legislation, the presumption is that it will
be the DWP unless otherwise specified. There are references in the text
to co-ordination with DECC. The amendments suggest that there should be
rather more. Frankly, I would prefer the sponsorship to shift to DECC
and then it would be pretty obvious that co-ordination and joint
activity between the department and the regulator was necessary.
Failing that, we need some sharper requirements on co-ordination
between the department and the
ONR.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000066">Amendments
38K, 38L and 38M concern co-ordination, which can be dealt with through
the memorandum of understanding. It would be useful if the Minister
could provide us—not now but some time before Report—with
a diagram of where all those different authorities interface and who is
responsible for what in relation to nuclear sites. Amendment 40E
requires co-operation as regards the health and safety function, which
is understandable. Amendment 38P requires joint regulation with the
Environment Agency, for example, in relation to design. That was
referred to before: the generic design is actually a joint activity 
<?notus-xml column=497?>between the ONR—or the HSE as was—and the Environment
Agency. Amendment 38S, which deals with offences, recognises that some
of the powers and some of the enforcement have to go to other agencies
under the nuclear regulations. Amendment 40Q concerns Schedule 12,
which deals with the transfer of responsibilities between bodies. The
text refers to the ONR and the Rail Regulator. The Environment Agency,
at least, also needs to be in there because there are some areas where
some future rationalisation of the responsibilities between the two
authorities ought to be
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000067">I
think that I have dealt with most of the major points in this group. I
hope that, while we can have a further debate, people will recognise
that whether we achieve the co-ordination and the understanding between
the agencies via an existing memorandum of understanding or a new one,
it is vital that the legislation reflects the need for the ONR to act
in co-ordination with these other bodies and for the public and
management and workers in the nuclear sector to understand where the
authorities’ responsibilities begin and end. I am not expecting
the Minister to accept all or any of the amendments in this group as
they stand, but this needs to be addressed, at least in some generic
way, in the Bill. I beg to

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I must start with an apology.
I dealt in my earlier speech with arguments which are much more
relevant to the group of amendments to which the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, has just spoken. I sometimes wish that there were a cut and
paste facility for <I>Hansard</I> so that the relevant paragraphs could
be taken out and inserted at the appropriate place. I will not repeat
those arguments as they are on the record, even if they are in the

I must take issue with the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, on Amendments 38G
and 38H. I understand his argument that because the ONR will not be, as
it were, under DECC but under the DWP, there therefore needs to be a
reference to DECC. I ask him to think what the public perception would
be of a clause which said that the operations of the ONR had to be
“conducted in conjunction” with DECC. One can only
imagine the situation that might arise. Supposing there was an argument
whereby the ONR was unhappy about certain aspects of a licence for a
nuclear installation but DECC was seriously worried about the
implications for the country’s security of supply.</hs_para>

my mind, any suggestion that DECC could lean on the ONR to modify its
advice in order to satisfy the DECC requirement would be hugely
damaging. For that reason, the noble Lord’s amendment needs to
be looked at with great care. As I said earlier, the essence of this
part of the Bill is to give the ONR a much greater degree of
independence than it has had so far. That is done for a variety of
reasons, not least of which is that people should have confidence in
its expertise to do what is right to secure the safety of nuclear
installations and all who work there and of the public who live near
them, without showing fear or favour to any government
department<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:07:50"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, in the end, somebody has to bid for the money to provide 
<?notus-xml column=498?>that. That is the role of the DWP and in that sense it is separate from
DECC. However, that should not give rise to any possible suspicion that
the ONR could come under the influence of DECC. That is my view. I
shall be very interested to hear what my noble friend has to say about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:08:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000071">I
have already dealt with the question of collaboration. I am worried
that if there is too much, one will get a clouding of who is
responsible for what. I would not complain in the least if my noble
friend were to agree to the request of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for
a diagram to be produced before Report showing where the lines of
responsibility fall. It seems to me that that would be helpful to the
debate. Perhaps eventually it could be made available for public
consumption, if that appeared to be appropriate. However, one has to be
jolly careful in this area. Some of the issues are dealt with already
in other parts of the Bill—I have no doubt that my noble friend
will refer to that—or in legislative powers that exist
elsewhere. I have again looked through the 1965 Act and some of them
are there, surviving in current legislation. As I said, the memorandums
of understanding are hugely important. Although they may have to be
modified in the light of the passing of the Bill, they should certainly
continue to
exist.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000072">The
question of whether regulators other than the ONR should have powers
and responsibilities for the enforcement of regulations is difficult.
Already, nuclear operators can be prosecuted by two regulators if they
are guilty of offences that offend the legislation of both of them.

circumspection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:10:41"></hs_TimeCode>.

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to refer particularly to the
suggestion that DECC and the DWP should in some sense be brought
together in this. I speak as a former Minister for health and safety. I
also speak from a family background with a great interest in what
happened in the coal industry in South Wales. There is no doubt that
one of the problems of the nationalisation of the coal industry was
that it was always thought that, because it was a nationalised
industry, there was no need to make a real distinction between the
industry and the way in which it was policed. In the early days, that
was not thought to be important because people had a very high-minded
view about what nationalisation meant. I am not going to enter into
that discussion but that was what people thought. They felt that if it
were nationalised there was no need to have too strong a distinction
between the way the whole thing was run because everyone was working
particularly for the benefit of the miners as well as for the customers
outside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:11:56"></hs_TimeCode>. One can

there is no doubt that as time went on it became more and more clear
that you had to be very different. You had to think about the fact
that, whatever else was true, management—even management with
the highest ideals and attitudes—could not really be 
<?notus-xml column=499?>responsible for policing itself. You had to be very careful about that.
Therefore, increasingly we divided it and made sure that the policing
of the system—looking at the mines and making sure that they
were safe—was very
separate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:12:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000075">As
a Minister for health and safety, it always seemed that the most
important thing about our regulation was that it showed that the
ministry responsible for a particular industry had to be second-guessed
right the way up to the Minister. The Minister responsible for health
and safety was not the same Minister as the one who was responsible for
many of the industries which the Health and Safety Executive
policed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:13:12"></hs_TimeCode>. I
always thought that that was terribly important. Inside the then
department of whatever it was, now the Department for Work and

independent difference.</hs_para>

feel very strongly that there is always a suspicion among the public
that the nuclear industry is so powerful and strong that it can lean on
Ministers. I remember that the industry used to act like that. When I
was Secretary of State for the Environment, I got some pretty offensive
interventions by senior people in the nuclear industry because I waited
until I had the full reports as to whether I should give planning
permission for the test drilling of a deep site for nuclear waste. When
I turned that down because the nuclear industry had failed to meet the
requirements of the Planning Acts, I cannot tell the Committee how
rude, offensive and utterly self-opinionated the industry was because I
said, “You haven’t obeyed the law. As the planning
Minister”—not the nuclear Minister—“I will
not give you planning permission because you have not looked at
alternative sites and all kinds of other things”, and I turned
it down. That was done by someone who was known to be in favour of
nuclear power. However, I felt uncomfortable about the two connections
because, as the environment Minister, I had responsibilities which ran
across the
two<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:16:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:15:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lords and particularly to the Minister that it is crucially
important that people do not think that the independent investigation

powerful group. The Department for Energy and Climate Change needs to
be protected from that allegation. Although it is uneasy, peculiar and
odd, and when you first look at it you wonder why—I have every
sympathy with the observation of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that it
does not seem to be fit—as my noble friend Lord Jenkin said, it
is absolutely true that this is the most dangerous thing to do. You
have to have your policemen here and the policed there, and you need
the public to understand that that is the case. It was helpful to have
two nuclear power stations in my constituency because I was able to say
to my constituents that the investigations, discussions and decisions
were undertaken by someone who was utterly separate from the Ministry
of  Energy, as it was at one stage, and then the

Lord Robens, who was then the chairman of the National Coal Board. He

Deben:</Member></B> I agree with my noble friend about that example.
The reason I drew from familial experience was that I was brought up by
a father who had pastoral responsibility for one of the mining villages
in south Wales. For him, that event was most devastating. Although as a
family we were not affected by it, my father was affected by his
memories of what he had to do in those kinds of circumstances. I
remember vividly his comment that you can never trust to police an
industry those for whom the main interest is the industry as a whole.
That is not because they are bad men and women, but simply because they
would have to wear two different hats, and you should not ask people to
wear two different hats. That is why we keep on talking about
declarations of interest and so on. We know that however good and

noble friend—Aberfan remains in one’s heart in a very
special way and will be there until the day one dies, even though one
was removed from it. That is simply because of the effect it had on
people one knew and upon the memories of my father. I feel strongly
that we should not allow the lesson that we should have learnt from the
coal industry to be forgotten in this

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I have some sympathy with the
remarks that have been made, which sets me at variance with my noble
friend. When I was chairing the Trade and Industry Select Committee in
the late 1990s, we went to Dounreay, which has been the subject of many
investigations and problems. Had other colleagues been here, I am sure
they would have be able to embellish this far more than I can. At
Dounreay, there had quite clearly been a failure to scrutinise the
safety arrangements on the part of what was then the Nuclear
Installations Inspectorate. It is 
<?notus-xml column=501?>fair to say that that part of the inspectorate had pretty well gone
native. Dounreay is in a very isolated part of the UK. You
cannot go very much further north without getting wet. It is natural
that everybody was living and working together, playing golf on the
same golf courses, probably drinking in the same pubs and what have
you. They came
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000084">An
independent report had to be carried out. It was carried out and, as
the Select Committee, we wanted to see it. We were told by the DTI
Minister at the time, who I think was John Battle, that it would not be
appropriate for a Select Committee to see it. The DTI was the
sponsoring ministry. The Nuclear Installations Inspectorate was in
those days, as it is now, sponsored by the equivalent of the DWP. It
took the Secretary of State for Scotland, who had environmental
responsibility for the area, to step in and say, “Publish and be
damned”, so we got access to the report. In fact, it was not
anything like as damning as people had anticipated, but it was
essential that it was
produced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000085">There
is a danger in establishing this umbilical link between the sponsoring
department and the functions. We have seen it in agriculture and food
safety in the past. And we have taken strenuous steps to correct it,
but there are still problems. In my experience, the nature of the
nuclear industry is such that it is a secretive industry. It grew out
of the production of weapons-grade material for nuclear weapons. While
it is now under commercial control in a number of respects, it
nevertheless still has a culture of understandable secrecy, partly
because of what would be regarded as security but also because it is so
damn dangerous. The truth is that because of the way in which in the
industry is handled, the dangers are minimal.</hs_para>

culture of the industry is determined not only by security but by
safety. At times, there is a sense in which the industry is covering
its own back as well as trying to protect people. That is natural. Even
today nuclear installations are for the most part in relatively
isolated, secluded areas. It is common knowledge that Sellafield was
chosen during the war because it was most unlikely that German bombers
would ever be able to find the place because it is shrouded in mist and
it is likely to be raining all the time, hence the Lake District. In
those days, it was just a weapons
store.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000087">The
industry has a security culture and a culture that is understandably
and correctly preoccupied with safety, but it is also at times unduly
linked to matters of secrecy where safety can be jeopardised. In my
limited experience, I confronted a situation where there had been
regrettable failures at Dounreay, which have now been corrected. The
report on that was nothing like as condemnatory as people thought it
would be but there was reluctance to have it published. It took an
independent agency, the Scottish Office, and the late Donald Dewar as
Secretary of State—who made it quite clear that he saw no reason
why we should not have access to it—for us to get the report. I
remember that we got a faxed copy of it as we got off the plane in
Caithness. The clerk had summarised it by the time we got to Dounreay

officials.</hs_para>

creating too close a link between the ministry and this function. It is
important that we discuss it and have it aired but I would like to
think that we do not go any further with it because there are too many
examples of departments looking after their own too carefully. The ONR
took a long a long time to come about. It should really have been in
the previous Energy Bill but in those days the DWP and DECC were arm
wrestling over it. It was a turf war. The compromise was that they
would let it go as long as they had a control over it. The DWP conceded
a bit and held a bit and we just have to accept that that is the way in
which the matter was agreed. For the reasons I have given, it would be
desirable for us to leave it to the DWP rather than having a sponsoring
department that might take an overprotective view of what could be at

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>My Lords, when I
heard the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, introduce this amendment I had a
good deal of sympathy with it. It seemed strange that we should be
losing contact with something of such importance but having heard the
last three speeches, I see the strength of the points made by
my noble friends Lord Jenkin and Lord Deben and by the noble Lord, Lord
O’Neill. I hope that on this occasion the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, will think carefully about this
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:27:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Whitty:</Member></B>
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>My Lords, before
the Minister replies, perhaps I might point out that most of this
debate has been about a sponsoring department. I regret making what was
a throw-away remark as a background to this, because none of my
amendments attempt to or could reassign sponsorship responsibility from
one department to another. It is entirely a matter for the Prime
Minister. It is not a matter for regulation. I hope the Minister will
deal with the amendments on their merits because there is clearly an
overwhelming view in this Room on the matter of sponsorship. I am
certainly not pursuing that
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:27:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B>
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:29:29"></hs_TimeCode>I am extremely
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and I hope that I will be able
to allay his fears. In fact, I think my noble friends Lord Deben and
Lord Jenkin and the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, have explained far
more eloquently than I could why it is important that the DWP should
remain the main sponsor body. I am extremely pleased to hear that the
noble Lord, Lord Roper, has been convinced by argument and has changed
his mind. That is the benefit of your Lordships’ House: we can
have these detailed debates which highlight how things can be
illustrated far better by people with far more experience than I
have.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070459000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000092">I
assure the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that DECC will still have
appropriate statutory levers to ensure the effective delivery of policy
areas for which DECC Ministers are accountable to Parliament. Such
independence is a requirement of the European nuclear safety directive,
which has been implemented by the UK.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=503?><hs_para UID="13070459000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000093">I will now address the
other amendments in the group, which have not had as much of an airing
as the noble Lord would perhaps have liked. Amendments 38K,
38L and 38P allow for changes to how nuclear regulations are made, in
particular that they could confer powers on other
bodies.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:30:00"></hs_TimeCode> The Bill
is deliberately focused solely on the ONR and the functions and remit
that it needs to be an effective regulator. It would be a significant
change of focus to make provision for conferring functions and
responsibilities on other regulators and would require changes to many
aspects of the Bill. In addition, any regulations made that covered the
remit of another organisation could be made jointly with them, using
the Bill and another more appropriate legislative vehicle. To that
extent, I take the view that these amendments are
unnecessary.</hs_para>

38M, 38N and 40M allow for general agreements and co-operation between
ONR and other bodies. We have already made adequate arrangements for
the statutory ONR to enter into agreements, such as agency co-operation
agreements and memorandums of understanding, as my noble friend Lord
Jenkin pointed out. It is not necessary for all those relationships to
be laid out in the Bill.</hs_para>

inappropriate for co-operation agreements to be a primary function of
the ONR, as would be the case under Amendment 40E. The ONR’s
principal functions delineate its remit as a regulator, and I do not
agree that they should be diluted by agreements that can already be
made under the Bill without the need for amendment.</hs_para>

Amendment 38Q, as it unnecessarily limits the type of persons who can
be prohibited from working with ionising radiations. Our intent is that
this might include categories of person, such as pregnant women, and
should not be limited only to those who are not a specialist appointed
to fulfil a certain role within the
organisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000097">I
am grateful to the noble Lord for Amendment 38S, which would
have the effect of allowing the creation of nuclear regulations that
could be enforced by others. I appreciate the noble Lord’s
intention behind this amendment, but I hope to reassure him that it is
not necessary. First, the clause to which the amendment pertains
applies to regulations, which can be made only in matters within the
purposes of the ONR. These are matters within the particular expertise
of the ONR, and it is unlikely that any other regulator would have
similar expertise. Clearly, it would not be appropriate for non-experts
to be taking on such a role. Secondly, were the Secretary of State to
agree that some of the ONR’s functions could be better carried
out on its behalf by another body, there is a power in Clause 83 for
the ONR to make the necessary arrangements for this to happen. Finally,
were the Secretary of State to need to make regulations that spanned
more widely than the nuclear regulations allow, a hybrid of two or more
legislative vehicles could be used to allow other bodies to enforce
those aspects which fall outside the scope of the ONR’s
purposes.</hs_para>

colleagues in the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee have
recommended that the regulation-making powers in Clause 63 follow the
affirmative route the first time that they are used. As I said earlier,
I will consider the recommendations with a view to tabling amendments
at Report. I hope that that adequately responds to the noble
Lord’s concerns, and that he will agree not to press the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000099">Amendment
40F is also not needed, as the ONR will already have the power to
appoint any inspectors jointly with any other regulator. The Bill
provides that appointments of such inspectors will be based on their
skill set, not who they work for. Amendment 40L expands the
ONR’s role with respect to compliance with nuclear safeguards
obligations to include facilitating compliance by the Department of
Energy and Climate Change with any safeguards obligations of the
department. I assure the noble Lord that the department does not enter
into any nuclear safeguards agreements acting independently of
Ministers, and therefore the department itself does not and will not
have any nuclear safeguards obligations that are not obligations of
Ministers of the Crown. This amendment is therefore also
unnecessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000100">Finally,
Amendment 40Q is added to allow for responsibility for enforcing the
duties under HSWA to be transferred by regulations to the Environment
Agency or another public
body<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
not an appropriate amendment. The current policy is that provision
would only be made for transfer between ONR and bodies which already
have responsibility for enforcing health and safety
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:34:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the noble Lord will have found my explanations to his amendments
reassuring. The noble Lord asked whether I would provide him and the
Committee with a diagram of the way in which the regulators are laid
out and I am quite happy to do so. I hope the noble Lord will withdraw
his

between now and Report the Delegated Powers Committee report on how

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I join the noble Lord in welcoming what
the Minister said. It is important that the Government give a clear
response before Report to the Delegated Powers Committee’s
recommendations, which affect powers under three important clauses in
this
section<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:36:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000104">I
appreciate the Minister’s reassurances and that she is going to
give me a picture of how all this operates and who relates to whom. I
should have started with that before I began drafting amendments for
this complex part of the Bill. I thank noble Lords who have spoken and
who, by and large, were not in support of writing much into the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with the issue of relations with DECC on sponsorship. However, for the
sake of historical accuracy I should say that the Health and Safety
Executive and its predecessor bodies, such as the nuclear inspectorate
and the Safety in Mind organisation, have frequently been in the same
department as the sponsoring department for all or part of their
activities. That may be tidied up by banging it into a department which
has little responsibility for the industry, and that may be the right
place. However, I reiterate that my amendments do not seek to change
the sponsorship role but to create an important relationship between
ONR and DECC. The two points at which I have inserted them relate to
the nuclear security and nuclear safeguards areas, which are also
covered by international obligations—and the department
negotiating on international obligations, along with the FCO, will be
DECC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Committee’s view is that we should accept the status quo, and I
will withdraw any implication that I or the Labour Party will not stick
with the status quo. Without wishing to upset the general sponsorship
arrangements, there is an issue of whether the legislation should at
least at some point reflect the relationship with DECC as well. This is
not to compromise the independence of the ONR, which is clearly set out
in the early parts of this section of the Bill. I would not want to do
anything to jeopardise that for the reasons that the noble Lord, Lord
Deben, and others have spelled
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000107">As
to the other regulatory bodies, I will look at the map or picture and
see whether I need to come back on any specifics. However, Clause 84
refers to the co-operation between ONR and the HSE, for obvious
reasons. Will the Minister look at that clause—she has no
obligation to respond to this—and consider whether there should
be a general requirement to co-operate with the other bodies operating
within the nuclear area, without going through the specifics of my
individual amendments? With that, I beg leave to withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para>

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, in moving Amendment 38R, I
will also speak to the other amendments in this fairly mixed
group. Perhaps Amendment 38R, and Amendment 38Q with which
we have just dealt, should have been in the earlier group relating to
workers in the nuclear sector. However, Amendment 38R deals with the
provision that the ONR would have the ability to prohibit the
employment of certain people under paragraph 10 of the schedule.
Paragraph 9 provides that employment can be restricted to those who
have met appropriate qualifications. I therefore wonder why we need the
additional provision here; it is a relatively technical
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070459000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000109">Amendment 38V would
make clear that the ONR is not seen as a Crown agency, whereas the HSE
for most purposes is seen as a Crown agency or at least as a body which
is an emanation of the state. Even where other regulators are public
corporations in the form of their incorporation, there is no denial of
their Crown status in legislation. I wonder whether this is simply to
ensure and underline the fact that ONR employees will no longer be
regarded as Civil Service employees, and therefore the inspectorates
and highly technical skills that are needed by the ONR in the nuclear
field can be rewarded at, probably, substantially higher rates than
would be allowed under the Civil Service pay
structure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:44:03"></hs_TimeCode>. That
seems a slightly heavy way of ensuring that one could make appropriate
market-rate payments to a very small and important sector. I hope that
I can get clarification on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000110">Amendments
40H and 40J relate to the provision of training, which is of course
another important aspect. You do not need the quality of staff only
when you recruit and pay them, you also need to continually update them
within the ONR with the best possible training. Clause 8 provides that
the ONR may provide training, whereas the HSE’s provisions, the
equivalent of the Health and Safety at Work Act, provides that the HSE
must provide
training<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:45:02"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:44:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 40J makes it clear that training is appropriate and
relevant—it is not training for anything—but the lack of
a requirement on the ONR to provide training needs to be

amendment in this group, Amendment 40P, deals with the issue
of staff coming out of the Civil Service. In general, if they are
getting paid better and are on better terms and conditions, I suspect
that 
<?notus-xml column=507?>those staff, at least in immediate terms, will be quite happy to leave
the Civil Service. However, there are important issues of seniority,
access to pensions, and dates of retirement which need to be preserved
in this transfer. Although there are correct references to the TUPE
provisions or equivalent in this Bill, “or equivalent” is
normally interpreted as the provisions that the Cabinet Office lay
down, which effectively means that transfers within Civil Service
bodies are covered by the equivalent of TUPE.</hs_para>

is not clear whether transfers from a Civil Service body into a new
public body, which is explicitly deemed not to be the Civil Service,
also means that the staff retain the same seniority that they would
have if they were still part of the Civil Service. That is important.
Although some of these staff are extremely specialist, some may wish to
return to the Civil Service at later stages in their career. Therefore,
their entitlements as civil servants need to be preserved however they
may be treated in a period in which they are on the staff of the ONR as
a non-Civil Service
body<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:47:06"></hs_TimeCode>. These
points need to be clear and they need to be tidied up, because this
ought to be a relatively seamless transfer. However, there are some
loose ends and I hope that the Minister can reassure me on these

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the noble
Lord, Lord Whitty, for allowing me an opportunity to clarify some of
the points he has just raised. Amendment 38R, when read with
Amendment 38Q, as the noble Lord rightly said, seeks to
limit the indicative list in Schedule 6 so that it can make reference
only to nuclear regulations, including provision to restrict employment
on the basis of qualifications or experience. The reason that broader
provision has been included in the Schedule is that nuclear regulations
may need to specify situations where individuals cannot do certain
jobs—for example, pregnant women working at greater risk from
ionising radiations, or restrictions on employment for certain types of
person for security-critical posts. While Schedule 6 is only
an indicative list, it would be a retrograde step to remove the
examples in paragraphs 10(a) and
(b).</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000114">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:48:21"></hs_TimeCode>
38V in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, seeks to remove the
explicit provision in the Bill stating that the ONR is not a Crown body
and that its property is not property of the Crown. The decision to
include specific provision in the Bill to establish the ONR as a body
outside the Crown was not made lightly. It is, however, integral to the
policy of creating a more independent, flexible and efficient
regulator. Most notably, the position of the ONR outside the Crown
enables its staff not to be classified as civil servants. Recruiting
and retaining skilled specialists is crucial for the ongoing
effectiveness of ONR and Civil Service restrictions on pay and
recruitment pose a serious risk to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000115">Clause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:49:10"></hs_TimeCode>
76 includes a power for ONR to provide training which relates to its
purposes. For example, if new regulations were brought in, it might be
appropriate for ONR to provide training to duty holders on new
requirements. Alternatively, if ONR has access to certain safety or
security expertise of limited supply on the open market, it might be
appropriate to make 
<?notus-xml column=508?>best use of this by offering training to up-skill the regulated
community. Amendment 40H seeks to make this power a duty. While the
provision of training by the ONR might be a useful and effective tool
to promote safety or security, it is not a core function of the
ONR. By making this a duty, it could divert valuable resource away from
its core regulatory
functions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:49:43"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:50:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
Amendment 40J seeks to ensure that the ONR carries out only appropriate
and relevant training. The ONR’s power to provide training is
already limited to its purposes; therefore, I am confident that the
Bill already focuses sufficiently on the ONR’s role in this
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000116">Finally,
Amendment 40P seeks to protect ONR staff’s continuous service
should they move in and out of the Civil Service. I reassure the noble
Lord that pension rights of ONR staff will be preserved under existing

thought that it was something to do with security, with a big S, and

the issue of the Crown, it seems to me that there are not many other
bodies that are public bodies which have that explicit divorce from the
Crown. I am not sure whether in shrinking the state, as the coalition
intends to do, there is a whole range of these coming up. I assume that
the ONR will never be privatised and that this is, as the Minister and
I indicated, really a ruse to pay people more, which is
necessary—although it is necessary for a number of other
regulators, not excluding the Environment Agency’s nuclear
staff, which will not be met by this change. I will not take it further
now, but it is peculiar, and we will keep a 
<?notus-xml column=509?>weather eye open for any other use of this in relation to public bodies.
We may have to consider at a later stage whether it is

do not want the ONR to be diverted on training, but it is the
employer’s responsibility to ensure training; it does not
necessarily have to provide it itself. It is explicit in the Health and
Safety at Work etc Act and necessary in the HSE that the organisation
has a responsibility to make sure that its people are trained up to
full modern requirements. That is every employer’s
responsibility but, in relation to nuclear regulation, it must be a
particularly acute responsibility, which the employer ought to accept.
So I do not really accept the Minister’s complacency about
leaving “may” there, when “must” would
reflect the status quo and what I hope is the reality of the

sickness or other extraneous grounds. I accept that it probably is not
a point which needs to be covered in legislation. I do not think that
it is a trivial point and may not be a trivial point for some of the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, this group is fairly straightforward and
deals with the structure of the board of the ONR. The amendments allow
us to move to increase the minimum number of non-executive members by
one and to provide that among those non-executive directors there
should be experience of the nuclear sector. The amendments in the name
of 
<?notus-xml column=510?>the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, probably express that slightly better than
mine and I therefore hope that the Minister, if she does not smile on
mine, will at least smile on
his<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:57:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendments also propose that the ONR board reflects at least some of
the structure of the organisation from which it is coming. The HSE has
always operated on a broadly tripartite basis, with employers, trade
unions and representatives of workers represented on the Health and
Safety Commission. The shadow ONR within the HSE also reflects that
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000127">I
recognise that the Government are not that keen on trade unions and
that regrettably, for the first time ever since 1974, through periods
of government of every hue, this Government did not consult the TUC on
the latest appointment to the board of the Health and Safety
Commission. However, they appointed a trade union person to it.
Therefore, they obviously continue to have some belief that the
tripartite nature of the organisation is helpful. I think that that
needs to apply also to the ONR, which operates some of the HSE’s
non-nuclear functions and all the HSE’s nuclear functions.
Therefore, it should be explicitly representative of people with
experience as employers and people who have experience of representing
employees—which, by and large, will involve trade
unions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:58:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000128">It
is very important to understand that the sector which the ONR will
regulate is still quite a highly unionised sector. Although there have
been difficulties, the co-operation between the workforce and the
management is very important, which has been greatly appreciated at
most points during the history of the nuclear sector. It also has been
one in which the HSE has helped, by its structure of governance, to
ensure that there is co-operation between the workforce, the management
and the Government in relation to the management of the nuclear
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T16:59:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000129">Whether
in broader terms they like it or not, the Government would be wise to
ensure that there is representation of the two sides of industry, as we
used to say, in the nuclear industry and in the regulator which deals
with the nuclear industry. Amendments 38V to 38X clear the ground for
that and Amendment 38Y provides for it. I also support the amendments
in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, which, as I have said,
perhaps are a better way of expressing the absolute necessity for
people on that board to have experience of nuclear safety in operating
their functions on the board. I would be interested to hear the

Lord, Lord Whitty, for his kind remarks about the two amendments which
stand in my name. It is very important, when you are setting up a board
of this kind, to have a proper balance between executive and
non-executive members. We are in an interim position concerning the
executive members. The chief inspector, Dr Mike Weightman, retired
earlier this year, and that was a considerable loss. He established not
only a huge personal relationship but an important overseas
relationship with the regulator in this country. There is great
admiration from many nuclear countries 
<?notus-xml column=511?>overseas for our system of regulation, and a succession of chief
inspectors, not least Dr Weightman himself, have made a major
contribution to

the other hand, I do not agree with the amendment of the noble Lord,
Lord Whitty, that there should be appointments from the NDA and the
other body mentioned. They seem to me to be much too directly involved
in the work of the board and of the ONR. They are among the regulators,
and that is probably not right. There are a number of experts from
academia and elsewhere in industry who could fulfil that role without
having to look to the Government’s own bodies to provide people
for the board. Under my amendment, at least one of them must have
experience in the matters which concern the board. That would

38W increases the number of non-executive directors on the ONR board

These amendments would result in the ONR’s board having a

small organisation. Amendments 38W and 38X accommodate
Amendment 40A of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, which empowers the
Secretary of State to appoint an executive member nominated by the
Environment Agency or a member nominated by the Nuclear Decommissioning
Authority. Although I fully appreciate the importance of the ONR having
a strong working relationship with other regulators and relevant
bodies, including the Environment Agency and the Nuclear
Decommissioning Authority, such relationships are already in place and
we expect them to continue when the ONR becomes a statutory body. The
Bill does not prevent persons recommended by those organisations being
appointed as non-executives, so I do not feel that the amendments are

also need to look at areas such as finance, audit and project

extensive range of relevant skills and expertise who have reached or
are approaching retirement age. Such sums that the ONR might decide to

now turn to the amendments tabled by my noble friend Lord Jenkin. These
concern the expertise and experience held by the ONR’s
non-executive directors in the areas of nuclear safety and nuclear
security. Amendment 39 is designed to enable more than one
non-executive director with security experience or expertise to be
appointed to the ONR board, and Amendment 40 requires at least one
non-executive to have experience relating to the ONR’s safety

drafted, the legislation gives the ONR a skills-based board, ensuring
that there is a balance of individuals with the necessary experience

ensure that the ONR’s security interests are carried out in the
context of wider national security policies, the legislation makes it a
requirement for the board to have one non-executive director with
relevant security experience. The legislation also enables more than
one such non-executive to be appointed by the Secretary of State. I
therefore reassure my noble friend that the current wording of the Bill
does not limit the ONR board to simply one member with security
experience or expertise, and on that basis I hope that he recognises

who was globally recognised, particularly given the work that he did

ONR is an organisation whose role is predominately concerned with

a number of

that I did not refer in my opening remarks to the last three amendments
in this group, which deal with cross-appointments. They would not be
compulsory, but the Secretary of State should have the option of
appointing people from other bodies with a role within the nuclear
industry. It would be helpful to have something like that in the Bill,
as co-ordination between agencies is aided by having non-executive
directors who cross-represent. We do too little of it and, as a result,
we have turf wars and misunderstandings between agencies. I could bore
the Committee with some of those from my experience as a non-executive
director of two such agencies and as a Minister. I agree that the
Secretary of State should not be bound to do this, but the Bill should
at least point him in that direction and I am disappointed that the
Minister does not accept that.</hs_para>

pensions, this was a probing amendment. Very few regulators pay

level of expertise and knowledge of the law, and of the technical and
scientific areas, in which they operate. I am therefore a bit surprised
that the Minister is not prepared to accept something like the
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. It also means that the
success of the Health and Safety 
<?notus-xml column=514?>Executive over 40 years—it has been a great success, since it has

there were people representing the unions as well as the

point of non-executive directors is that they can, on equal terms,

representation, it may not have the structured or corporate state kind
of formal representation that was there in the origins of the HSE,
although I regret the passage of that. In reality, they ought to have
been able to reproduce the culture of the Health and Safety Executive

that Amendment 40C is the lead amendment in the final group for today.
This group 
<?notus-xml column=515?>deals with aspects of the financial structure of the ONR. I am not sure
that even the totality of 60 pages of regulations and another 60-odd

40C is pretty straightforward. I cannot see in the reporting mechanism,
although I am sure that this would be the fact in practice, that the
report that the ONR has to give to the Secretary of State, and that the
Secretary of State gives to Parliament, must include a fully audited
set of accounts. That seems fairly straightforward. If it is there
somewhere else in the Bill, I will withdraw, but it seems helpful to
put it in the formal reporting

40D deals with borrowing. It is a probing amendment. I do not, in
principle, object to the ONR being able to borrow, but it is not a
provision that we find very frequently in the powers of regulators. We
know that there has been some indication that the amount of public
funding that the Government will give to the ONR—directly out of
the taxpayers’ pocket, as it were—will be £35
million a year, I think, potentially rising to £80 million. It
is a fairly hefty whack and a very important
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000155">The
ability to borrow over and above that, and the ability to charge fees,
is pretty unusual in a regulator. Can the Minister give us some
indication of what she expects the total expenditure to be, not just
the taxpayers’ and the fee income, but the total expenditure,
roughly, of the ONR in its early years of operation? How much of that
does she expect will need to be raised through borrowing? This is quite
a delicate area. I am sure there are some public bodies that can borrow
but, generally speaking, not
regulators<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

speakers on previous amendments have emphasised the absolute necessity
of the ONR being independent. There is a wider issue of conflict of
interest over whom it would borrow from and what obligations that
borrowing would provide. It is presumably not helpful if the ONR
borrows from the industry it intends to regulate or anybody with
connections to it. If we go ahead with an ability to borrow, there
should be some pretty explicit restrictions on it. If the provision
simply means that the ONR can borrow from the public works system of
loans from the Government, we probably should say so. If it goes
outside that, issues do
arise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0001.htm#13070459000157">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:19:17"></hs_TimeCode>
is not only an industry issue; security and safeguard issues are also
involved. Would<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>
we want it to borrow from overseas sources? Probably not in most
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:19:50"></hs_TimeCode>. In a
subsequent clause we allow the ONR to operate overseas, but should it
be able to borrow money to do so? Again, who will it borrow the money
from to regulate or help regulate someone else’s nuclear sector?
I am suspicious about this. My amendments would delete the lot but I am
willing to listen to something short of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:20:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Before we
finish with the Bill, the Government need to be cautious about this and

Amendment 40G, Clause 34 allows the ONR to charge fees. However, it is
not clear on what basis those fees will be charged. In general, the
Treasury would require regulators to charge fees based on full-cost

not quite the principle on which the HSE operates, but it is moving
towards it. It is, broadly speaking, the principle on which the
Environment Agency operates and it would be useful to know on what
basis it is to charge fees to the industry and to whom in the industry
it is to charge fees. Is it simply the operators of the nuclear sites

79 allows the ONR to provide services to anyone, more or less, provided

overseas. In principle, it may be okay to provide the

responsible—which, as I read it, Clause 79(2) to (5)
allows—but that seems a bit odd. If the expertise and services
it is providing are not in the areas for which the ONR was set up, you
could have all sorts of odd operations. A top nuclear inspector in his
spare time may also be an expert in karate or in almost any area. On
the basis of this clause, the ONR could hire out its services under the

amendments in this group. On Amendment 40G, I am told that
full cost recovery always takes place. However, you have a potential
position whereby a licensee who needs to be properly regulated may be
in financial difficulties and unable to pay the charges that he would
otherwise have to. It may be a rare occurrence but, given that they
attempt a full cost recovery at the moment, there needs to be a
possibility that some essential services may not be paid for on the

am unhappier about Amendment 40K. This point has been raised with me by
the Nuclear Industry Association, which feels that it would be greatly
to the advantage of the UK generally and the ONR in particular to be
able to develop and make the best use of its expertise in markets not
just in this country. The effect of eliminating subsections (4) to (9)
of Clause 79 would be to reduce the ONR to its absolutely
core activities. There is quite a strong feeling that that would not be
to everybody’s advantage.</hs_para>

to the effect of the Fukushima disaster and the great tsunami there,
and I said earlier that it greatly enhanced the reputation of
regulation in this country because of the work of Dr
Weightman—but it goes wider than that. The supply chain for the
nuclear industry is very much concerned with spreading its activities
abroad to increase overseas earnings, and here, too, the ONR could
provide valuable services and should not be prevented by the Bill from
doing so. Of course, it will always be concerned primarily with its
regulatory duties in this country, but it has the expertise, and will
develop increasing expertise, to provide wider services and perhaps

Deben:</Member></B> My Lords, I wanted to build for one moment on what
my noble friend Lord Jenkin has said and take it to a further degree.
This House should be very careful about restricting a body that we have
been careful to construct. There is a terrible habit in your
Lordships’ House, of which there was a good example today when
somebody got up and said to the Minister, “What are you doing
about Egypt?”—as if we were doing anything about Egypt,
or as if we should always do something about everything. It is about
time that we realised that there are a lot of things in this world that
we are not likely to do anything about at all. One thing that we should
not do is to do things about things about which we cannot at this
moment know anything
whatever.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000167">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-04T17:28:34"></hs_TimeCode>
have no idea how this organisation will develop. We have some
suggestions, which my noble friend Lord Jenkin has put forward, which
may represent some of the routes. But here is the idea that we should
be so frightened that we should write down now what this organisation
may or may not do, when it has been carefully built, with a whole lot
of non-executive directors and all sorts of restrictions as to the
nature of the people who run it. I find that one of the problems of
government. I would prefer the organisation to be in the position of
doing rather too much or doing something wrong than not being able to
do what it needed to do, or what came to it, or to take up
opportunities that might arise. We have to be a bit freer on this.
There is a kind of determination to control that we should resist. I
would much prefer this organisation to be sensibly built and then left
to get on with it. So I hope that we resist any suggestion that, at
this moment, we should decide what this organisation should do in two
or three years’ time, or indeed in five or six or 10 or
11 years. It is much better to leave it as it is, and I hope
that my noble friend will resist any such

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I rise in defence of my noble
friend—although we disagreed on the previous amendment. We are
losing sight of what is a legitimate tactic in the process of
scrutinising legislation. In order to have the Government justify what
is in the Bill, we have to ask them to remove things for them to 
<?notus-xml column=518?>tell us why they should be in it the first place. That is what my noble
friend has sought to do in a variety of areas. No one is suggesting
that the ONR will decline the invitation. It seems to be general public
knowledge that one or two Middle Eastern states that are envisaging or
engaged in the development of nuclear power have looked to the United
Kingdom as an independent regulator separate from the supplier of the
kit and the running of the kit which they anticipate having. In order
for us to have a clear understanding of the powers and the
responsibilities of the ONR, we have to use the rather brutal method of
seeking to delete those powers from the Bill so that they can be better
defined. I realise that I have spoken for about two minutes longer than
I should have done, but we are making rather heavy weather of this and
I hope that my noble friend’s amendments will be treated fairly,
as the Minister always
does.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000169"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13070459000247" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000247">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> I am extremely grateful that the noble Lord ended
on his last note, because I consider everything extremely carefully,
but I agree with my noble friends Lord Deben and Lord Jenkin that we
must not be so restrictive on what the ONR could do to enhance its
standing in the world. I would like to address the amendments of the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, as they are grouped, so that I can clarify for
him the reason why we are taking the position that we
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000170">Amendment
40C would require that the ONR’s accounts are presented to the
Secretary of State and laid before Parliament at the same time as the
annual report. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, asked whether the accounts
would be made available. Accounts are already required to be audited
and laid before Parliament under paragraph 21 of Schedule 7, and, in
practice, the accounts and the annual report will be published
together. I hope that that answers the noble Lord’s question on
reporting and laying before
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000171">Amendment
40D would remove the ONR’s powers to borrow. This is not an
element of the Bill that it is intended that the ONR would use
frequently, and it can be used only with the Secretary of
State’s approval. It is certainly not a blank cheque, but there
may be instances where the ONR’s work may require extra funding
in the short term to achieve a long-term goal, and in this instance I
believe that the ONR’s power to borrow money, with appropriate
checks and balances, is suitable for an independent public
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000172">Amendment
40G, on the other hand, would seek to require the ONR to recover the
full costs of an inquiry. Laudable though the intention is, we cannot
always guarantee that full cost recovery will be appropriate. The costs
of some inquiries may not be fully attributable to one or even a group
of duty holders. We would not wish unfairly to add extra charges to
business for costs not incurred by
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000173">I am
grateful to the noble Lord for tabling Amendment 40K. It
would remove provision in Clause 79 for the ONR, with
Secretary of State approval, to provide services related to its
expertise but not part of its purposes. My noble friend Lord Jenkin
eloquently articulated how important the provision is, because of the
specialist knowledge that ONR possesses, if resource 
<?notus-xml column=519?>were available, to, for example, assist another country with assessing
the safety of a new reactor design. Under the Bill, ONR could charge
for such work, including at a commercial rate. The provision of such
advice would have real benefits—not just financially, but, as my
noble friend said, by helping to spread the UK’s high standards
of practice internationally and giving ONR inspectors wider
experience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000174">Let
me be clear: the ONR’s first priority will be to meet its
obligations as the UK’s nuclear regulator. Nothing will allow us
to detract from this. My noble friend Lord Deben is right; we must
allow the ONR to get on with its core activities. To ensure that there
are no actual or perceived conflicts of interests, any commercial work
which the ONR undertakes will be only with the consent of the Secretary
of State. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will withdraw
his
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000175"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Jenkin of Roding" PimsId="1169" UID="13070459000248" xid="1291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000248">Lord
Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> Before my noble friend sits down I hope
I may be allowed to say how much we owe to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
for enabling us to have debated a large number of matters during the
course of the afternoon. As I said earlier, I had my doubts about
whether we would take the time. We will stop just half an hour short
and are most grateful to
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000176"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Whitty" PimsId="4591" UID="13070459000249" xid="1139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000249">Lord
Whitty:</Member></B> Flabbergasted as I am, I thank the noble Lord and
others who are saying, “Hear, hear!” I wondered if we
could get through a full day when I started on this process, because,
in principle, we agree with the Government’s broad strategy and
we certainly want an ONR which is effective, independent, vibrant and
innovative. Anything I have said is not intended to restrict that. I am
grateful to the noble Baroness for pointing me to paragraph 21 of
Schedule 7 about the annual accounts. It would be helpful to have them
all in one place, but nevertheless this seems to cover the
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000177">On full
recovery of costs, there will be situations in which regulators cannot
do that. They usually have to explain why to the Treasury, certainly if
it is done on any systematic basis. There will be exceptions, but I
think that the Government have said they will be pursuing the principle
of full recovery of costs. I am not therefore pursuing the argument
that this needs to be in legislation. At least we have a clear answer
that that is the principle and that fees and costs will be covered plus
the Secretary of State’s allocation of grant in aid—or
whatever we call it these
days.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000178">That
might still leave a gap which presumably is intended by the borrowing
provisions here. As my noble friend Lord O’Neill says, I have
proposed deletion, not to say that I am utterly opposed to borrowing
powers, but to see to what degree the Government are likely to use
them. The Minister has pretty much indicated that they would not use
them that often, but they are there. Given that they are there, I think
that in some capacity or another, the Government—it could be the
Secretary of State in guidance, or whatever—need to be pretty
careful of what kind of borrowing the ONR engage in, because this gets
into the area of conflict of interest.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=520?><hs_para UID="13070459000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000179">This also applies to my
amendments in relation to what services the ONR can sell. Because my
deletions would still leave subsections (1) and (2) of the clause,
which allow the ONR to sell services anywhere in the world which relate
to its areas of purpose—that is, nuclear safety in the widest
sense—all the objectives of selling services to other states
that are interested in developing nuclear power would be allowable,
even if my full deletion was accepted. I am worried about a provision
that says we can also sell services to anyone anywhere that are not
related to our purpose. That seems to allow for a money-making venture
which is not really related to the role of the
ONR.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070459000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000180">At the
end of the day, through all of this, we have to remember that the ONR
is a regulator. As a regulator it has to be cleaner than clean. It has
to have clear sources of operation; clear standards to which it
operates; clear standards for the qualification of its staff;
and—yes—some limitations on what those staff and the
organisation can do. To retain a genuinely world-class regulator in a
very difficult and delicate field, we need to be careful not to allow
any loopholes which allow a conflict of interest to be claimed, even if
it is not for real. I am a bit suspicious about the issue of selling
services. I think the Government should reflect on it. For now, I am
happy to complete this stage—only 20 minutes in advance,
regrettably—and beg leave to withdraw my
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13070459000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-gc0002.htm#13070459000299">Amendment

the House of changes to the Immigration Rules affecting members of HM
Forces and their families, which will be laid before Parliament in
September to come into force on 1 December 2013. Full details are
included in a Statement of Intent which I have published today. Copies
are available in the House Library and on the Home Office

Immigration Rules affecting non-European Economic Area (non-EEA)
nationality family members of British citizens and persons settled here
were implemented on 9 July 2012 as part of the Government’s
overall programme of reform of immigration routes. Those changes aimed
to ensure that non-EEA family members seeking to live in the UK will
not become a burden on the taxpayer and will be able to integrate
effectively in British society.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070447000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-wms0001.htm#13070447000006">Under temporary
transitional arrangements, non-EEA family members of British citizens
serving in HM Forces were exempted from the family Immigration Rules
changes pending a review of the rules affecting all non-EEA dependants
of HM Forces personnel, including family members of Foreign and
Commonwealth citizens serving in HM Forces. That review has now taken
place and has produced a single set of Rules covering the non-EEA
family members of British service personnel and also the families of
Foreign and Commonwealth citizens serving in HM Forces (including
Gurkhas discharged since 1 July 1997). The new Rules will cover the
dependants of service personnel currently dealt with under Parts 7 and
8 of the Immigration Rules. They are intended to align the treatment of
non-EEA family members of service personnel with the general approach
to family immigration. At the same time they aim, so far as possible
and appropriate, to treat all non-EEA dependants of service personnel
in the same way, irrespective of the immigration status of the sponsor.
And finally, they make special arrangements, in certain respects, to
cater for the situations brought about by overseas postings which are a
feature of service life.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13070447000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-wms0001.htm#13070447000007">With effect from 1
December 2013, the following rules will apply to Armed Forces
families:</hs_para> <hs_WAIndent>Service personnel
who wish to sponsor their non-EEA dependants to enter or stay in the UK
must meet a minimum income threshold of £18,600 for a partner,
£22,400 for a partner and child and £2,400 for each
additional child.</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>A basic
English language requirement will also apply to all non-EEA partners
seeking to enter or stay in the UK. This will be in line with the
current such language requirement which applies to the partners of
civilians and of serving British personnel.</hs_WAIndent> 
<?notus-xml column=84?><hs_WAIndent>Non-EEA partners of British and of Foreign and Commonwealth
citizens serving in HM Forces will serve a five year probationary
period before being eligible to apply for settlement.</hs_WAIndent>
<hs_WAIndent>To qualify for settlement, non-EEA partners and children
between the ages of 18 and 65 will have  to demonstrate a
knowledge of language and life in the UK. This will involve passing the
Life in the UK test and holding an intermediate level English language
speaking and listening qualification. This is a new, more robust,
requirement which is being introduced across the immigration system
from 28 October 2013 (as set out in the Home Office
Statement of Intent on <I>Knowledge of Language and Life in the UK for
Settlement and Naturalisation</I> published on 8 April 2013 and
available
at:</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/182545/statement-of-intent-koll.pdf).
Dependants of serving British citizens, most of whom are already
subject to a knowledge of language and life in the UK requirement, will
switch to the new requirement from 28 October. Dependants of Foreign
and Commonwealth citizens serving in HM Forces, who are not currently
subject to the requirement, will be required to meet it from 1
December.</hs_WAIndent>

Family Rules take full account of the principles set out in the Armed
Forces Covenant, which states that service personnel and their families
should face no disadvantage as a result of service. Accordingly, the
new Rules will incorporate the following provisions specifically
designed to accommodate overseas postings:</hs_para>
<hs_WAIndent>Applications may be made from overseas for all categories
of leave under the Armed Forces Rules.</hs_WAIndent> <hs_WAIndent>The
duration of a settlement visa under the Armed Forces Rules will be
extended to 5 years to enable a dependant to apply for settlement
without having to renew their initial visa. This will remove the
financial disadvantage currently faced by those who are overseas where
application fees are more expensive than in the UK.</hs_WAIndent>
<hs_WAIndent>Time spent overseas on an accompanied posting will be
regarded as time spent in the UK for the purpose of calculating the
residence required for settlement.</hs_WAIndent>

remove some further anomalies and practical obstacles inherent in the
current Rules. Where a serving Foreign and Commonwealth member of HM
Forces naturalises as a British citizen, their family will be able to
continue to progress to settlement; they will no longer need to switch
immigration route because their sponsor’s immigration
status has changed. Bereaved non-EEA partners of Foreign and
Commonwealth citizens serving in HM Forces will be treated in the same
way as bereaved partners of British personnel and will be able to apply
for settlement immediately if the sponsor dies in service, even if the
death is not directly attributable to service. And alongside the new
Rules, we will deliver faster grants of settlement for service
personnel on discharge, count reservist time on deployment towards
residency requirements in the applicant’s substantive
immigration status, and 
<?notus-xml column=85?>introduce an Armed Forces specific application form to facilitate
identification and processing of applications from the Armed Forces
community.</hs_para>

arrangements will apply to family members who already hold valid leave
as a dependant of a service person, and to those who submit an
application before 1 December 2013. These are set out in full in the

(bTB) is the most pressing animal health problem in the United Kingdom.
The crisis facing our cattle farmers, their families and their
communities cannot be overstated. Bovine tuberculosis is a devastating
disease which threatens our cattle industry and presents a risk to
other livestock, wildlife species such as badgers, domestic pets and
humans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070447000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-wms0001.htm#13070447000020">This
was once a disease isolated to small pockets of the country. It has now
spread extensively through the West of England and Wales. The number of
new herd breakdowns has doubled every nine years and in the last decade
we have slaughtered 305,000 cattle across Great Britain. In 2012 in
England alone, over 5.5 million bTB tests were performed
leading to the slaughter of 28,000 cattle with the disease costing the
taxpayer nearly £100 million. In the last ten years bTB has cost
the taxpayer £500 million. It is estimated that this will rise
to £1 billion over the next decade if the disease is left
unchecked.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13070447000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-wms0001.htm#13070447000021">The
Government is today publishing a consultation on a draft Strategy for
achieving official freedom from bTB in England. The Strategy, which has
been developed by the Animal Health and Welfare Board for England and
the Bovine TB Eradication Advisory Group for England, draws upon
successful approaches to eradicate bTB around the world, including
Australia, New Zealand, Michigan in the Unites States of America and
the Republic of Ireland. These demonstrate the importance of applying
stringent cattle control measures in combination with tackling any
significant reservoir of infection in wildlife, whether it is water
buffalo, brush-tailed possums, white-tailed deer, or badgers. An
additional factor which has contributed to their success is the fact
that their programmes are either led by industry or delivered by
government and industry, with both parties contributing to the
cost.</hs_para>

the measures applied currently including testing of cattle and other
animals, additional controls in affected herds, and controls to address
the reservoir of infection in badgers. The Government is proposing to
work in partnership with the industry to develop risk-based packages
using all available tools to protect low risk areas of England, stop
the geographical spread of bTB and bear down on the disease in endemic
areas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13070447000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130704-wms0001.htm#13070447000023">As
well as using available tools the Government will continue to develop
new ones. I have already achieved a major success in securing a
concrete road-map from the European Commission on the deployment of
cattle vaccination. I am committed to meeting the minimum timescale but
that is at least ten years away. The Government will also continue to
invest in the development of an oral badger vaccine and in new
diagnostic tests for tuberculosis in cattle and badgers, which could
pave the way for alternative approaches.</hs_para>

bTB will require long term solutions and considerable national resolve.
The Strategy will deliver my ambition to reverse the rising trend in
the worst affected areas of the country well before the end of this
decade, achieve official freedom from bTB for parts of England on the

bTB over 25 years. Our cattle industry and countryside

offer a good deal to savers, I am concerned there may be some –
now or in the future – that do not deliver the standards that
should be expected. Unlike other financial products, people who are
automatically enrolled or automatically transferred into a workplace
pension will not have made an active choice about which scheme to join.
In addition, the long-term nature of pensions means it may not be clear
how good an outcome a scheme will deliver for members until they have
paid into it for many years. It is therefore particularly important
that sufficient protections are in place to ensure that schemes are run
in a way that is beneficial for members. The Government wants to ensure
that every defined contribution scheme used for workplace saving
delivers value for money and meets some essential minimum legislative
standards.</hs_para>

important aspect of this. On 1 July I laid draft regulations to prevent
the use of consultancy charges in automatic enrolment schemes. The
Government also plans to publish a consultation on charges
this autumn, following the Office of Fair Trading’s

This consultation will set out proposals on charges, including for
introducing a charge cap.</hs_para>

Responses to the call for evidence will form an important part of the
