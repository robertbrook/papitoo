twice as many of its small and medium-sized enterprises are involved in

years, and it now has a much more small and medium-sized company focus.

an underlying problem. British exporters are currently doing extremely
well in the big emerging markets. We have rapid export growth to
countries such as Russia, China, India and Brazil, for example, but
exports to the eurozone are weak, for obvious reasons. We accept that
there are underlying weaknesses. We have not had the recovery of export
volume growth that we would expect following a substantial devaluation.
Much of this relates to the way in which supply chains were hollowed
out in the long period of manufacturing decline, but we are trying to
rebuild them through the industrial strategy.</hs_Para>

Council has identified skills shortages as a key problem. As a result
of the adoption of the strategy document, the industry has committed
itself to a significant growth in the number of apprenticeships. We
have already seen a considerable increase, but he is right to suggest
that this is an issue not simply for the big original equipment
manufacturers but for the supply chains, and a lot more needs to be

of £6 billion-worth of new investment. One factor has
undoubtedly been the confidence that the Government are fully
supportive of the industry and are working with it through the
Automotive Council. The confidence factor is indeed spreading into the

that our lightly regulated employment market is an asset to the British

despite the fact that unemployment is still too high, we have seen
employment rates bear up rather better than in some other countries. It
is important that we simplify employment law—I would have hoped

it is also important for a functioning economy that we ensure that

absolutely nothing about the problem. As a result, we went into the

think he misunderstands; the OFT report shows the biggest set of
problems in the industry. I know that much of the focus ends up on the
APR headlines, but the surveys and the consumer organisations working
with the issue day in, day out show the problems around issues such as
affordability assessments, continuous payment authority abuse and abuse
of the way in which roll-overs are used. The FCA has said specifically
that it is looking to plug any gaps in regulation in all those areas

time, money and stress for everybody involved, both employers and
employees, so what we are trying to do through our employment law
reforms is reduce the number of cases going to tribunal. We are
streamlining the rules of procedure, which should also help to reduce
costs, but the really important savings will come from getting more

I welcome the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee’s

Hansard Society’s latest audit of political

and the work of the Backbench Business Committee have been instrumental
in making that happen. I note, for example, that of the 21 petitions
that have reached the 100,000 signature threshold, 20 have either been
debated or are scheduled for debate. We can do more and I have said
that we can. I am sure we can do that not by transferring
petitions to Parliament, with the Government standing back and leaving
the process alone, but by engaging together so that the public can
petition their Parliament while also seeking action and a response from
their Government. I am sure we can work together to make that

low-income families, and wants to ask schools to cover 50% of the
school transport costs for those young people from the pupil premium
they receive. That seems particularly mean and insensitive at a time

rise, so will the Leader of the House allow time for a debate? Does he

she wants to raise this issue on behalf of her constituents, it would
be appropriate to do so on the Adjournment, so perhaps she can seek
that opportunity. However, I entirely share the sense of achievement

fulfilling the coalition agreement to provide an additional £2.5

relationship between general practitioners and the Department for Work

quandary. Atos has decided that she should no longer receive any
benefits because, it says, she is fit for work. She is appealing
against that decision, which is fair enough, but she has been told that
she must provide evidence from her GP. She has been to her GP, who has
told her that Bro Taf local medical committee has declared that GPs are
not in a position to administer or police the benefits system, and
consequently should write no letters—no letters at
all—for their patients for tribunal purposes. That strikes me as
very callous and unfair. It means that not only are people’s

did we carry out the inquiry? We had two main reasons. First, the
private rented sector is growing. In 1999, fewer than 10% of households
rented privately. By 2011-12, the figure was more than 17%. More
households now rent privately than are in the social rented sector.
Secondly, the sector is home to a growing range of people, including,
increasingly, families with children. In view of that growth and the
changing nature of the sector the Committee thought it was the right
time to consider how the sector could better meet the needs of those
who live in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:15:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000305">We
make the point consistently that many landlords do an excellent job and
our efforts should be targeted at the rogues who let substandard
accommodation, often to those in real housing need. During our inquiry,
we visited Germany. We are not calling for the German system to be
adopted en bloc in this country but there are lessons to learn. We saw
the advantages that a mature market brings for landlords and tenants:
widespread understanding of rights, good quality housing and a broad
equilibrium of supply with
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:16:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000306">In
England, in contrast, the rapid growth of the sector has left in its
wake regulation and legislation that was introduced in response to
problems from decades ago. Our report identified a number of areas in
which we believe action is required. First, we call for better, simpler
regulation—not more of it. More than 50 Acts of Parliament and
70 pieces of delegated legislation relate to the sector. The result is
a bewildering array of regulation that few landlords or tenants have a
hope of understanding. That needs to be consolidated in a much simpler,
straightforward regulatory framework. We have seen what the Government
have done to simplify planning regulation: why cannot they do the same
thing in this case? That is an obvious question to ask the Government
and the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:17:09"></hs_TimeCode> Minister
for Housing, who I see on his place on the Government Front
Bench.</hs_Para>

a new regulatory framework is in place, we need to publicise it. The
Government should work with landlords, tenants and agents groups on a
campaign to promote awareness of the new framework once it is produced.
We call for a standard, easy-to-understand tenancy agreement on which
all agreements should be based. Included with that should be a
factsheet setting out clearly the respective rights and
responsibilities of 
<?notus-xml column=1332?>the tenant and landlord. We heard far too much
evidence that people simply do not understand their rights and
responsibilities.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071867000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000308"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:17:51"></hs_TimeCode>We
also say that councils should have the freedom they need to enforce
standards and the law. First, they need more flexibility over the
introduction of licensing schemes. We heard evidence that these are
over-bureaucratic and restrictive in the way they can be used.
Secondly, councils should have the power to require landlords to be
part of an accreditation scheme. We saw an excellent scheme in
operation in Leeds, but the landlords who were part of the scheme and
tenants drew attention to the fact that those landlords who caused
problems were generally not a member of the scheme. Such schemes should
as far as possible be self-funding, with extra charges for those who do
not comply. We must ensure that the overall burden of costs shifts to
unscrupulous landlords and we call for a review of the level of fines
and consideration of the use of penalty charges as ways to improve
standards and act against bad practice.</hs_Para>

addition, we were concerned about public money, through the housing
benefit system, being used effectively to subsidise landlords who do
not meet legal requirements. We therefore propose that local
authorities should be able to recoup housing benefit when landlords
have been convicted of letting substandard property. To ensure we have
a balance and that we are consistent, tenants should also have the
right to reclaim rent paid in similar circumstances from their own
resources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000310">A

Pawsey:</Member></B> Does the Chairman of the Select Committee agree
that one of the most compelling pieces of evidence that we received on
that issue came not in a formal evidence session but when we met
tenants? A person told us that if he and a colleague were to visit an
estate agent’s office where people were selling houses on one
side of the room and letting properties on the other, one set of agents
would be regulated and the other set would not, despite the fact that
both parties going into the agency were looking to do the same thing:
find their own
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000314" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000314"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Betts" PimsId="3992" UID="13071867001270" xid="48" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867001270">Mr
Betts:</Member></B> Absolutely, and the hon. Gentleman anticipates my
next point. In the report, we welcome the Government’s
commitment to a redress scheme, and we hope that our report helps to
shape it, but we felt that we could go a little further. On the exact
point that he makes, it is quite surprising to people who look at the
issue afresh that letting agents are subject to less regulation than
estate agents. We believe that they could be put on exactly the same
basis. A key point is that the Office of Fair Trading has powers to ban
estate agents who behave badly; the same power should be introduced for
letting agents.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071867000315" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000315">We also
looked at the fees charged by letting agents and found that many of
them were unreasonable and unclear. The first step has to be
transparency. Wherever 
<?notus-xml column=1333?>a property is advertised to let—in a window,
on a website or in a newspaper—it should be accompanied by a
full breakdown of the fees that a tenant is likely to have to pay. No
more hooking the tenant with a property that they like, and then, once
they are interested and are looking to sign the tenancy agreement,
letting the hidden fees come out, little by little—drip, drip.
We are talking about costs that the tenant never anticipated, and that
can run into the hundreds of pounds. Also, there should certainly be no
more charging the landlord and the tenant for the same service; that is
completely and utterly unacceptable, and should be
banned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000316">An
important step in bringing the market to maturity and aligning supply
with demand would be to meet the clear need for longer tenancies. The
common industry standard is six months. That might be suitable for many
mobile, younger people; it is certainly not adequate for the many
families in the sector who want a secure home. One renter who came to
give evidence to us told us that their 10-year-old daughter had already
moved house seven times in her life. That is simply not acceptable. If
families move home, it means moving school, and we need to tackle that
sort of
insecurity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000317">We
need to look at and remove the barriers, real and perceived, to longer
tenancies. Limitations in mortgage conditions need to be lifted. We
were encouraged by the news that Nationwide building society has begun
to allow longer tenancies; we welcome that. We have to ensure that
letting agents work with landlords and tenants to make sure that they
are aware of the different options for tenancy length. Too many letting
agents seem to be hooked on getting repeat fees for short lets. They
are almost like the football agent who benefits from constant
transfers, rather than players staying at a club for a long period. In
return for offering longer tenancies, landlords should be able to evict
tenants who simply refuse to pay a lot more
speedily<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:23:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000318" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000318">We
looked at safety standards. Safety is absolutely paramount. Landlords
who let out death traps must face the consequences. The gas safety
regime has gone a long way to making homes safer, but electrical safety
is still a blind spot. The Government should develop an electrical
safety certificate for private rented properties. It would confirm that
wiring had been checked and was in good order, and we think that the
check should take place at least every five years. We also call for a
requirement that all private rented properties be fitted with a working
smoke alarm and a carbon monoxide detector with an audible
alarm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000319" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000319">Placing
homeless households was another issue to which we gave consideration.
Councils can now discharge their duty to homeless households by placing
them in the private rented sector without their consent. When councils
do this, they must ensure that the accommodation is suitable. As a
matter of good practice, they should inspect properties before using
them to house homeless families. We are aware that some councils are
placing homeless households away from their local area. Where this is
necessary, there should be a statutory duty of full discussion,
including sharing appropriate information with the receiving authority
and, of course, with the prospective tenant.</hs_Para>

Government need to look at how the housing benefit bill is spent in the
private rented sector. There are obvious concerns in all parts of the
House about the 
<?notus-xml column=1334?>rising bill. We heard from Blackpool about how the
market has failed there because housing benefit levels are set
artificially high, as the calculation of local housing allowance, which
determines benefit levels, includes surrounding rural areas where rents
are higher. We heard wider concerns about the interaction between
housing benefit and rents. Housing benefits can drive rents up across
an area, which in turn leads to upward pressure on local housing
allowances, creating a vicious circle and increasing costs for the
taxpayer, who picks up the bill. We recommend that the Government
conduct a wide-ranging review of the local housing
allowance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T11:25:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000321" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000321">We
looked at the issue of tax evasion. Very often the tax authorities and
councils operate in different worlds. We called for greater
co-ordination between councils and the tax authorities, which could go
a long way to cracking down on tax evasion, both capital gains tax and
income tax. It would be especially effective in areas where a licensing
or accreditation scheme was in place and details about the landlords
were known. We call on the Government to promote a more joined-up
approach to tackling tax evasion, which would benefit us

am delighted to see you, Mr Speaker, in the Chair for this debate,
which has some historical resonance. In 1642, our legislative
predecessors fought a bloody civil war to control Executive power. They
would be aghast at how their hard-won victory had been eroded and
overturned and at how the Government are still not directly elected yet
control a legitimately elected Parliament, right down to the minutiae
of its daily agenda. They would be surprised at the mindset of many
individual Members of Parliament, many of whom remain blissfully
unaware of the difference between being in an independent Parliament
rather than an Executive sausage machine.</hs_Para>

report to the House that we have examined the work of the Wright
Committee, named after its Chair, our distinguished former colleague,
Dr Tony Wright. I declare an interest, as a member of that Committee.
Wright urged major change, calling on the House to give Back Benchers
more say in setting the House’s agenda. Wright recommended the
establishment of two new Committees: the Backbench Business Committee
and a House Business Committee, which would itself have Back-Bench
representation. Wright also proposed the introduction of elections for
Chairs and for members of Select Committees, and called for various
improvements to the petitions
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0001.htm#13071867000335">The
Wright Committee’s proposals were initially blocked by the then
Labour Government—the heirs to Tom Paine and the Fabians had
long since given themselves up to Sir Humphrey. But then a new
Government—yet to be reprogrammed, and with a radical Leader of
the House—acted swiftly to implement some of the key
proposals.</hs_Para>

is important briefly to recap on some of those proposals, as many new
Members may take as obvious what in fact took years to achieve. They
will need to work hard to retain these minor improvements
and to have a sense of what their generation needs to build for
those parliamentarians who come after them.</hs_Para>

of Select Committees by Members of Parliament in a secret ballot,
rather than their being appointed, was one of the biggest steps
forward. The second achievement was the election of Select Committee
Chairs by MPs in a secret ballot of the whole House, meaning that they
now speak for Parliament and their colleagues, not for the Government
or the alternative Government. Our report welcomes the consequent
advances in the effectiveness and quality of Commons Select Committees,
which is broadly recognised by those who gave evidence to us in our
proceedings. Yet the report says that some issues remain and must be
addressed if the momentum towards an even more effective set of Select
Committees is to be maintained.</hs_Para>

is unacceptable that Government Bills are scrutinised by Committees
appointed by Government appointees not elected or even approved on the

Government Bill Committees. The legislative scrutiny process in
Bill Committees is so unchallenging and so irredeemable that some of us
actually helped to invent pre-legislative scrutiny to try to bring some
order and some sense to it. Our report underlines that pre-legislative
scrutiny must in future be standard practice—an integral and
mandatory part of the process of consideration for every Government
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000339"><Member ContinuationText="Angela Smith" PimsId="4808" UID="13071867001278" xid="886" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867001278"><B>Angela

in many ways, including by Select Committees, elected Committees, or a
properly elected Bill Committee. It is not beyond the wit of Members of
this House to come up with a system that is far better than
having colleagues sitting and reading their newspapers, being told what
to do and not to intervene. It is our role to intervene during the
progress of legislation in order to make it better, and we should not
be told by the Government that that is inappropriate behaviour for

a valuable point, and I suspect he alludes to the lobbying Bill that is
being produced with great haste, although no response has been sent to
the Committee about the work it did over a year ago in examining that
Bill and helping to make it better. Now we are being told that there is
no time for pre-legislative scrutiny. We are trying to squeeze it in
this afternoon, when we have been told that Members can go
home—“It’s a one-line Whip, you can all clear
off”—and we are trying, desperately, to get
proper parliamentary scrutiny of a Bill that has changed considerably,
and answers have not been given to the sensible proposals for
improvement made by the Committee. We are then meant to come back after
the break and dive straight into Second Reading and consideration of
that Bill. It is apposite that at this moment we have a good example of
how not to pass legislation, and to produce, in effect, a dangerous MPs
Bill, as opposed to a dangerous dogs

difficult to imagine that colleagues across the House would not have
recognised the great talent that was wasted by a process
intended to give the Government—in this case the
coalition Government, but it happens in every Government—an easy
ride as the Bill went through Committee. That is not the way to improve

my hon. Friend, who I know wants to make a point about

minority parties, which is in a sense an unwitting casualty of the way
we decided to elect members to Select Committees. That should be put
right, and, to do that, the report makes certain recommendations. One
possibility would be a reserve place that the Speaker could nominate to
remedy any obvious injustice, but there are many other possibilities.

powers, which allows an independent legislature to hold the Government
to account. That is all we ask. Gladstone once said that the role of
Parliament is not to run the country, but to hold to account those who
do. It is an absolute injustice, and it flies in the face of natural
justice, that those who are meant to be scrutinised are appointing and
selecting those who are meant to carry out the scrutiny.

states in Europe already have free trade agreements with the United
States, it remains an option for us to leave the EU and enjoy our own
free trade agreement with the United States. Can he think of one reason

Bertelsmann Institute’s report, he will see some interesting
evidence on the assessment of the potential impact of a comprehensive
deal. It points out that the countries that are in Europe but not part
of the European Union are likely to lose out the most. Britain could
gain tens or even hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the long term
through an agreement. In contrast, countries such as Iceland are set to
lose at least 1,000 jobs, while Norway is set to lose about 11,000
jobs. In other words, the countries in Europe that are not party to the
agreement are likely to lose out in future. The evidence is rather

debate is welcome though somewhat overdue. About three months, ago I
contacted the House of Commons Library to ask for a briefing on the EU
trade and investment deal. I said to the researcher, “I’m
sure you’ve got something on the stocks; perhaps you could just
update the standard briefing that you’ve got.” The
response was, “We don’t have one. No one’s asked
about this before.” The Library subsequently produced a very
good briefing, as well as a very good briefing for hon. Members for
this debate. That briefing, combined with the research that the Centre
for Economic Policy Research has produced for the European Commission
and the impact assessment produced by the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, underlines just how important and
ground-breaking this deal could be. Simply put, these are the biggest,
most ambitious, best prepared bilateral trade negotiations ever. This
would be the first ever such deal between economic equals. In other
words, the partners have no significant imbalances in power or
wealth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:00:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000392">Why
do I say that these are the biggest negotiations? Together, the
European Union and the US account for about 30% of global trade and
almost half the world’s output. The more reliable of the studies
and assessments suggest that if the deal is done, it could bring a
boost to the UK’s national income of between £4
billion and £10 billion, and a boost to our exports of between
1% and 3% a

are they the most ambitious negotiations? The transatlantic trade and
investment partnership aims not just to remove the remaining tariff
barriers to trade between the EU and the US, but to reduce the
non-tariff barriers by aligning the regulations, rules and standards to
which we operate. It also aims to open the markets in services and

is important to remember that this is potentially a deal on trade and

worth about $1 trillion a year, the two-way investment flow
is worth about $3.5 trillion each year. Of course, trade and investment

Historically, the UK has been able to access foreign direct investment
free of EU interference. If such investment becomes subject to an
international agreement, it will effectively become an exclusive EU
competence. The other member states have been very jealous that we get
so much foreign direct investment. How can the right hon. Gentleman be
so sure that the deal will not be used to hamper flows of foreign
direct investment into our country, because that would affect us far

this agreement must be well regulated and command public confidence. It
will not and cannot be a deal done in the diplomatic backrooms, because
Congress and, now, the European Parliament must approve the terms of
any agreement. The European Parliament has already shown its mettle in
rejecting the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement that was recently
negotiated, including with Japan, Australia, Canada and the US.
Unanimity, and not just a qualified majority, may well be needed in the
Council of Ministers to approve some parts of any future agreement in,
say trade in services, intellectual property, foreign direct investment
and anything to do with social, education or health services. There is
also a case for expecting any agreement to involve mixed
competences. In other words, there could be a contestable case that
member states, rather than the European Parliament and the Council of
Ministers, will have to ratify any elements of such an agreement
dealing with, for instance, intellectual property, transport or
investor-state dispute mechanisms.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:13:19"></hs_TimeCode>begin to wind
up. There are four things that the Government could do to help to
secure a successful, well negotiated agreement that commands wide
support. First, they should swallow hard, accept that we are in the
hands of the European Union and throw their weight behind the
Commission’s negotiators. That means—I say this to the
Minister—no public criticism, no freelance discussions with the
US and no distancing ourselves from the deal while it is being
negotiated.</hs_Para>

the Government should map and publish the jobs linked to foreign direct
investment and exports in every area of Britain. The US does that on a
state-by-state basis for every member of Congress and every Senator.
Even the British embassy in Washington, together with the CBI, has
produced a state-by-state analysis of the jobs there that are linked to
exports to the UK. Surely we can do that for ourselves in Britain as
well.</hs_Para>

the Government should deal with the fears that will arise during
negotiations that could derail public or parliamentary support for the
agreement. These include concerns about the NHS being opened up to big
US health care companies and concerns about 
<?notus-xml column=1348?>employment, consumer or environmental standards
being weakened. There might also be concerns about the investor-state
dispute system—even though the EU and the US have long
established traditions and well proven systems of due process, the rule
of law and respect for property rights—particularly when an ISDS
is being abused in the way that Veolia, the French company, is abusing
the system in trying to sue the Egyptian Government for raising the
national minimum wage.</hs_Para>

the Government should make the process open and transparent to the
public and Parliament. In the US and the European Parliament, the
negotiators are holding briefing sessions—in the Parliament and
with the Parliament—before and after each set of negotiations.
They are also doing that with wider interest groups and making public
some of the position papers as they go into the negotiations. I would
like much more formal reporting and accountability of the UK Government
to Parliament on EU matters. Other countries, such as Germany, Portugal
and Denmark, have formal legal agreements with their Governments and
Parliaments covering negotiation mandates, the provision of documents,
and notification and reporting arrangements. It would help to build
wider confidence in, and strong democratic influence on, our
involvement in the European Union if we followed that sort of model. We
can start on this European trade and investment agreement.</hs_Para>

number of extremely learned articles have been written about this

disadvantaged by the deal. I cannot claim that we would be exclusively

enthusiastic we may be about the concept of free trade, it is important
to ask whether the deal is actually going to be beneficial to the

that of the EU. We also trade with the whole of the Commonwealth, and
our trade relations with the emerging countries, the Commonwealth and
the rest of the world have been going improving. We have a net surplus
of trade with the rest of the world of about £15 billion a year,
according to the latest figures for 2012. However, we have a trade
deficit with Europe. The figure for 2011 was minus £47 billion;
it is now minus £70 billion. The Germans, on the other hand, had
a surplus in 2011 of £30 billion, and it is now £72
billion. Many people believe that the United States will
benefit the most from the deal, and those figures suggest that it will
weigh up all those factors when dealing with these questions.

rectifying that.

Instead, I shall focus on the implications of an EU-US trade agreement

areas, and the fact that some of the issues would be of particular
importance to the west midlands and the black country has not hitherto

the area’s manufacturing has been dominated by the car industry,
which has suffered for many years but is now undergoing a renaissance,
largely as a result of the foreign direct investment by the Tata
brothers and the revival of Jaguar Land Rover. It gladdens my heart
when I see those vehicles queuing up at the docks awaiting export.
About 80% of the cars we produce are exported, and the US is the
second-largest market after Europe for those exports. Jaguar Land Rover
holds second and third place with its Land Rover and Jaguar models, but
if they are considered together, it holds first
place.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Spellar:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend and good neighbour for
giving way. As a fellow black country MP, I know that it is good that
foreign buyers are buying from Jaguar Land Rover, but would it not be

Bailey:</Member></B> I know that my right hon. Friend has campaigned on
this issue for many years and I totally agree with him. We need to look
properly at procurement policies to realise that point, but I will not

far as I can see, the big issue for the motor industry is that, for the
UK and the US, tariff barriers are relatively low but that is not quite
the same as the barriers between the US and the EU. One of the
challenges for the British negotiators as part of the US team is to
ensure that the EU does not concentrate only on overt tariff barriers.
If that is the case, there will be a general 
<?notus-xml column=1352?>benefit, but the EU will benefit disproportionately.
In case anyone considers this to be an anti-EU argument, let me make it
absolutely clear that I think we have a far better chance of
prosecuting a good deal as part of the EU negotiation than we would if
we were not part of it—but this particular issue does need to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:31:04"></hs_TimeCode>. The
fact is that the removal of non-tariff barriers within the US are
considerably more important for stimulating exports or reducing costs,
and the British Government must concentrate on those as part of the EU
negotiating team.</hs_Para>

me highlight a few areas where I believe the British Government need to
get behind those who are already engaged in this work. The first
relates to how the myriad of technical regulations—quite
understandably in respect of road safety and the
environment—dictate a range of different regulations in
different countries. Standardising them provides a big challenge. I
know that the European Automobile Manufacturers Association and the
American Automotive Policy Council are working on this at this moment,
but it is up to the Government to see that that work comes to a
positive conclusion and give it all the support they can.</hs_Para>

on the global scale, the United Nations is working on standardising
global technical regulations. Although this might not be part of the
specific brief of the EU negotiating team, it would be helpful if the
EU and the US, working with the UN, standardised their approach so that
the standardisation of regulation applies not just within the EU and
the US but throughout the rest of the world. That would provide a
further impetus for both
sides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:32:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000460">Another
issue affecting our dealings with the US is the disparate and federated
nature of its regulatory bodies. There are national federated bodies
involved in regulations on environmental protection and road safety,
but there are, of course, state bodies as well. That provides a
specific challenge to get the sort of coherence and pace of reform that
we need to conform to the

spelt out the disproportionate level of benefit that would accrue to
the motor industry and companies such as Jaguar Land Rover and their
suppliers in my area of the black country from a successful reduction
of both tariff barriers and the sort of non-tariff barriers to which I
have alluded. On an optimistic view of a 75% reduction in non-tariff

later elected by the European Parliament as the president of its
relations with the US Congress. I took up that post eight years ago,
and from then on it was clear to me that many legislators on both sides
of the Atlantic had already devoted decades of effort to bringing about
much closer economic co-operation between the United States and Europe.

closely together in the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee of the

of the Transatlantic Economic Council, set up by Chancellor Merkel and
President Bush in 2007. I well recall encouraging Peter to join me in

Prime Minister has said that a successful transatlantic agreement could
be the biggest trade deal in history. I have heard some cynical

the challenge that we face in achieving agreement. As may have become
evident during today’s debate, we sometimes hear protectionist
voices, which can be at their most seductive during times of austerity.
I know that comments have been made about the “Buy
America” legislation which exists in no fewer than 21
states. The latest state to pass such legislation is Maryland, whose
legislators seem to be unaware that some 70,000 people in the state
work directly for European companies, that $13 billion from Europe is
invested in Maryland annually, and that every year $3 billion worth of
goods are exported from Maryland to Europe. Immediately after signing
the new “Buy America” law, the Maryland state governor
flew to the Paris air show to urge Europeans to buy defence products
made—believe it or not—in Maryland. You couldn’t

protectionism does not protect jobs in Maryland or anywhere else in the
United States, and it does not do so in this country either. Reference
has been made to the effectiveness of laws of that kind. I think it
worth observing that Government procurement agreements made by the
United States at the World Trade Organisation grant EU countries full
reciprocity with Maryland providers and manufacturers. I believe that,
in this instance, “Buy America” laws are not just
wrong-headed but a blatant deception of US and Maryland voters. Let ne
add that my warning against protectionism is just as appropriate in the
case of the French voices that successfully compelled the European
Commission to remove audio-visual services from the scope of the
negotiation.</hs_Para>

86% of global financial sectors, which render this deal crucially

I may be a pessimist, but I rather fear that at some point we may be
dragged into the 2016 presidential election campaign if we hit a road
block, and I hope that matters do not stagnate during 2014 and 2015. I
assume that, once the deal is done, it will have to be ratified in this

between the European Union and Singapore and between the EU and
Colombia and Peru are vital to the Scotch whisky industry, which
exported £4.3 billion worth of whisky last year. The United
States is the top whisky export marketplace: more than £700
million was exported to it in 2012. It goes without saying that there
is no expectation that the negotiations will have any damaging effect
on Scotch whisky exports, but I have given that example to demonstrate
how important and valuable such agreements can be when UK businesses

is possible that at the time the agreement is approved, Scotland will
be facing an independence referendum. I fear that, if Scotland votes
for independence, we shall be very short-term beneficiaries of this
piece of work. Perhaps the Minister will tell us at some point whether
he has received any representations from the Scottish Government about
the challenges that Scotland would face if it became independent and,
being outside the European Union, could not benefit from the agreement.
Indeed, one has to wonder what would happen to all the benefits of all
the other free trade agreements negotiated by the EU if Scotland became
independent. What would be the impact on, for instance, Scotch whisky
production, exports and jobs?</hs_Para>

scrutinised by this House. If we are to negotiate a free trade

treaty; it is more about making sure that what we do create will
benefit not just the economy of the UK, but the global economy. I say
that because I agree that a genuine free trade agreement between the EU

United States; it will have a global impact as well. These issues are

have concerns about the time scale of two years for this agreement. I
had the good fortunate last night to be in discussions with one of the
Canadian Prime Minister’s advisers, because one concern that
must be expressed is that for a long period—certainly since I
have been elected to this place—we have been involved in
discussions between the EU and Canada in an attempt to reach a
satisfactory trade agreement between those two trading blocs.
Unfortunately, as yet, despite promises on numerous occasions that we
were very close to an agreement, no agreement has been reached. We are
being told by some individuals involved on this side of the pond that
the issues are all to do with concerns about Canadian farmers and
agriculture, yet when I was discussing this issue last night with that
representative of the Canadian Prime Minister the concerns were all
about the demands of the EU in terms of our agriculture.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T12:57:33"></hs_TimeCode> two-year

cannot be secured after so much time between the EU and Canada, there

also think we should express concern at the ability of some countries
in Europe to highlight their protectionist views in relation to this
proposed agreement. It is a concern that the audio-visual sector has
been excluded from negotiations. That is also a positive issue in many
ways, however, because the decision to move ahead with talks has been
made despite the fact that the European side has excluded that sector.
We are aware of why that specific area has been excluded, but it is
encouraging to see that one problem has not necessarily resulted in a
decision that the whole negotiations should be stopped.</hs_Para>

concerned that the objectives from the European point of view are
driven less by the question of free trade and more by the idea of

can stitch up deals

me finish on the issue of whether such a trade agreement will have an
effect on our relationship with the European Union. I am often made
despondent by the behaviour of the EU and I believe that we need to
renegotiate the relationship between it and the UK. We need to show the
people of this country once more that the EU could benefit us, rather
than being problematic, a drag on economic growth and a cause of deep
frustration. As someone who represents a constituency that is dependent

challenge to not just the United Kingdom but our European partners to

the huge surge in technical development. They also depended on
significant transatlantic initiatives. We had the creation of the
European Coal and Steel Community, which then merged into the European
Community, but before that we had the Marshall plan and the creation of
NATO, and both were key parts of the changes brought about by that
towering genius of foreign affairs and the British Labour movement,

Hemming</B> (Birmingham, Yardley) (LD):</Member> First, I refer
the House to my entry in the Register of Members’ Financial
Interests. I do not think that I have any relevant financial interests
on this occasion. I am a member of a copyright society, and I have
traded with America in the past, but I do not think I have a direct
financial interest; obviously, my constituents have a substantial
financial interest in the subject, because I am the Member of
Parliament for Birmingham, Yardley, and although there are no Jaguar
Land Rover plants in the constituency, it is next to the JLR plants in
Solihull and Castle Bromwich. An agreement could mean 26% more exports
of vehicles, which would reduce yet further unemployment in my
constituency, and that is obviously something that I would
like.</hs_Para>

the US were, in many ways, the first countries to promote and extend
free trade worldwide, as we see it today. That vision has been
furthered by our membership of the EU, and we have been a driving force
in extending and widening the free market. There have been set-backs,
both in the UK and the US. Both countries have toyed with
protectionism—that is even going on at the moment—often
with negative effect. More recently, the EU and the US have
had periods of fracture. The dispute over the two biggest aircraft
manufacturers in the world, Boeing and Airbus, at the World Trade
Organisation was not good. The US obligations to scan shipping
containers and the “Buy America” provisions have also
served to undermine trade. The EU emissions trading scheme for airlines
was seen as unilateral by international partners, despite decades of
inaction on the issue.</hs_Para>

grills have an exception from music licensing rules in the US; that
exception exempts 70% of bars and restaurants and almost half of shops
from having to 
<?notus-xml column=1363?>pay copyright royalties, and that remains a key
outstanding issue. That exemption was found incompatible with the
agreement on trade-related aspects of intellectual property rights, yet
it remains in force, and no compensation, however minimal, has been
made available to European and British artists since 2004.
Interestingly, people are critical of China for not abiding by
intellectual property law, but the US has an issue in that regard as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:13:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000530"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jonathan Evans" PimsId="3148" UID="13071867001367" xid="1038" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867001367">Jonathan
Evans:</Member></B> That is sometimes called the music case. It is
interesting; the US Government did pay some compensation on behalf of
those people who are breaching the law, but they have not paid it

in the

Hemming:</Member></B> Yes; I think $3.3 million was paid before 2004,
which is why I said “since 2004”. The US Government
recognise that there is an issue there, but the problem continues none
the less. I think that the US has been critical of China, but
it should sort out its own issues as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000532">I
am sure that the House will echo my call for American Congress to
uphold its obligations under existing international trade laws, respect
intellectual property and use this process to salve wounds. A disregard
for intellectual property only encourages others to have a similar
disregard. It would be quite wrong for our laws to ignore American
intellectual property, and it is about time the United States returned
our
courtesy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000533" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000533">Despite
those set-backs, this new free trade agreement is to be strongly
welcomed as a once-in-a-generation opportunity for the UK that will
bring benefits of around £10 billion a year to our economy, help
to build a stronger economy, and create many much-needed jobs. It is
proof that our participation in the European Union does not restrict us
from trading with the rest of the world.</hs_Para>

EU and US combined account for more than half of the world economy, our
agreements with Korea have seen EU exports to Korea go up by 16.2%. For
the first time in 15 years, we have a trade surplus with Korea, and UK
exports to Brazil, India, China, Russia and South Africa have jumped
from £12.7 billion in 2007 to £27.1 billion last

member of the largest free trade area in the world creates jobs and
opportunities for British industry around the world, and our relentless
drive to widen and deepen the single market has created prosperity for
the many, not the few. We simply get a better deal when we work with
the world’s trade superpower—the EU—than when we
act alone, which is why we should work with our allies to concentrate
on reform and ensure that the European budget spends more on boosting
jobs, research, development and infrastructure, as we did with the
multi-annual settlement up to
2020.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000536" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000536">The
coalition Government are to be commended for ensuring that there is an
overall cut in the budget and an increase in job-boosting measures. We
need these negotiations fast-tracked, and I hope that Her

the US and our European partners the need to enter these negotiations
in a spirit of can-do—with the “single tank of

the greatest slow-down in world growth since the 1930s depression, and
stalled starts must not be tolerated. My party, the Liberal Democrats,

Greenwood</B> (Nottingham South) (Lab):</Member> I am sure that, like
me, the hon. Gentleman has seen that the CBI’s director general
recently said that we pack a bigger punch in securing trade deals when
we are inside the EU, rather than outside. He clearly set out that the
US wants that bigger prize. Is that not exactly why the uncertainty
about our future position in the EU is really unhelpful to British
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:16:57"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000539"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Hemming" PimsId="4735" UID="13071867001370" xid="804" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867001370">John
Hemming:</Member></B> I disagree. I think that we owe it to the British
people to give them a vote. There is uncertainty until that has
happened. It has been far too long since the vote in the 1970s, and we
need a referendum on the issue, although I am happy for it to wait
until 2017. I would most likely vote to remain in, but that does not
mean that I do not support a referendum. The issue needs to be resolved
by us asking the British people.</hs_Para>

national interest and the interests of the wider world to encourage
free trade through Europe and increase prosperity for all, because it
undoubtedly works. We must uproot direct barriers to trade; end import
tariffs, business restrictions on services and regulatory barriers; and
make it easier for investment to reach both sides of the Atlantic.
Where joint positions on rules governing competition, state-owned
enterprises, raw materials, energy, small and medium-sized enterprises,
and transparency do not exist, it would be beneficial if joint
positions could be established, so that we can form a new global
standard of excellence in
trade.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000541">The
potential benefits of an agreement are huge. The US is our
second-largest trading partner, with two-way trade totalling
£129 billion in 2011, while £200 billion has been
invested by US companies in the UK. It is in our vital economic and
national interests to ensure that we expand our economy, and this US-EU
free trade agreement should receive support from all sides of the
House.</hs_Para>

there are complexities, and I have sympathy with the argument that we
should not have a rush to the bottom internationally, so I am
sympathetic to the idea of looking more widely than just at issues to
do with tariff barriers in discussions. However, from the point of view
of the financial interests of my west midlands constituents who work
either directly in the motor business or in the supply chain, it is
clear that an agreement would be a very positive step forward in most
respects and should therefore be supported. However, it is good that
the all-party group on EU-US trade and investment has been created,
because the fear in such processes is that if we do not look at the
issues until the agreement is brought about, what can we do about them?

England and develops products that are made in factories in my

mostly used in the US to prevent soya rust, which is very important. We
also have Ineos, made up of former parts of BP, which is seeking to buy
ethane from the US, where it is now one tenth of the price of ethane
from the North sea, to produce the chemicals required for

That is the reality. If companies are not bound by trade agreements
that contain priorities and strictures, then, as has been said, the
result is a race to the bottom—the lowest standards, the

services. It was not a case of giving provision over to the private
sector. Now there is an open door for the private sector. It is a
Hayekian model. Hayek was the driver for Mrs Thatcher’s
advisers—the idea that there was no need for a state and that
any service that was required could be brought in from the free market.
If one reads Hayek—I am an economist—he even went as far
as saying that armies should be hired, instead of a state having an
army of its own. He also advocated private prisons, and sadly we moved

to note that in the EU-Canadian trade agreement which has just been
accepted, the health service is not part of the agreement. That is a
decision of the Canadian Government rather than of the EU, but it may

for Stone (Mr Cash) in his role as Chair of the European Scrutiny
Committee, is quite correct to say that the Committee should be able to
see the process stage by stage, but that alone is not adequate.
Parliament must hear about it. There should be special reports from the
Minister for Europe, the Foreign Secretary and even the Business
Secretary to tell Parliament what 
<?notus-xml column=1367?>is happening, what has been negotiated at any stage

must be accountability. Instead of one proposal at the end of the
process, perhaps there should be staged proposals coming back to
Parliament, where certain sections of the trade agreement are taken
before the House and debated by a Select Committee or on the Floor of
the House. For me, there should be conditionality. Everything that
happens in the European Union should be conditional, the condition
being that we do not end up with an agreement that subverts what we
signed up to in our last treaty. It cannot be an attempt to rewrite the
treaties by the back door, so we must always ascertain whether the
conditionality of any trade agreement or any other agreement will
undermine the rights contained in the documents to which I
referred.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000557" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000557">We

is important that I start by paying tribute to the Prime Minister, the
Chancellor and the Government as a whole for putting an EU-US trade
agreement and talks at the centre of the strategy for the EU and for
growth, which this Government are so relentlessly pursuing. All of us
in the House understand the importance of America, and we need to make
the case to the country and to British business that although there is
rightly a pivot east in trade and activity—to the BRIC countries
and other emerging economies—the American economy, with 310
million people with a per capita income of $48,000, and an energy
sector that looks as though it is going to get incredibly competitive
over the coming years, is a phenomenal opportunity for Britain. It
would be wrong just to accept that we already have a relationship which
is established and going quite
well<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000561" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000561">Companies
in my constituency, such as Silver Cross Prams which produces
traditional prams that hon. Members may have used or been in in the
past, sell across the world, but in America they have to go through
pages and pages of health and safety and other procedures in order to
sell their already safe and already EU-recognised product in America.
If Jet2, which flies out of Leeds Bradford airport, wants to fly to an
American city and then on to another American city, it is unable to
sell seats on the domestic US side, which has an impact on its
business. Principle Healthcare sells drugs, vitamins and other products
that are perfectly safe and have been rigorously tested here in the UK
and in Europe, but when it tries to sell to America, it must start the
whole procedure yet
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000562" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000562">I
have great respect for the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne
(John Healey), but I was worried by some of his remarks. The idea that
this agreement should try to have top-down formal regulation of all
these things is quite wrong because to get the pace we have been
talking about, we need to think much more about mutual recognition. If
we have safe drug products in America and safe drug products in the EU,
how do 
<?notus-xml column=1368?>we recognise those regulatory processes? That is not
to say that we should have a free for all but that we should recognise
and be pragmatic about what we do. One of the strongest messages I have
for the Minister is a request that he utilise his innate pragmatism to
influence these
negotiations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000563" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000563">The
second push I would make is on something we have talked about: pace.
There are moves afoot already in America—we have seen the French
examples and there will be others from all interested parties—to
slow things done and to have carve-ups and opt-outs. We must make the
case for pace and ensure that we stick to the rigorous timetable set in
place by the negotiators. I also think that the point made by the right
hon. Gentleman is key: this debate cannot be a closed shop in this
place or in Brussels or in America. We must take the argument to our
citizens and businesses and explain to them the importance of
the jobs that will be created by the agreement and by enhancing our
relationship. The benefit for EU supporters is that if we can do that
for this agreement, we can use that information and build on that
argument as we make the case for Britain continuing to be an active
member of the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000564" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0002.htm#13071867000564">Finally,

William Bain</B> (Glasgow North East) (Lab):</Member> This debate is
very timely because of the discussion about where the UK’s
future economic growth is going to come from: away from an
overreliance on domestic consumption, which is now creeping back into
the economy, and shifting once again, we hope, towards exports and
manufacturing. Although the value of the pound is a fifth lower than it
was at the onset of the economic crisis, unlike in previous downturns
exports from this country have not risen but fallen. Completing a trade
and investment area between the US and the EU will create more
opportunities in this country for businesses and investors to grow out
of the crisis. That will add to the 36 other countries with whom the EU
already has a trade agreement in place.</hs_Para>

exports more in goods and services than it imports from the US, and 30%
of the EU’s foreign direct investment is in the US, too. The
estimated benefits to Europe of successfully negotiating a free trade
area with the US would boost growth across the Union by 0.9% a year,
and, according to an assessment by the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, would provide £10 billion in direct
economic boost to the UK.</hs_Para>

a successful agreement would align technical standards; harmonise
labelling and product specification standards; protect intellectual
property; improve access to Government procurement schemes; cut
agricultural tariffs; and, most important, help our largest
manufacturing industry in this country—the food and drink

is successfully completed, the UK has still to be a full member state
of the European

indications are that it will take between 18 months and two years to
reach an agreement but perhaps as long as 10 to 15 years for the full
effects of a successfully agreed accord to come into force. But perhaps
before the end of the arbitrary timescale that, unfortunately, many
Government Members wish the House to follow on an in/out EU referendum,
the UK would already be seeing some of the gradual benefits
accumulating from that transatlantic free trade area, only potentially
to be forced out of it shortly afterwards as a result of such a
referendum. The House of Commons Library has confirmed that all EU
trade agreements would have to be renegotiated by the UK if it left the
EU, so by leaving the EU and leaving the advantages of this agreement
that we hope to see very soon, the UK would lose access to over 130
free trade agreements, which would not only have a negative impact on
the economy but imply huge costs in individual renegotiation.</hs_Para>

The EU is the UK’s main trading partner and comprises around 52%

markets in China and India are important, but those two markets
account for 5.6% and 1.6% of our current trade. Through the

population and accounting for almost 20% of world GDP. The EU is not
important to the UK simply for that reason, but also because of the
access it provides to other markets. The EU is the top trading partner
for 80 countries and currently has free trade agreements with
more than 40. That process is continuing, and the EU is currently
negotiating agreements with more than 70 countries, including important
UK partners such as India and Japan, as well as growing economies
such as Brazil. According to the CBI, the European Union has
negotiated trade agreements that cover around 30% of trade outside the

significant—my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T13:44:30"></hs_TimeCode>

that drugs that have already gone through one rigorous testing
procedure must then go through another one. That is not necessarily
anything other than an obstructive measure to preserve markets for

will be people in the US, as in Europe, who will try to resist and

also linked to pork-barrel politics, the two-year congressional
election cycle and all the other difficulties people have in winning
public office in the US, so this will not be an easy process, and these
negotiations will take time; it is a bit optimistic to think they could
be over in two years, and they will not be helped if the EU adopts a

higher gains per worker. Forecasts predict that increased trade would
lead to higher wage rates of between 0.2% and 0.5% for workers in this

focus on a few specific industries that could benefit enormously from a
comprehensive and ambitious free trade agreement. The motor vehicles
sector, which has been mentioned, is forecast to see considerable
growth as a result of an ambitious transatlantic trade and investment
partnership—TTIP. Estimates predict a rise in exports of between
15% and 26%. That will obviously help the German manufacturers, but we
certainly should not discount the impact it will have on our important
and growing automotives sector, where we are producing great-quality,
high-premium cars that the rest of the world are keen to buy. That was
mentioned by my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich West (Mr
Bailey).</hs_Para>

that regard, I hope the Minister will reassure us that regulatory
convergence to ensure great export growth will be at the top of the
agenda in the negotiations. I hope he will agree that a vehicle
considered safe to drive in Europe should also be considered safe to
drive in the US. Will he ensure that duplication of
safety and environmental standards is dealt with and that
negotiations prioritise mutual recognition agreements and equivalence
standards? Will he also address the point, not entirely confined to the
automotive sector, that differing regulatory arrangements apply at a
state, federal level? Will negotiations ensure that state differences
are dealt with, too? That point will apply to many industries, such as
those producing electrical goods, chemicals and cosmetics. My area has
the highest concentration of chemical engineering in western Europe,
and if Europe and the US had mutually accepted standards, the potential
for the chemicals industry in the north-east would be
enormous.</hs_Para>

aerospace industry is dominated by Europe and the United States, and
particularly by Airbus and Boeing, as was seen in the recent sales at
the successful Paris air show. Britain is the largest player in this
industry in Europe and is second only to the US in the world. The
European aerospace industry generates a third of the EU’s
manufacturing exports, and we in this country are at the heart of it.
We have to maintain our competitive advantage. The industry is subject
to fierce competition from other nations. China is particularly
ambitious about launching an aerospace company—COMAC—to
rival Boeing and Airbus. Does the Minister accept—this is an
important point—that an ambitious free trade agreement between
the US and the EU would actually help to maintain our competitive
advantage in this field, as consistency of international regulatory
standards should give existing firms and their supply chains an
important lever to use? That was certainly the conclusion of an

example, a UK lawyers’ qualification is not fully recognised in

the exceedingly high-quality contributions. More important than the
quality of the rhetoric has been the unanimity of argument in favour of
an EU-US trade deal. Of course important questions need to be

rules fit for the 21st century. The principle of mutual recognition is

Friend the Member for Coventry North East a lot of support. I cannot
praise them highly enough. They are now in the situation of having to
travel 70 miles to a stadium outside Coventry, which will cost a
significant amount. With the economic situation these days, people are
finding it hard to make ends meet, to say the least. The fans have been

bad.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000685" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000685">Secondly,
the Football League has given approval for the club to play at
Northampton. I understand that that might be contrary to the Football
League’s own regulations, but we will have to wait and see about
that. I disagree with the decision to grant approval because I do not
believe that all avenues of negotiation have been exhausted. Until a
week ago on Monday, I thought that there was a very good chance that we
would make progress with the three main parties in the process.
However, when the Football League gave its approval, that took the
pressure off all sides to get together and resolve the situation. That
was a weapon that the league could and should have
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000686" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000686">I
believe that there should be an inquiry into whether the Football
League’s regulations have been fully complied with. However, if
we assume that they have been complied with, it is still shocking that
the situation has reached this late stage without the Football League
taking action. To let the situation unravel to the point where a
football club cannot play in its home city without the league
intervening seems to me to be ridiculous. There should be a review of
the Football League’s regulations to ensure that cases such as
this one and that of Wimbledon are not
repeated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000687" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000687">Thirdly,
on a related point, we all know how serious a problem debt can
be for football clubs. Debt, rent disputes, company buyouts and
takeovers can all be felt by the team and the fans. It is time for a
review of the company law relating to football club ownership to take
into account the fact that football clubs are not simply businesses.
They are not commodities to be bought and sold to make a profit. They
mean more than that to the players, the many people involved in a club
and, importantly, the fans. It is a great shame when fans can no longer
watch their team because of the financial decisions of a few
business people.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:35:30"></hs_TimeCode> believe that
there should be a review of the law relating to football club ownership

<?notus-xml column=1385?>and clubs’ financial arrangements. It should not be possible to

essential if a compromise is to be reached that will keep the club in

I should like to praise the excellent public library service in the
London borough of Havering and to highlight the positive impact of
books in developing early years literacy. Havering council takes its
libraries very seriously. I commend in particular its cabinet member
for culture, heritage and sport, Councillor Andrew Curtin, who takes
them even more seriously. He has fought hard, not just to protect
library funding but to support our excellent library staff, to improve
the quality of service even further and to increase
membership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000691" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000691">In
January, Havering ran a universal membership pilot as part of the
project run by the Department for Education to examine ways for
children to join the library automatically at a certain point in their
lives. The council worked with 10 schools across the borough. Tickets
were created for all reception children and the reader development team
went into the schools with a selection of books for children to borrow.
The children started with mini membership, which meant that they could
borrow just one book and would face no fines. The children also
received an information pack, which included an invitation to parents
to come and meet professional staff who could teach them how to help
their children to read and offer advice on which books to borrow.
Volunteers were available during the February half-term to talk to
children about the books that they had
read.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000692" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000692">Havering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>
library service is also working with the registrar of births to join
all new babies born in the borough. They have signed up 856 babies in
the pilot period. Activities for babies and parents assist in early
language development and fine motor skills, and combat social
isolation. Read and rhyme sessions for three to five-year-olds improve
concentration and listening skills, and help to make the transition to
school successful. There are also workshops for parents and carers
entitled “How to read to your children and instil a lifelong
love of reading in your
child”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000693" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000693">The
positive approach of Havering council has resulted in a huge surge in
library membership in both the junior and adult sections, with 67% of
the borough now signed up. For adults, especially those who live alone,
the library is a social contact point. It has computers that are
available for job searches, informal learning and online courses, and,
of course, an endless choice of books to borrow.</hs_Para>

stress the importance of books in developing early years literacy and
all the benefits that that brings. I remember vividly my first ever
visit to the public library. It was stressed to me as I walked along
beside my mother that, “When we are in the library, we have to
whisper.” The library was a traditional municipal building with
wood panelling, not unlike the Chamber, which was a bit intimidating
for a five-year-old, but it was a treasure trove because it was full of
books. We did not own any books at home, and to see wall-to-wall books
was wonderful. Even better than that, I was allowed to borrow them. I
could choose them, take them home and read them. A very important lady
stamped the back of the book to tell me when I had to bring it
back—the whole thing was absolutely thrilling. I could not wait
to get home and start reading. It was the beginning of my lifelong love
affair with
books<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:40:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000695" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000695">Children
who enjoy reading are more likely to have a good vocabulary,
and the importance of good communication skills cannot be overstated.
Reading develops imagination, creativity and ideas. Children learn to
spell and absorb information without realising it, if they enjoy
reading as part of their daily lives. They can be transported into
other worlds and experience a gamut of emotions: excitement, fear, joy,
sympathy and optimism. Characters in books display the good and bad in
people, and set examples of courage and kindness, happiness and
despair. Children who are introduced to books and acquire a love of
reading in their early years are likely to continue to keep it all
their lives. They are better informed and broader minded for it, and
will be better equipped to face the many challenges that school and
life
bring<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:40:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000696" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000696">There

a shocking case with the House on behalf of my constituents George Shaw
and Paula Davidson, who for 18 years have been the proprietors of the
Fillings sandwich shop in Streatham Hill.</hs_Para>

March 2005, Mr Shaw was unloading his van outside his shop. He saw a
man looking into his front window and became concerned that the man was
about to steal his van. He then felt a sharp pain in his back: he had
been shot. The man had been looking at the bank, which he intended to
rob, on the other side of the street through the reflection of the shop
window. This man, Mr O, fled in a minicab. It took some time for the
police to arrive, but there was CCTV footage from the buses that passed
along the street and there were witnesses who were prepared to give
evidence, in spite of it being a violent crime. One would think that it
was an open and shut case.</hs_Para>

took the police a week to find Mr O. They found him in the Republic of
Ireland, where he was also wanted by the police. He was found guilty of
a violent crime in Ireland and was imprisoned there for five years. He
was later extradited back to the UK and went on trial in 2010. Mr Shaw
and Ms Davidson tell me that in the five years between the shooting and
Mr O being returned to Britain they were not kept informed and had no
idea what was going on. To this day, they are confused as to why
Trident investigated the case, as it was not a gang or black-on-black
crime. A few days before the trial in 2010, they received a two-line
e-mail telling them to be prepared for a case at the Old Bailey, and to
be ready to give evidence.</hs_Para>

O was being tried for a number of violent crimes, including, I
understand, a dangerous assault on a woman in a pub in Brixton. When Mr
Shaw got to court, he learned that the police had lost all the
evidence: they had lost the gun, the bullet and the CCTV from the
buses. The people who were prepared to give evidence turned up in fear.
They sat outside for 10 days completely uninformed about what was going
on. Mr Shaw and Ms Davidson had never had anything to do with
the police or the criminal justice system before, and this was an
overwhelming experience for them. Mr Shaw had suffered greatly. He had
been in hospital for weeks, and he continues to have a very large
hernia as a result of the injuries he sustained. Nobody explained what
was happening. As far as he knew, Mr O was not being prosecuted for his
near murder.</hs_Para>

investigate. On 19 December 2012, Mr Shaw and Ms Davidson met Mick
Foote, the detective superintendent in Trident gang crime command. Last
week, they received a letter explaining that nobody was at fault for
losing the evidence, and that nothing could be done to bring Mr O back

Mr O is imprisoned and when he will be released. Not unreasonably,
Mr Shaw and his wife are frightened that Mr O will be
released. He is a man of violent conduct and might come back to their
shop. I would like the police to meet Mr Shaw and Ms Davidson and
explain exactly what happened, and what support they should have
expected, from the crime taking place to the date when the trial took

Pawsey</B> (Rugby) (Con):</Member> I rise to draw attention to an issue
to which I drew attention in the last debate on matters to be raised
before the Adjournment, which took place on 26 March. On that occasion
I drew the House’s attention to concerns about the consequence
of an EU directive on people’s ability to continue to use what
was then, and still is, a relatively new product, namely electronic or
e-cigarettes. Members will remember that an e-cigarette is an
alternative to a conventional tobacco cigarette and consists of an
electronic inhaler that vaporises a liquid into an aerosol mist,
enabling the user to enjoy nicotine in a far safer form.</hs_Para>

return to this topic because, in addition to the EU legislation, there
is a now a proposal by the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency for e-cigarettes to be considered as
medicinal products. The EU directive seeks to lay down a legislative
framework for the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco
products. However, e-cigarettes are not tobacco products. Bringing them
into line with their more dangerous counter-
parts—standard cigarettes—will see the consumption of
e-cigarettes drop. That means that people who currently use them safely
will no longer be able to do so. If the MHRA’s proposal goes
through, e-cigarettes will have to go through an expensive and
time-consuming procedure to be approved as medicines. If that procedure
makes them more difficult to obtain, smokers will simply continue to
smoke tobacco.</hs_Para>

is important to remember that e-cigarettes were not developed as a
medicinal product. Indeed, I heard them described at a seminar the
other day as simply an “enjoyable consumer product”.
However, their regulation as medicinal products would raise costs,
reduce the diversity of products available, slow down innovation and
inhibit creativity, and, in doing so, make them less appealing to the
very people hoping to switch to them. These are by-products of the law
of unintended consequences. More people will revert to
tobacco.</hs_Para>

that, the MHRA recommendation is for people “not to
use”—that is its advice—the current generation of
e-cigarettes available on the market. Its group manager of vigilance
and risk management of medicines told a press conference held
to announce the MHRA’s
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:51:12"></hs_TimeCode>:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13071867000975" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000975">“We

that was despite the MHRA’s impact assessment giving no evidence
of any harm caused by the use of e-cigarettes. In fact, Professor
Robert West of University college London says that for current
e-cigarettes “the risk is negligible”. Indeed, the
NHS’s website states that their toxicity is one thousandth that
of tobacco cigarettes.</hs_Para>

consequence of the MHRA’s recommendation has been that a major
supermarket chain removed e-cigarettes from its pharmacy shelves, while
a survey of 700 pharmacists has shown that 99.5% are declining to stock
e-cigarettes because of the announcement. There is an emerging industry
manufacturing e-cigarettes, which predicts that the reduction in their
use caused by the MHRA’s recommendation will cost the NHS
£2.5 billion, owing to fewer people giving up smoking tobacco.
E-Lites, the largest producer of e-cigarettes, now forecasts a
substantial reduction in the growth of the market. On its figures,
390,000 fewer people will be using e-cigarettes by the end of the year,
compared with what would have happened without the MHRA’s

are concerned that it will become harder for them to access

directive is also of great concern to a number of small businesses, in
particular a business based in my constituency called Smoke No Smoke,
to which I referred when I last spoke on this issue. Its
entrepreneurial owner, Jim Lacey, is facing a threat to the future of
the business that he has worked so hard to build up. The
feedback from his customers is that they will be unable to access the
product. There is a danger that that will force the e-cigarette trade
underground. If e-cigarettes were produced in an illegal market, it
would be difficult for people to know where they had come
from.</hs_Para>

They tell me how tough it is to find work, how they are struggling
because their tax credits are being cut, and how they cannot afford
their rent, let alone a mortgage. I do not dispute that our membership
of the European Union is an issue for some people—I suspect,

leading it, reforming it and making it work for the 21st century. The
European Union is far from perfect. We need to tackle the waste and

where enormous multinational companies have greater financial powers

and the lack of genuinely affordable housing. At its heart, it is about
the public looking at their politicians and seeing, by and large, a
bunch of people who all look the same and sound the same—but do
not look and sound like them. It is easy for UKIP—a party that

the time we return to Parliament in September, it is quite possible
that a serious situation will have got even worse. The Israeli
Parliament has voted for what can be described only as ethnically
cleansing between 40,000 and 60,000 Bedouin. Clearly, the removal of
such a large number of humanity will be undertaken only at the point of
a gun. If ethnic cleansing were 
<?notus-xml column=1392?>going on anywhere else in the world, the world’s leaders would be

does not take place by the Israelis and the Israeli Parliament against
the Bedouin. It is, of course, a track record that goes back over many
years. The illegal occupation of the west bank and East Jerusalem; the
obvious apartheid legislation of the Israeli Government; the ignoring
of countless United Nations resolutions, the Geneva convention and
international law: these are everyday occurrences for Palestinians
living in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Our Government have

Bruce</B> (Congleton) (Con):</Member> This week, I have had a work
experience student in my office. Members might say that there is
nothing unusual about that, but this young man is different. He is from
North Korea. Abandoned by his family as a child, he lived on the
streets from the ages of eight to 14, scavenging food. He tried to
escape his hopeless life to flee his country only to be caught by
Chinese soldiers, returned, imprisoned, tortured, hung upside down,
repeatedly beaten and left virtually for dead. He was just 16. He told

managed to escape yet again, but was hunted down in China by the police
and imprisoned there, where he attempted suicide. Later, after a long
international journey involving the selfless kindness of many people,
he arrived in the UK, where he is now a student with a hope and future,
although he still bears the scars of his early life in many ways. He is
still only 24 years

is one remarkable young man from North Korea whose life, after years of
terrible suffering, is now changed for ever. Dare we hope
for the same for his people? The answer must be a resounding yes. We
should indeed hope for a better future for the people of North Korea
and do more than just watch and wait for it. We should act. I hear

change that will surely come. When it does, there will be a need for

business people can consider supporting social enterprises in North
Korea. There are isolated examples of such enterprises, including a
shoe factory. Business start-ups provide potential soft power
interventions, including through improved employee conditions, such as
the very basic one of insisting that wages are paid direct to
employees, and not via the state, with its inevitable deductions. At
grass-roots level, North Korean people want DVDs, USB drives, radios
and mini-computers to be sent to them. The regime’s information
blockade is crumbling, as through these items North Koreans have much
better awareness of the realities of life in the outside world than
they would have done even five or 10 years

on a relative shoestring, has taught English to 3,900 North Koreans
over the past 13 years, is to be commended and would merit greater
support, as would academic and cultural exchanges. The Pyongyang

successes of Swansea City and Bayern Munich last season emphasise, in
their very different ways, the success of clubs where supporters have a
very direct and significant role in how their football club is managed.
Swansea City is unique in the Premier League in terms of the
involvement of fans in the boardroom. I think that it is high time that
that situation changed. The Co-operative party, which I am lucky enough
to chair, championed in the late 1990s the idea of football
supporters’ trusts to help football supporters co-operate to buy
stakes in the running of their clubs. Now many Football League clubs

Wimbledon or FC United through to the likes of Exeter and
Chester—are directly run by their supporters through the
mechanism of a supporters’ trust.</hs_Para>

when players’ wages and contracts are being agreed.
Supporters’ trusts help to ensure that longer term thinking

value to their localities and, indeed, on occasion they can boost
enterprise in the area.</hs_Para>

legislation is needed to make it easier for supporters’ trusts

valuation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000786" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000786">Secondly,
for most supporters of Premier League clubs, administration is not
likely to happen any time soon and there is no obvious sign either
that, despite warm words from some Premier League club owners or
managers, a stake in the ownership of Premier League clubs is likely to
be sold to supporters’ trusts. Legislation is also needed to
embed a right to observe in law. In other words, if a
proportion—say 10 per cent—of season ticket holders at a
Premier League or Championship club belong to the registered
supporters’ trust, that trust ought to have a right to attend

measures would help to embed supporters in the heart of decision making
about a football club’s future. Such decisions about the future

third measure to which I draw the House’s attention is the
funding of grass-roots sport, and other related football causes. In
2001, the Premier League agreed to give 5% of its total broadcast
income to the provision of grass-roots facilities, and to encourage
better provision for supporters. It now claims that that was just for
one TV deal, and only for domestic broadcasting rights. I wonder
whether we need a back-stop legal power to ensure that that 2001 deal
continues into the future. Without such a back-stop power, the Premier
League and Football Association have been able to reduce the amount of
money given each year to the Football Foundation directly from football
clubs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000789" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0003.htm#13071867000789">The
need for more investment in grass-roots sport, and perhaps for a lever
to change the minds of owners and their defenders in Premier League and
FA boardrooms, points to a need for a legal power to impose a levy. If
such a levy were ever to be used, it must clearly be kept well away
from the Treasury. I hope we would never need to use such a power, but
perhaps the Minister would consider the possibility of a back-stop
statutory 
<?notus-xml column=1400?>power to get the FA and Premier League to be more
serious about funding for grass-roots sport in the future. With a
£5 billion broadcast deal, it is not unreasonable to expect the
Premier League to offer 5% of its income for investment in grass-roots
coaching and facilities.</hs_Para>

perfectly legally, since 2008. She is married to a British citizen and
she is a top-flight business woman. She contributes to Britain’s

support me in “pitch” meetings which involves visiting
clients’ offices all over Europe. Our business travel occurs
about two times a month, and is usually planned at very short notice
i.e. one week notice or less. It is important for me to stress that Ms

directly linked to her ability to travel. Ms Chung has performed

proven to be an asset to the company. It is therefore important for me

will not detain the House with the details of Rene Chung’s case,
but I want to highlight three points. First, Mrs Chung has been waiting
for more than a year for the renewal of her spouse visa
application—in my view, an unacceptable length of time.
Secondly, the Home Office has already made a disastrous error in
handling her case by incorrectly deeming Mrs Chung’s application
to have been withdrawn—the Immigration Minister has apologised
for that in his latest letter to me. Thirdly, and most disgracefully of
all, when Mrs Chung recently returned to Gatwick, following a business
visit to Europe, she was locked up for six hours and only released
after her passport had been confiscated. Such conduct is more redolent
of an authoritarian police state than what we expect in a democratic
Britain that pays proper regard to basic human rights.</hs_Para>

it comes to supporting economic growth in the business community, the
Home Office is wholly apart from the rest of the Government, who are
doing all they can to support economic growth in the business
community—some signs of success are, I hope, beginning to show
through. On the other hand, as far as I can see, the Home Office takes
absolutely no account of the need to support the business community,
including individual business men and women trying to contribute to our
economic growth. It is blindingly obvious that it should introduce a
fast-track procedure for processing applications for visa renewals of
people with a clear legal right to be in this country and for whom
travel is 
<?notus-xml column=1401?>essential to their work. I put it to the Home
Secretary that fast-track processing should be put in place forthwith.

I want to make a complaint to the Immigration Minister about a recent

examines these issues carefully. We have just published a report on the

turn now from home affairs to health, and to declare my interest as a
type 2 diabetic. I want to raise the issue of obesity and diabetes, and
the continuing war on sugar, which was started earlier this year when I
presented my ten-minute rule Bill on this important matter. Obesity is
the nation’s No. 1 health problem and it is a growing problem in
our children. A report published last year found that a third of
primary school leavers were either overweight or obese, and that
obesity is a major factor in the development of type 2 diabetes. I do
not need to remind the House of the deadly nature of type 2 diabetes,
or that 80% of type 2 diabetes cases are preventable and 10% of the NHS
budget is spent on dealing with diabetes complications. I just wish
that earlier in my life I could have been tested for diabetes, because
if I had discovered at an earlier age that I had diabetes or a
propensity to it, I might not have contracted type 2 diabetes or, at
least, I might have delayed its onset.</hs_Para>

hope to raise one aspect of the Government’s policy, which is
the responsibility deal. It is a flagship Government policy that tries
to get fizzy drinks and sugary drinks companies to own up to their
responsibilities. Some 536 organisations have signed up to the
28 voluntary pledges initiated by the Leader of the House when he was
the Health Secretary, but, as we have seen, all that glitters is not
gold. Although it is a good thing to have asked the companies to sign
up to responsibility in this area, the substance of the deal has not
materialised. As Dr Aseem Malhotra of the Royal Free
hospital, one of the country’s leading cardiologists, said, the
deal is nonsense, with companies saying they are going to
reduce sugar content but failing to do so. This is a voluntary
arrangement, so there is no compulsion and these companies are not
being held to account. As we know, diabetes, unchecked, could result in
all kinds of other complications. Professor Jaspal Kooner, one of
the country’s leading cardiologists, has talked on a
number of occasions about the effects of diabetes on those with heart
problems.</hs_Para>

want to cover two big constituency issues in the next eight minutes.
One of them is very positive, but first I have some recent disturbing
news. Areas of Meltham in my constituency have been left without postal
deliveries this week after a horrific dog attack left a postman needing
plastic surgery on his arm. In fact, the wound is so severe that it has
been described as potentially life-changing. When we return from the
summer recess, I will be asking whether we can have an urgent debate on
how we can reduce dog attacks on our brave postmen and women and keep
the post being delivered. Rather ironically, it is Royal Mail’s
dog awareness week. The statistics show that there have been 5,500 dog
attacks on Royal Mail postmen and women since 2011. I have just had an
update from the local police, who say that today they have seized the
dog that attacked the postman and tests are under way to see whether it
is a banned breed. I know that Members of the House would like to join
me in sending their best wishes to postman Jason Lee as he recovers
from this shocking dog attack.</hs_Para>

number of people calling them for advice has gone up from 6,000 to
18,000 in a year, and there are similar figures for Honiton. Health
funding will have to recognise this trend. People breathe in the good

Let me start by congratulating all Members who have
taken part in this afternoon’s debate. Those who are here in the
Chamber are very much the hard-core membership of the House—the
aficionados who have not taken advantage of a sunny Thursday, on the
final day in Parliament, to depart early to their

Gentleman’s first batch of issues concerned foreign
affairs—in particular, Syria, Iran and the Maldives. Let me
respond briefly to those. Members will be familiar with the tragic
situation in Syria, with 93,000 people dead so far, some 7 million
Syrians now in need of humanitarian assistance and 1.7 million having
fled to neighbouring countries. The UK is playing a significant role in
providing humanitarian aid, with many agencies supporting activities
there, providing food and water, and making other contributions. The
hon. Gentleman was concerned about the risk of military intervention
from the UK or the UK making a military contribution. Clearly no such
decision has been taken and, as has been stated many times in the
Chamber, Parliament would be engaged before any such decision was put
into action, with a vote in the House of Commons.</hs_Para>

have consistently urged, including at ministerial level, all parties to
work together to find a solution that would allow for genuinely free,

Commonwealth with its observation of the Maldives presidential
elections, so we certainly hope to see substantial improvements in that
country, including in human rights.</hs_Para>

this is a critical health issue, and our call to action on obesity sets
out our approach and the role of key partners. The national ambition is
a downward trend in the number of people with excess weight, and many
partners will contribute to that. The change for life programme, the
national child measurement programme and NHS health checks should all
make a

<?notus-xml column=1409?>look into the fridges and look at the offerings that
are made in our restaurants, to ensure that they do not contain the

emptied its vending machines and replenished them with products that
are much healthier. If that school can do it, I am sure that we can do

with complex issues. He will be aware of the action taken in relation
to Leveson. A submission from the press is before the Privy Council,
and the Government will be submitting our own submission once that has
been considered. We want this matter to make progress. Sir John Chilcot

to complete its task and publish its report as soon as possible. That

referred to bungee jumping; I have nothing to say about that. I have
never done it myself, and I have no intention of doing it. He mentioned
the important work of a company called Coloplast, and talked about
bowel independence day, which I hope was successful in giving a higher

wanted representatives of the Treasury to meet the Essex bowling club

consider it carefully. He finished on a point about Southend
regrettably having failed in its bid to become the city of culture. He
suggested that Unite might have rigged the ballot. I cannot

public library service. She praised Councillor Andrew Curtin for the
role he is playing, and I think we would all echo what she said about
the essential role that libraries play in developing children’s
interest in reading and their culture. She referred to a read and rhyme
scheme for improving, among other things, listening skills. Perhaps she
could bring that to the House at some point, because listening skills
could be developed further in the Chamber. We would all support my hon.

issue she raised was about the activities of Stubbers outdoor leisure
centre and its important role in building young people’s skills
and experiences, which they might not otherwise have, helping them to
overcome their difficulties. She highlighted the importance of the

there is agreement among Members on both sides of the House that the EU

with the findings of all the opinion polls over a number of years. He
might like to look at the report of a Westminster Hall debate entitled
“National Parliaments and the EU”, which was

hon. Friend the Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell) made one of a
number of suggestions that have been made today about holiday reading
for Members. He recommended “You Can’t Hide the
Sun”, by John McCarthy, and he spoke of what is happening to the
Bedouins. He has tabled an early-day motion on the subject, and he is
not alone: I believe that 21 Members signed it. There is clearly an
acknowledgement in this place, at least, that it is a significant
issue. I certainly agree with him that both the Israeli and US
Governments have a significant responsibility for sorting out the
situation there. I am pleased, therefore, that John Kerry has won Arab
League support for his initiative to try to restart the
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and if they do restart I hope the
Bedouin issue will come up. We need to see urgent steps to ensure that
a two-state solution is introduced there. I am sure the Foreign and

of the budgets that has been safeguarded when many others have not. On
alcohol, I think it is fair to say that a lot has been achieved through

hon. Friend also gave some useful concrete examples of how UK citizens
can help directly in North Korea. She gave the soft examples of making
a financial or business contribution as a way of trying to open up a
society that is still very closed. Finally, what she said about the
desire of North Koreans to have access to information reminded me of
the meetings I had about 30 years ago when I was in
Czechoslovakia—as it then was—and met up with Hungarians.
The Czechs were too scared to talk to westerners, but the Hungarians
were a bit braver, and one of the things they said was how important it
was that they could get news that was real news. They did not want to
get their news through a filter that filtered out
what was genuinely happening. That is clearly what is happening in
North Korea, and the UK remains extremely concerned
about reports of 
<?notus-xml column=1413?>widespread and continued systematic human rights
violations there. My hon. Friend will be aware that the UN has
commissioned an inquiry to investigate human rights abuses, and we
encourage the North Korean Government to co-operate fully with it and
to engage with that process.

get a swift response on the issue of the passport, the fact that his

of the reasons the changes were made to the UKBA was to ensure
a separation between its role in processing the customer-focused part

mentioned earlier. He is a recognised campaigner on the issue in this
House and referred to some of the statistics that highlight why we
should take the matter seriously. As 10% of the NHS budget is spent on
addressing the issue and 80% of cases are preventable, there is a clear
win for the health service if we can focus on that. He referred to the
responsibility deal and clearly felt that it was a mixed
blessing—or at least that it was not delivering in the way he
would like and that the substance behind it had not materialised. We
all, as a Government, as Members of Parliament and as members of the

to raise the issue’s profile. He talked about health funding for

residents of Axminster and Honiton is what we are expecting the
national age profile to be by 2035, so we probably have quite a lot to
learn from those towns’ experiences, in terms of types and costs
of services. He made a request for a new school; I am sure that the
Department for Education will have listened carefully to that request,
and will respond to it. He also asked the Department for Environment,

Stafford. I became the Member of Parliament for Stafford in 1984 and I

Thorley resides. I sent to the Minister on 21 May a letter that
I received, which summarised various points relating to the case in
question. The case is simply explained. At Stoke-on-Trent Crown court
in December 1979 Mr Thorley was convicted of theft arising from VAT
returns. In 1980 the Court of Appeal quashed the conviction and Mr
Thorley left the court utterly
blameless<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000895" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0004.htm#13071867000895">It

cannot confirm on what basis a prosecution was undertaken. Neither can
it ascertain from records whether or not there was an appeal. It
follows therefore that I cannot comment on the outcome of that appeal.
HMRC does not hold any records in relation to Mr

the light of the information I have supplied, I find it unbelievable
that there would be no basis for an apology. My constituent—who,
at 88, does not have by any reasonable standards much longer to
live—has throughout this period been seeking by various means to
obtain an apology. He does not want compensation and has made that
absolutely clear in correspondence. There is no need for HMRC to be
concerned about that if it made an apology. There is no need for
electronic files; he was convicted and sent to prison for three years,
serving 11 months. As a result of the diligent conduct of his defence
by his lawyers, he was released from jail on the orders of no less a
judge than Lord Justice Eveleigh. He asks only for an
apology.</hs_Para>

of the court was read on 27 and 28 October 1980 by Lord
Justice Eveleigh. I will not go through every detail of it—the
Minister has a copy—but I will read out some salient points. In
June 1975, an investigating officer named Mr Evans from Customs and
Excise went to Thorley’s office to investigate the claim for the
repayment of £43,000. He expressed the view that he was
satisfied, in the document I mentioned earlier. He was given a large
number of documents and made inquiries— chiefly from a Mrs
Mannering. He was left in the office to investigate these at his
leisure and sent in his report. He wrote “satisfied”
against all four periods that he investigated. Mr Evans also states
that he investigated the position in depth. At the trial four and a
half years later he could not say what had happened but felt that the
word “satisfied” meant that he had compared the claim
with the totals in the books and that the returns had been reconciled.
That is why he put “satisfied” against it. I have the
paper in front of me signed by this gentleman and so has the
Minister.</hs_Para>

doubting that the trial took place, that my constituent was sent to
jail and released, or that Lord Justice Eveleigh importantly quashed
the conviction. Against that background, to my mind it is utterly
astonishing that my constituent cannot even get an apology, simply
because the records are not available. It is not for me to lay down
rules about what records have been or should have been held by the
Departments in question, or any other Department, but nobody with any
sense of justice—or, indeed, with any common sense—would
seriously dispute the facts as I have described them. Nobody has
attempted to dispute those facts; they say only that they cannot find

with <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>the first
point about why HMRC does not hold information. In line with the
requirements of the Data Protection Act, HMRC must not hold personal
data indefinitely, so the organisation regularly reviews and destroys
or deletes information. For cases involving criminal investigation, the
retention period varies depending on the outcome of the investigation.
The default period is six years from the conclusion of the
investigation, but when the investigation leads to a conviction, the
retention period is the length of sentence imposed plus one year, or
six years, whichever is the longer. When an investigation ends in
conviction but that conviction is later overturned on appeal, as
clearly occurred in this case, the retention period is six years from
the Court of Appeal ruling. In the case of my hon. Friend’s

the Data Protection Act also requires that when someone makes a request
for the release of information, the recipient of that request must make
a thorough search to see whether it is held, even if the normal

department-wide check of all electronic systems and a targeted search
of manual records. It also asked the Crown Prosecution Service

respond to those letters. My hon. Friend has received a letter from me

me return to the procedure. Usually, HMRC has a two-stage complaints
process, which seeks to deal with as many complaints as possible at the
first review. At the end of that stage, the reply tells the customer
that if they are still unhappy, they can ask HMRC to look at the
complaint again. At that stage, a different official takes a fresh look
at the complaint and gives HMRC’s final response. If the
customer remains unhappy, they may approach the Adjudicator’s
Office. The Adjudicator’s Office will investigate the complaint,
drawing together a full and impartial summary of details from the
customer and

my hon. Friend has provided HMRC with information regarding the case
that indicates that a conviction was quashed following the finding that
there had been a misdirection. As he will also be aware, his
constituent’s concern is that there was a malicious prosecution
against him. If HMRC has evidence that there was a malicious
prosecution against someone, of course it should apologise. If that
evidence is presented to it and it is satisfied that that is what has
happened, I would hope and expect it to do exactly
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:13:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071867000931" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0004.htm#13071867000931"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Cash" PimsId="2512" UID="13071867001474" xid="102" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/debtext/130718-0004.htm#13071867001474">Mr
Cash:</Member></B> Whether or not it was malicious, the question is
whether an apology is due, given the fact that—of this there is
no doubt—there was a prosecution, my constituent spent time in
jail, the conviction was quashed and then he was released. I am simply
asking for an apology. There is an element of farce about the
situation. I do not want to be told that I should go off to the
Ombudsman; I am talking to the Minister, who is accountable to the
House. He has responsibility for HMRC and for the conduct of Customs
and Excise before it, in one form or another. All I am asking

I am seeking to say to my hon. Friend is that his constituent clearly
feels wronged. He was, as my hon. Friend says, convicted on a case
brought by HM Customs and Excise, and that conviction was subsequently
quashed. I understand my hon. Friend’s position, which is, in
essence, that in any circumstances when someone has been wrongly
convicted, the prosecuting authority should apologise to that person. I
fully respect that position.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T17:15:32"></hs_TimeCode>, it must
also be said that the fact that an individual is found not guilty after
a criminal trial or their conviction being quashed by a higher court on
appeal does not necessarily mean that it was inappropriate for the case
to have been investigated, or even prosecuted, in the first place. I am
sure that my hon. Friend, as a distinguished lawyer, can appreciate
that point.</hs_Para>

may well be that in this investigation over 30 years ago HM Customs and
Excise behaved wrongly and inappropriately. If that is the case, then
his constituent would deserve an apology in those
circumstances—let me clear about that—and I would be very
happy to give that apology on behalf of HMRC. However, before HMRC is
in a position to give a full apology, it needs to see the facts more
fully. As I say, the mere evidence that a conviction has been quashed
does not necessarily mean that HM Customs and Excise behaved in an
unacceptable way. That is why I believe that it is essential that my
hon. Friend’s constituent provide all the available paperwork
that he and his advisers hold to enable HMRC fully to assess the
reasons for the quashing of the

serve under your chairmanship, Mr Bone. I thank the Backbench Business
Committee for allowing this debate and colleagues from across the House
for supporting it. It gives us an opportunity to examine some of the
measures that the Government are putting in place to promote shale gas,
and to explore the implications of fracking for our constituents, our
countryside and our climate. I read with interest the <I>Hansard

the details of community benefit packages but also touched on some
issues that I am sure we will return to and explore further in this
debate.</hs_Para>

discuss those questions, in light of recent lobbying scandals and
concerns about inappropriate corporate influence on politics and policy
making, I will declare my relevant interests. I am a proud, albeit
small, shareholder in Brighton Energy Co-operative, which invests in
community-owned solar power in Brighton and Hove and whose vision for
community-owned renewables at the heart of our energy system I openly
support. I have a similar very small interest in the Westmill Wind Farm
co-operative in south Oxfordshire. I hope that other Members speaking
today will agree that in the interests of transparency and rebuilding
trust in the political process, it would be beneficial if all of us

the depressingly common pattern of waiting until just before the summer
recess to publish unpopular policies, but I was told this morning by
the Department for Communities and Local Government that it would,
after all, be published not today but “very soon”. That
is even worse for the House’s ability to examine the details and
hold Ministers to account on behalf of our constituents. I am sure that
we would all like to hear from the Minister the reasons for the delay.

additional fossil fuel subsidy, which is exactly what the UK and other
G20 nations pledged to phase out three years ago. It looks like a

there is any difference between well design in the US and the UK that
makes that less likely here? Will he also say whether there is a
register of the performance of existing UK wells? I have not been able

is a broad consensus among gas analysts that little, if any shale gas
will be produced commercially in the UK before 2020, and therefore, we
should not expect domestic shale gas to have any impact on gas prices
in the short to medium term. That time scale is very important, because
so much of the energy debate focuses on the rest of this decade, for
which shale gas is basically irrelevant. If we are talking about energy

<?notus-xml column=315?>security perhaps in the 2020s, what that looks like obviously depends on
how much gas is extractable. The British Geological Survey recently
reported that the Bowland shale in Lancashire and Yorkshire may contain
1,300 trillion cubic feet of gas. It stresses that it is a highly
uncertain estimate and that it is not an indicator of the volume of gas
likely to be extracted, which will depend on economic, technological
and environmental considerations. However, if 10% of that gas were
extracted, it would equate to approximately 41 years of UK gas
consumption, but defining energy security as security of supply, DECC
believes that it is still too early to a firm conclusion on whether
shale gas in the UK or elsewhere in Europe is likely to have a
significant effect on security of supply.</hs_Para>

cutting emissions by displacing coal, they need to remember that that
coal is simply being exported and the emissions created elsewhere, so
that does not help very much with the overall reduction of emissions
required in order to tackle climate change. Regardless of the precise
life cycle in terms of the greenhouse gas impact of shale compared with
other gas, the direct carbon content of shale gas means that its
widespread use is incompatible with the UK’s international
climate change commitments.</hs_Para>

gas is lower carbon than coal, although the methane leakage question is

Tuesday that people who are against shale exploration have a principled

exactly how they think that the exploitation of new sources of fossil

irrational enthusiasm for shale gas and fossil fuels more widely. This
fossil fuel obsession, or addiction, is preventing us from making the
most of the UK’s indigenous renewable resources. Worse still, it
means that we are seeing policies designed to maintain the status quo,

the group’s full-year earnings after tax expected to be 2%

There are many points in the process at which groundwater contamination

from migration under the surface. There is also the contamination of
land and surface water, and potentially groundwater via the surface
route, arising from any kind of spillage. Right hon. and hon. Members

return to the planning issue and whether local communities can have a
proper say on any decisions about shale gas that affect them. I have to
say to the Minister that the changes to the planning and permit process
advertised over recent months have served only to make my constituents
more anxious. We know that the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 will
allow developers to bypass local authorities in some cases, which is a
real concern in my constituency. The Act creates an opportunity for
developers to fast-track major projects instead of going to the local
authority, and I have many times been asked, “Is that going to
happen to us?” The Act allows developments for large onshore gas
extraction over a certain size to be fast-tracked to the Secretary of

Over my lifetime, I have been—indeed, I still am—involved
in an oil company in central Asia and I was involved in analysing oil
companies and predicting energy prices for 20 years, when I had a
proper job before coming to this place, so she may try to insinuate

member of the Energy and Climate Change Committee who criticised, as
she does, the suggested special tax breaks for fracking. On the basis
of my knowledge of the oil and gas industry, I think that they are
probably unnecessary, and we should not give away unnecessary tax
breaks; although if they are necessary, that would be fair

second and more plausible argument is that, even if there are large

it will not succeed in bringing down prices in the UK, because our

they will not in which case the tax revenues from producing gas in this

Alan Whitehead</B> (Southampton, Test) (Lab):</Member> The debate here
falls into two categories: a wider category and a narrower category. It
is undoubtedly true in terms of the wider category that we will have to
leave a lot of the carbon that we otherwise could get out of the ground
in the ground over the next few years. Indeed the understanding of the
Department of Energy and Climate Change of this process in terms of
what will need to be done with regard to gas as a component of wider
energy sources in the 1930s reflects that in the way in which gas will
need to be used at a much lower level and fairly sparingly in the
running of gas-fired power stations. But that is also an issue in terms
of what we do with oil, coal and a variety of other mineral sources of
energy under our soils.</hs_Para>

talking specifically about shale gas in the UK, and I want to address
the narrow issue of what would be the consequence of us deciding that
we really were going to go for a shale gas “bonanza” in

to underpin our energy economy.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:49:11"></hs_TimeCode>First, there is
indeed a large amount of shale gas reserve under the ground in the UK.
The question of how much of it is recoverable is another matter. If we
recovered what looks to be a possible level of recoverability from the
present fairly uncertain estimates of how much shale gas there is under
the ground in this country, shale gas could perhaps underpin 10% of our
overall necessary gas supplies in this country.</hs_Para>

there would be about 100,000 to 107,000 wells. Admittedly, they would
not be separate wells. Usually, there would be about six or seven wells
on one pad, going outwards from the pad, which would create a need for
about 18,000 pads in the country. So, if we did a straightforward
division between the constituencies of this country, each constituency
would have to support 164 wells. Obviously, the wells would not be

the US shale gas drilling takes place right in the centre of a number
of towns, such as Fort Worth. There are very considerable concerns
about that, precisely on the grounds she refers to, not because shale
gas will kill us all but because of particular concerns about how the
shale gas is extracted: what happens with the waste water; what happens
with the operation of the shale gas facility itself; and indeed the
arrangements in the US relating to mineral rights that cause that
drilling to take place. That would not be the case in this country, so
I would not for a moment suggest that we will get a rash of shale gas
wells in the middle of town, because there is an entirely different
mineral regime in the UK. Nevertheless, she makes an important
point.</hs_Para>

Byles:</Member></B> I am not sure if the hon. Gentleman has seen the

Whitehead:</Member></B> Well, those are entirely different points. At a
particular point we could meet a larger amount of supply, but what I am
talking about is the overall question of the amount of supply over a
period of time that would be possible to underwrite as a result of that
sort of level of shale gas production—two different
points.</hs_Para>

additional point that needs to be borne in mind about shale gas wells
is that they do not last very long. Research from the US demonstrates
that the average life of a shale gas well is about seven years or so.
That is because shale gas wells produce a lot of gas to start with, but
they deplete very rapidly. So, after about seven 
<?notus-xml column=333?>years they are producing virtually negligible amounts, even—as
has happened in a number of instances—on the basis of
refracking. Refracking of a well produces a little increase, but the
well still dries over a fairly short period. Therefore, to maintain
that sort of level of production over a longer period, one would need
to redrill a number of those wells.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:53:44"></hs_TimeCode> is the sort
of scenario that we would set for ourselves if we were to introduce a
level of shale gas production that would support the sort of
intervention in the gas market that I have mentioned.</hs_Para>

second concern is this: would shale gas production actually reduce
prices for everybody, if we went for it to that extent? The clear
answer is no. The intervention of the shale gas itself would not reduce
prices because of the way that gas is traded on the international
markets, particularly in this country. There are three international
markets for gas trading. Gas is not particularly transportable, except
through vessels such as liquefied natural gas carriers, which make a
marginal difference in terms of supply; gas is largely transported by
pipelines. Gas is traded on the European market, the far east market
and the north American market. The north American market has seen
substantial price decreases because of the concentration of shale gas
within that one particular market. We would need to have a similar
amount of shale gas produced throughout Europe in order for the
European traded gas market to come down significantly in price compared
with what it is currently, notwithstanding LNG imports coming into the
European market overall. So shale gas might make a marginal difference
over a period of time, but probably not—for the reasons I have
given—unless there were fundamental changes in gas
trading<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:55:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071889000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0001.htm#13071889000196"><B><Member ContinuationText="David Mowat" PimsId="5728" UID="13071889000503" xid="1167" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0001.htm#13071889000503">David

amount of shale gas that is presently being produced in the US, yes,
that is possible, in terms of the trading in the European market, but
that probably is not going to be the case. Therefore we have to look at
the relevant prices of gas within the markets. It is a question of
trading in a market, not a question of the gas being plugged into
someone’s home and therefore creating a reduction in price as
far as that house is concerned.</hs_Para>

other question is what happens with those large amounts of wells in
terms of the fracking process? That process involves the use of between
2 million and 7 million gallons of water, and 5,000 gallons

not, that is the sort of amount of chemicals needed. As has been said,
that water cannot be injected largely into 
<?notus-xml column=334?>seams deeper than the fracking itself, as is the case in America, but
would have to be disposed of by other means. Also, unless the fracking
companies brought the water with them, water would have to be taken
from the water table within the area where the fracking was taking
place, which has implications for the integrity of the water tables in
those particular parts of the country. That is an important but largely

final thing that I want to say, given the short amount of time I have,
is about the policy implications of going for a large amount of

could perhaps supply—over a period—10% of overall UK gas

could provide 10% of the domestic gas supply. A farm-sized anaerobic

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:57:21"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member may well have asked a very valid question. As I was saying, such
a plant produces about a third of the gas over a 20-year period that a
fracking well would produce over 7.5 years, but anaerobic
digestion plants will produce gas continuously because the cows that
provide the stuff that produces the gas continue to produce the
feedstock, as do we from our own waste and our food. Therefore,
anaerobic digestion plants do not deplete. A long-term strategy for gas
supply security might concern itself with anaerobic digestion and
biogas, rather than going for a gas bonanza. We ought to look at all of
these factors when looking at the future of gas supply in this
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/2923B4C399A2D1C35B7171064E1C5801D3B85627" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 July 2013">Thursday

the Energy and Climate Change Committee, I chair the all-party group on
the environment and I also chair the all-party group on unconventional
oil and gas. “Unconventional gas”—that is what we
call shale gas, which is a bit of a misnomer, because it really is just
gas. It is the same gas that we use to heat 83% of our homes and to
generate 30% to 40% of our electricity.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) said that gas
has been hydraulically fracked in the US since 1949, but he may not be
aware that the first exploratory shale gas well drilled in the UK was
in 1875, in Netherfield in the south of England. It was an academic
activity at that time, but the first commercial shale gas wells in
Europe were drilled in northern Spain in the
1950s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:59:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Hydraulic
fracturing itself is not a new or an unknown process, as my right hon.

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T14:59:29"></hs_TimeCode> view is that
the evidence to date shows that shale gas can be accessed safely, if
operations are done to a high standard and with effective regulation.
That is backed up by a growing library of research from reputable
expert organisations, such as the Royal Society, the

this is not a debate about whether to use gas. It is important to state
that, because sometimes this debate strays into a discussion about the
gas strategy. This is a debate about where we get the gas we use from.
Under the Department of Energy and Climate Change’s central
forecast scenario, we will be using broadly the same amount of gas in
2030 that we do today. The trouble is that both the Institute of
Mechanical Engineers and the Institute of Directors estimate that by
2030 we will be importing up to 80% of our gas, at a cost of some
£15 billion a year. That gas will come from Norway and Qatar and
in future, probably, from Russia. It will include liquefied natural gas
that has to be liquefied, transported and re-gasified. I have no
confidence that Russian gas is produced and transported to higher, or
even the same, environmental standards as gas in the

Actually, only one organisation that I am aware of—Nottingham

monitoring. Since 2010, it has monitored background public opinion on
shale gas, approximately every quarter, using YouGov, with proper
balanced samples. It has found that acceptance of shale 
<?notus-xml column=337?>gas is slowly rising and fears about it are slowly falling. Its most
recent survey, with 2,200 respondents, done in the past month or so,

hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion could be accused of being
unrealistically precise in her comments about what is likely to happen
in the climate over the coming years, and I would make two simple
points about the science. First, I have talked to most of the leading
scientists on climate change in this country and in the United States,
and there is no known way of distinguishing natural variations in the
climate from impacts caused by carbon dioxide—nobody knows how
to do that.</hs_Para>

the models that have been used to predict the increase in temperatures
have all been wrong. In the Met Office, we have the biggest
supercomputers in the world, which are great at back-projecting
climate, but their projections of climate into the future have all been

<?notus-xml column=339?>inaccurate. That is just an indication that there is something unknown
about the science, which is not to say that carbon dioxide is not a
greenhouse gas, because it clearly is, and it has been known as such
for a long time. However, an artificial precision is being introduced
into the debate, and it really should not be there. We do not,
therefore, often talk about the science.</hs_Para>

next point is about the costs of all the different policies and the
price that will result. An interesting report by Liberum Capital
indicates the difference between the cost of the Government’s
policies on replacing the sources of our energy and the cost of
replacing like with like. It finds that there is a difference of more
than £200 billion between the two, and that will come
out somewhere in the price of gas to our constituents.</hs_Para>

Government’s energy policy is based on taking a long-term

they are betting the house, the country or hundreds of billions of
pounds that the price of fossil fuel will continue to rise. If that
happens, and if renewables are put in place, they are likely to win
their bet—and it is a bet. They will have to find the capital to
fund those renewable energy supplies, but given that prices of publicly
quoted shares in the European renewables market have dropped below
their level in 2004-05, that looks very unlikely. If the Government
lose their bet, our constituents will pay more for their energy than

are two reasons for being against fracking, and the debate has been

reasonable to make this point on behalf of constituents—is that
people worry when they hear that there is to be fracking in their area.
It is therefore quite reasonable for them to ask for the good health

elsewhere in the country. However, it is not reasonable to push those

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:16:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

I want to put the Government’s energy policy, which is not
coherent, in the context of what is happening on emissions worldwide.
Much of the Government’s policy is based on reducing emissions,
in the belief that that will bring down global warming and slow down or
stop climate change. However, the policy is failing, and emissions are
going up. With emissions, one has to deal with imported goods, which
are often created using industrial processes that create more carbon
dioxide than processes here do. If we push up the price of energy here,
we will export production to China, India and other places and increase
the amount of carbon dioxide. That is a deindustrialisation policy, and
I hope that, by exploiting shale gas in a safe and environmentally
responsible way, we can start reindustrialising this country and
creating the 72,000 jobs or more that it has been predicted will come
from exploiting shale
gas.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-18?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_18_PT_1/3645DA4EB3913916574FED1864D6A738EDA4C5A3" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="18 July 2013">Thursday

One of the phrases that I have heard used several times is that we are
“betting the farm” by moving ahead with shale gas. I have
not heard anyone in the Government or otherwise saying that we should
do that. We do not want to bet the farm on it. We want a mixed supply
of energy for the future, and gas will rightly be part of that.
She<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:19:51"></hs_TimeCode> mentioned
Sam Laidlaw who now runs Centrica and who was previously at Conoco and
Amerada Hess. Just to put her mind at rest, he is an ex-Etonian, just

doing that for some renewables—and just taxing it a little less,
and we need to recognise that. I think that she also said—she

electricity prices that are a quarter of ours. It has feedstock prices

that are a quarter of ours. That is already making a difference at the
margins. Some industries are already deciding not to invest in the UK
and to bring petrochemicals and chemicals back to the US—indeed,

hon. Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) made an
excellent point about climate change. The issue about climate change
and gas emissions is how we get coal out of the system. The UK still
produces 70% of its energy from coal and oil and something like 3% or
4% from renewables, taking into account transport as well as
electricity production. The UK has lower carbon emissions per head and
per unit of GDP than nearly every country in Europe, in spite of the
fact that we have less in the way of renewables. The reason is that we
burn less coal than most countries in 
<?notus-xml column=342?>Europe. Incredibly, apparently aided and abetted by members of the Green
party in Germany, a programme has kicked off there to build 10 or 12

short-sighted to encourage a “drill and see what happens”

that a businessman might at some point have met a Minister to discuss
shale gas—heaven forfend! In the end, the Government have to
make a judgment on the basis of the national interest, and that
judgment must be approved by the House of Commons. We therefore have to
consider the arguments sensibly and seriously, not merely chucking mud

Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) did. I have a
constituency interest, because the Sussex Weald basin, which covers a
large part of my constituency, has been identified as an area that
might contain significant reserves of exploitable shale gas. At the
moment, we do not know the extent of any possible drilling or how
exploitable any reserves might be. Test drilling is about to begin,

want to engage in the argument about what the national interest is. It
cannot solely consist of the contention that shale gas might lead to
cheaper energy and economic benefit, powerful though that argument
might be—in any case, we have heard that it is debatable. There
are of course other arguments about whether the form of energy
generated is sustainable or the kind of clean energy that we should be

the Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw), some of the
areas in which the drilling would have to take place in Sussex are in
the national park. National parks are areas with the highest landscape
designation, and they are designated as such precisely because the
landscape is treated like no other, so there should be a strong
presumption against any kind of economic activity that may damage them.
That does not mean that no activity can ever take place in a national
park, or even that that should be the case, but it does mean that we
have to make judgments carefully, recognising the national interest in
protecting such areas, not only the local interest or vested local
interest. That has to be considered. We must be able to balance the
national interest

intervening again because he is quoting what he says I did or did not
say. On the issue of whether we need gas, yes, we need a small amount
of gas as a transition fuel to get us to the renewable future that we
need, but the question is what to do over the next 10 years. Do we lock
ourselves into or put in place the infrastructure for a whole new gas
business here in Britain, or do we use the 10 years that it would take
to get shale gas going in Britain to invest properly in renewables?
There is an opportunity cost and a decision to be made. I would rather
we invested in
renewables<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T15:56:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071889000317" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0002.htm#13071889000317"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tom Greatrex" PimsId="5564" UID="13071889000550" xid="1134" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0002.htm#13071889000550">Tom
Greatrex:</Member></B> I would like us to invest in renewables, because
I think that it is important, but I take a slightly different view of
the prognosis for how long we will require gas both for heating and for
electricity generation. In relation to our indigenous gas supply from
the North sea, the hon. Lady will know as well as I do that the extent
to which we rely on imports has changed massively in the past 10 years.
The trajectory is going one way. If it is possible to extract shale gas
safely, and if it is properly regulated and monitored, we may have the
benefit of being able to replace some of what we import with indigenous
supply. We should not close our minds to that or seek to block
it.</hs_Para>

sometimes. I do not think that that is a realistic suggestion.
Sometimes, the language around the issue does not help. Suggestions

Prime Minister talks, as he did yesterday, about making it easier for
shale to be extracted. That is not particularly helpful or useful
either. It should not be about making it easier; it should be about
ensuring that it is done sensitively and appropriately. Members have
mentioned the precautionary principle. I suppose that I would use the
term “proportionate”. It needs to be proportionate. That
is important. If it is not proportionate, it will not happen, and then
the potential benefits may not be realised. It needs to be done
proportionately and properly. We have had a couple of debates this week
and I am sure there will be plenty more during the next few months.
Some specific points have been raised with the Minister, and I hope
that he will respond to them in those terms. If he does not, he may be

for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) for starting this debate, and
all those who have contributed to it. For those of us who were here on
Tuesday, this has been a slightly livelier debate, but none the worse
for that. I will try to set some context, say more about the way in
which the industry is being regulated, deal with some of the myths, and
then turn to some of the specific questions and worries that have been
expressed. I hope that colleagues will bear with me.</hs_Para>

saying that oil and gas are vital for our economy. About three quarters
of our current energy demand is met by oil and gas. Even as we move to
lower-carbon sources, which we all want to do, 70% of the primary
energy we consume here will come from oil and gas by 2020. They are a
vital part of our economy and will remain so for some decades to come,
even as we move to a low-carbon economy.</hs_Para>

with some of the specific questions, let me debunk some of the myths
about shale gas: that it is a recent technology, that it is new
technology, and that accelerating its exploration involves increasing
the risks. Let me take those three myths in turn. The first is that
onshore oil and gas production began recently. In fact, we have been
exploiting oil and gas onshore for nearly 100 years.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071889000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0002.htm#13071889000326">The first
production well was drilled onshore in 1919 at Hardstoft in Derbyshire.
Since then more than 2,100 conventional wells have been drilled, and
onshore production continues to take place throughout our country from
the south of England up to Scotland. Just last week, I visited IGas
operations in the South Downs national park in Sussex, which is a very
good example of how oil and gas operations can work even in the most
sensitive environments. We have nearly a century of experience of oil
and gas production with no history of chemical spills or gas leaks
comparable with the experience in the United States. During that
century, we have put in place robust regulation to ensure that oil and
gas operations are safe for people and the environment. Given that
century of onshore exploration and the expertise and robust supply
chains that exist as a result of extraction in the North sea, we are
very well placed as a country to make the right decisions about
shale.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071889000327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0002.htm#13071889000327">The
second myth is that fracking is new. It is not. As my right hon. Friend
the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr
Lilley)<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:02:54"></hs_TimeCode> said,
some 2.5 million hydraulic fracturing operations have been performed at
oil and gas wells worldwide. It is thought that as of 2010 around 60%
of all new oil and gas wells are hydraulically fractured. Some 27,000
wells were drilled in the United States in 2011 and most them were
fracked. Even here, that has been happening in some form for the past
60 years. We have already had some 200 wells fracked in this
country. With all that activity, there is still no confirmed evidence
of contamination of aquifers caused by
fracking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:03:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071889000328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0002.htm#13071889000328"><B><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Lucas" PimsId="1568" UID="13071889000554" xid="1022" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0002.htm#13071889000554">Caroline

has reinvigorated the economy, gas prices have halved, reducing costs
for industry and consumers, and billions of dollars of new investment
and thousands of jobs have been created. Nations across the globe,
including India and China, are looking in on that boom and joining in.
We must start to think seriously about shale. We must get on and
explore the resources that are there and understand the potential, to

Survey, and our knowledge of shale resources will be further enhanced
when we publish estimates for the Weald basin in the south of England

turn to the planning and regulatory system, which will have a high
degree of local scrutiny and prior consultation, which we are setting
out in guidance that we will publish very soon. That guidance will not
cover every issue when considering proposals for shale gas. It must be
read alongside other planning guidance and the national planning policy
framework, but it will carry weight in the system. The Government have
heard loud and clear what the industry and others in the community have

for regulating activities beneath the surface rests largely with the

integrity of the wells rests with the Health and Safety Executive. It

England and Wales. For new and first-time shale operators, they will
meet and advise them of their legal duties, and conduct a joint

engagement by the operators with local communities and the key
regulators before any planning application is submitted. I therefore
welcome the industry’s commitment, in the community engagement
charter, to engage earlier with local communities and to be transparent
in their activities. However, close engagement with the regulators by
such firms is also beneficial, helping to identify issues to be
addressed as part of the planning application and other approvals at an

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:11:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Worsley and Eccles South asked me about the impacts on adjacent
wildlife sites, which are important issues to be addressed in the
planning system. Where an environmental impact assessment is required,
such issues will have to be addressed in the report. They will have to
be consulted on and considered again by the planning authority on the
basis of that report, before any decisions are made. If any SSSI or
other European protected site might be affected, 
<?notus-xml column=355?>a habitats assessment must be made, and that, too, must be similarly
considered by the planning authority before any decision is made on
planning permission.</hs_Para>

hon. Lady also asked whether the Growth and Infrastructure Act could
allow shale and gas projects somehow to bypass local
authorities’ planning permission. The Act allows for certain
business and commercial projects, defined by regulation, to go directly
to the national regime for obtaining planning permission. The
Department for Communities and Local Government has consulted on the
possible inclusion of oil and gas projects in that process, but in
light of the responses to that consultation, I can tell her that option
is not being pursued for the moment. We want those planning decisions
to remain with the minerals planning authority in the normal
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071889000345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/halltext/130718h0002.htm#13071889000345">The
hon. Lady also asked about the Columbia university study on the domino
effect, where distant quakes in one place can trigger quakes at other
water disposal sites. It is important to point out, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-18T16:13:39"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for North Warwickshire (Dan Byles) did, that the research
relates to waste water disposal wells involving volumes of water much
greater than those used in fracking. The injection of very large
volumes of water can trigger quakes in the ground. That is not news; it
has been understood for some time. However, as he also pointed out,
that particular technique of disposing waste water is not used at the
moment in the United Kingdom, and it is very unlikely that it would be
approved if it were proposed.</hs_Para>

supplies so far as practicable, because that is the most likely way to

to extract water directly from aquifers, again, they will need a permit
from the Environment Agency that will not be given if the quantities

in well designs between operations here and in the United States and
about the possibility that we might have methane leaks on the scale
that we have seen in Pennsylvania. I visited the United States to talk
to experts, and I am aware that the standard of environmental
regulation has varied widely across the different states of America.
They do not have the overall, national regulatory system that we have.

the same as in the United States, but the regulatory framework in the

that it is all right, perhaps, that Britain’s offshore rigs and
platforms have leaked oils or other chemicals into the North sea on 55
occasions in the last month alone, according to the figures from DECC.

have taken important steps to streamline the regulatory framework, but
that is not at the cost of robustness. It is about ensuring that the

system is, as far as possible, concentrated in schools that parents and
pupils really want to go to. So I am delighted to announce that the

key part of the challenge our market faces is in ensuring secure
electricity supplies. The capacity market will give investors the
certainty they need to put adequate reliable capacity in place,
protecting consumers against the risk of supply shortages. It does this
by providing a predictable revenue stream to providers of reliable
capacity, including both generation and non-generation measures such as
demand-side response and storage. In return, they must commit to

penalties.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071861000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/wmstext/130718m0001.htm#13071861000050">I

have now published Government’s intended reliability standard
for the capacity market—which captures the trade-off between the
cost of providing additional back-up capacity, and the level of
reliability achieved. The proposed standard is expressed as a loss of
load expectation (LOLE), i.e. the number of hours per annum in which,
over the long term, it is statistically expected that supply will not
meet demand, and which reflects the economically efficient level of
capacity. This does not mean that we would have this level of blackouts
in a particular year; in the vast majority of cases, loss of load would
be managed without significant impacts on consumers. But no electricity
system can be 100% reliable. Based on our assessment of the value
consumers place on security of supply, and the costs of providing
capacity, we are 
<?notus-xml column=124?>proposing that a reliability standard of three hours LOLE per year most
efficiently makes this trade-off between cost and reliability. We are

the landscape that existed in December 2011, after the Government had

in the business case are largely consistent with the impact assessment
they took account of some costs (estimated at £127 million in

they were out of scope (for example, because they related to measures

while Europol can already request a member state to initiate an
investigation, this proposal goes much further and includes an
obligation to provide a reason if no such operation is conducted. Any
reasons provided would be subject to challenge before the European

option is to purchase a further 270 vehicles to replace the electric
Intercity 225 fleet which currently runs on the east coast main line
with a fleet of new, high quality, modern, higher capacity class 800
series nine-car electric trains. This is in addition to the core order
to build nearly 600 vehicles to replace Britain’s fleet of
Intercity 125 high speed trains along the Great Western and east coast
main lines that were originally deployed by British Rail in the 1970s
and
1980s.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071861000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/wmstext/130718m0001.htm#13071861000129">The
first class 800 series trains will enter revenue-earning service on the
Great Western main line in 2017 and on the east coast main line in
2018. We expect the second batch of new class 800 series vehicles to be
in service on the east coast from 2019. Passengers will see
improvements to their travelling experience, including even more
reliable services, improved telecommunications connectivity, increased
leg space without compromising on luggage provision, and a greater
chance of getting a seat. Train capacity will be 627 seats per train,
18% higher than the stock they are replacing which will mean that the
class 800 series deployment in total will increase the number of seats
in to King’s Cross in the morning peak by 28%. Journey times
between London, Leeds and Edinburgh will also be reduced by several
minutes. The new trains will be capable of running at 140 mph, which
would lead to further journey time reductions, although operation at
this speed will require signalling and infrastructure
upgrades.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13071861000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/wmstext/130718m0001.htm#13071861000130">Furthermore,

The consequences of overspill of the Syria crisis to neighbouring

Lebanon. It is vital that further contagion is avoided at all cost and

Work programme IT payment system update went live in April 2012. All
outcomes prior to this were recorded clerically and uploaded to the
system during April and May 2012. The outcome date for these is based
on the date the information was uploaded to the system. For job
outcomes recorded after this, outcome dates are based on the date that
payments were made to providers following pre-payment validation
processes to confirm job outcomes. The manual pre-payment validation
checks may take time to conduct resulting in a delay between the job
outcome being claimed and the date the payment is made to providers,
and hence recorded in the statistics. Validation procedures continue to
improve to streamline the process as issues are identified. For further
details around issues and delays to job outcome payments please see the

Barker:</Member></B> The complexity and variability of the Arctic
environment means that it is not possible to make predictions for a
specific year several years in advance. Therefore DECC has not made an
assessment of the likely area of Arctic sea ice for September 2015.
However, we expect that in the long term the annual minimum extent of
Arctic sea ice will continue to decline as a result of man-made global
warming.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071894000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0001.htm#13071894000163">Results

no recent assessment has been made of the amount of solar energy

the current long-term decline in summer Arctic sea ice would require
stopping the current rise in global temperatures caused by rising

in the Arctic have risen more than twice as quickly as the rest of the
world over the past 40 years and climate models suggest that the Arctic

Rising temperatures are likely to increase the risk of methane release
from hydrates in the Arctic ocean and shelf seas and also from thawing
permafrost, 
<?notus-xml column=796?>which would amplify global warming. There are, however, major scientific

credit checks for Green Deal customers as this is a commercial

and liquidity of the ECO market by allowing a range of Green Deal
providers, including new SME entrants, to trade with energy companies,
thus helping keep cost to bill payers down. In keeping with this aim
for transparency, a criterion used when designing brokerage was that it
should allow for the trading of those commodities which are relevant to
the legal targets set on the obligated energy companies. In the case of
the carbon saving element of ECO, that obligation is expressed 
<?notus-xml column=799?>in carbon tonnes. Hard to treat cavity wall insulation and solid wall
insulation are not identified as separate sub-targets. Aligning
commodities with the relevant obligation also gives GDPs flexibility in
preparing packages of future measures for auction.</hs_Para>

offenders aged 18 and over. Offenders under the age of 18 are not
subject to supervision by the probation service. Table 2 provides the
number of requirements started as part of a community order by
offenders aged 18-21 by type of requirement in England and Wales, 2005

Court of Protection generally sits in private, but this is to reflect
the sensitive and personal, and, in particular, the financial nature of
the issues being discussed. It is also because the person who is the

However, the court does have a wide discretion to: authorise the
publication of information about private hearings; authorise persons,
including the media, to attend a private hearing; exclude persons from
attending a hearing and otherwise restrict the publication of
information about a hearing—the court will decide what
restriction to impose on a case by case basis. The court does not
record the detail of reporting restrictions. To research all cases
where hearings have been held since October 2007 would be a

There is no centrally-driven policy to alter LJAs. These are local

reducing re-offending, for offenders with similar characteristics. This

imprisonment, which is determined by the court and must be served in
full, after which the offender may be released on life licence when the
Parole Board determines it is safe to do so. For the most exceptionally
grave offences the court may impose a whole life term which means that
the offender is never subject to Parole Board release. The average time

was 14
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071896000430" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0002.htm#13071896000430">A
life sentence is mandatory for murder, and this Government has
introduced a new mandatory life sentence for a second very serious
sexual or violent offence. In addition, Parliament has put in place a
maximum penalty of a life sentence for other very serious offences.
When imposing a life sentence it is for our independent courts to
determine the minimum term to be served in custody for the purposes of
punishment and deterrence. There is 
<?notus-xml column=829?>statutory guidance to the courts on determining the
minimum term under a life sentence for murder. Once the minimum term
has been served in full, it is for the Parole Board to determine
whether or not the offender is safe to be released on licence, which
lasts for the rest of the offender's life with the possibility of
recall to custody at any time. Many offenders serve longer than their
minimum term, and some are never
released.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071896000431" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0002.htm#13071896000431">This

Wright:</Member></B> We want to ensure that prisons operate to a
consistent standard when rewarding prisoners for positive behaviour and
engaging with efforts to rehabilitate them. We announced an overhaul of
the Incentives and Earned Privileges (IEP) scheme on 30 April, with the
revised scheme coming into effect from November 2013. The revised
scheme will provide consistency across the adult (18 or over) estate,
with the introduction of a centralised privileges and facilities list.
This will set out what is available at the different IEP levels.
Governors 
<?notus-xml column=833?>of prisons will be able to select privileges from this list to meet
local circumstances but will not be able to deviate from

error has reduced by 37%. In 2012 there were a total of 45 releases in
error, which equated to 0.05% of discharges from prison. Releases in
error are taken very seriously and action has been taken to tighten
processes and focus managers' attention in this area. All incidents are

should be noted that around 98% of offenders sentenced for retail theft
are dealt with at a magistrates court, broadly indicating the lower
levels of planning involved in the offences in question and the stolen
goods typically being of a lower value. An increasing number of
offences are carried out by re-offenders with five offences or more,
which highlights the need for effective rehabilitation of those
convicted. The Government is committed to strengthening sentences, so
that they combine robust punishment with requirements that are
effective at preventing further offending and which provide reparation
to victims and communities. At a time when crime is falling we have
increased the length and duration of curfews, given courts greater
flexibility to impose programme and treatment requirements, and made
the delivery of community payback swifter and more intensive.</hs_Para>

Department and its executive agencies External training costs are those
which are delivered outside of our internal resources with approval
through the central Civil Service Learning arrangement. This can
include professional training and training through academic bodies.
External training providers are able to deliver
specialist training which is sometimes not
available internally. Externally procuring specialist training in this

opportunities for young people through the new Civil Service Fast Track

take part by offering placements on this scheme, once further details
are announced after the initial pilot, which commences in the autumn.
By taking part in a scheme, run centrally through Civil Service

Assured shorthold tenants enjoy a minimum tenancy term of six months

in legislation. The no-fault ground for possession gives landlords an
automatic right to possession, provided the landlord has given the
tenant at least two months' notice. However, an order for possession on

tenancies are currently excluded from the assured tenancy regime. This
means that the only statutory protection enjoyed by a Crown tenant is

Jeremy Browne:</Member></B> Damping is a means of ensuring stability in
funding for Police and Crime Commissioners between years. After
considering the responses of an informal consultation on damping, the
Government decided that every police force area in 2013-14 (and in
2014-15) will face the same percentage reduction in core central
Government funding. The cash reduction in this funding for 2013-14 is
1.6%. This mirrors the approach taken for the first two years of this
spending review
period.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307198000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0005.htm#1307198000204">Damping
is only one part of the police funding picture, which is driven by the
Police Allocation Formula (PAF). The Government will conduct a
fundamental review of the PAF (including damping) to begin in due
course and will seek the views of PCCs. Until this review of the Police
Allocation Formula is completed, the Government considers that it would
be inappropriate to change existing arrangements, as this is the basis
on which many PCCs have made their financial
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307198000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0005.htm#1307198000205">In
2011 -12, the effect of damping was to reduce core Government funding
to West Midlands Police Authority by £27.5 million (equating to
5.2%), compared to what it would have received if the raw formula had
been used. In 2012-13, the reduction was £23 million (equating

on the effectiveness of equality law. The Commission has already
indicated in its Business Plan for 2013-14 that it intends to undertake
research into caste issues in this country and make recommendations.
The complexity of caste means that it is vital that preparatory work

IMGE is a mechanism for monitoring the overall effectiveness of the
Government's equality strategy; however, implementation of the strategy
is overseen by other relevant ministerial groups and committees. For
example, the Minister for Women and Equalities is chair of a bespoke
ministerial group, which includes members of the IMGE, which has been
established to drive delivery of the Women's Business Council
recommendations. This work will significantly contribute to the aim set
out in the equality strategy of creating a fair and flexible labour

2012 and 2013, HM Treasury created apprenticeships by recruiting into
vacancies that already existed in HM Treasury, advertising via the
National Apprenticeship Service. By bringing apprentices into existing
vacancies, the strategy was to create the prospect of employment in the
longer term if the posts continued to exist, and the apprentices
successfully completed their apprenticeship. There are currently 6
Range Bs (AA/AO equivalent), who have studied or are studying Level 2
NVQ in Business and Administration, of whom five have been offered
employment on a permanent basis. More recently, one higher level
apprenticeship at Range C (EO equivalent), who is studying the Advanced
IT user qualification has begun. HM Treasury continues to actively
support the Government Apprenticeship scheme and will continue to look
for further apprenticeship opportunities in the future.</hs_Para>

statutory duties to enforce competition law and to protect consumers.
Any replacement body would need to take on these functions. In addition
a change to a new regulator would be likely to incur transitional costs
associated with any staffing changes, establishment of a new
organisation, premises and so forth. These costs would be above the
ongoing running costs inherited from
Ofgem.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1307198000091" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0006.htm#1307198000091">Overseas

value of overpayments, both at UK level and in the areas requested, has
increased over the last five years. However, as a proportion of total

Budget 2010 and Spending Review 2010 will have increased the level and
number of overpayments. In particular, the decrease in the income rises
disregard from £25,000 to £10,000 will have increased

Francois:</Member></B> The Ministry of Defence (MOD) takes any theft,
loss, attacks, or misuse of its information, networks and associated
media storage devices very seriously and has robust procedures in place
to mitigate against and investigate such occurrences. Furthermore, new
processes, instructions and technological aids are continually being
implemented to mitigate human errors and raise the awareness of every
individual in the
Department.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071912000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0007.htm#13071912000216">The
MOD does not generally record items as ‘lost’. Any
incident where an information asset has not been handled and recorded
correctly in accordance with our strict guidelines is recorded as the
asset being ‘unaccounted for’. In a high proportion of
cases where information and communications technology (ICT) is reported
as missing it is likely it has been officially disposed of without the
correct record being
maintained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071912000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0007.htm#13071912000217">352
of the assets recorded as ‘unaccounted for’ in financial
year (FY) 2012-13 are a result of a legacy accounting issue with the
accuracy of recording assets belonging to a network which was in use
from approximately 1990 to 2005 and contained around 88,000 assets. The
discrepancy was noted as a result of responses to the Burton report in
2008 but ongoing action to locate the assets resulted in it not being
centrally recorded at this time. It was formally reported to the
Joint Security Co-ordination Centre (JSyCC) as part of
negotiations for a contract transfer in 2012. For this reason it
appears in FY 2012-13, although the incident itself will have taken
place over eight years ago. Investigations suggest it is very likely
that none of these assets has left MOD establishments and that they
have therefore not been ‘lost’. However, they are
recorded as ‘unaccounted for’ as this cannot be
conclusively proven at this
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071912000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130718/text/130718w0007.htm#13071912000218">It

and complex and because of its nature it is difficult to estimate when
it will conclude. A significant number of active lines of inquiry are

in any detail but I can confirm that, for example, the military police
are speaking to new potential witnesses who have come forward following
a recent television appeal on the German equivalent of the BBC's
Crimewatch programme. In doing so, they are working closely with police
forces in other countries.</hs_Para>
