years ago, the independent review of the postal sector, led by Richard

2010, Richard Hooper’s updated report confirmed his initial
findings and that a package of measures was needed to secure the
universal service. Through the Postal Services Act 2011, which I
introduced three years ago, we have implemented two elements of the
package by establishing Ofcom as the postal regulator and taking on
Royal Mail’s historic pension

set out in today’s report, we will now implement the third and
final element of the Hooper recommendations by selling shares through
an IPO in this financial year. We will retain flexibility on the size
of stake to be sold as that will be influenced by market conditions,
investor demand and our objective to ensure overall value for money for
the taxpayer. It is our intention to dispose of a majority stake,

IPO will include a retail offer to enable members of the public to buy
shares on the same terms as the big institutional investors. At the
time of the IPO, the Government will allocate 10% of the shares to an

recognising that many would otherwise find them unaffordable, and I
want to strengthen employee engagement by ensuring that employees own a
real stake in the business. Employees must retain their shares for at
least three years, giving longevity to the scheme. Our scheme will be
the biggest employee share scheme of any major privatisation for nearly

employees will also receive priority in allocation if they purchase
shares in the retail offer. I want to reassure employees that ownership
change does not trigger any change in their terms and conditions. The
Communication Workers Union will continue to be their recognised
representative and employees’ pensions will continue to be
governed by the trustees. As part of a three-year agreement, Royal Mail
is also prepared to give assurances on the continuation of a

also due to the management and the work force who have implemented a
modernisation plan. The challenge now is to maintain that positive
momentum. In recent history, Royal Mail’s core UK mails business
has swung between profit and loss. In the 12 years since 2001, it
suffered losses in five of those years and more than 50,000 jobs were
lost. Resting on the current level of progress is not

public ownership there is simply not the freedom to raise
capital in the markets. A share sale will not only provide commercial
discipline but give Royal Mail future access to private capital,
enabling the company to continue modernising and to take
advantage of market opportunities such as the growth in online
shopping, building on its success in parcels and logistics. Recent

are various myths that we must rebut. Contrary to what is being
claimed, after a sale, Royal Mail will still be the UK’s
universal service provider. That includes services to urban and rural
areas and free services for the blind. Only an affirmative resolution
in Parliament can change these minimum requirements. Free services for
the armed forces are entirely independent of ownership and Royal Mail
is fully reimbursed for those services by the Ministry of
Defence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0001.htm#13071070000213">Ofcom’s
primary duty is to secure the provision of the universal service. It
also has duties to promote competition where that benefits consumers. I
want to be absolutely clear that should the two duties be in conflict,
the universal service takes precedence. In March, Ofcom published a
statement on its approach to end-to-end competition, making it clear
that should a threat to the universal service arise from this
competition, it has powers to take any necessary action. Ofcom is
currently the most appropriate body to assess and react to such threats
to the universal service, but as a safeguard, the Government have
retained powers to direct Ofcom with respect to certain regulatory
levers, such as reviewing the financial burden of the universal service
and taking mitigating action to ensure that the universal service is
maintained.</hs_Para>

confirm that Post Office Ltd will remain a publicly owned institution,
although we continue to explore mutualisation. The Government have

conclusion, the Government’s decision on the sale is practical
and logical. It is a commercial decision designed to put Royal
Mail’s future on a long-term, sustainable basis. It is
consistent with developments elsewhere in Europe; privatised operators
in Austria, Germany and Belgium produce profit margins far higher than
Royal Mail’s, and have continued to provide high-quality,
expanding services. The time has come for the Government to step back
from Royal Mail and allow its management to focus wholeheartedly on
growing the business and planning for the future. It is time for
employees to hold a stake in the company and share in its success. This
Government will give Royal Mail the real commercial freedom that it has
needed for a long time, and I commend this statement to the
House.</hs_Para>

Mail in public ownership gives the taxpayer an ongoing direct interest
in the maintenance of universal postal services in this country; helps
safeguard the vital link that the Royal Mail has with the Post Office;
and ensures that the taxpayer gets to share in the upside of
modernisation and the increased profits that Royal Mail delivers.

are ignoring the huge changes that have taken place since the passage

self-financing in the future.</hs_Para>

every sign that this treasured national institution is being sold off

competition from other postal service operators who are not subject to

allowed to put the Post Office at risk. What guarantees can he give
that a privately owned Royal Mail will renew the agreement under which
the Post Office provides Royal Mail products, which is essential to the
Post Office’s future? What will happen in 2022? Is it not the
case that he cannot give any guarantees on what will happen when the
agreement expires? On the future of the Post Office, when can we expect

centres for a fast buck, which will be replaced by distant depots,
sorting offices and the rest, which are hard to get to for consumers

times past which have delivered for the British people, but there have
also been examples in rail and energy under the last Conservative

Germany. The hon. Gentleman often cites Germany as a role model for
good industrial policy, and we have many lessons to learn from it.

additional shareholding. The principle under which the share scheme
will operate is that it will be locked in for three years to give the
arrangement longevity. I imagine that most postal workers will want to
hold the shares for at least five years to take full advantage of the

come first to events in Egypt. Although the events of the past two
weeks have been a major setback for democracy, they need not represent
an irreversible trend. The role of the military in any democracy must
be both clearly defined and subject to Executive oversight, so the
priority must now be a return to civilian rule through a credible
transition process that results in swift, fair and free elections. I
welcome the recent statement by interim president Mansour setting a
deadline for new elections to be held before February 2014. However,
recent reports suggest that not all parties have accepted that process,
and there have been recent statements from the Muslim Brotherhood
apparently refusing to take part. Does the Foreign Secretary agree that
it is vital that the transition process from interim to full civilian

Opposition’s attitude on Egypt. What has happened may be a
setback for democracy, but it need not be an irreversible trend. That
is absolutely right. He is right to point out that some parties in
Egypt have not agreed to the timetable of parliamentary and
presidential elections set out by the new president in the
constitutional declaration. In fact, worryingly, most of them have not
agreed, including the National Salvation Front, which was one of the
prime movers behind last week’s events. There were widespread
objections to the details of the announcement. As he said, this cannot
be resolved in any other way than an inclusive legitimate process
inside Egypt. We therefore call on all parties to do that.</hs_Para>

would be a terrible mistake for the authorities in Egypt to act in a
way that drives the Muslim Brotherhood, or any other legitimate party,
out of democratic politics. That mistake must be avoided at all costs.
It would also be a mistake, however, for the Muslim Brotherhood to now
refuse, under all circumstances, to take part in democratic politics in
the months and years ahead. All nations who hold dear the stability and
future of Egypt, as we do, have to encourage people, whether the Muslim
Brotherhood or the new authorities, to resolve these differences and
counsel against making those mistakes. Part of that is about releasing
prisoners. I agree about that and I made that point to the acting
Foreign Minister of Egypt. The Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and
Commonwealth Affairs, my hon. Friend the Member for North East
Bedfordshire, pursued the point with the Egyptian ambassador just this
morning. Prisoners should be released unless criminal charges are to be
laid. The holding of prisoners for political purposes after these
events does not help the process.</hs_Para>

to provide to him, or to the Library, more details. The $38 billion was
not a fund, but the total financing from all global institutions
available to the countries of the region if and when they pursue
economic policies that give them access to it. One of the problems of
the outgoing Government in Egypt was that they did not agree an IMF
programme, and therefore did not win international financial support.
The part of the Deauville partnership that involves funds that can be
given away is much smaller. We have been determined, during our
presidency of the G8, to make a tangible difference, and this year the
Deauville partnership transition fund has started to deliver practical
support. Projects of more than $100 million have been approved, and
these principally support the development of small and medium-sized
enterprises. This is the part that is a fund, but potential
international financing is vastly greater, if the right economic
reforms are

think there is strong agreement across the House and support for a

out in the House previously that we have to be ready, in the UK and in
other European countries, once negotiations get going, to offer
incentives or even disincentives at times during the negotiations for
Israelis and Palestinians to try to make it a success, working with the
United States. First, we have to get the negotiations going. We have
been urging Israeli and Palestinian 
<?notus-xml column=383?>leaders to take the opportunity to work with John Kerry, stressing that

offences, as it is now in Homs, it does not have an incentive to come
to meaningful negotiations, and neither is the Opposition in a frame of

Iran, given the scale of its intervention in Syria. The extent to which
it can be involved in a peace process will be heavily up to Iran,
however; it has not, hitherto, expressed support for the outcome of
last year’s Geneva conference and the creation of a transitional
Government with full executive authority. Without agreeing with that,
it is very hard to see how a success can be made of participation in
negotiations over the coming months. Of course, however, those

example. However, reforming the Egyptian economy,
reinforcing the rule of law, tackling corruption and making
it more attractive for international companies to
invest in Egypt, as well as agreeing a programme with the IMF, would
allow a great deal more assistance to flow to Egypt. Egypt has had
financial support from Qatar, and has now apparently been offered
financial support from Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, but
if it is to build a sustainable economy and get more assistance from

include, subject to debate, scrutiny and change in this House, the
following provisions. First, it would include the consolidation and
simplification of existing legislation under one Act. At present,
trafficking offences are contained in three separate pieces of
legislation: the Sexual Offences Act 2003, the Asylum and Immigration
(Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, and the Coroners and Justice
Act 2009. This makes the legislation contrasting rather than
complementary. It also serves to maintain the widely held
misunderstanding of modem slavery as primarily an
immigration—not a criminal—problem. Bringing all modem
slavery and human trafficking offences under one Act would address the
current confusion and misunderstanding in the justice system. Moreover,
the symbolic message of enacting these provisions under the title
“Modem Slavery Act” would itself help to raise the
profile of modem slavery and send a clear message, domestically and
internationally, that the UK takes this issue very
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:25:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000438">Secondly,
I propose legislation for an “Anti-Slavery Rapporteur”.
As an anti-EU Tory, of course, I could not possibly bring myself to
call it that, so why do we not suggest “Commissioner”
instead? Modelled on the Children’s Commissioner for England,
the Anti-Slavery Commissioner would be statutorily obliged and
empowered to represent the interests of victims of modem slavery, and
in doing so, would fulfil the role of “critical friend”
to the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000439">At
present, the Government maintain that the Inter-Departmental
Ministerial Group on Human Trafficking is equivalent to a national
rapporteur and therefore fulfils the UK’s obligations in this
respect under article 19. However, the group fails in this regard. I
would argue that it is not possible for a group of Government Ministers
to carry out this role: Ministers have many other competing
responsibilities and can devote only a limited amount of time to this
issue. The group meets only every six months and is often subject to
change at reshuffles. Who knows, by the end of next week, we may have a
new set of Ministers to deal
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:27:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000440" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000440">In
addition, attendance at meetings is less than 50% and at the
most recent meeting, apart from the Chairman, only two Ministers were
present—a Minister for Wales and Minister for
Scotland—with seven Ministers giving their apologies. An
Anti-Slavery Commissioner could replace the Inter-Departmental
Ministerial Group, be more effective and cost less
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:27:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000441" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000441">Thirdly,
the Bill would provide for duties on local authorities for the
provision of support to adult and child victims. Imagine that a
25-year-old woman from a 
<?notus-xml column=396?>small village in Moldova has been offered an escape from poverty via a
job in the UK working as a waitress, providing a chance to earn some
money to send back to her family and provide family members as well as
herself with a better quality of life.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:24:15"></hs_TimeCode>She arrives in
London, but it becomes clear after a while that there never was a
legitimate job opportunity. Her “contact” confiscates her
passport and locks her in a room where she is beaten and repeatedly
raped, and then sold into slavery as a prostitute. She is unable to
escape her traffickers. After a few weeks, months, or even years, she
is eventually found and rescued by the local
police.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000442" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000442">The
Government currently fund a specialist support programme run by the
Salvation Army, which has a network of sub-contracted safe shelters.
The system of care for adult trafficked victims is very good in the
UK—so impressive that the Government have doubled their funding
from £1.5 million last year to £3 million this year,
despite the austerity. These safe houses offer adult victims the
deserved chance to begin a recovery from the horrific mental, physical
and emotional damage that they have experienced at the hands of
traffickers. These victims have witnessed unimaginable horrors, yet are
given an opportunity to be brought back to
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000443" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000443">Now
imagine a 15-year-old girl from a small village in Moldova who has been
trafficked into the United Kingdom; these stories have the same

way to escape.</hs_Para>

discover the trafficking ring of which the girl is part. She is taken
in by the local authority and put into social care as a “missing
child”. However, she is given no special care and is not even
identified as a victim of trafficking, and the home she is in is not
secure. The traffickers know where she is and soon she disappears from
care—trafficked back into her living hell, to be beaten and
raped once
more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000445" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000445">I
find it almost impossible to believe that we can stand by and allow
such a scandalous situation to continue for one moment longer. We must
enact a solution to this outrageous state of affairs in the quickest
possible manner. We must address the disparity in care between adult
and child victims. We must provide child victims safe and secure homes
that will offer them the same level of care and support that adult
victims receive. Furthermore, child victims need to be identified and
recorded as such by local authorities—a move that would
certainly incur no extra cost, but would make a huge difference to the
plight of the victims.</hs_Para>

cases I have described are obviously horrific, by the nature of things
the magnitude of damage caused to a child victim of trafficking is
likely to be significantly greater. It is shameful that we have
established, and continue to permit, a system that allows such children
to be re-trafficked with such ease. We must learn from the examples of
other countries such as the Philippines, which provides safe houses run
by local non-governmental organisations and charities, partly funded by
the state and designed specifically for the recovery of child victims
and their integration back into society.</hs_Para>

purpose of my Bill relates to the non-prosecution of victims. The Court
of Appeal recently overturned the convictions of four victims of
trafficking 
<?notus-xml column=397?>who had been prosecuted for crimes committed as a result of trafficking.
Three were Vietnamese children forced to work in cannabis farms and one
was a woman forced into sexual exploitation. Protection rights for
victims are not set out in legislation; they are only in Crown
Prosecution Service guidance. It is vital that that discrepancy be
addressed. My Bill would bring in the presumption that victims of
trafficking should not be prosecuted for crimes committed as a result
of their being trafficked.</hs_Para>

also include clauses about several other issues: the return of
foreign-national trafficking victims to their country of origin and
their safe integration back into society; a duty to trace and
confiscate traffickers’ assets; a requirement for large
businesses to report on measures that they are taking to eliminate
modern slavery from their supply chains; and a requirement for
front-line public servants to receive targeted training relating to
human
trafficking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000449" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000449">There
is a general public and political awareness of the horrific nature of
modern-day slavery in the UK and across Europe, but it is not at the
top of any Government’s political agenda. Although our Prime
Minister has done a lot to improve the situation, having brought in a
human trafficking strategy, set up an annual report, had a debate in
Parliament, opened exhibitions and opened up Downing street, and
although we are moving in the right direction, the British Government
must be prepared to stand up to the individuals who perpetrate such
evil crimes. They must take the lead on this most crucial of issues, as
they did almost 200 years ago.</hs_Para>

Byrne:</Member></B> I will give way to the Secretary of State in a
moment, but first I want him to respond to this scenario. His own
figures show that 660,000 people will be hit by this hated tax. He said
when he came to the House that this would save £490 million. Let
us assume that 50% of the people who move go into the private rented
sector. That is going to cost his Department an extra £25 a week
each. Let us assume the rest get another form of social housing. Every
single move costs a registered social landlord £850. Then there
is the cost of arrears, which RSLs say will double. Then there is
£160 million-worth of discretionary housing payment on top. The
truth is that if 40% of people move, this could well cost our country
£580 million, which is £100 million more than
the Secretary of State promised to save. What is his analysis of that?

and City West Housing is expecting arrears of at least £1
million this year. Even worse than that is the effect on choice and
dignity: week in and week out, I am now seeing cases in which disabled
people have to explain why they cannot sleep in the same bedroom as
their carers. They are being assessed on the point of “Why 
<?notus-xml column=402?>can you not sleep in the same bedroom?” Last week I had a letter
about some constituents which stated, “We see no reason why you
cannot sleep in the same bedroom.” Case studies that Carers UK
has provided to Members today, however, explain why for people with
disabilities there is very often a really good reason why the carer
cannot sleep in the same room or the same bed as the person they are
caring

must produce the impact assessment. All of us are now meeting people
who are under such pressure that they are creating more cost elsewhere
in the system. I will probably remember for ever the man I met recently
in Redcar. The great Anna Turley introduced us, and this is what was
said: “Yes, he has a spare room, and do you know what he puts in
it? He puts equipment to help him with renal failure.” Now,
because he is having to move, that opportunity for home care is
disappearing, and the NHS is saying to him “We’re going
to have to take you to and from hospital in an ambulance every single
day.” That is not a cost saving for the NHS. That is a new cost.
It is a straight cost jump from a failure of policy from this
Government.</hs_Para>

botched reform to DLA could see another 10,000 carers lose support.
Parents of disabled children will suffer, too. Parents of 100,000

understand from the Secretary of State’s performance before the

people. How else will he know what to ask for? How many people are
losing their homes? How many are losing their DLA? How many are losing
their homes, their DLA and their ESA? How many will lose carer’s
allowance on top? And how many more disabled people will fall into
poverty as a result of these sweeping changes over the next couple of
years? Surely the Secretary of State cannot justify proceeding with
these reforms blind. Surely he cannot go into negotiations with the
Chancellor later in the year, before the autumn statement, oblivious to

could affect any of us and is therefore something that affects us all.
We should be learning from reform such as that pioneered by the

talk to each other, but where is the DWP? Why is it not coming together
with local councils and the NHS to deliver change? We should create a
“tell us once” approach to collecting information and,
crucially, we should transform back-to-work support by giving people

hours a week, who will get help for the first time. Households with one
or more disabled adults will be able to keep up to £647 a month
of their earnings before seeing a reduction in their universal credit.
It will also offer a more flexible system for people whose ability to

all know that some disabled people face extra costs as a result of the
impact of their disability. The main source of financial support,
disability living allowance, has not been fundamentally reformed since
1992. Our welfare reforms presented an opportunity to start afresh,
keeping the best elements of DLA that people value, but bringing the
benefit up to date to make it fit for the 21st century. The personal
independence payment—PIP—is 
<?notus-xml column=413?>easy to understand and administer. It is financially sustainable and
more objective. It will be better targeted on those in most need.
Throughout the whole development, we have consulted widely with
disabled people and have used their views to inform policy design. We
have continued to listen and consult, ensuring that these reforms
continue to be shaped by the views of disabled people themselves. In
other words, reform is not static and this Government are committed to
listening and acting where change is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000567" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0002.htm#13071070000567">Instead
of simply cutting money from everyone, we chose the more difficult but
principled option of modernising the benefit and focusing support where
it is most needed. PIP will be awarded on the basis of a fair,
consistent and objective assessment which will enable us to target
support on those who face the greatest barriers to independent living.
More than one fifth of PIP recipients will get both of the highest
rates, worth £134.40 each week, compared with only 16% on DLA.
That demonstrates that we are focusing support on those in most

one area. He has not taken into account tax changes, changes in fuel
duty, the additional money that we are spending on improving access,
the pupil premium or the changes that we are making to social care. To
do an assessment properly—to look at that level of
detail—as the motion suggests, involves looking across the whole

ways of joining up and simplifying care. We have made fundamental

four bedrooms. She objected, as was her right, to the bedroom subsidy,
yet at the same time—I am not divulging any

their baby were living in a bedsit in the borough in my constituency.

with disabilities. That was proved absolutely not to be the
case—no more so than when the Prime Minister stood at that
Dispatch Box and compared someone living in a residential care setting
to someone in a hospital. That completely missed the difference between
a medical model and a social model of care. The reality is that this

that is the case only when support is also offered. The Minister will
no doubt be aware that in Scotland, we are undergoing a change in the
way people with disabilities are empowered to buy their own care
through direct payments. This means that many people, whom I hope she
would have included in the exemptions from the tax, will no longer be
exempted, because they are being empowered to buy their care and not
receive it from the provider who owns the property in which they live.

I ask the Minister to respond to the court ruling on the Gorry case,

the Equality Act 2010 to compel the child to share a room, given the
extent of his disability. Will the Government act on this, and most of
all, will they give the organisation that is going to have to support
people through this incredibly difficult process the information it

2009-10. This is not about seeking to reduce the welfare budget,

Chancellor and the Prime Minister have repeatedly lectured us about the
need for fairness and said that we are all in this together. However,
it is clear that it is not the richest, most powerful and most able in
our society who will pay the costs of this Government’s cold

the most vulnerable and the least powerful—the

us look at the elements of welfare reform that are having an impact on
disabled people, and their carers and families. The introduction of the
universal credit will result in 2 million households seeing a drop in
their income, with disabled people being among those worst affected.

major change is the introduction of the personal independence payment.
Last year, in a Westminster Hall debate, the Minister with
responsibility for disability 
<?notus-xml column=431?>matters said that 160,000 claimants would get a reduced award and
170,000 would get no award—that was before a single individual
assessment had taken place, so it was a very mean prediction.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:01:40"></hs_TimeCode>
announcement concerned me greatly, given that the Minister already had
figures on those who would get a reduced award and those who would
receive no support before any assessments had taken place. Surely that

benefit is based on individual
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000712" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0003.htm#13071070000712">The

tree spouting jobs these days in places such as north-east England. As
I am sure the Minister is aware, unemployment there is going up, not

When we had the debate in Westminster Hall in December the figure was
24, so that cost is going up by the month. We need to ensure that the
assessment criteria take proper account of the full range of barriers
faced by people with disabilities and health conditions, making the
assessment and reassessment processes as simple, transparent and
proportionate as possible and ensuring that robust evaluation and
monitoring processes are in place. We need to bring all the strands
together—the bedroom tax, housing, the welfare reform and the
changes to legal aid. All those things will have an impact on
people’s capacity to deal with the real changes occurring in
their lives day by day. I ask all Members to support the original

the Member for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) mentioned
earlier, revealed that by 2017-18, 3.7 million disabled people will
collectively lose £28 billion as a result of the
Government’s cumulative benefit changes. If Scope and Demos can
do a cumulative impact assessment, why cannot the Government? That is a
staggering expropriation from arguably the most deprived and
disadvantaged section of the entire population and it is perhaps worth
rehearsing quickly the range of the cumulative impact: the incapacity
benefit reassessment; the reassessment of the personal independence
payments; the overall cap; the universal credit; the time limitation of
employment support allowance; the change to local housing allowance;
the bedroom tax; the abolition of the independent living fund; the 1%
cap on benefit uprating; the localisation of and 10% cut in council tax
benefit; and the 1% cap on various benefits and tax credits. That is
the range of it.</hs_Para>

benefit cuts, losing a total of £23,000 each over five years.

they will devolve it to local authorities. Let me ask the Minister some
questions—and I expect a reply. Will that be ring-fenced when it

so many disabled persons who have been through the process have said,
the worst aspect of the employment and support allowance assessment is
fear and insecurity. There is the belief that a test has been created

ill-health worse; and the stress and uncertainty of repeated
assessments, which are like a sword of Damocles hanging over people

improve assessors’ questioning technique, and preferably
transfer that whole function back to the national health service;

want to talk briefly about some of the proposed changes and why we
think they will have more of an impact on the disabled. In the spending
review in June this year, the Chancellor announced that for the first
time ever there will be a cap on the UK’s welfare spending
through changes to the annual managed expenditure. That means that if
demand for disability benefit rises in future, there is a substantial
risk that disabled people will lose vital financial lifelines. The
impact will be that they will be left more exposed to trade-offs within
the cap. If the need for housing benefit rises sharply one year, there
is a risk that disability benefit will be a lower spending
priority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000751" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0003.htm#13071070000751">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:51:46"></hs_TimeCode>
Welfare Reform Act 2012 introduced a number of measures, one of which
was a new single benefit—universal credit—to replace six
income-based benefits and tax credits for people of working age. Around
2 million households will see their income drop when
universal credit is introduced, and disabled people will be
particularly affected. While the average household will be worse off by
£26, the average disabled household will be worse off by
£37.</hs_Para>

the halving of support for disabled children from £57 a week to
£28 a week could see a reduction in income for families with
disabled children of up to £1,366 a year—more than
£20,000 over the course of a childhood. It is estimated that
this change will affect about 100,000 disabled children. The removal of
the £58 a week severe disability premium will have a profound
impact, affecting 230,000 disabled adults and potentially costing them
more than
£3,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:55:14"></hs_TimeCode> a

introduction of the personal independence payment, which is to be

change that is being introduced is the contributions-based employment
and support allowance, which is to be subjected to a 365-day limit. It
applies to disabled people in the work-related activity group who are
assessed as not being able to work immediately but who could, with help
and support, return to the labour market in future. This will affect
some 700,000 people by the year 2015-16, and of those 40% will lose
their ESA completely. This change could force disabled people back into
work when they are not ready for it—and, let us face it, there
are not many jobs out there in any event—and push them into
disposing of any assets they have, with their partners perhaps having
to cut back on their working hours.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:56:45"></hs_TimeCode> effects of
these changes are likely to be compounded by the Government’s
recent decision, set out in the autumn statement, to increase the value

has been said about the bedroom tax, which reduces housing benefit for

my own. We heard earlier that the discretionary fund is completely
unable to deal with the scale of the problem. I think it was suggested
that one in 10 people will be able to get proper compensation from the
funds available. There may well be discrepancies throughout the

different
situations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000765" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0003.htm#13071070000765">We
know from various studies in Scotland that £1 billion is
expected to be taken out of the pockets of those who currently receive
disability benefits. Citizens Advice has said that across the UK up to
half a million disabled people will lose out, just because of the
change to universal credit. As we move towards those changes and the
personal independence payment, a cumulative range of impacts will
disproportionately affect those with disabilities.</hs_Para>

in the coalition Government has any mandate for such an attack on
working people or for targeting those with disabilities. I believe the
British people have the right to know the truth, and we should not rely
on charities and independent organisations to give us information. We

seen in other areas of policy that they are completely unwilling to
provide such assessments regarding what will happen to women or people
from ethnic backgrounds. Today we must make it clear that we expect the
Government to tell the truth about the impact of their policies on
disabled people. If we do that, we will get the support of the British

old-fashioned and too reliant on physical disabilities. The Minister is
fond of saying that the new system will be better for those with

argued that DLA is too easy to obtain, but more than half of all claims
are refused when first applied for. Part of the idea that DLA is too
easy to get was set out to the House again by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:07:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Spelthorne (Kwasi Kwarteng). He claimed that most people get DLA by
filling in a form, which is all they have to do, but that is simply not
the case. Figures from the Department for Work and Pensions from 2010
state that 16% of decisions are made without “additional”
information, other than the form, but that does not mean that medical
information is not provided because people send it with the form. Some
36% of decisions are made on the basis of further non-medical
information—remember that there may already be medical
information—such as phoning the claimant to get more information
or speaking to a carer, and 48% of decisions 
<?notus-xml column=440?>are made on the basis of further medical information or assessment.
Worryingly, in a press release from as recently as June this year, the
DWP again repeated that more than half of claims are made without any
medical information. It is not helpful to keep repeating things that
are not
accurate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071070000770" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0003.htm#13071070000770">The
other accusation about DLA was that claims are never looked at again,
and the June press release stated that 71% of current recipients
“get” indefinite rewards. The tense is important because
if we read “get”, we presume that something is still
ongoing. In fact, in 2010, 77% of new claims were for fixed periods,
and 23% were indefinite. The figure in the press release goes back to
1992, when many more indefinite claims were granted. Things have
already changed. If we start making policy on the basis of false
premises, and create a straw man—as the Government constantly do
to justify what they are doing—the chances are that we will get
things wrong.</hs_Para>

people who are very badly affected by these changes are those in the 45
to 65 age group. If they fall ill, they lose income from their job. For
many couples, that means a halving of their income, and of course they
will have higher costs for such things as heating. Many lose employment
and support allowance after a year if they are in the work-related
activity group, often because they have a partner’s earnings,
even if that partner works only part time; savings towards their
retirement, which they will now have to use up before they ever get to
retirement age; or an early retirement pension. Given the forthcoming
increase in pension age, people will be in that limbo for a lot longer.

same group may be among those who do not receive the personal
independence payment. Some 66% of those on the lowest rate
of DLA are aged over 45, so they are likely to be the most affected.
That is also the age at which illness and disability are most likely to
occur. If they are tenants, they are also likely to be affected by the
bedroom tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T17:10:29"></hs_TimeCode>.

social care, access to legal aid and independent living are right, the

of the fantastic policy and analytical capacity in the DWP and the

complexity of disability and the very different life experiences that
everyone lives through, so let me talk about the range of people we are
dealing with: from people like Stephen Hawking, who has a brain the
size of the planet but is very physically disabled, to people who are
mentally severely disabled but physically very able, and everybody else
in between—from fluctuating to sensory to cognitive. We have to
support each one of those. We have to find individual, tailor-made
support for each of those people and provide it in an holistic
approach, and that is what we are doing, bringing together social care,
health, education and all the benefits. What I will say,

with disabled people and their organisations. This is about supporting
them and finding out what their needs, their aspirations, their desires
are, and finding out what they want to do and how they want to be
portrayed. They have the same dreams as every one of us—yes,
they want a job; yes, they want to get married; and yes,
they want a family life—and we are supporting them in
that.</hs_Para>

is what universal credit is all about. It is about helping people to
get into work, to do as little or as much as they can do. It is about
giving them extra support, and about tailored allowances. It is also
about a tapered relief, which is something that the Labour Government
never introduced. Under them, the system was very statist, with people
being told, “You must do 16 hours”, and a 98% tax rate
sometimes being applied. We are not doing that.</hs_Para>

Government are determined to do all they can to minimise the threat
from terrorism to the UK and our interests abroad. Proscription is an
important part of the Government’s strategy to tackle terrorist
activities. We propose, through the order, to add both Jama’atu
Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad, more widely known as Boko Haram, and
Minbar Ansar Deen, also known as Ansar al-Sharia UK, to the list of
international terrorist organisations, amending schedule 2 to the
Terrorism Act 2000. This is the 12th proscription order under
that
Act.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071093001103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0003.htm#13071093001103">Schedule
3 of the Act provides a power for the Home Secretary to proscribe an
organisation if she believes that it is currently “concerned in
terrorism”. The Act specifies that an organisation is concerned
in terrorism if it commits or participates in acts of terrorism,
prepares for terrorism, promotes or encourages terrorism, including the
unlawful glorification of terrorism, or is otherwise concerned in
terrorism. If the test is met, the Home Secretary may exercise her
discretion to proscribe the organisation, having taken into account a
number of factors. Those factors are: the nature and scale of an
organisation’s activities; the specific threat that it poses to
the United Kingdom; the specific threat that it poses to British
nationals overseas; the organisation’s presence in the United
Kingdom; and the need to support other members of the international
community in tackling terrorism.</hs_Para>

wide ranging impact of proscription, the Home Secretary exercises her
power to proscribe only after thoroughly reviewing the available
relevant information and evidence on the organisation. This includes
open source material, intelligence material and advice that reflects
consultation across Government, including with the intelligence and law
enforcement agencies. These decisions are taken with great care by the

Clearly, his own experience was very shocking and I well understand why

Proscription can be an important mechanism to disrupt activity. We
therefore believe that it is an appropriate mechanism to send a strong
message that terrorist organisations are not tolerated in the UK and to
act as a deterrent to their operating here. It also means that an
organisation is outlawed and is unable to operate.</hs_Para>

Haram is a prolific terrorist organisation based in Nigeria whose
ultimate goal is to establish the Islamic caliphate. Seeking to
undermine democratic government through its campaign of violence and
attacks, it has targeted all sections of Nigerian
society—Muslims, Christians, rich, poor, civilians and members
of the security forces alike—as well as members of the
international community. For example, an attack near Abuja on Christmas
day 2011 that killed at least 26 people, and an attack on a
bus station in Kano City in March 2013 that killed over 60, were both
attributed to the organisation. The organisation has also sought to
attack international targets in Nigeria. In August 2011, it claimed
responsibility for a suicide attack against the UN building in Abuja
that killed 26. It has also targeted westerners for kidnapping in the

Haram has carried out indiscriminate, mass-casualty attacks, and
clearly we are conscious of all the events I have outlined. We believe
that proscribing that organisation shows our condemnation of its
activities very clearly and will prevent it operating in the UK and
give the police powers to tackle any UK-based support for it, so
proscription is an important step. I cannot comment on specific
discussions we have had with the Nigerian Government, but clearly those
continue. I stress the point I made earlier about condemning any human

that we have noted carefully the comments in David Anderson’s
report about the de-proscription process and that we responded to the
report in March. In that context, under the current regime any person
affected by a proscription can submit an application to the Home
Secretary requesting that she consider whether the organisation should
be de-proscribed. The Home Secretary has received no de-proscription
applications, and I understand that none was received by her
predecessor since 2009. I can assure the right hon. Gentleman that
officials continue to explore options for improving the de-proscription

of which have been raised in this House on many occasions by my right
hon. Friend the Chairman of the Home Affairs Committee, and to the

first point is about the independent reviewer’s recommendation
for a time limit on proscription and my second is about
de-proscription. As I understand it, the only group to be de-proscribed
achieved it by judicial review. The Minister has said that no
applications have 
<?notus-xml column=460?>been made to the Home Secretary, but will he explain why there was a
judicial review? It may have happened several years ago. May I also
press the Minister on his assurance that we will receive a response at
the earliest opportunity, to use his

that time is pressing and Parliament will enter recess next week, is
the Minister able to assure us that we will receive a response from the

my comments are not meant to be inimical. The fact remains, however,
that there are sometimes clear legal reasons why it is difficult to pin
down such organisations. The previous Prime Minister found exactly the
same situation, and there are legal reasons why it is difficult to
achieve. There are also good intelligence reasons why it is sometimes
necessary—or advised—to be less robust with such
organisations than might otherwise be the temptation. Simply put, if
Hizb ut-Tahrir were to be banned, as appears likely at the moment, it
would soon spring up as “son of” or “bride
of” or “ghost of” Hizb ut-Tahrir, under a
different name with a different faction and a different flag. We need

damagingly, as the previous Government did. My view is that the period
is currently far too long. I ask him to understand that we combated the
Irish Republican Army and Irish terrorism, or republican terrorism as I
should probably call it more accurately, with a much shorter period of
detention without trial. I speak from personal experience, although I
entirely take the point that Mr Speaker has just made, Madam Deputy
Speaker. We combated that terrorism within the law and with the
principle and understanding that a man or woman is innocent until
proved guilty. We did so on the basis that those who opposed us were

the fact that any period for which we take away a man or woman’s

and sensitivities of terrorism, means that we unintentionally add to,
aid and abet terrorists’ cause. In the same way, the death of
Drummer Rigby—the death of simply one man, desperately sad
though it was—has drawn attention to that cause. If we make an
issue of the matter again and try to turn our liberties on their head

Nigeria, but with people in this country who support what is going on
in Nigeria, north Cameroon and Niger. The other has been involved in
all kinds of activities, particularly in Libya, but also in other
countries that promote terrorism. In the United Kingdom, it promotes

worry about proscription orders, especially in respect of new groups,
is how the heads of those groups can be chopped off, and, amoeba-like,
they can form themselves into different organisations with different
names. For example, the Home Secretary proscribed Muslims Against
Crusades in November 2011 on the grounds that it was simply a new name
for an organisation that was already proscribed. However, as we know
from other proscription orders, it is possible for Boko Haram and Ansar
al-Sharia, or the people behind them, to suddenly create themselves
into new organisations with new names. One example is the case of Mr
Anjem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:38:05"></hs_TimeCode> Choudary,
who has created numerous new organisations after his organisation was

This was a criticism not of the Prime Minister, but of the system. The

be done, but somehow the system does not allow it to happen. That is

the proscription of these two

was disappointed with the Minister’s response to my
intervention. He is an accomplished performer at the Dispatch Box and
before the Home Affairs Committee—we will be calling him again

hon. Member for Newark—I was about to call him the Minister for
Newark; of course, he ought to have been security Minister at some
stage, given his knowledge of the subject, but there is still time,
with two years to go—the shadow Minister and I are not
suggesting it in this case, but
when<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:44:26"></hs_TimeCode> we
proscribe, we ought to put in place a time limit for reviewing the
order, not because we would want to de-proscribe as soon as we
proscribe, but because it would be right to keep reviewing these
organisations, just in case they turn out to be shell organisations. I
have mentioned the Tamil Tigers on the two most recent occasions that
we have discussed this, although the Minister was not here last
time—the Immigration Minister stood in for him. The Tamil Tigers
have ceased to exist—everyone in the organisation has ceased to
exist—yet they are still proscribed in the United

Minister invites us to make an application for de-proscription for
which there is no timetable. That means, I am afraid, that the matter
ends up not in this House, which is responsible for proscription, but
in the courts, where organisations are able to spend a lot of money. I
think of the People’s Mujahedeen. Like me, Madam Deputy Speaker,
you were in the House when that happened, on the Government Benches. A
Minister came before the House and said, “We are de-proscribing
the People’s Mujahedeen, because they’ve gone to court
and won their judicial review.” I do not want these two
organisations to do the same thing, which was why I said that the
Minister’s answers were unsatisfactory.</hs_Para>

told us one year ago, on 4 July 2012, that there would be a response
“in due course”. I have discovered that that is one of
the Minister’s favourite sayings—I am going to look in
<I>Hansard </I>at how many times he says it; but he was a distinguished
lawyer before he came to the House, and “in due course”
is something that lawyers tend to say in their arguments. On 22
November 2012, however, the Immigration Minister, who is not a lawyer,
used the word “shortly” in the House.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T18:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>“Shortly”

the word “response” also needs to be looked at, because
although the Minister said that there had been a response—you
were not in the Chair at the time, 
<?notus-xml column=465?>Madam Deputy Speaker, so I will not draw you into this debate—the
Government’s response was to say that the report by the
independent reviewer of terrorism, David Anderson, QC, had been
“noted”. That is a very odd response from the Government.
We are used to them saying, “A Select
Committee”—or an independent reviewer—“has
made a recommendation, and this is what we think about the
subject.” This poor chap went through the preparation of that
entire report and then waited a whole year to be told that it had been
“noted”. Now we hear from the Minister, in his response
to me, that he is going to
respond—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I am afraid I have

the Minister is this. He has told us that officials are looking into
the matter. Well, hooray for officials—distinguished officials,
I am sure. He has told us that they are “actively”
considering the matter. What does that mean? Since I last raised the
matter in the House on 4 July 2012, have officials
“inactively” considered it? We have had activity and

decisions on whether to proscribe a particular organisation are taken
after careful consideration and in the light of emerging intelligence.
It is important that such decisions should be built on a robust
evidence base and that they should support other members of the
international community in their fight against terrorism. It would be
inappropriate for me to discuss specific intelligence matters, but I
can assure her that these issues are carefully considered in this
context, and in the context of our broader support for others around
the world in their fight against international terrorism. I note the

hon. Friend the Member for Newark spoke of the need for balance and the
need to ensure that, when we take action, we properly consider
individual freedoms as against the need for collective security.
Sometimes the challenges might be pushed in one direction or the other,
but I am clear that they should be mutually reinforcing. If we are to
uphold our values and traditions, and uphold who we are as a country,
we must ensure that we properly respect individual freedoms and
liberties while providing collective security for the country as a

hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North asked about Hizb ut-Tahrir.
That organisation is not proscribed, and proscription could be
considered only when the Home Secretary believed it to be involved in
terrorism, as defined by the Terrorism Act 2000. However, I want to
make it clear to the House that the Government have significant
concerns about Hizb ut-Tahrir, and we will continue to monitor its
activities closely. Such groups are not free to spread hatred and
incite violence as they please. The police have comprehensive powers to
take action under the criminal law to deal with people who incite
hatred, and they will do so. We will seek to ensure that Hizb ut-Tahrir
and groups like it cannot operate without challenge in public places in
this country. We will not tolerate secret meetings behind closed doors
on premises funded by the taxpayer, and we will ensure that civic
organisations are made well aware of Hizb ut-Tahrir and groups like it,
and of the names under which they operate and the ways in which they go
about their business.

build on the very good work of the Prevent strategy. An example is the
work of Prevent co-ordinators in universities to provide support and

disruptive action against any of its supporters in the UK and ensure
that they cannot operate here. The proscription of Minbar Ansar Deen
will be a powerful tool for the police to help them successfully
disrupt the organisation, and it will also send a powerful message that
the promotion and encouragement of terrorism are not acceptable and
that we will take action against organisations that partake in such

hon. Friend by making accusations against the promoters or London
authorities by suggesting that the Bill is designed to confuse and
ensure that they can get more in penalty income than they might
otherwise be able to. Again, the fact that my hon. Friend raises that
as an issue demonstrates the climate of suspicion regarding a lot of
local authority in relation to the imposition of penalty charges, which
I recall from having read an article are now giving hundreds of
millions of pounds in income to London local authorities alone. Many
people feel those measures were brought in almost by subterfuge through
Bills such as the one we are considering tonight, and now many years
later people can see that has resulted in a significant financial
burden and quite a lot of injustice. That is why I think it would be
better to have simplicity and clarity, which would require that any
provisions in this Bill be introduced in all areas of London at the
same time on the same day, rather than causing the confusion to which I

thought about, which is that these subsections may be superfluous
anyway and it is implicit within the powers being given under clause 3
that an appointed day could be a different day for different parts of
London in different circumstances, in which case, in trying to keep
legislation simple there would be another argument in favour of
accepting my amendments 1 and 2, as in leaving out
subsections (2) and (3) of  
<?notus-xml column=471?>clause  3 they would make the Bill clearer. We will have to
wait to hear the response to the debate before assessing whether these
amendments are of such significance that we would seek to divide the
House on them. Speaking for myself, I think it would be reasonable to
await the full explanation before rushing to judgment.</hs_Para>

3 is significant. It is the first of the amendments addressing part 2
of the Bill, and clause 4 in particular, which deals with the
attachment of street lamps and signs to buildings, and changing the
regulations relating thereto. At present, the regime is pretty
restricted under the highways legislation, but this Bill seeks to give
much wider powers to local authorities, enabling them to permit the
attachment of street lamps and signs to buildings even when that is not
approved or supported by the owners of those buildings. This power is
potentially quite significant, because the owner of a building could
suddenly find they are required to have a street lamp or sign attached
to their building.</hs_Para>

amendment has been selected and I thought that rather than just
referring to “the Secretary of State” it would more
appropriate if it specified the Secretary of State for Transport. If
the Minister wishes to intervene to suggest that it should be the
responsibility of a different member of the Government, so be it. The
point I am trying to make is that this is a significant issue. It is
recognised by the promoters as sufficiently serious in its potential
implications as to mean there should be a code of practice to deal with
the exercise of the powers. The code should go further, in the sense
that it should be approved by the Secretary of State for Transport. It
would be unreasonable to expect this code to have to be approved by
this House, through a statutory 
<?notus-xml column=472?>instrument, but it is reasonable to say that there should be a safeguard
and that the Government can ensure that the code of practice accords
with what is reasonable and proportionate. The Secretary of State for
Transport could then be held accountable by this House for approving a
code of practice if it did not meet the reasonable conditions we think

exercise or something of substance would depend very much on the
Minister. Although we would say that the code would be approved by the
Secretary of State for Transport, in practice it would be brought
before a more junior Minister, who would carry out the approval in the
name of the Secretary of State. It is not for me to comment on the
assiduous way in which various junior Ministers operate, but I have no
doubt that the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend
the Member for Wimbledon (Stephen Hammond), would be extremely
assiduous if he was the Minister charged with this responsibility. The

Giving it to a person who is resident is fine, but what concerns me is
how we are to judge whether to give a formal notice to somebody who

loophole. Anybody could say, “I saw somebody there, they
appeared to be the resident, I served notice on them. I don’t
know who they were, I didn’t ask them any questions, but they
appeared to be the resident.” That is granting a power that is
far too wide—unnecessarily so—and could undermine the

service of notices and that the owner or resident of affected premises
should receive the proper notice. I look forward to

I concede that my hon. Friend may have got me on that. Essentially, the
question is whether we would describe minor damage as being covered by
the amendment, or whether we are talking about significant damage. I
drafted my amendment on the basis that we are talking about damage of
such significance that it should be made
good<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:28:59"></hs_TimeCode>. We know
that an unevenness on the road surface may soon deteriorate when heavy
vehicles go over it or when it is subject to water penetration. What
might start off as relatively minor damage may, if not addressed in
timely fashion, become a significant pothole and a hazard to road
users.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T19:25:45"></hs_TimeCode>

and insert “shall”, as amendment 7 proposes, but not make
amendment 8, obviously the highway authority would be required to make
good the damage and be forced to recover the expenses reasonably
incurred. I do not think that it would be sensible to oblige a highway
authority under the terms of a statute to recover the expenses, which
might prove difficult. It would be better to say that it
“may” recover the expenses, which is why amendment 8
seeks to insert “may” in front of the word
“recover” in the provision. That way, the highway
authority would have a responsibility to make good any damage caused to
the highway by adjacent works, but it would have discretion over
whether or not to seek to recover the resulting expenses. I hope that

regulations on lamps and signage. The Bill’s promoters across
London are very keen for ultimate flexibility as to when the

authorities to introduce them all on the same day across London, which
would be draconian. The purpose of this part of the Bill is to say that
there will be a need for lamps and signage to be restricted, but at
different times for different authorities. That does not alter the fact
that authorities have to advertise and give notice of their wish to
introduce these schemes, but they do not have to introduce them in the

that notices would be served on such people if the local authority had

to make every effort to establish the name and owner of a building, and
it would be sensible for it to do that. However, in London in
particular, there is often a freeholder, a leaseholder and maybe a
sub-leaseholder, and the ownership and responsibility may be confused.
The provision is about giving a notice setting out what is going to be
done to the outside of a building. That is not particularly draconian,
but it is clearly required. A local authority frequently goes through a
set of procedures to make such things happen. It would be draconian to
frustrate its ability to provide signage or lamps that are wholly

something that they should be doing. Certainly, they should not expect
the council tax payer or general taxpayer to fund the repair of damage

amendment 20, London has many gates placed across roads to prevent the
flow of traffic through residential communities. The roads are normally
accessible by the emergency services—the fire brigade, ambulance
service and police—and other appropriate authorities, but
sometimes there is a severe problem. At the moment, if someone damages
a gate, they can be held liable for criminal damage, but if they merely
open the gate for their own convenience—to access the road or
bypass a congested road—it defeats the purpose of that gate,
which is to prevent large parts of London from being used as rat runs.
The promoters therefore seek an enforcement option. If, on being
directed by the emergency services, someone opened a gate, clearly they
would not be guilty of an offence, but if they opened a gate for their
own convenience—or for other people’s convenience, 
<?notus-xml column=483?>for joyriding or whatever—they would be guilty of an offence, and
it would be up to the local authorities to enforce those
actions.</hs_Para>

a red traffic light, an emergency vehicle wishes to get through and
that person moves through the red light to allow it through, they still
can be, and in some cases have been, prosecuted for going through a red
light. I fear that, under the clause, if somebody for a good, common
sense, although perhaps not lawful reason, opened a gate to allow an
emergency vehicle to get to the scene of an accident, they could still
find themselves prosecuted, which surely cannot be anybody’s

in London over the years, I can say that they are almost all locked
with padlocks—except where someone has stolen the padlock, in
which chase the gate will often flip open and shut. Young
people—in general it is young people—have a habit of
occasionally using such gates as a form of entertainment. We need to
make it clear that such gates are there for a purpose. This issue is a

Amendments 1 and 2 deal with the starting dates. They are worth

Obviously, no one could possibly argue that that kind of sign should
not be put up and then taken down again so as to suit the
circumstances. However, I see no reason why that could not apply even
if amendments 1 and 2 were accepted and those two subsections were left

First of all, by limiting the provision to the Secretary of State for

were not a Secretary of State for Transport. Personally, I would prefer
the description “the Secretary of State”. I heard the

be dealt with by the Mayor of London, and there might well be some

hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East described the clause as
“a decluttering exercise”, and I agree that there are far
too many signs about, which is very confusing. I wholeheartedly support
any measures to do with decluttering. I would be even more impressed,
therefore, if clause 4 were headed “Removal of street lamps and
signs to buildings” rather than “Attachments of street
lamps and signs to buildings”, which suggests to me that the aim
is not to remove the street lights or signs, but to make provision for
them to be added to a building. As far as I can see, that is what the
clause is about—the circumstances in which a sign can be added
to a building; hence all the rules and regulations about serving a
notice before such action is taken. I am not entirely convinced. There
might well be some ideas about how to get rid of the superfluous signs
that clutter up our streetscapes around London. As I say, however, I
would be more impressed if there were some evidence of that on the face

legislation to remove a sign. I understand why legislation is needed to
put a sign up, but I am not aware that once a sign is up legislation is
required to remove it; someone could just go and take it down. I would
be interested to know from others whether I am right. Perhaps after a
certain period, a sign acquires some sort of importance. If it is
attached to a listed building, it might become part of the listing.
However, there is no evidence in the Bill that that is intended. There
is merit in saying that special provisions should apply to the effect

7 and 8 are best dealt with together. The issue in question is slightly
confusing because it all revolves around the words “may”

interpretation of this clause is everything, really. The whole essence
of the amendments of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:27:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch is simply to make things clear. As the
clause is currently drafted, the authority might make good the damage,
but they might not. My hon. Friend’s amendment makes it the case
that the highway “shall” be repaired. I appreciate the
point made by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:27:32"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East about that imposing an
obligation on authorities, but I would have thought that they would
want to see the highway properly maintained for a number of reasons,
first from the point of view of their residents and secondly from the
point of view of risk reduction. As we all know, it is a very costly
exercise for local authorities to not properly maintain the highway, so
I would have thought that they would in any event want to make good any
damage caused by a contractor, and I see no problem with replacing
“may” with “shall” or with moving the word
“may” to before the word “recover” so that
they may recover the
expenses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:28:30"></hs_TimeCode>. It may
well be that they will do that in every single case, so in 100% of
cases they will have the right to go and recover the expenses from the
contractor, but that does no more than the clause as currently drafted
does. It already says that they may make good the damage and recover
the expenses, so it implies that they may not. I cannot see why this
amendment cannot be accepted.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harrow East made on behalf of the promoters, which was
that they understandably want to recover the costs they have incurred,
but I cannot understand why they should try to recover them from
somebody who may have nothing to do with the damage caused. It makes
sense to recover the costs from whoever has caused the damage, on the
polluter pays principle—I entirely agree with that. However,
simply saying that they should have the right to recover them from the
owner of the land, without any explanation as to how the owner may be
identified—without saying whether it is the freeholder, the
leaseholder, the sub-lessee or the tenant—creates a
lawyer’s paradise, a description I shall use in relation to

my hon. Friend went on to say that this is a matter of interpretation.
He said that these gates are normally locked and are almost all locked
except where someone has stolen the padlock. In other words, one of
these gates could be open only if a criminal offence has taken place.
That offence would be either theft of the padlock or criminal damage,
if the gate has been prised open and left. By definition, from what was
said earlier, it could only be, in these circumstances, that a criminal

of my hon. Friend’s amendments are superficially attractive, as
they generally are. He made a good point with amendments 1 and 2, which
highlight provisions in the clause that are either bad or unnecessary.
However, there is some merit in having some flexibility for the London
boroughs in organising how they do business. There might be good
reasons for trialling measures or introducing them at different times,

Davies:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend and I certainly
will do that. To cut to the chase, his strongest amendment is amendment
5, on the issue of serving notices and whether someone is a resident
or, as the Bill states, “appears to be” the resident. For
me, the situation is completely nonsensical. On what basis does
somebody appear to be a resident? One of us might be delivering
leaflets in our constituency, as we do, and might have just left the
door of a place only for somebody from the local authority to come
along to serve the notice. Seeing that we are leaving the door, they
might serve us with the notice because they presume, quite wrongly,
that we are the resident. All sorts of ridiculous scenarios could
ensue. Sometimes, such provisions are just for the convenience of the
laziness of local officials, so that they can use the justification
that as far as they could see somebody appeared to be a resident and
they therefore did not have to take any reasonable steps to ensure that
that person was a resident. Surely the least any resident affected by
these provisions can expect is that the authority concerned makes a
proper effort to serve them with the relevant notice. If it was enough
for someone to appear to be a resident, the local authority could, for
its convenience, idly hand that person the notice, come what may. That
is a ludicrous situation that we in this House should not tolerate, so
I hope that my hon. Friend will consider pressing amendment 5 to a
Division; that would be doing us a great
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071093001355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0004.htm#13071093001355">My
hon. Friend’s other particularly strong amendment is amendment
20, on gated roads. This is a very important issue. As I mentioned in

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:39:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harrow East, there are often well-meaning,
well-intentioned provisions in legislation that have totally perverse
outcomes. As I said, if a person drives through a red light to allow an
emergency vehicle through, they are liable to prosecution for the
offence of going through a red light. People might think, “It
would be ludicrous if anyone who went through a red light just to allow
an emergency vehicle through was prosecuted. Surely that would never
happen,” but people have been prosecuted in those very
circumstances. It does actually happen.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Harrow East says that when someone opens the
gates for a good, common-sense reason, they will not be prosecuted. I
do not doubt that that is his genuine belief, but we cannot pass
legislation on the basis of what we think is likely to happen; we have
to look at what the legislation actually states. We cannot allow
perversity in the law. What if 
<?notus-xml column=491?>there is a terrible accident, and someone says, “For
goodness’ sake, open that gate! An emergency vehicle is coming
along in five minutes, and we need this person to be dealt with as soon
as possible,” so a person opens the gate, and then finds
themselves with a criminal record because they had done something they
were not allowed to do under this legislation? That would be ludicrous,
and we would be enshrining that kind of perversity in
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071093001357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0004.htm#13071093001357">On
the other hand, someone who is encouraged to open a gate because an

unintended consequence of the Bill. I hope that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:42:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:42:04"></hs_TimeCode>for Bury North
(Mr Nuttall) were very gung-ho about amendment 9, and I feared that
they might seek to put it to a vote. I advise a certain amount of
caution, because including a reference to the owner of the land in the
legislation is quite sensible. Clause 6 does not say that the highway
authority has to go after the owner; it just allows the authority the
flexibility to do so, if that is the right person to pursue.</hs_Para>

briefly show why that may be a good idea. If the provision mentioned
only the person carrying out the works and the person on whose behalf
the works were being carried out, the following scenario could arise.
Say a landowner’s permission is sought for work to be carried
out. Although they are happy for that work to be done, and may well
have encouraged it to be done, it may not have been carried out on
their behalf, and they may not be the people carrying it out. However,
they could quite easily be just as liable as the other people for the
damage done, because they gave their consent for the work, although it
was
inappropriate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071093001360" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0004.htm#13071093001360">Another
scenario may come into play.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T20:44:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch may unintentionally create a loophole with
his amendment, because a wealthy landowner who does not want to be
liable for any damage caused may get someone who has no means whatever
to request that work be carried out, and get another person who has no
means whatever to do the work. When the damage is done, the local
authority has no means of recovering its money because the people who
carried out and officially requested the work have nothing. The owner
of the land, who actually wanted the work done in the first place,
though that may not be evident at the time, gets away scot-free. I
therefore fear that my hon. Friend could be creating a loophole, which
would be unfortunate. Knowing him as I do, I am sure that would be an
unintended consequence of what he is trying to achieve. I urge caution
on him in pursuing amendment 9, even though I appreciate that

Friend the Member for Harrow East that what may be useful decluttering

country. The problem with localism for London is that London is a city
that relies on lots of people from out of London visiting it. We can
take localism too far in London and more thought should be given to
people from Shipley, Bury, Dorset and other parts of the country who
come and visit, and rely on some of those signs because they do not

which deals with “Builders’ Skips”. It is
important that we have a proper control regime for builders’
skips. It is also important that we are absolutely clear in our own
minds about what the impact of the proposed changes to the Bill would
be. For example, amendment 10 would add to section 8(1) so that the
relevant highway authority could require the relevant person to provide
them with the name and address of the owner of the builder’s
skip</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13071093001444" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0004.htm#13071093001444">“where

that is done and there is no breach of the provision, it will not be
necessary for the highway authority to exercise the power set out in
clause 8 because the information that it is seeking to ascertain will
already be in its knowledge and the knowledge of anybody else who looks

shortly, but I am going to anticipate it in my next comments. Prior to
his looking at this because it was drawn to his attention by my
amendment, nobody had thought through how reasonable a period of three
working days would be in these circumstances. As a result of my tabling
amendment 11 to insert 14 working days instead, he and the promoters of
the Bill have seen the unreasonableness of the original proposition and
the reasonableness of the amendment. He indicated in a letter that I

think my hon. Friend has got the wording incorrect, because the
requirement set out in the Bill is under section 139 of the Highways
Act 1980. The problem, as Members will see if they come to various
parts of London and see skips on the roads, is that there may be a name
on the side of a skip, but it might not be accurate, because skips are
swapped around various companies at various times. The amendment would
place a severe burden on skip suppliers to ensure that the details were
accurate. On that basis, I do not think it would be sensible to accept
it, particularly given the rest of the Bill’s

12 is about the maximum fine for not complying with a request. For
clarification, I point out that a level 3 fine is currently
£1,000 and a level 1 fine £200. The Government are
currently consulting on increasing those levels fourfold, and the
Ministry of Justice has raised no objections to the proposal that level
3 be the appropriate fine for the offence set out in clause 8(5)(a). In
fact, a level 3 fine is lower than the fine in some equivalent cases.
For example, under section 16 of the Local Government (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1976, the maximum fine for the equivalent offence is
level 5, which is £5,000. The promoters have sought the right
level for an offence of this type. If skips are placed on the road in
contravention of highways law, appropriate fines are needed for the
local authority to remedy the situation. If the owner did not provide
relevant details, the local authority would find it difficult to remove
the skip, immobilise it or take appropriate penalty action against the
supplier. People need to understand that if they deliberately flout the

the fine to £1,000. A draconian fine is required to prevent
people from knowingly misleading the local authority, so that they

14 lowers the threshold at which a penalty charge notice could be

therefore, would water down the requirements considerably. The general

Blackman:</Member></B> The point is that these are criminal offences at
the moment. The proposals would put the power relating to the public
highway in the hands of local authorities, so that they would take
action to prevent people from allowing dangerous
structures—skips, in this particular case. There was something
similar many years ago with parking control, for example. Parking
control used to be enforced by the police. It was then decriminalised
and put in the hands of local authorities to enforce. A similar
position is proposed in the Bill. Instead of the police having to take
action, local authority personnel would take action. That does not make
it any less of a requirement. It shifts the requirement from the
police, who I think we would all say have a big job to do anyway and
should not have to do such work; it should be the job of local
authorities. That is the purpose of the Bill, and that is why I
describe it as a decriminalisation measure. The police enforce the
criminal law; local authorities have a duty to enforce the Highways Act
1980 and other appropriate
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0004.htm#1307114000024"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Nuttall" PimsId="5664" UID="1307114000485" xid="1228" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0004.htm#1307114000485">Mr

initially. If that is paid, that is the end of the matter. If it is not
paid, it is then presumably for the local authority—I would take
advice on this—to take the matter to the county court or the
magistrates court to push a position where liability orders would be
obtained, and the enforcement action would follow in a similar vein to
that of a parking offence on the public highway. Hopefully none of that
would ever arise, because people would realise that if they failed to
observe the rules they would face high penalties. We all want the
streets to be safe. This is a set of proposals for when people

and lighting was removed, a criminal offence would have been committed.
The police would step in and take appropriate action against either the
owner of the skip or the owner of the property at which the skip was
based. Clearly, we want skips that are placed on the public highway to
be lit properly and placed in a sensible and not a dangerous position.
I will come on to that point later. We can water down the criminal law
and remove the ability of people simply to claim, “It’s
nothing to do with me, guv. What can I do if someone removes the
lighting?” That does not change the fact, however, that someone
has driven their car into a badly lit skip, causing immense damage. At
that point, it will be a matter of ensuring that the wrong is put
right, and that, if it is not, a fine is issued. It is as simple as

15 would require names, addresses and telephone numbers to be marked on

would face much more draconian measures in London than outside it.
<I>[Laughter.] </I>My hon. Friends smile and laugh, but when someone
acquires a skip in London, they do not necessarily acquire it from a
site in London; they might acquire it from a skip owner
outside London, who would then have to take it to London. If the

the address and phone number in a way that did not apply in the rest of

Bill deals with appropriate action to make London streets safer when
people put skips on the public highway, by ensuring appropriate fines
and enforcement action when people break or flout the rules. We will
accept amendment 11, but I invite

the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) correctly—I am sure he

that because skips change ownership quite often, having just a name,
telephone number, address or whatever it might be on the skip would not
necessarily be a good enough indicator of the actual owner, because the
skip might have changed hands a couple of times since those markings
were

to delay the House for long by discussing amendments 12 and 13. I do
not have a strong opinion on the level of the fine, but I want to make
a wider point on legislation generally. If we look at different pieces
of legislation “in silo”, we might find individual fines
appropriate or inappropriate, but we could end up in the ridiculous
situation whereby some serious offences attract small penalties and
some minor ones attract severe ones. Instead, we ought to look at the
criminal justice system as a whole, to determine the appropriate level
for different severities of crime. I wonder whether this particular
offence could attract a much more severe penalty than other, more
serious, crimes.</hs_Para>

fast asleep and vandalise the lighting. The local authority could then
impose a fine, even though the skip had been perfectly well lit. I do

<?notus-xml column=502?>and common sense, but we cannot pass legislation that is reliant on
people doing that. If we do so, we will end up with perversities in the

to take “reasonable steps” to do things. That should be
sufficient. We cannot ask them to do things that are, in essence,

clause 9(8), which introduces yet another condition to make

the Member for Harrow East that the person should not be prosecuted. I
hope he would accept that; I am sure he does, because he is a

the argument that we have been making in respect of virtually every

longer. I am not entirely sure that

honest, I have never seen one of these devices, and I can only imagine
what they must look like. I understand that they both immobilise and
light up the skip at the same time, which seems an eminently sensible
idea for dealing with a problem skip. I have always thought that even
empty skips are particularly difficult to move, so I would not think

turn to the slightly more contentious amendments. I looked at amendment
10 and thought it was merely a clarification. There would be no point
in criminalising someone or causing them to commit an offence if the

in accordance with clause 9. Apparently, the promoters think otherwise.

10.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000063">We
now move neatly into the debate about decriminalisation. We are not
really decriminalising these things, just moving the responsibility for
taking action from one authority, the police, to another authority, the
local authority. The net result is the same. Anyone reading language
such as “commits an offence” would think, “Crikey!
They mean a criminal offence.” Apparently, however, the measure
represents decriminalisation. I humbly suggest that if clause 8 had
read, “A person on whom a requirement is imposed under this
section shall be liable to a civil penalty,” that would have
been more appropriate if the intention was to
decriminalise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000064">I

criminalisation is important when considering the question of proof. If
the offences are to remain criminal, the burden of proof is
“beyond all reasonable doubt”. However, if they are to be
dealt with according to a civil burden of proof, “the balance of
probabilities” applies—it could be 51:49. There is a
whole host of difference between liability in criminal and civil cases.
The matter needs to be nailed down. We need to be absolutely clear
about whether we are decriminalising this. Is it going to be a criminal
offence, or is it going to be a civil offence and is it going to be
dealt with under the civil law? That will affect the burden of proof
required of those who seek to enforce these
requirements.</hs_Para>

a telephone number or the address, because there is a danger that many
skip operators will opt to have an address that might be a PO box or
the registered office of a limited company which turns out to be a huge
office block in London with hundreds of other offices, and which is in
fact the office of an accountant or a lawyer, and not a place of work

the Member for Shipley that if amendment 14 were accepted, to give them

step of saying, “Look, once we’ve served you with this
notice, it is your responsibility to come up with some other person who
is more guilty than you are.” It seems a very strange way of
setting up a legal system, and it seems to me to be entirely alien to
all the principles of English law. I can well see that at some future
point there may be many a legal case fought over clause 9(8), as people
say, “How can it be fair that I have been picked on? I have got

Nuttall:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point, as that is one
reason why one is slightly sceptical about this sort of clause. Just
this day I received a letter from a constituent raising exactly that
point about the behaviour of traffic enforcement officers in Bury; it
detailed how they have been served with a penalty notice in
circumstances where it would have been easy to deal with the matter in
another way if more common sense had been
applied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:50:01"></hs_TimeCode>. That
would have avoided having to give a local resident a penalty
notice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T21:50:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Such
examples make me want to agree with my hon. Friend’s proposition
that people will be suspicious that this provision is there to make it
easy for the local authority officer to find somebody. It does not
matter who they find on this basis; they can give the notice to almost
anybody and they will be able to say, “We have done what we can.
It is now your problem. If you weren’t responsible, it is now
your responsibility to find somebody who was.” I humbly submit
that that is clearly not the right way for things to be. It should be
the responsibility of the responsible officer of the local authority to
find out who is responsible, rather than 
<?notus-xml column=506?>expecting a person on whom a notice has been served to identify that
other person for the purposes of determining who has committed the
offence.</hs_Para>

Bob Russell</B> (Colchester) (LD):</Member> We should rejoice at the
wonderful advances in medical science, particularly in the last
half-century, which have enhanced the quality of life of people with
serious health conditions, and we should give thanks to those whose
research made those advances possible. Some people’s lives have
been extended, or even saved. The invaluable research work goes on. I
pay tribute to those involved; they deserve our gratitude. In the case
of cystic fibrosis, I should mention the Cystic Fibrosis Trust,
pioneering researchers at places such as the Royal Brompton hospital,
and patients and their families, past and present, without whose
endurance the present survival rates would never have been
achieved.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="1307114000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000100">It is not that
long ago that for some conditions, such as cystic fibrosis, life
expectancy was so low that few lived beyond their teens. Today, living
into the 40s is the average, and that will improve still further; of
that I am sure. Although there have been advances in helping those with
serious health conditions, to the point that today people are better
placed than at any time in history, the reality is that the rules,
regulations and bureaucracy of prescription charge exemptions are stuck
in a time warp, taking us back to nearly half a century ago. It is
astonishing that while we have witnessed medical advances and
breakthroughs on a large scale, achieved by those driving forward the
boundaries of medical research, successive Governments, wedded to the
bureaucracy of the 1960s, have not moved forward an inch when it comes
to helping people with serious health conditions to pay for
prescriptions. People are forced to pay, in many instances to stay
alive, and in every instance to sustain a quality of life that is
seriously compromised if the right level of medication is not
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000101">I
am grateful to the Prescription Charges Coalition, which comprises 27
organisations, including the Cystic Fibrosis Trust, with which I have
had an association for 16 years, and Asthma UK, the British Heart
Foundation, Crohn’s and Colitis UK, the National Rheumatoid
Arthritis Society, Parkinson’s UK, Rethink Mental Illness, the
Royal Pharmaceutical Society, the Terence Higgins Trust and the
Multiple Sclerosis Society. They cover a wide range of serious
conditions, and they are united in calling on the Government to put
right an anomaly. I am confident that those who, 45 years ago, drew up
the list of exemptions would today, because of medical advances,
include on the list those conditions represented by the Prescription
Charges
Coalition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000102">Yesterday
morning, the associate parliamentary health group held a seminar in the
Jubilee Room entitled “Public health killers: tackling obesity,
smoking and alcohol abuse”. Why does the national health service
treat those who are guilty of abusing their body better, in financial
terms, than those to whom mother nature has given serious health
conditions? We should contrast what the Prescription Charges Coalition
is calling for—free prescriptions for those who need them to
live—with the £5 billion spent every year on health
problems associated with being overweight or obese, or the £2.7
billion per 
<?notus-xml column=510?>annum cost to the NHS because of alcohol misuse. Alcohol-related
admissions to hospital, according to Department of Health statistics,
are rising at a rate of around 11% a year. Smoking is the biggest
killer, accounting for nearly 80,000 preventable deaths in England in
2011. What I do not have a figure for, but it must cost the NHS
billions of pounds, is dealing with the consequences of people taking
illegal
drugs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000103">Given
that enormous cost to the public purse as a result of self-inflicted
lifestyle choices, I call on the Government to look fairly on those
with health conditions whose lifestyle choices are restricted. The cost
of what I am seeking is modest in comparison with the huge sums that I
have listed for self-inflicted body
abuse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000104">I
am pleased that this evening I can raise a serious issue, which I also
highlighted in the last parliamentary Session through early-day motion
1, signed by 41 hon. Members, namely the terrible unfairness faced by
those with cystic fibrosis who have to pay prescription charges. That
also applies to those with other conditions embraced by members of the
Prescription Charges Coalition, who I know will understand why, in the
limited time available, I will concentrate my remarks on CF; however,
my case for CF applies equally to the other
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000105">As
I am sure the Minister will be aware, the criteria that determine
eligibility for exemption from prescription charges for those with
certain medical conditions were laid down in 1968. The only slight
amendment was the welcome addition in 2009 of cancer.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:04:27"></hs_TimeCode> 1968, someone
with cystic fibrosis was unlikely to live until adulthood. I am pleased
to say that, 45 years on, life expectancy is 41-plus. However, the
condition continues to claim the lives of younger adults, teenagers and
even children. For the 10,000 people in the UK with cystic
fibrosis—contrast that relatively low figure with the 945,000
alcohol-related admissions to hospitals each year: 10,000 versus
945,000—their condition is such that they are especially prone
to infection and may eventually require a lung transplant.</hs_Para>

therefore support the call made last Friday by the hon. Member for
Sheffield South East (Mr Betts), who wants the law changed in respect
of organ donations so that there should be presumed consent. This
follows the welcome announcement last week by the Welsh Assembly of a
move towards presumed organ donation consent significantly to increase
the number of organs for transplant. We should do the same in
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:05:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000107">Those
with cystic fibrosis have a great deal to contend with throughout their
lives and, on reaching adulthood, they face the additional burden of
having to pay prescription charges to stay alive unless—this
would be laughable if it was not so serious—they have
insulin-dependent diabetes, which gives them an exemption from paying.
It is such a nonsense, you could not make it
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:06:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000108">Tonight’s
debate is about the striking inequality and the significant impact that
prescription charges are having on people in England who have a range
of long-term conditions, but not those living in Wales, Scotland and
Northern Ireland. In support of the Prescription Charges Coalition, I
call for a fairer system of exemptions. It is a matter of considerable
concern that many people with long-term conditions are not collecting
or taking their medicines effectively because of the cost, as is all
too clearly illustrated in the Prescription Charges Coalition’s
recent report, “Paying the
Price<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:06:40"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=511?><hs_Para UID="1307114000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000109">Many MPs will
be aware of reports of constituents struggling to afford their
prescriptions and the impossible choices they have had to make between
paying for food, clothing, housing and other bills or their
prescription medication. Austerity has added to the problems. People
with long-term conditions are not “all in this together”,
as the Chancellor would have us believe. For many, it means splitting
tablets in half, missing doses or substituting cheaper but less
effective alternatives to eke out medication until pay day. Inevitably,
individual health suffers and there are numerous knock-on effects. The
Prescription Charges Coalition’s survey found, very worryingly,
that more than one third of those who pay for each prescription had not
collected at least one item because of the cost. Indeed, the Royal
Pharmaceutical Society reports that pharmacists are often asked,
“Which of these prescriptions can I do
without<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:07:41"></hs_TimeCode>?”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000110">I
am advised that the majority of those who reported that they were not
taking their medicine as prescribed said that their health had got
worse as a result, with additional treatment then being required.
Emergency admission to hospital was the dramatic and costly consequence
in 10% of cases. For example, one respondent said: “I ended up
being hospitalised for two weeks because I missed five days of
medication.” Another stated: “I could not afford the
prescribed medication, went without, and ended up having panic attacks
and losing my
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:08:24"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000111">The
implications of this are extensive, not only for the
individual’s quality of life and long-term health outcomes, but
with regard to the impact on their families, on
their ability to remain in employment and independent of state support,
and also, of course, on the NHS. At a breakfast briefing this morning I
was surprised to be told that this is not a matter for consideration by
the Care Quality Commission. This suggests a lack of joined-up thinking
on the health needs of our country. The stress and anxiety caused by
worrying about how to afford prescription costs can exacerbate a
condition and the ability to manage it effectively. Individuals also
report cutting back on food or utility bills to afford medicines, which
could also clearly have an impact on their
health<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:09:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000112">Those

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:09:10"></hs_TimeCode> Department
of Health is aware of the survey by the Prescription Charges Coalition,
so I hope that the Minister will tonight confirm that she is personally
aware that more than half of those who reported not taking their
medicine as prescribed cited cost as the reason. Perhaps she can
explain why there is discrimination against those with long-term
conditions who live in England. Why cannot they get the same deal as
those living in Wales, Scotland and Northern
Ireland?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000113">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:09:51"></hs_TimeCode>

scrap the 28-day prescribing limit for those with stable, long-term
conditions on regular maintenance medication. Having to make monthly
trips to the doctor and pharmacist for repeat prescriptions is a
further and unnecessary inconvenience that means extra cost and
additional distress, particularly when errors occur with prescriptions.
Patients might need 
<?notus-xml column=512?>to take time off work, depending on surgery opening hours.
Scrapping the limit would also ease pressure on
doctors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000114">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:10:23"></hs_TimeCode>

Ireland Assembly to decide how they will spend their budget. The simple
truth is that making prescriptions free for all in those countries has
taken money away from other areas of their health budget. We have
decided to spend our allocation of money in a different way, and
rightly so, especially when we consider that the prepayment certificate

The responsibility for prescribing, including repeat prescriptions and
the duration of prescriptions, rests with GPs and other doctors who
have the expertise and who rightly take clinical responsibility for
that particular aspect of a patient’s care. Doctors can
prescribe flexibly and take decisions about prescribing patterns on the
basis of a patient’s need. Ultimately the decision must be left
to the doctor, but guidance has been issued by the National Prescribing
Centre about prescription terms, encouraging prescribers to be
receptive to the needs of patients and to use appropriate prescribing
patterns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T22:24:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1307114000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/debtext/130710-0005.htm#1307114000138">My
hon. Friend asked about the lack of relevant data on the costs and
consequences of the current prescription charging system. At the
moment, some £450 million is raised each year by charging people
for their prescriptions, which is equivalent to about 13,500 qualified
nurses or 3,500 hospital consultants per year. One can see the power of
that money from prescription charging, but given the lack of relevant
data, more research is needed 
<?notus-xml column=516?>to inform policy. It is important that we make best use of the available
evidence and identify gaps in knowledge. We would, of course, welcome
input from groups such as the Prescription Charges Coalition about any
evidence it is aware of or studies that may have been undertaken in
that area. That would help inform any research proposals that the
Department of Health might consider in its assessment of research
priorities. I hope that may be of interest and comfort to my hon.

Davidson:</Member></B> Indeed. I intend to come on to that, but I want
to make the initial point that now, as distinct from when I first
applied for the debate, the question of separation is largely
hypothetical. Therefore we need to discuss the future of postal
services in Scotland in the context of remaining in the United Kingdom.
Many of us who have been involved in previous elections have seen,
either from our own party or the one that is now in government, a
decapitation strategy, but I never expected to see the yes campaign
operating a self-decapitation strategy, ejecting members of its
leadership, as it is doing. It is now pretty clear that the yes
campaign is no more than a sham. Essentially it is an SNP campaign for
separation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T09:32:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000009">I
want to turn to the question of the future of Royal Mail within the
Union and under the present Government. I never thought that I would
see a Liberal Secretary of State proposing privatisation of the Post
Office, and a Liberal Minister supporting it in a Westminster Hall
debate. Who—among those of us who can remember how Liberals
previously campaigned for this post office to remain open, or in
defence of that aspect of Royal Mail, always blaming someone
else—would have thought that they would be the drivers of the
privatisation of Royal Mail? A Liberal Secretary of State will this
afternoon call for its privatisation. What a turn-up for the books.

must be clear about the Royal Mail’s position. It is clearly not
a company in crisis. It has been suggested that it faces imminent
danger, and that privatisation is the only answer. That is simply not
correct. Its profits more than doubled in the past year, to £403
million from £152 million in 2012. Revenues grew by 5%. The 
<?notus-xml column=72?>Government, correctly, have taken over the assets and liabilities of the
Royal Mail pension scheme, which saves the company £300 million
a year. Parcel volumes are growing. Royal Mail, admittedly, used to be
a letters company with a parcels business attached. Now it is the
converse: essentially a parcels company with a letters business
attached. Therefore, adjustments are obviously required. However, it is
adjusting. Its business is expanding and it is doing exceptionally
well.</hs_Para>

then, is there a drive by the Government for privatisation, fronted by
the Liberals? Is it because, as has been argued, Royal Mail can have
access to money only if it is in the private sector? That is clearly
not correct. Network Rail, for example, which is essentially in the
public sector, has access to private sector money and borrowing. When
Moses came down from the mountain with the ten commandments, he did not
also have the Treasury rules on a block of stone. Those rules were
drawn up by the Treasury and can be changed by the Government. The
Government—and particularly the Liberals, which I find
particularly appalling—choose to argue that Royal Mail needs
private capital and that the only way it can be brought into the
business is through
privatisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T09:35:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000012">The
Labour party is opposed to privatising Royal Mail. We want to clarify
why the Government are in such a rush and are pressing forward with the
proposal now. Is it simply because of the deficit in the Government
finances, and because they want a large influx of money to pay for
bankers’ bonuses? Should Royal Mail be privatised to pay for
bankers’ bonuses? That is one of the questions to which we need
an answer from the Government. There are credible alternatives to
privatisation. There is no crisis to solve, and therefore it is
inexplicable—other than that it is
ideologically-driven—that the Government should be putting the
proposal

obvious anxiety is that the universal service will come under pressure
with privatisation. The point of introducing private sector finance
will be to allow those in the private sector who buy shares to make a

universal service obligation.</hs_Para>

us be clear that a privately owned Royal Mail will undoubtedly apply
downward pressure on the universal service obligation. We have seen
that happen in Holland, for example, where the privately owned
universal service is now likely to be reduced from six days a week to
five days a week, with services being dropped on Mondays. We must
recognise the alternative that lies in the private sector by looking at
what private sector operators undertake at the moment. TNT, for
example, operates on a principle of zero-hours contracts, whereby
people who deliver for 
<?notus-xml column=75?>TNT are employed for zero hours. TNT constantly invites more people to
the workplace than it needs on any given day so that it can guarantee
itself enough numbers. That means, of course, as we used to see in the
docks when they had the casual labour scheme, people are being turned
away, potentially day after day, by privatisers who are treating

alternative future of separation calls into question the future of

has also indicated that there would be one price throughout Scotland,
but it has not specified whether that one price would be the same price
that applies in the rest of the United Kingdom, and I think it would be
helpful if the SNP did specify that at some point. As we approach the
referendum, there is an obligation for the SNP to clarify how it
intends to fill the gap in financing Royal Mail in Scotland after
separation, because that gap is presently filled by cross-subsidy from
the rest of the United Kingdom. Operating a national service clearly

particularly throughout the highlands and islands and the most
scattered rural communities in Scotland, in a way that the private
sector does not. It is noticeable that when the Select Committee on
Scottish Affairs investigated the provision of postal services to rural
communities, which was quite some time ago—when the SNP was
still on the Committee, before it took the huff and walked
off—it was clear that the private sector was not delivering to
those rural communities; it was refusing to deliver to a variety of
postcodes where the costs were much higher than elsewhere. Royal Mail
was the only one that would deliver to those communities at the
standard and universal price, and it is the cross-subsidy system that
makes that
viable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000038">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T09:49:47"></hs_TimeCode>

independence from the United Kingdom, ranging from EU membership, NATO,
currency, passports and many other universal British institutions. The
list is extensive. We ask such questions to scrutinise the plans of
those who would break up the UK and challenge their scaremongering.

people throughout Scotland. It is a crucial service, ensuring that UK
businesses and the economy run smoothly. For example, Royal Mail

every working day. There is no disguising the scale, the efficiency

do so, and that is one of the options that we will be looking at. We
believe that it must be in the interests of the Scottish people and all
areas of Scotland, and that that can be achieved only by public
service. We have experience in Scotland of courier deliveries and what
happens when the service is private. That is my view and that is what I

transfers are well understood, and Royal Mail receives 266 million
letter post items and 1.7 million parcels from international origins.
The system works perfectly well. In 2004, member nations of the IPU
adopted a system aimed at covering their actual mail processing costs.
There is absolutely no way in which a mail operator in the remaining
parts of the UK could impose excessive charges on a mail operator in
Scotland for mail delivered to or from Scotland or in transit to
another destination, because the costs would be identical to those
within its territory. Before anyone gets excited, all recently
independent states had access to the IPU almost immediately on gaining
independence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000097">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:17:07"></hs_TimeCode>

fact, Royal Mail employment in Scotland is below the UK average and
there is scope for making a better service and creating more
employment. There are also prospects for helping the Post Office, which
is not being privatised but is important to rural areas. We will build
a delivery service for social security and many of the things that have
been taken away from post offices. We will be looking to help post
offices. Although it is a reserved matter, the Scottish Government have
a good track record of helping post offices with a diversification
programme, rates relief and business
bonuses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000098">My
time is running out, so I will end by saying that it is true that there
are real dangers for postal services in Scotland post-2014. That danger
does not come from Scottish independence; it comes from remaining in
the United Kingdom and seeing a postal service privatised by the
present Government. I predict that in the unlikely event that the
Labour party forms a Government at Westminster in 2015, it will do what
it always does and decide that it cannot reverse the privatisation.
Labour will just go along with what the Tories have done. There will be
a privatised postal service in the UK if the Government’s
proposals continue. In Scotland, there will be a postal service that
works for the people of Scotland and the communities of Scotland. We
will build that as part of
independence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_10_PT_1/9B769678FFF83854031F83330126BE3D9052694F" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="10 July 2013">Wednesday

the Member for Glasgow South West (Mr Davidson) on securing this

there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000100">I
know that today is a big day for Royal Mail, with the statement that we
will hear in the House later. However, to people right across the UK,
and particularly in Scotland, the post office network is a vital part
of day-to-day life, keeping in mind also that the Post Office depends
heavily on generating a significant percentage of its work through
Royal Mail. The Government, with a fanfare, introduced a subsidy to the
network and embarked on what they have claimed is a programme of no
closures, but the picture out there is somewhat different in many of
our communities. I will quickly go through some figures, and towards
the end, I will raise one or two issues with the Minister.</hs_Para>

have just over 1,400 post offices in Scotland, which has 12% of the
UK’s 11,800 post offices. Some 67.6% of post offices in Scotland
are rural, whereas in the UK, 54.6% are rural. Some 32.5% of urban post
offices are urban deprived, compared with just under 25% in the UK, and
28% of Scottish post offices are the only retail outlet in the area.
Work done by what used to be Consumer Focus—now Consumer
Futures—shows that 49% of the population in Scotland visit a
post office once a week, while 58% of residents in accessible rural
areas do so. Scottish post offices are visited once a week by some 60%
of residents in remote rural areas, 63% of people aged 65 and over, and
63% of disabled people.</hs_Para>

Government produced plans for safeguarding the post office network, as
I said. The social and economic changes, along with a withdrawal of
Government services and growing competition from alternative service
providers, have put serious financial pressures on the post office
network in recent years. Between 2001 and 2012—I appreciate that
the bulk of that time was under a Labour Government—26% of
Scottish post offices closed. The figure UK-wide was 34%. Concerns
about the future viability of the post office network led to Government
proposals for the modernisation of the network. Published in November
2010, those plans were designed to make the network more financially
secure and to prevent further closures.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:22:46"></hs_TimeCode>We need to keep
in mind that all those businesses are small businesses, and people

me deal with sub-postmasters’ income. The net Post Office pay is
used to pay for the running of the post office, including the
sub-postmaster’s own drawings, staff salaries, rent or mortgage,
and any other overheads. In Scotland, the average net Post Office pay
was just under £2,000 a month last year, which was down from
£2,377 in 2009. That is a drop of some 19%.</hs_Para>

post office has traditionally been the key local outlet where the
public can interact with government. I know that there has been a great
fanfare of more government work—that is, local government, as
well as central Government—but the income from providing 
<?notus-xml column=85?>government services across the UK fell from £576 million in 2005
to a mere £167 million in 2010. The Scottish figures reflect
that massive reduction.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:24:18"></hs_TimeCode>The Government
have, I would say—I am sure that the Minister will say
differently—failed to deliver on their pledge. The few new
services that have been introduced are one-off transactions available
only in a small number of post offices. No new major government
services have been awarded to post offices since May 2010.</hs_Para>

will provide some additional figures, for which I want to thank the
National Federation of SubPostmasters. Research has shown that the
overwhelming majority of Scottish sub-postmasters are making no income
at all from certain services: 92% earn nothing from ID-checking
services; 71% earn nothing from the passport check-and-send service;
59% earn nothing from Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency transactions;
and 92% earn nothing from payment services.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:25:16"></hs_TimeCode>Other services,
such as the benefit cheques, or “green giros”, and
national savings and investment products have recently been withdrawn

and every one of us in this Chamber was delighted when, in November
last year, the DVLA contract was awarded, or re-awarded to the Post
Office, but the picture out there is somewhat different.
Sub-postmasters are seriously worried that there is a precedent of
falling rates of pay for transactions directly linked to all of that,
and income is undoubtedly dropping even after having been re-awarded
that contract. What lies ahead, later this year, are benefits and
universal credit. The system that will be introduced contains no
mechanism to allow some of the poorest and most vulnerable in our
society to access their money—their benefits. We all realise
that we have a job of work to do, as elected representatives, to
protect some of the neediest and most vulnerable people in our
communities and in society in general. If that money is finding its way
into a Post Office account, will there be some way to ensure that
peoples’ rent, utility bills and council tax is actually paid?
Nothing is in place at the moment, and we are about to embark on that
system.</hs_Para>

will tie up my comments quickly, but I want to come back to the point
that I raised with the Minister yesterday, because I am deeply
concerned that we do not appear to have the full facts and figures on
what is happening out there with post offices. I will repeat what I
said—I know that she has promised to come back to me in writing,
but she has not done so yet, unless she has done some writing
overnight. Will she share with us the number of sub-post offices that
are temporarily closed or have had to move to an alternative, temporary
service delivery system? Communities are desperately seeking
answers.</hs_Para>

I want to say that we did have another fanfare in the past two or three
years, about the delivery of credit union services through post
offices. That has disappeared; no one seems to know where it is. If
there is about to be an announcement on the matter, it has been a long
time in the making. I recognise full well that, under the previous
Government, there were two closure programmes. I say to the Minister
that I supported those programmes, because they were about service
delivery across communities, with people having access. What we are
seeing at the moment are temporary closures, with the Post Office
desperately looking to find someone 
<?notus-xml column=86?>else to take on a post office that is sitting vacant. However, it needs
to be understood that the income of sub-postmasters and
sub-postmistresses has been so badly hit over the past two or three
years that there is little wonder that no one wants to take up that
offer of opening a business under the terms of a post office. We may
not have seen a programme of closures under the current regime, but I
worry that if we have another Conservative or Conservative coalition
Government in 2015—heaven forbid—we would undoubtedly see
a programme of closures like we have never seen
before.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_10_PT_1/D14D0B36486924E9EC0CA41B11459E9E4707B6BF" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="10 July 2013">Wednesday

He is probably right, but democracy is not always fair. It does not
always work out the way we want it to. That said, it is our duty to
ensure that the electorate are given all the information possible, and
certainly Opposition Members will hold to account  not only the
Government, but the Liberals. In the last two general elections, the
Liberals were second in my constituency, albeit more than 10,000 votes
behind me. That said, they were still second. I would wager that they
will not be second next time—we might have to give odds of 1:9

say to the Minister that the rules were for guidance. I think that that
will be appreciated. They were never supposed to be written on tablets
of stone. They were there to guide, not to tell people what to do.
Perhaps, when we are looking at the rules and things that have happened
in the past and looking to the future, we can look to guidance, rather
than strict rules, because one of the hardest things for any management
or even any union is to be given rules that they think have to be
abided by 100%, yet are used for guidance. In relation to some of the
guidance, I would be inclined to ask what can be done for rural areas,
the highlands and islands—generally, areas outside the city
centres. I am very lucky; I live in an inner-city constituency, but I
know that if Scotland were to become independent and the costs for
postal services in Scotland were all to be grouped together, the people
of Glasgow North West would pay an inordinate amount more than people
in rural areas for service, because it will be cheaper to send stuff in
my area and they will have to subsidise people outside my area. Will
that be the case? Should it be the case? If not, what guidelines will
the Government produce?</hs_Para>

will not go on, Mr Hood. I was going to mention other bits and
pieces, but my colleagues have said almost
everything. The only thing I want to say is that the Post Office means
a hell of a lot to me. I was a GPO member and a Post Office member many
years ago. I was on strike against privatisation for three weeks. I
helped with picketing and making signs for picketing. It was never
easy. Union members do not go on strike because they like strikes; they
go on strike because they feel that they are being hard done by and
they have a cause. If privatisation comes forward and all the people
who want to invest in the Post Office look at what happened in the
past, they will see that this is a different kind of privatisation,
which may or may not make them money. If we are making money now in the
Post Office, why would we get rid of it and put everything in jeopardy?
Union members will feel hard done by and may take industrial action. I
know that I will stand with them if they do, because they will be

the Member for Glasgow South West has already mentioned the one-price,
equal service and that service standards for private companies are not
as high, which has given Royal Mail an unlevel playing field to compete
on against private companies. Statistics from the Federation of Small
Businesses show that Scottish businesses rely on Royal Mail more than
businesses in the rest of the UK—56% to 42%. That highlights a
fact that we will talk about when we go on to other issues: Scotland
relies on the Post Office and Royal Mail far more than other parts of
the UK. There are proportionately more post offices in
Scotland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000130">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:45:05"></hs_TimeCode>

Scotland, of which 67.5% are rural, as opposed to just under 55% in the
rest of the UK. Scotland has 12% of UK post offices with 8.3% of the
population, so we have proportionately more in Scotland. Those
statistics alone tell us that the post office network, as opposed to
Royal Mail, in Scotland is significantly more expensive to operate,
because there are more post offices and more rural post offices. We

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:50:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Glasgow South West (Mr Davidson) for securing the debate, and for
his wide-ranging introductory speech. We have covered a good amount of
ground today; indeed, I wondered at times whether we were in a rerun of
a debate from two weeks ago on the privatisation of Royal Mail. I know
that the hon. Gentleman was unfortunately not able to attend that
debate, but I hope he is able to be in the Chamber later today for the
Secretary of State’s statement on this 
<?notus-xml column=92?>issue. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:51:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Angus (Mr Weir) mentioned that there may well be further
opportunities for discussion in Backbench Business Committee debates,
if the Committee so agrees, so I am sure that we will return to the
issue time and again over the next few months, and
beyond<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:51:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000140">In
2014 we face an historic choice in Scotland—arguably the most
important vote that Scots will have cast in decades. I hope that there
will be a high turnout in the independence referendum, and I very much
believe that the Scottish people will decide to reject the notion of
independence because we are better off as part of the United Kingdom.
It is important that over the next  14 months or so we continue
to have a full and healthy debate about all aspects of what such a
change would mean for everyday life in Scotland. The Government are, of
course, making the case that Scotland should remain in the United
Kingdom, and as part of that we are carrying out a programme of
analysis across a number of Departments about Scotland’s place
in the UK and how it contributes to, and benefits from being part of,
the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000141">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:53:05"></hs_TimeCode>
am sure that right hon. and hon. Members are aware of the paper that
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills produced on 14 June,
which demonstrated that Scotland and the rest of the UK benefit from
the domestic market and the shared business framework that underpins
it. The paper had a section on postal services as part of a more
general consideration of infrastructure in Scotland. We take the view
that we are better and stronger together as part of the United Kingdom.
We are not making contingency plans for the Scottish people deciding to
leave the United Kingdom because we do not believe that that will be
the outcome, but it is absolutely for the Scottish Government to set
out what would happen in that scenario, given that it is they who are
advocating the change, and that is a challenge for the
SNP.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000142">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>

Christmas card post-independence. However, under her privatisation
proposals we do not know what the cost will be in 2016 for sending a
Christmas card in the UK whether or not there is independence for
Scotland, because there is no longer a price cap on anything other than
second-class
mail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000144"><Member ContinuationText="Jo Swinson" PimsId="4816" UID="13071061000228" xid="834" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000228"><B>Jo
</B><B>Swinson</B><B>:</B></Member> I welcome the hon.
Gentleman’s intervention because it gives me the opportunity to
confirm and clarify the situation. I appreciate that there are strong
views on different sides about the privatisation of Royal Mail, but
many wild stories have been going about. It is absolutely clear that
the universal service obligation remains. The obligation is enshrined
in the Postal Services Act 2011, which was passed by this Parliament.
The Act sets out that there has to be a six-days-a-week service to
every location at an affordable and uniform price. That provision is
monitored by the regulator Ofcom, and will 
<?notus-xml column=93?>remain in place after privatisation. The exact same set of protections
that is in place at the moment will, therefore,
remain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000145">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:54:52"></hs_TimeCode>
is unclear, however, is what would happen in an independent Scotland.
We do not know whether Scotland would be a member of the EU and
therefore whether the EU postal services directive would apply. If we
assumed that it did, there would have to be at least a five-days-a-week
universal service—Ireland has such  a service. Only five
EU countries, including the UK, go beyond that and have a
six-days-a-week service. We do not know whether it would be a five-day
or a six-day service in an independent Scotland. The SNP says that it
will give guarantees—I noted that from the speech made by the
hon. Member for Angus—but it does not back up how it would do
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000146">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T11:00:01"></hs_TimeCode>
comes down to the basic economics point to which various hon. Members
have referred, and which applies to both the Post Office and Royal
Mail. What we have in Scotland is a different sort of demography and
geography to that of the rest of the UK, which is something that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:55:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Glasgow North West (John Robertson) mentioned. His area is very
urban, and the costs of the logistics of getting about to deliver
letters are, therefore, lower than they would be in a very rural
constituency. If one country has a higher proportion of rural areas and
addresses than another—Scotland compared with the UK for
example—the service becomes more expensive to operate, and that
cost must be accounted for. An hon. Gentleman chuntered from a
sedentary position, “Do you think that Scotland could not run a
postal service?” Of course it could, but we need to know what
the costs will be. To suggest that they would be the same as for
running the service across the UK, where there is cross-subsidisation
between more densely populated areas and rural areas to offset the
higher costs in the latter, is to misunderstand the basic
economics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000147"><Member ContinuationText="Anas Sarwar" PimsId="5637" UID="13071061000229" xid="1071" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000229"><B>Anas

post offices, a topic that was missing from this debate on postal
services in Scotland. As I have tried to make clear, the subject under
debate is a very separate issue to that of the Royal Mail. We have had
a fair amount of confusion. Royal Mail and the Post Office are now
separate entities. The latter is a separate company with its own board,
which will be helpful to its ultimate success. We do not want to get
confused, particularly when we are talking about
privatisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000154">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:58:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T11:00:01"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Glasgow South West said that he was astonished that
Liberal Democrats were proposing the privatisation of Royal Mail. I
accept that our 2010 manifesto was probably not high on his reading
list, but it is bizarre to be accused of something being a huge
surprise when it was clearly set out in our manifesto at the last
election. We want Royal Mail to be able to access private capital so
that it can provide a good service to customers because, ultimately,
that is what is important, and when Royal Mail has to compete with
schools and hospitals for capital it is not able to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:59:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071061000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071061000155">The
situation for the Post Office is incredibly different. We are aiming

plays an important role in Scotland.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T10:59:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Dumfries and Galloway outlined some statistics and, as I promised
yesterday, I will write to him on the issue he raised. The fact that
Scotland has 12% of all post office branches and 15% of all rural
branches shows that we have higher than our population share’s
worth of post office services. Under an independent Scotland the
service would, therefore, cost more, and the Scottish Government need

are the rights of victims and families, where they potentially conflict

have a superior claim over the victim’s other immediate blood

specifically to the case of the killing of Claire Oldfield-Hampson,
which I have mentioned in two previous parliamentary debates. First, I
need to place this matter in context. The context, most recently, is
the Home Secretary’s correct response to recent allegations
about the investigation into the Stephen Lawrence case. That response
is most welcome and I think that those who are concerned about the
treatment of victims and their families will gain a great deal of
succour and encouragement from it. After all, Stephen Lawrence was just
18 when he was murdered on 22 April 1993. We are talking about a case
that goes back more than 20 years. It is right that, when further
evidence has emerged and further allegations have been made, the Home
Secretary has raised the prospect of ensuring that those matters are
subject to further investigation and review. The killing of Claire
Oldfield-Hampson took place in September 1996, but if some matters are
still not resolved, I encourage my hon. Friend the Minister to look
carefully at that case and, if necessary, instigate further
reviews.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000011">Just

greater consideration and protection than a killer. That is what most
people would assume. They would assume not that killers lose all their

that consideration for victims would be superior to consideration for
the killer’s sensitivities, particularly if the killer has
already admitted that they perpetrated a crime. However, when a husband
kills his wife, he continues to enjoy next of kin rights, and vice
versa.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000014">Should<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>

would expect the victim’s family to have the greatest rights and

a bit of background, although I know the Minister has already been
given a great deal of material on this case. I have been raising issues
on behalf of my constituent from St Ives, Joanne Bryce, for
several years. Joanne’s sister, Claire Oldfield-Hampson, was
killed by her husband, David Hampson, on 25 September 1996
at their home in the town of March, Cambridgeshire. He buried her body
in the garden, and it was exhumed on 16 December
1998.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000016">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>
what I have previously described as an “horrific
injustice,” Hampson was convicted of the diminished charge of
manslaughter, a charge that was mentioned to the family only a few days
before the hearing. The plea was accepted because the Crown Prosecution
Service and the judge, on the basis of the evidence that the police
were able to gather and provide, ultimately accepted that Hampson had
suffered the psychological effects of his wife’s
nagging<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:42:19"></hs_TimeCode>. My
constituent, Joanne Bryce, points out that Claire’s character
was completely vilified. Nine out of 11 national newspapers ran with
the headline, “Nagging wife killed by husband.” It seemed
that nagging was the capital crime and the killing was just a minor
incident<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:42:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000017">All
that went unchallenged. Claire’s personal diaries must have
included evidence of the family relationship. There were 15 diaries,
but they were not used at all in the investigation. Much of the
material in Claire’s diaries was not made available at the time
or shown to the court. There was also video evidence of
Felicity’s relationship with her mother, and Joanne has told me
that 66 exhibits would have been placed in the public domain and

the then Justice Minister,

have been many questions and complaints about the competence of
Cambridgeshire constabulary, and it would be easy just to brush the
case aside and say, “Well, it’s a question of the
competence of one particular constabulary, and those issues need to be
looked at. They need to hold their hands up and acknowledge that they
have failed, and they need to apologise for their failings.” It
would be easy to draw a line there and to make that the end of the
matter. Following the debate and the complaints raised by my
constituent, Cambridgeshire constabulary asked Bedfordshire police to
undertake an investigation into the case, and Bedfordshire police found
that Cambridgeshire constabulary had seriously failed on a number of
counts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071085000001" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071085000001">Cambridgeshire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>

the blood relatives of the person who was killed.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:45:30"></hs_TimeCode> constabulary
failed to let the family know that they were entitled to a family

that people who are grieving, bereaved, angry, confused and sad about

was a failure to provide information about the criminal injuries

There was a failure to obtain evidence of Claire’s character,
and, ultimately, the Director of Public Prosecutions wrote a letter to

to be assassinated in court by the case in mitigation as a result of
the police investigation’s failure to achieve a balanced

was a failure to investigate fraud and theft by the killer, too,
because the police felt that, as they were going for the murder charge,
fraud and theft were less important, and therefore they were swept away
and ignored. The family were also denied access to their niece and
granddaughter. Claire Oldfield-Hampson’s mother, Mary Oldfield,
who was living in the area at the time that Claire’s body was
exhumed, was unable to go back to live in the area and came to live

police also gave out to the media the address and phone number of
Joanne Bryce without her permission. In reply to the Bryce
family’s complaints about abusive phone calls from the
killer’s sister, the family were told, “Well, she is a
victim, too.” The family received one phone call at 10.45 pm on
16 December 1998 informing them that Claire’s body had been
found and that she had been murdered, but no one offered any help. The
family saw Cambridgeshire constabulary for the first time three weeks

matters of complaint and concern arise from the case. Joanne Bryce was
told to get Claire’s bones moved from a hospital in Peterborough
or the family would get a big bill. Of course, the family needed to get
the killer’s permission before they could make contact with an
undertaker or make arrangements for a funeral. How would anyone feel if
they were told in those terms that they are responsible for resolving
the matter but that they do not have the power themselves to
ensure that the funeral takes
place?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000026">Cambridgeshire<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:49:28"></hs_TimeCode>
constabulary says that it investigated Claire’s bank accounts

Joanne Bryce was advised by the bank manager that she must get copies

families should not have to beg the killer’s family for family
effects. All that my constituents have to remember Claire by is her
wedding dress and an out-of-date passport. The war medals of her uncle,
who died before Claire met and married her husband, her
grandmother’s crockery, photographs and certificates were all
denied Claire’s blood family, who were not 
<?notus-xml column=99?>allowed to enter her home. Meanwhile, the killer’s family, or

away.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000028">If
possessions of the victim are found years later in the hands of the
police force, under the Senior Courts Act 1981, the family and victims
should be advised and allowed to claim them. That was mentioned to me
during the debate in 2011, the first time that my constituents were
aware of that right. Those possessions should not have been sent to the
perpetrator’s family, and the victim’s family should not
have been told that the only way to recover them was by raising their
own case in court through civil action, but that is effectively what
the Bryce family were told about diaries dating back to 1983, long
before the couple married.</hs_Para>

to many agencies about the issue, including Victim Support, which is
considering it. Victim Support told me that when the next of kin is the
perpetrator of the crime, it causes many issues, including, for
example, for children’s carers, who must seek permission from
the legal parent for even the simplest tasks, such as taking the
children on holiday. However, the issue relates to family law, which is
civil, not criminal. Unfortunately, neither the police nor other
criminal justice agencies have control over the matter; it must proceed
through family courts with the assistance of social services.</hs_Para>

that the issue of next of kin falls into the rather murky territory of
what next of kin means, because it is not specifically defined for all
purposes. The forfeiture rule, which was mentioned by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T14:29:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Reigate during our last debate, is an instance of the
wider principle that a person should not be allowed to profit from his
or her crime. I do not think anyone is saying that in cases of domestic
violence, profit is necessarily in the mind of the killer at the time,
but taking advantage of the situation and disallowing the
victim’s family access to the effects, estate and memory of
their blood relative who has been killed is a matter that needs to be
resolved. It is not a question of killing or murder in order to obtain
the benefit of the estate for
profit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000031">I
have also heard from Refuge, which I am sure the Minister is aware is
running a strong campaign at the moment to open a public inquiry into
domestic violence in relation to the domestic homicide victim Maria
Stubbings and many other cases. Refuge has a public petition that it is
urging people to sign, and it is also supported by 38

Government still need to address more issues than that of competence in
this case. In my judgment, almost everything that could go wrong in the
handling of an investigation and the relative rights of victims and
perpetrators did go wrong in this case; everything that could be
mishandled was mishandled. Cambridge constabulary make the calamitous
Keystone Cops look like a highly professional and effective law
enforcement
agency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000033">Also—this
is critical—I urge the Government to review the issue seriously
and undertake a great deal of purposeful, although not lengthy,
reflective work on considering how the interests of victims and their
immediate blood relatives, particularly in cases of the kinds of
killing and murder that I am referring to, can be balanced. They
clearly have not been in this case. It is not just about mistakes;
within the law, police do not have discretion to give victims and their
blood relatives the consideration 
<?notus-xml column=100?>that they deserve. Between the point of arrest and the point of
conviction, many serious mistakes are often made that can never be put
right. They certainly were made in this case.</hs_Para>

strongly urge the Minister and the Government, across both the Ministry
of Justice and the Home Office, to consider the issue seriously and
ensure, without denying alleged perpetrators the right to a fair trial,
that victims’ interests are properly protected in such cases. I
argue that we as a country should be taking a far more precautionary
approach to protecting the interest of victims and their estate, and of
blood relatives in killings and murders in cases such as the one that I
have referred to. We can learn lessons from this case going forward. I
fear that the same thing will happen again and again, that victims and
their families will not have the right to redress and that when they
do, it will be too late.</hs_Para>

know that she has spent the past 15 years seeking expensive legal
advice—on one occasion, she sought the advice of a private

in order to continue seeking justice. She has not asked for
compensation, but I must say on her behalf that I think she deserves

Claire Oldfield-Hampson occurred in 1996. As the hon. Gentleman said,
he instigated debates on the issue 12 years ago and in the past couple
of years, and he has sought this debate to raise it again. That shows
that he has the interests of his constituents at heart and wants to
resolve some of the injustices that have occurred, so that other

system self-evidently exists for witnesses and victims. Ultimately,
victims are what the justice system is trying to prevent, and we are
delivering justice to victims through the whole police, Crown
Prosecution Service and courts process. For justice to be effective, it
needs to have the confidence of those who use or are brought into the
system. I was particularly struck by the hon. Gentleman’s
comment that many of the people who enter the system do so for the
first time in their lives; they are not law-breakers, but have suffered
an injustice. Their experience of the justice system, how their case is
treated—how the police, the CPS and the 
<?notus-xml column=101?>courts deal with them—and the outcome of the process are
extremely important as to whether they feel that they have received

am not familiar with the case of Claire Oldfield-Hampson or the details
of the difficulties mentioned by the hon. Gentleman, but from what he

corrected by good governance on the part of all police forces and of
the Home Office. The policy we make in the House of Commons and in
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:01:20"></hs_TimeCode> could
at least provide some standards, to which we hope everyone would
aspire. When victims are treated with such indifference, justice and
their confidence in justice are damaged; as the hon. Gentleman rightly
said, it also leads to a long period without a feeling of closure,
given the concerns expressed. He has done justice by bringing such
matters forward, and we need to look at
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:01:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000041">The

police forces, and I look forward to the Minister’s response. We

victims in the case of serious incidents. Those standards should be

the Independent Police Complaints Commission, while examining serious
incidents, should be able to monitor and give guidance on such matters.
I hope that the new College of Policing, which the Minister and I are
discussing in detail in the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing
Bill, will give some opportunity for proper guidance to police forces
on serious crimes, be they manslaughter or murder, and on the types of

right to be kept informed by the police as an investigation proceeds,
and as the prosecution develops and then proceeds. He made a point
about a last-minute change of charge, and that would have been resolved
in part by the involvement of the victims in any discussion. The family
should have been consulted or at least informed about the CPS
involvement, rather than finding out about the charge at a late stage,
in a distressing way. 
<?notus-xml column=102?>Another example for our victims’ code might be the right to have
the body of a loved one released within  28 days, except in

He said many of his complaints were about the police, while others were

the Police Complaints Authority—the IPCC’s predecessor

to reopen the case. There are now instances where matters brought to
the PCA’s attention can be reconsidered by the IPCC. We now
allow for some cases that were previously investigated to be the
subject of further investigation. The circumstances have to be
exceptional, and the IPCC must be satisfied that the matters that have

referred specifically to complaints that had been referred to the PCA.
I can see why it was introduced: to prevent every case the PCA had
looked at from being investigated by the new body. However, there are,
as I say, very large caveats, and there needs to be exceptional public
interest. The matters that have been complained about must be unusually
grave, and there must be overwhelming public interest in their being

hon. Friend mentioned the fact that the Criminal Cases Review
Commission reviews cases for perpetrators of crime, but not for victims
or their families. The CCRC reviews the safety of convictions and
sentences on application by, or on behalf of, defendants. Generally, it
may do so only when all available avenues of appeal have been
exhausted, but, in carrying out its functions, it takes care to ensure
that it complies with the spirit of the code of practice for victims,
as well as with its obligations under it.</hs_Para>

number of points have been made about how appeal proceedings can, in
circumstances such as those we are discussing, appear to favour the
perpetrator rather than the families or the victims. Although victims
and their families cannot appeal, they can make a personal statement to
explain the impact of the crime on them. Any personal statement from a
victim or their family that was produced for Crown Court proceedings
should have been sent to the Court of Appeal with the other trial
papers when the appeal was started. However, a victim or a member of
their family can lodge or update a personal statement with the Criminal
Appeal Office at any time during appeal proceedings. Obviously, it is
better to do such things in good time before the hearing so that judges
have time to read the statement, but it is possible to send in the
statement at any time up to the day before the hearing. In addition, we
intend to include information about victims’ entitlements at the
appeal stage of the process in the revised victims’
code<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T15:16:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

George:</Member></B> That is extremely helpful; in fact, in the
original debate in January 2001, a request was made for victims to have
a statement and to have a role in the proceedings—even in the
kind of lower-order hearing that was used in this instance to advance
the case in mitigation. In Claire Oldfield-Hampson’s case, no
one answered the case in mitigation, which resulted in the castigation
of her and the appalling way in which her memory was recorded. Is
there, therefore, an opportunity to find a means by which the family
can, even at this stage, put on the historic record something to
counteract the slanderous comments that are now there as a result of

effects. I can perfectly well appreciate how those are so valuable in

murder forfeits his or her right to inherit from the victim. However,
as my hon. Friend mentioned, it should remain a fundamental principle
of law that a person is innocent until proven guilty, so there are no

probate before trial or to prevent relatives of a person convicted of

probate register to prevent probate from being granted. For example, a
relative of a murder victim could enter a caveat to prevent probate

Green:</Member></B> The key to the point is the victims’ code.
We are about to publish a new version of it, and have been consulting
on it for the past few months. It is very important that
victims’ rights should be better understood, not least by
victims themselves and their families. Members of the public, as well
as those who are habitually involved in criminal justice proceedings,
need to be more knowledgeable about the code. Victims of crime are
entitled to receive information, support and services under the
victims’ code. That includes, for example, information about the
criminal injuries compensation scheme and the appointment of a family
liaison officer. As I have said, awareness of the code is not high
enough—not only among victims but among criminal justice
practitioners. That is why, as well as revising the code to make it
more accessible, we shall use a range of methods, including short
leaflet guides, to communicate it more effectively. Awareness will be
raised through work with organisations such as Victim Support, whose
extensive networks operate locally in every part of the
country.

changes made since the late 1990s and early 2000s will serve generally
to raise awareness of means of redress, particularly among
victims and their families. The most obvious and dramatic have been
mentioned: each area will have a police and crime commissioner, whose
basic task is to hold the chief constable to account. When there are
serious complaints, such as there clearly were in the case that my hon.

where there would be someone whose local responsibility was, in the

we have also embarked on a wider reform of the criminal justice system.
Much of the reform is about improving efficiency, but some of it is
about making things more transparent. For everyone who becomes involved
with the criminal justice system—and I take the point that often
it will happen to a person once in their lifetime, perhaps because they
are a victim or a victim’s relative, and so they do not want the
involvement—things should happen in a clear, timely and
efficient way, and be clearly explained. People should not be left
waiting around for months or years waiting for a decision. That is
another significant

the principle of tackling the spare room subsidy, so that the social

housing providers think that they can simply pass the buck when it
comes to managing their housing stock fairly and appropriately and
making fair allocations. The spare room does not affect them, so why
should they care? Too often, they are content to do little or nothing
about fair housing allocation. The best incentive to get them to clean
up their acts would be for social housing providers to take some or all
of the burden for their incompetence in the management of housing
allocations over such a long time. I hope that the Minister will

include the state pension and pensioners in it. We need to limit
welfare spending, but it is not right to do it at the expenses of
pensioners who have worked hard for so many years and have
contributed to the system. It would not be right for any
Government to start beating pensioners up and taking their pensions

do not propose to speak for long because we want to leave plenty of
time for the Minister to respond to the important points that my hon.
Friend raised, but I want to share with hon. Members my recent
experience of the benefit cap. As part of my duties in my constituency,
I visited my local jobcentre to hear about the impact the benefit
changes were having and to understand what actions were being taken
there to help people to deal with the changes, and I was surprised to
hear some positive news. One of the most positive things was that the
jobcentre had appointed a social justice adviser, whose role is to work
inside the centre with the people 
<?notus-xml column=112?>affected, helping them to understand where they might be able to make
savings and what benefits they are entitled to.
Their role is also to work with those who have been affected by the
benefit

newly appointed social justice adviser talked to me with great pride
about a case he had recently dealt with. He had invited in a person who
was getting £700 a week in benefits for her and her family, and
they had sat down and reviewed all the benefits she was receiving and
all the money she was spending. What came out of all that was that she
was paying £1,200 a month in rent. When they looked a little
closer, they discovered that the property was substandard and was
massively over the market value for a property on that estate. With a
little bit of work and some involvement from the council, instead of
her paying approximately £300 a week in rent, she now pays
£85, which brings her below the benefit cap. She and her family
are now in better accommodation and on the right track.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:13:48"></hs_TimeCode> other
advantage is that because she now falls below the cap she can afford to
look for
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0001.htm#13071067000100">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:16:05"></hs_TimeCode>
one thing that the cap has done is to make us all look again at who is
in receipt of benefits, and rather than just abandoning them into the
benefits trap we are bringing them out, to the jobcentres, and helping
them to get their lives back on track. That woman’s life has
been turned around purely and simply because the benefit cap was
introduced. She is now looking for work because she can afford to, and

is absolutely right that we reform the welfare state and ensure that we
have a fair and affordable system that provides incentives for work.
Both my hon. Friends referred in their speeches to the benefit cap,
which is a good example of our ensuring that there is fairness in 
<?notus-xml column=113?>the benefit system. It is absurd to have people on benefits taking home
more than the average wage, and it is absolutely right that we tackle
that through the work we are doing. Earlier this year, we rolled out
the benefit cap in four areas across London, and this month we are
moving to a wider national roll-out. The example cited by my hon.
Friend the Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock is a powerful
testament to the transformational effect that the cap can have on
people’s
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0002.htm#13071067000105">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:13:48"></hs_TimeCode>

being carried out in his borough in the pilot stage. What struck me
during that visit was the amount of support that was going in to help
people, either to move accommodation or to find work as a way of
avoiding the impact of the benefit cap. The link between fairness and
incentivising work is embedded in the benefit cap, because if someone
gets 16 hours’ work a week the cap does not apply to them, so
there is a real incentive there for someone who has perhaps been out of
work for some time and has depended on benefits to move into

hon. Friend the Member for Dover made a powerful point about the
relationship between landlords and their tenants. There are many good
examples of housing associations and local councils that work
holistically with their tenants. They are concerned not only about
whether they get the rent on time, but about their tenants’
health and employment prospects, as well as a range of issues, such as
antisocial behaviour. The benefit cap and the roll-out of universal
credit will drive that further forward. The move away from direct
payment in universal credit requires landlords to take a much greater
supportive interest in their tenants—to get them into work so
that they can pay their rent. Our reforms are therefore

that the system too often stops people from working, as does the
uncertainty that comes from people not knowing whether they are better
off in or out of work and whether or not they earn more money. The

pleasure, Mr Rosindell, to see you in the Chair this afternoon. I am
pleased to have secured this important debate on the supply chain for
Britain’s submarines. It is particularly timely given the
expected publication, perhaps within the next few days, of the Trident
alternatives review—the taxpayer-funded vehicle that one half of
the coalition Government set in motion to prove that they were right
all along about their idea to scrap Trident in favour of some sort of
mini-deterrent. How the Government respond to the review will have a
direct bearing not only on thousands of jobs across the country but on
Britain’s standing as a cutting-edge manufacturing
nation.</hs_Para>

submarines that are built by the skilled workers in my constituency are
truly extraordinary. The Astute-class boat currently under construction

among the most technologically sophisticated vessels on the planet. It

serious mistake to think that submarine building happens only in
Barrow-in-Furness. In fact, this is an enterprise that brings together
at least 1,200 firms from every corner and nation of the United

who took the difficult but right decision to press ahead with Vanguard
renewal. We set in place that programme, and we were disappointed that,
following the coalition agreement, a delay was put on main gate and the
in-service date. That has stretched the programme to its limit, but the
Labour party remains committed to a minimum credible deterrent as long
as other countries have it. Once one makes that call and genuinely

will make a little more progress. Although it seems that the Trident
alternatives review is set to dismiss such options as a land-based,
air-based or surface ship delivery system, and indeed to give up
finally on the Liberal Democrats’ mini-deterrent fantasy of
adapting Astute-class submarines to carry nuclear-tipped cruise
missiles, recent media coverage has suggested that the review may set
out proposals to abandon the UK’s posture of continuous at-sea

if the extensive leaks to the national newspapers can be believed.
Colossal savings could be realised, says the unnamed brain-box who
briefed the <I>Financial Times</I> in May. We are also told that we
could build half the boats and save half the capital costs. As the
submarines are predicted to cost, on average, about £2.5 billion
each, that must mean a  £5 billion saving to the
Exchequer. Also, we are told that £1 billion a year could be
saved by downgrading Britain’s nuclear capability to a part-time

I am afraid that like so much that the Minister’s coalition
partners transmit on defence issues, all of that is complete bunkum.
For starters, does the Minister agree that it is nursery school logic
to believe that we can save half the capital by building half the 
<?notus-xml column=119?>boats? The outlay on the submarine fleet is not simply a matter of
purchasing these submarines; it is also about investing in the ability
to design and build them. Those costs are fixed, whether we order two,
four or more submarines—I am not necessarily suggesting that we
order more than four submarines.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>Therefore, can
the Minister confirm that he anticipates that the first of class would
cost-effectively double the average across the fleet, and that the
fourth boat would be the cheapest of the batch? Can he also confirm
that there would be significant savings from placing a four-boat order
from the outset, rather than ordering two with the option to order two
more? Also, can he confirm that if the Government were inclined to
press ahead with the main gate decision in this Parliament, as was
originally planned, there could be further substantial savings for the
British
taxpayer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:42:53"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071067000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/halltext/130710h0002.htm#13071067000139">Similarly,
with running costs the savings would not be anything like the amount
that the antis boast it would be. Will the Minister confirm that at
least 70% of those costs are fixed, covering the fuelling and basing
facilities, and that they will be the same whether Britain operates
patrols around the clock or takes the submarines on the occasional
fishing expedition once or twice a year? What is his estimate—if
he can share it with the House—of the annual savings that would
accrue from stepping down from a class D posture?</hs_Para>

given the high fixed costs, does the Minister agree that abandoning
class D would mean a disproportionate downgrading of the
deterrent’s capacity to deter the grotesque horror of a nuclear
war, by removing the guarantee that currently exists, namely that any
nation that launched a nuclear attack on the UK could be hit by a
counter-strike no matter what damage our country
sustained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:44:04"></hs_TimeCode>?
Furthermore, does he agree that it would be highly perverse if those
who pursue disarmament—admittedly for absolutely laudable
motives—were actually to increase the risk of nuclear conflict
in future decades through their unilateral gestures, rather than making
the world safer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-10T16:44:21"></hs_TimeCode>?
Also, if I can tempt him to speculate, does he think that it was that

Without more submarines to build, Barrow’s unique specialised

of that work force, and consign to history the nation’s capacity
to build submarines, with the loss of valuable skills and export
spin-offs that would occur as a result, or alternatively—this is
surely more likely—the Government of the day would bring forward
the next submarine programme. That programme would involve the
successors to the Astute class submarines, which of course have not
been built yet, sooner than those vessels are actually needed from a
military naval capability assessment, to keep the industrial drumbeat
going. Can the Minister confirm that because that would mean that the
bulk of capital spending on that next generation of boats would be
required as early as the Parliament after the next one, bringing that

plan set out a series of actions which, fully implemented, would
deliver a civil service that is smaller, flatter, and faster; more

civil service today is 15% smaller than in 2010, and productivity is
correspondingly higher. Some of the actions in the plan could not have
been expected to be complete in 12 months. On others, substantial

was set out to be delivered by this point has been fully executed. We
are determined that the pace of implementation will now

said in June 2012 that the plan was not the last  word in
reform. I set out today some further reform actions. We will introduce
five-year fixed-term tenure for permanent secretaries. We will enable
Ministers in charge of Departments to appoint personally an extended
ministerial office (EMO) including career civil servants, civil
servants recruited externally on fixed-term appointment (according to
Civil Service Commission guidance and subject to the civil service
code), and special advisers. IPPR concluded in their report which I
published last month that Ministers in Britain received much less
direct support than Ministers in countries with systems

tensions in Syria which the actions of the Assad regime are continuing
to exacerbate. The regime's actions undermine the stability and
security of Syria and thereby endanger all Syria's
citizens, including Christians and other religious minorities.
As for the Opposition the UK Special Representative to the Opposition,
Jon Wilks, is in regular contact with the Syrian National
Coalition to stress the need for them to respect fully and protect the
rights of all communities, including ethnic and religious minorities.
The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs has
personally reinforced these messages to the National Coalition
leadership, most recently in Amman on 20
May.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071089000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0001.htm#13071089000090">On
20 April the National Coalition published a compact with the
international community and the Syrian people in which it confirmed the

their assistance to the opposition. We will continue to raise these

Francois:</Member></B> The Ministry of Defence takes the issue of
sexual offences in the armed forces very seriously and this is
reflected in the policy dealing with those offences that are listed in
schedule 2 of the Armed Forces Act 2006. A commanding officer has a
legal duty to ensure that the service police are informed of any
offence or suspected offence listed under schedule 2. The service
police will undertake the investigation which, on its conclusion, will
be referred to the Director Service Prosecutions (DSP). If the DSP
decides to bring a prosecution this will result in a court
martial.</hs_Para>

year for the annual one per cent increase in equipment spending, which
includes both procurement and support spending, is financial year
2015-16, with the increase continuing each year thereafter. This is
because the baseline year needs to take account of the new efficiencies
identified in the spending round 2013, which have been factored in to
our plans before calculating the 1%
increase.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13071092000008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0001.htm#13071092000008">Government

largely voluntary approach to slowing the spread of Chalara in England,
by encouraging landowners to remove recently planted,
infected trees which could increase the rate of spread. The Forestry
Commission has published guidance to support the Chalara Management

removal, disposal and replanting, as well as management of infected

develops.</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13071092000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0001.htm#13071092000374">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/chalara#managing%20infected%20trees</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13071092000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0001.htm#13071092000218">Since
the end of April, landowners in some parts of England have been able to
apply for grants under the England Woodland Grant scheme (EWGS), to

this we are supporting a £2.4 million research programme to
identify potential treatments and genetic resistance. Work on the
resistance trials started in May. The Forestry Commission is running
large-scale field trials and is planting 250,000 young ash trees in
infected areas to screen for possible sources of resistance. We have
also commissioned research to investigate genetic resistance in a

potential for further spread is being assessed through an ongoing
modelling project and given favourable conditions for the development
of the disease, spread is likely. A five-year programme to reduce
levels of the disease to epidemiologically insignificant levels began
in 2009, prior to the finding in larch. Actions under the programme
include removal of plant species which are most effective in spreading
the organism; surveillance of horticultural and forestry production;
research; and raising public awareness about the organism and plant
health risks more widely. The five year programme covers England and
Wales, and officials are in regular contact about its implementation.

Prisk:</Member></B> Local authorities have a crucial role to play in
supporting housing and wider economic growth, but the local government
finance system historically failed to reward housing and other growth.
The coalition Government has put in place structural reforms to change
the incentives for local authorities. From April 2013, local
authorities in England are retaining half of the business rates that
are raised locally, and the New Homes Bonus also provides funding for
local authorities based on the homes that are built in their
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071097000568" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0002.htm#13071097000568">The
Government's response to the Heseltine review (Cm 8587, March 2013)
outlined our plans to empower local enterprise partnership to drive
forward locally-led growth and enterprise. It also recommended the
pooling of more financial resources to strengthen incentives for local
enterprise partnerships and their partners to generate growth. In the
spirit of joint working and greater collaboration, we believe that
there is scope for pooling of resources from central and local
government.</hs_Para>

in ‘Investing in Britain's future’ (Cm 8669, June 2013),
we intend that in 2015-16 £400 million from the New Homes Bonus
will be pooled within local enterprise partnership areas to support
strategic, locally-led housing and economic development
priorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071097000570" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0002.htm#13071097000570">Councils'
local plans will remain as the focus for where development should and
should not go. The pooling complements the duty to co-operate and the
abolition of regional strategies introduced through the Localism Act.
In particular, we hope it will encourage local authorities to work
together on new developments which might cross council boundaries, and
to help unlock the provision of cross-local authority infrastructure.
It also gives local authorities an indirect financial stake in new
housing build near but outside their council boundaries; whereas
before, there was no mitigation for developments which placed strains
or pressures on neighbouring
councils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071097000571" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0002.htm#13071097000571">We

Lewis:</Member></B> The general power of competence was designed to
allow local authorities—including certain parish
councils—to act innovatively without being found by the courts
to have acted outside the law. It gives councils confidence in their
legal capacity to act both for communities and in their own financial
interest to generate efficiencies and savings. The Government expects
councils to use the power as their primary tool without constantly
looking back to Whitehall for permission. While I regularly speak with
councils who are acting innovatively, local authorities are under no
obligation 
<?notus-xml column=285?>to notify the Government when they rely on the power nor does the

National Planning Policy Framework asks local councils to recognise
town centres as the hearts of their communities and pursue policies to
support their viability and vitality. It sets out clearly that local
councils should require new town centre uses to be located in existing
town centres out of preference. It also sets out that where there are
no suitable and viable sites in town centres for new main town centre
uses, permission should be refused where a proposal outside of a town
centre would have a likely significant adverse impact on existing town
centres. My the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government, my right hon. Friend the Member for Brentwood and Ongar (Mr
Pickles), already has wide discretion to call-in planning applications
of sufficient significance for his determination, which would include
consideration as to whether proposals conflict with our policy on town

1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on education formula spending
(EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance
Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local
authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The
DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition,
the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block
and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only
covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through
DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot

Gauke:</Member></B> The Treasury does not hold information on financial
flows relating to diaspora communities in the UK. The Treasury relies
on the Office for National Statistics (ONS)for data on UK transfers.
The ONS does not publish separate estimates for remittances as they are
not considered to be of sufficient quality. Instead, estimates for
remittances are combined with estimates for net transfers from UK
charities, defined in the UK Balance of Payments (the Pink Book) as
'other payments by
households'.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071097001135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0003.htm#13071097001135">The

remittances totalled US$23.16 billion from the UK in 2011. Remittances

Bangladesh US$740 million, to Sudan US$31 million and to Yemen is US$23

Poulter:</Member></B> The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory
Agency is actively involved in discussions on the design of randomised
clinical trials in the scope of personalised medicine. These
discussions involve regulators, academics and industry in Europe and
the United States of America, as well as the Stratified Medicine
Innovation Platform headed by the Technology Strategy Board.
Personalised medicine offers the prospect for smaller, targeted
clinical trials in which the likelihood of response is improved by
selection of patients based on their inherited characteristics. Several
such studies have already been conducted to support new medicinal
product development. These studies will continue to be randomised and
controlled in their design, albeit in a more stratified population and
are expected to play an important role in the realisation of
personalised
medicine.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13071097000070" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0003.htm#13071097000070">Cystic

Duncan:</Member></B> Remittances have played a key
role in both economic growth and stability, particularly in Somaliland
but also more widely in Somalia over the last 20 years. Remittances are
estimated to account for 50% of Somalia's gross national income and to
support up to 40% of the population, or 3.8 million people. Exact
figures cannot be determined due to the lack of supervision and
regulation of the sector in Somalia, however, Somali "Money Transfer
Organisations" (MTOs) are estimated to handle US$2 billion annually in
remittances from worldwide sources. It is further estimated
that $500 million of remittances are sent to Somaliland per
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071097002392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0004.htm#13071097002392">Remittances
are therefore crucial to a large number of individuals' livelihoods and
to the overall stability of the country. Studies have, however, also
found that remittances in Somalia can discourage job-seeking as
individuals have chosen to rely on remittances for their livelihoods,
rather than work in local jobs. Due to commercial banks' recent
decisions to close the majority of MTO accounts in the UK, DFID is
working closely with Her Majesty's Treasury and the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office to assess the situation and facilitate dialogue
between industry stakeholders to try to ensure transfers to Somalia and
elsewhere remain
possible.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13071097000129" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130710/text/130710w0004.htm#13071097000129">Sudan
