Blomfield:</Member></B> I thank Members on both sides of the House for
their encouragement and advice. The supporters of the Bill, with four
Labour colleagues, five Conservatives and two Liberal Democrats, almost
perfectly reflect the composition of the House. The Bill has the
support of many other Members, some of whom are here today and many
more who cannot be here. That sends two important messages. First,
regardless of how far the Bill progresses, Members’ desire to
see statutory regulation of payday lending will not go away. Secondly,
there is a growing consensus—not only across party, but beyond
this place—on what the key components of the regulation should
be.</hs_Para>

preparing the Bill, I have drawn on the advice of Citizens Advice, the
debt charity StepChange, the Centre for Responsible Credit, Which? and
local debt advisers in my constituency. I am grateful for all their
support. I have consulted Members from both sides of the House who are
involved in the all-party groups on debt and personal financial, on
financial education and on credit unions. I hope that the Minister will
agree to meet those of us who have been involved in that process as we
take it forward. The Bill reflects the common ground of all those
groups and offers a consensus on how we should deal in an holistic way
with the problems of payday lending. It recognises the important role
that the Financial Conduct Authority has to play from April 2014. It
deliberately does not seek to tie its hands with over-prescriptive
detail, but aims to provide a positive direction of travel to the FCA
on the key issues. I hope that that direction of travel is consistent
with Government thinking.</hs_Para>

payday lenders, because, sadly, there are few alternatives for many
people. However, many of the practices our constituents have

plan. Some credit unions—including Birmingham’s Citysave

me conclude by giving an example from Sheffield of a single parent, not
currently working but supporting three young children. She used various
payday loans from different companies to pay household bills and found
herself trapped in a spiral of debt. The Money Shop, for example, gave
her three roll-overs at £30 a time. It used a CPA to withdraw
money needed for essential household bills from her account and she
subsequently fell behind with her rent. When she approached the
companies, they were very unsympathetic. The Cheque Centre was at one
point calling her five to seven times a day. She feels, as many Members
of this House do, that payday loan companies prey on the most
vulnerable, offering credit to those who have no realistic prospect of

interest in high-cost credit started in 2003, when I did a research
project for the Bow Group that looked at various issues affecting
inner-city areas, one of which was debt. I ended up doing that research
only because nobody else would do the bit on debt, but I discovered
that it is a hugely complex, interesting and challenging area. Among
the recommendations we made—Members should bear it in mind that
this was back in 2003 and we published in 2004—were a complete
overhaul of information and disclosure on high-cost credit, including
replacing APR as the headline measure with a cash figure for how much
people would have to pay back. We advocated “new model”
credit unions, with a save-as-you-pay-back product, a slightly eased
cap on the APR they could charge and a social ISA, as a way of bringing
more capitalisation into the credit union sector from better-off
consumers. Some of those things have now been done, by the previous
Government and this Government. We have an opportunity to debate some
of the others today, thanks to this Bill, and I hope that others may
yet fight another day.</hs_Para>

through what Which? in its recent report calls the credit feast of 1997
to 2007, when borrowing increased from £77 billion to
£190 billion. I make that point not as a party political point
but to negate a different party political point that is sometimes
propagated—that the growth of payday lending, high-cost credit
and sub-prime is somehow the result of a Conservative-Liberal Democrat
Government. It is not; it is just that the different types of product
on the market tend to evolve and change over time.</hs_Para>

is a great deal in the Bill. I suppose it is unlikely that anybody here
would agree with every single part  of it, but I think that
every single part of it is worthy of consideration. I suspect that all
or the vast majority  of us would agree on some
aspects—for example, that loans should be made only to people
who can afford to pay them back, and that lending companies should not
pretend to solve problems that they cannot solve, especially when they

that—well, perhaps some would, but I certainly would not. There
is a big issue about individual responsibility, but this market is a
complex one, and it can be difficult for people to find their way
around the jungle of credit that is available. People who take these
loans are often in very vulnerable circumstances, and I am afraid that
the purchase decision—people can blame whoever they
like—often ends up being made not on the product that is

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:21:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Christchurch (Mr Chope) suggested that some people take
out loans irresponsibly. Research by the university of Bristol personal
finance research centre seems to suggest something
different—that there were logical reasons why people took out
these loans: convenience, having no or limited access to other sources
of credit, and the customer service and reputation of the firms
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000145"><B><Member ContinuationText="Damian Hinds" PimsId="5583" UID="13071272000797" xid="1059" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000797">Damian
Hinds:</Member></B> And there are multiple other reasons why people
take out credit products, many of which are just as rational. I shall
come on to some of them later in my remarks, but there is ample
evidence to show that many people taking out loans—and the same
applies when they access a debt management plan—choose something
that is inappropriate. Even where comparative, side-by-side, costings
are available—to those of us who studied economics and believe
in consumer sovereignty and rationality, this is difficult stuff to get
our heads round—consumers often take the more expensive
option<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Durkan:</Member></B> Is the hon. Gentleman’s answer to the point
from his hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) that the
very fact that these products are advertised in a mainstream way as
being so convenient is one of the things that gives them the air of
reputability, which encourages people to opt for them as a standard and
acceptable form of

Hinds:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman. That may well
be part of it. There is a range of operators in this market, stretching
from the big and well known 
<?notus-xml column=669?>with very large ad spends—we can call them “reputable
brands” if we like—through to quite iffy-looking
companies at the other end of the scale. As in most markets, there is a

these points—I am grateful to hon. Members of all parties for
making them—bring me to the third point on which I think we
should all be able to agree. Wherever people are on the political
scale—whether they are a Milton Friedmanite free market
economist or a socialist—they should agree that people should
not have to go to excessive lengths to know that they are not being
ripped off. There is, of course, a reasonable amount of due diligence
that has to be applied when people make a purchase, take a loan or
whatever, but they should not have to run around the block seven times
to know that what they are taking out is reasonable value.</hs_Para>

are the three things on which I hope we can broadly agree, and the
debate largely revolves around how we achieve them. It is not always
quite as straightforward as it appears. On occasion in this House and
elsewhere, relatively simple solutions have been proposed that purport
to deal with complex market issues in one big initiative. I suggest
that that is rarely an adequate answer, as it is rather more
complicated.</hs_Para>

are a number of rules of the road in the  credit markets, and
they have come into sharper focus for me as I have looked into this
subject over the last  few years. The first is that there are
always unintended consequences—except when there are no
consequences at all—of what regulatory authorities try to do.
The second is that markets cannot be beaten unless something better is
provided. The third is that where demand creates its own supply, supply
creates its own demand. Let me explain in a little more detail what I
mean in each of those cases.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071272000151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000151"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>On
the unintended consequences, it is a beguiling and attractive prospect
to say, “Let us just cap the amount of interest that lenders can
charge on their loan products so that people will pay less and
household budgets and benefits will go further.” The problem
with a blunt and general APR cap is that companies find new products
that slip outside the definition being regulated and new ways of making
money that do not count as part of APR. To the extent that this cap, or
something like it, is effective, its major impact is market exclusion,
which inevitably means the most vulnerable and the poorest customers
are those most likely to fall into the hands of illegal loan sharks and
the sorts of people whose idea of a late payment penalty is a cigarette
burn to the forearm.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13071272000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000152"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>When
I say that there are sometimes no consequences at all, it can again be
beguiling to think that we have done something clever, come up with an
initiative, empowered consumers and so forth, but it turns out that no
impact whatever was made. It is very easy for disclosures, warnings,
signposting and so on to just become part of the wallpaper of
life—like the bit at the bottom of the billboard chart that says
“Your home may be at risk if you do not keep up your payments on
a mortgage or other loan secured on it”. In the case of this
market, hon. Members may recall from the previous Competition
Commission inquiry that there was, for example, a lenders-compared
website, which was meant to help consumers who might be home credit
borrowers to compare the price of home credit providers against 
<?notus-xml column=670?>credit unions and so forth. The problem, of course, is that nobody uses
it. The regulatory authorities feel happy because they have provided
something, but what they have provided actually does no good at

Hinds:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises an important and telling
point. It is, as he says, a problem affecting students, but I am afraid
that it exists for many older folks as well. It highlights the fact
that a cash number might be a more appropriate headline figure on which
to explain the
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:27:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000155">My
second rule is that if the market is providing something that people
want and it seems to fulfil a need, it cannot be get rid of unless
something better is provided. Credit is a fact of modern life. During
the year, people have ups and downs in their expenditures
patterns—around Christmas, birthdays and back to school, as well
as when unexpected things happen such as a car or a relationship
breaking down. Credit is one of the means that everybody uses—or
almost everybody, whatever their income level—to help smooth out
those ups and downs. It can be entirely rational—the point
raised by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:28:32"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies)—even to take
out a payday loan at a 2,000% APR if in so doing someone avoids
unauthorised overdraft charges by the bank, which might cost even more.
When the market provides something that has a use, it will not be got
rid of until something better is provided.</hs_Para>

third point is that although, as I said, the market will provide and
supply will follow demand, it is also true that demand will follow
supply—on that at least, Galbraith was right. Payday lending in
the UK in recent years has not grown because it has suddenly become
more difficult to get from one pay day to the next. People have always
struggled to get from one to the next and to pay unauthorised overdraft
charges to tide them over for a short
period.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:30:00"></hs_TimeCode> The
difference is the availability of payday lending—partly, Members
may note, displaced from the United States, from where a number of
operators have come as the regulatory environment in the US has become
more difficult. That suggests that there is some efficacy in regulatory
restrictions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:29:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000157">All
of that tells us that individual simple and grand solutions will

Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) mentioned, we need financial
education. That is one of three parts that have to constitute an
integrated approach. The others are sensible regulation and disclosure

be fair to the Government, there is quite a strong story to tell on
each of those points about action that has been taken and is being
taken. Financial education is going to be in the national curriculum,
and there will be a strengthening of mathematics in schools. On
sensible regulation and disclosure, we have the new regime with 
<?notus-xml column=671?>the Financial Conduct Authority, which has the potential to be tougher

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:32:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

of course, is the massive and visible growth in payday lending. One
thing that has really made a difference to the public policy debate is
that now that high-cost credit is on the side of buses a lot more
people are paying attention to it than when it was only on daytime
telly or on the back of tabloid newspapers. There are also issues to do
with credit brokers and the Amigo model, which is a new model of credit
whereby people get their mates to underwrite their loan, and then it
turns out, lo and behold, to the surprise of that mate, that he or she
gets stiffed for having to pay the loan
later<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:33:26"></hs_TimeCode>. We must

it all, we should not forget old-school credit. I have mentioned all
the new flashy new things that are clearly visible on the radar of
public policy makers and commentators, but home credit is an enormous
sector that is largely invisible to most of us, because most of the
time it is a door to door activity on streets and estates, using an
agency network and without advertising. The leading operator of home
credit claims to have one in 20 UK households as regular weekly
customers. It is an enormous

turn to specific aspects of the Bill. I will comment on them in the
sequence of the customer journey, starting with advertising. This is
tricky for me to say, as I believe in free markets—I am a
Conservative MP and was a marketer before I came to the
House—but at some point we have to face up to the fact that not
only sharp practice, such as dodgy or unrealistic advertising, but the
volume of advertising in the credit market makes a difference. The
sheer ubiquity of messages about the ease of access to credit and the
problems it will solve has an impact.</hs_Para>

restrict the total number of ads for credit, I think there are some
things that everybody can agree are blatantly bad and should be
stopped. One example, to which I think the hon. Gentleman alluded, was
the £1,000 night out text that First Payday Loans sent to
people. It purported to be from a friend and said, “I’m
still out on the town and I just got £850 or £1,000, and
you can too.” That is clearly bad practice in

must also consider the representation of costs. APR is not a
particularly helpful measure in many ways—once it goes past the
first 1,000%, people start  to think, “What difference
does that make?” There is a 
<?notus-xml column=673?>natural argument for saying that there should be a cash cost comparison
instead. However, there is no perfect solution. The formula that Which?
proposes of pounds per 30 days seems to deal with the immediate issue,
which is the growth of payday loans. It does not necessarily help with
the comparability of all products, however, and with any cash
comparison—the amount-to-pay-back figure—there is still
the issue of how to deal with behavioural charges, which are an
additional way of making money out of the customer. Companies can in
theory charge a relatively low headline payback rate in the knowledge
that they will make more money from missed payments and various other
behavioural penalties. We may in the end decide that a cash comparison
is useful, but we will still need the representative APR figure, and we
will also need to have a proper analysis and debate about which
behavioural and other charges should be reflected within
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_12_PT_1/232458ABFF1A7D29EB969C05834B2723154285F4" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 July 2013">Friday

agencies and intermediaries, I support the Bill’s provisions on
credit brokers, underwriters and guarantors, and the Amigo model, but
there is something else we need to be aware of: as the online market
develops even further, there is a tendency in every sector—I saw
this in my old sector of hotels and travel—for intermediaries to
come in, particularly on paid search, and intermediate, and there is a
natural inflationary pressure in that process, which in the end only
ever gets passed on to the consumers. Whereas the internet is supposed
to make things cheaper for consumers, and comparisons easier and
markets freer, it actually tends to concentrate power with other people
and add other costs, a lot of which end up going to search engine
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:41:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000176">Affordability
and cost limits is another important issue. Two types of limit can be
applied. One is a limit on the cost of the loan—on how much
companies can charge to anybody. The other is a limit on affordability,
or how much credit can be extended to an individual given their
circumstances. Both of them are very complex, which is implicitly
acknowledged by the fact that the hon. Member for Sheffield Central
says in his Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:41:40"></hs_TimeCode>
that the FCA would have to decide exactly how these things
work.</hs_Para>

are big arguments against having a cost cap, because of all the
unintended consequences that I have mentioned, but if there is to be a
cost cap, it ought to reflect the actual cost structure of extending a
loan. In principle there are three elements of cost in extending a
loan. The first is the initiation cost, including customer acquisition
and credit checks. The second is the actual cost of capital. The third
is the risk element, which will vary by
customer-type<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:42:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000178">If
we recognise that and want to reflect it in a limit on the amount of
interest that can be charged, we should end up having two elements to
the cost cap. One of them is to cover the initiation of the loan, and
the second is to cover the cost of capital and risk factor. The figure
here would be something like a cap of 15% of the capital as a one-off,
plus 30% as an annual interest rate. Sub-prime and high-cost credit
providers that offer a range of loans seem to follow that sort of
formula.</hs_Para>

Hinds:</Member></B> As ever, my hon. Friend tees me up nicely for my
next point, which is about affordability. This is different from the
issue of an overall cost cap. People need a bank account to get a
payday loan, and payday lenders will typically require proof that they
have a pay day on which a regular amount of income comes in. The Bill
proposes a single real-time database. For myself, I think that is a
step too far. This would be a database of every loan that everybody in
the country has, and to be effective it would need to cover not only
payday loans, but credit card debt, mortgage debt, car debt and all
sorts of other debt. There are massive worries in that, relating to
privacy, civil liberties, the concentration of data and, of course,
what happens when, inevitably at some point, it goes wrong. I do think
we need to look at serious reform of the existing credit reference
agency system, however. It does not seem to work as it should when
people who are overstretched and who have had eight, nine or 10 lines
of credit extended to them go to debt advice

issue is making sure the loan actually gets paid down over time. There
is a big fashion for restricting roll-over. We need to be careful about
that, however, because it deals with the immediate issue we happen to
face in 2013. I remind Members that 10 years ago roll-over was
something we understood only in the context of the national lottery and
20 years ago we understood it only in the context of “10 in the
bed and the little one said”. In terms of loan products, it is a
new thing, therefore, and I would rather we instead had a general duty
to make sure the loan gets paid down over time. That should apply to
instalment credit and revolving credit as well as to payday loans. A
product that is advertised as a 30-day loan should, therefore, be paid
down fully by 60 or 90 days, but the payback should start before that
60 or 90 day point is

I want to talk very briefly about three issues that are not covered by
the Bill, but which are closely related to it. I mentioned our not
being able to beat something in the market until we come up with
something better. The first issue relates to mainstream banks and the
fact that part of the reason why payday loans are popular is because of
the behavioural charges people incur at mainstream banks and the bounce
charges. We need to work on that, and if possible remove the cause at
source. There is no such thing as free banking; there is only banking
which is paid for by different people in 
<?notus-xml column=675?>different ways at different times. There is cross-subsidy from people
with more complex, perhaps even chaotic, banking affairs to people
who have simpler banking affairs—or to put
it another way, banks make money out of people going overdrawn

that he makes political rather than helpful points on this subject. I
did not say that these people had the facility to save large amounts of
money. As a director of a credit union, he will know that the whole
credit union movement is based, initially, on helping people to save.
Many credit unions will have a “save as you pay back”
process, whereby even where someone borrows from them they will find
that at the 
<?notus-xml column=676?>conclusion of that loan they have a small savings pot, which will stand
them in better stead for the future. If we move more towards
budgeting-type banking—the so-called jam jar bank
accounts—there will be the facility for small amounts of money
to go, through payroll deduction, into a savings account. That has
exactly the same effect, but at a cheaper rate, in terms of smoothing
out the ups and downs of cost that people incur through the
year.</hs_Para>

expand—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:52:08"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) explained this in great
depth—we have allowed a wild west gold rush to happen in the
high-cost credit sector. It is no wonder that so many major US players
have been so keen to invest tens of millions of pounds to achieve a
significant market presence here. In 2010, five of the seven biggest
payday loan companies in this country were controlled by a US
company<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T10:52:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Interestingly, some of those companies also operate in Florida, which
now has one of the most tightly regulated high-cost credit sectors in
the world. It has no roll-overs whatsoever, but according to figures
that I have received this week from Veritec Solutions, which provides
the regulatory system operated in Florida, there has been a substantial
increase, year on year, in the high-cost credit sector in Florida. What
it does not have, however, is a substantial proportion of highly
distressed borrowers. That is why this Bill is important in putting
forward the message about controlling the number of distressed
borrowers.</hs_Para>

Frankly, this has been perceived as a peripheral problem affecting
“little people” who could not cope with their weekly
finances. But in the meantime, huge numbers of people have, since the
financial crash, seen their household finances severely squeezed. The

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Health (Anna
Soubry):</Member></B> The Government’s policy remains unchanged.
The Government have today published a summary report on the
consultation on the standardised packaging of tobacco products. The
consultation was undertaken last year between April and August with the
agreement of the devolved Administrations on a UK-wide basis. The
summary report is available in the Library.</hs_Para>

standardised packaging of tobacco refers to measures that may be taken
to restrict or end the  use of logos, colours, brand images or
promotional  information on packaging. Any brand or product
names would be displayed in a standard colour and typeface. The
consultation was intended to explore views on whether standardised
tobacco packaging would reduce the appeal of tobacco products to
consumers, increase the effectiveness of health warnings on the
packaging of tobacco products, reduce the ability of tobacco packaging
to mislead consumers about the harmful effects of smoking
and have a positive effect on smoking-related attitude,
beliefs, intentions and behaviours, particularly among children and
young people. To inform responses to the consultation and subsequent
policy making, the Department commissioned a systematic
review of evidence on standardised packaging. I am grateful to the
academics who undertook the review at the University of Stirling,
University of Nottingham and the Institute of Education. It is being
published alongside the consultation

than 668,000 responses to the consultation were received and the views
expressed were highly polarised. Strong views were put forward on both
sides of the debate and a range of organisations generated campaigns
and petitions. Of those who provided detailed feedback, some 53% were
in favour of standardised packaging while 43% thought the Government
should do nothing about tobacco packaging. Having carefully considered
those differing views, the Government have decided to wait until the
emerging impact of the decision in Australia can be measured before we
make a final
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T11:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000220">Only

Drink-driving deaths have come down by three quarters in the past 30
years. The reduction of smoking among men from 82% to about 20% mainly
happened before we started throwing the law at everything. People smoke
because they take it up as teenagers, and we say they are too young to

It is not as simple as they now try to make out. Most importantly, I

aim of the introduction of standardised packaging. If a good experiment

the evidence as it emerges. I thought that we might see some sort of
change quite quickly in Australia,

there is a huge amount of agreement on the issues we are trying to

legislation is necessary at this point or whether the

been taken up by the FCA since April, is a better way of tackling the

hon. Member for Sheffield Central said that his preference would not be
to ban payday loans. It is important to be clear that there is a place
for high-cost short-term lending and that emergency cash or managing a
short-term cash-flow problem can be useful. However, it is not right
for many consumers, many of whom get lured into taking out loans that
they cannot afford to repay and that they should not be given in the
first place. Too many people are not getting a fair deal, which is why
action is needed and why it is indeed being

is also worth mentioning that we have tried very hard to work with the
industry on these matters. Indeed, last November the industry produced
a payday and short-term loans code of practice. I would argue that if
everything in the code was being complied with, there would not be
anything like the number of problems that are being experienced, such
as three days’ notice from a continuous payment
authority—that is mentioned in the hon. Gentleman’s Bill,
but it is already in the code of practice—or affordability
assessments or better information on constraints and roll-overs. The
vast majority of the industry has already signed up to that and I think
that the real issue is delivering it, which is why we recognise that
further regulation is needed through the

need to assess the progress that is being made with codes of practice
so that the FCA has information on how the industry is complying with
what it has signed up to. If the industry itself has signed up to
something, I am sure the FCA will consider whether it is worth turning
it into a firm rule when it publishes its rules. The Department has
launched a survey to encourage customers who have used payday loans to
undertake a quick online survey of their experiences, so that we can
better assess the extent to which lenders are complying with their
codes. I tweeted a link to that survey earlier today, if anyone

example, the ability to impose unlimited fines and to order redress for
consumers who have been ripped off. It will also be setting a higher
bar for entry in the first place, so when it is granting a consumer
credit licence, the applicant will have to prove that its business
model is not based on ripping off consumers. We had the discussion
earlier about roll-overs and whether, if some companies are making
significant proportions of their profit from roll-overs, their business
model in fact

between them make up more than 90% of the market, and did a significant
investigation into the practices of each of those. Those 50 lenders
were sent a detailed dossier of where their practices were not up to
scratch, with a 12-week deadline to sort out the problems that they
were causing or face losing their licence. That has brought real

a third—have left the

giving up their consumer credit licence entirely or by continuing to
operate in other areas of consumer credit but no longer in payday

lenders outwith the 50 largest and one further licence has been handed
in. So since March, 14 payday lenders, including 10 of the biggest 50,
have left the payday lending market. That shows that the tough action

hon. Friend the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) spoke well
about how adverts pretend that such loans will solve problems that they
will not 
<?notus-xml column=695?>solve. The adverts suggest that a payday loan is the answer to problems
such as not having enough money towards the end of the month. If people
find themselves in that position, the answer is not to take out a
payday loan, but to get some good financial and debt
advice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000336">When
legislating on advertising, the evidence base for what should be
brought in and what will work needs to be strong. The FCA will have
powers to ban misleading financial promotions and to create rules on
advertising payday loans. At the press Q and A after the summit, the
chief executive of the FCA made it very clear that he would consider
all sorts of rules that could be made with regard to advertising,
including on the timing of adverts and the content that needs to be
included. The FCA is very clear that it is looking at that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0001.htm#13071272000337">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T11:52:01"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to proceed on the basis of research and evidence. BIS has
commissioned Ipsos MORI to conduct qualitative research into the impact
of advertising on consumer behaviour because we want to know what
changes would be most effective in helping consumers. It would be easy

little annotations that we hear and see in adverts all the time, such
as “terms and conditions apply” and “shares may go
down as well as up”. Do we actually respond to all those things
or would other things be more effective? The research will look at what
health warnings or wealth warnings might work on such adverts, whether
signposting debt advice might be more effective, and what is the
best way of simply explaining the cost to people. There is a
range of reasons why APR is not the most relevant figure in the context
of payday and short-term credit advertising, not least of which is that
many people do not understand what APR is. Is there an easier way
to get that information to the consumers? That research will
provide evidence to inform the FCA as it develops
its rule book. We will publish the findings in the

Table. She was right to highlight this issue. If somebody is lending
money over a very short period at a high interest rate that basically
covers the administration cost of setting up the loan arrangement, that
is not necessarily problematic. The problem arises when that short-term
loan is no longer short term, but becomes medium or long term because
it is rolled over from one month to the next. That is when the APR is
much more relevant, because people are taking out a much longer-term
form of credit. Roll-overs are therefore problematic. In some cases,

Swinson:</Member></B> It depends on the specific circumstances. Current
guidance does not necessarily suggest a ban on roll-overs, but there is
evidence that some practices mean that borrowers, including those who
are not necessarily unable to repay the loan, are proactively offered a
roll-over—for example, by text message. That gets them into more
debt and incurs more charges, even though they may have been able to
repay the loan. There is a suggestion—more than a suggestion:
evidence—that there are problems with roll-overs, but that does
not mean that every roll-over is wrong. We also want to encourage
lenders to recognise and show leniency when borrowers get into
difficultly. That is also important. There is sharp practice with
roll-overs, whereby the lender perhaps appears to be helpful in
offering extra time when that might not be the right thing for the
consumer. We are discussing a short-term product. If a proper
affordability assessment is performed, the number of occasions when a
borrower is unable to repay a short time after it was granted should be
relatively low, and such occasions really should be the result of
unexpected emergencies or circumstances that could not have been
predicted weeks earlier.</hs_Para>

is also concern regarding the use of continuous payment authority. This
tool allows lenders to dip into a borrower’s bank account to see
whether they have enough money in their account to make a repayment,
and to do that multiple times—sometimes hundreds—a day.
Many card issuers and others in the financial services market are
concerned about how that is being done. The Bill suggests three
days’ notice of CPA and an awareness of the right to cancel.
Those measures are already in the voluntary code. If they were stuck to
and ended up in the FCA rules, that would be helpful.</hs_Para>

is important to clarify that people have the right to cancel continuous
payment authority. Indeed, the FCA has recently made it clear to banks
that if their customers wish to cancel CPA they have a responsibility
to ensure to that that happens. Further, if customers have paid
erroneously through CPA after they have asked for it to stop, the banks
should refund the consumer. Banks will also have to undertake a review
of such cases in the past few years.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:01:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) eloquently set out. This
is a complex market and clumsy interventions could have unintended
consequences. The Bristol report findings indicate that a total cost of
credit cap could risk harm to consumers, reduce access to credit and
lead to less tolerance by lenders of customers with repayment
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:02:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

from other countries shows that in some EU member states interest rate
caps have resulted in reduced credit access for low-income consumers.
In Australia, lenders have imposed charges outside the cap, or
developed products outside regulation. Sometimes a cap results in a
move to rent-to-own credit. I am sure Members will be aware of places
on the high street where technological gadgets can be bought at a very
high hire purchase fee. The expansion of this market occurred in
Michigan in the US, where pawnbroking thrived following restrictions on

to report against that in its annual report, which the Treasury will
lay before Parliament so that it can be scrutinised by the Treasury
Committee. The Public Accounts Committee also has the ability

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:04:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Northfield mentioned the role that post offices can
play. They can help credit unions and it is important to note that they
are piloting current accounts, in particular the control account, which
is aimed at people who may not have had significant bank accounts
before and may want a lot of control over managing their money. We
hope  to see that rolled out across the rest of the country.
Furthermore, the Department for Communities and Local Government is
running a competition to get post offices to play a greater role in
their communities, some of the prize money from which they could use
better to help those in financial difficulty.

education is key, however, hence the importance of the
Government’s moves to have it provided in schools. Some people
taking out payday loans have access to alternatives, but are not using
them, partly because the advertising is so effective and partly because
of the speed and convenience of payday lending compared with the
discussions with a bank about an overdraft.</hs_Para>

Lewis, from Money Saving Expert, has produced an interesting guide on

its website. Martin Lewis has made the excellent suggestion that if
people are worried they might need emergency credit in the form of a
payday loan, they could instead take out a credit card, stick it in an
ice cream tub filled with water and keep it in the freezer, which might
instil in them the discipline of not being tempted to use it for
everyday spending. Should they need emergency credit, however, they
could use the credit card in the short term and pay it off before the
next bill, thereby not paying any interest. There are ways of getting
around it, but I appreciate that not everybody will want to follow that
advice.</hs_Para>

surprised and rather disappointed. The Minister herself raised issues
about advertising and she seemed to be in agreement in principle with
many of the provisions about how lenders should be
obliged—although I think she suggested voluntary measures, and I
am not sure that that would work—clearly to display the interest
payable in cash terms. That is important so that consumers know exactly
the position they would be in and could compare the costs of borrowing.
The Bill would allow that consistent approach to be determined by the
Financial Conduct Authority.</hs_Para>

to claim it at that very moment—if only we would text back. We

it is perfectly normal for people to take out all these loans and as if
there is nothing to be concerned about with them. As I say, it

concerns raised about the dangers of interest caps. He described them
as a blunt instrument, and he spoke about how a market for new products
can emerge. The issues that the hon. Gentleman raised could be explored
further in Committee. His points about the role of the mainstream banks
were important, too. He referred to the charging regime and to the need
for the so-called “jam jar” accounts. When some people
cannot access or have difficulty accessing a basic bank account, it
makes it extremely difficult for them to consider saving. He
highlighted the importance of financial education and the credit unions
to encourage saving, but the harsh reality is that it is simply not
possible for many people on low pay to have the financial resilience to
save. If a child needs a pair of shoes or a school trip comes up or
something unexpectedly goes wrong in the home, they 
<?notus-xml column=702?>might have to use the little savings they have, making it extremely
difficult for them to get back on track. The credit union movement has

ensure, too, that the FCA would be able to determine the enforcement
powers to be used for breaches of the legislation. Again, I view that
as an important issue. I heard the Minister talk about the need to have
everyone together and to have the code of conduct encapsulated in the
provisions. It was almost as if the bad companies or those that would
not adhere to the rules would somehow fall off the end of the world.

credit is a serious and growing problem, and the irresponsible actions

However, the key difference that makes those firms so dangerous is that
whereas not every vulnerable household in the country has a friendly
neighbourhood loan shark knocking on their door, pretty much every
household is likely to have a TV, radio or computer through which they
are constantly bombarded with clever and manipulative advertising
almost every time they switch on. In many ways, the cheap suit and the

gave frightening statistics about what is clearly still going wrong in
the industry. I think 
<?notus-xml column=703?>77% of respondents said they were having trouble paying their loan, and
about 65% had extended their loan without being clear how much it would
cost them. That is extremely worrying. Only 8% said that they were
given any information about the availability of free debt advice, which
tells us an awful lot about the

do not think any Member of Parliament has not had someone in their
constituency who has suffered from payday companies getting them into
deeper debt and roll-overs. I wish to give one example, a lady in my
constituency who took out three payday loans to help to pay the bills.
She was subsequently made redundant, and her relationship broke down
due to domestic violence. She was therefore unable to repay her loans,
and of course she began to get phone calls from the loan
companies—up to five times a day from each company—and
letters harassing her to pay. On many occasions, she was wrongly given
the impression that they were priority creditors. They put her under a
lot of pressure. She tried many times to renegotiate her loans, but she
felt immensely threatened. She then went into counselling for domestic
abuse, and the lenders’ harassment made her feel more anxious
and depressed.</hs_Para>

involved with the citizens advice bureau. I give enormous credit to
citizens advice bureaux, and I am sure we are all extremely grateful
for the fantastic work they do in our constituencies. They should be

have talked about marketing issues, and I particularly support the
desire to give an indicative cash cost in advertising. I know that the
current regulations require companies to give a typical APR in their
adverts, which is of course important, especially if there is a
possibility of roll-over. However, on the whole it is not relevant if
somebody is taking out what they intend to be a short-term, one-month
loan. The APR does not give people much indication of their ability to
pay the loan back. It is very hard to judge that, and to judge other
companies and what they are offering. These loans are often what might
be termed distress purchases to cover the cost of a sudden event such
as a school trip or a broken boiler, and people are therefore looking
for ease of access, but when they listen to these companies’
marketing they could be forgiven for thinking that ease of access is
the only factor they should consider when taking out one of these
loans.</hs_Para>

am sure Members will have heard many of the adverts—some may
even have particularly irritating jingles rattling around in their
heads now—and I have never heard an advert for one of these
companies that says, “Our typical APR is just 5,000% per annum
and a staggering 8% lower on average than that of our nearest
competitors.” They simply do not market on those issues. If they
were to give typical cash costs, that would make pricing more
transparent for potential borrowers, 
<?notus-xml column=704?>and it could also mean lenders start to compete on that basis in their
advertising, which might bring down the cost of these loans and
therefore have a further benefit for potential
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:25:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000388" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000388">I
want to say a few words about the proposed restrictions to the
continuous payment authority provision, which allows companies to take
money from people’s bank accounts. Some payday loan companies
have exploited that provision by simply taking money directly out of
customers’ accounts on pay day even after those customers have
done the right thing and have admitted to their payday lender that they
are struggling and might need to reduce their payments. There are even
some cases highlighted to us by citizens advice bureaux of customers
who have rung up their lender, painstakingly negotiated a repayment
plan with it over a number of months, only for it to take the
outstanding amount it is owed straight away, leaving them with no money
to pay their mortgage and utilities and other household bills. Payday
loan companies behaving as if they are priority lenders in this way
causes a huge amount of distress in my constituency and around the
country, and I welcome the proposal that they should be obliged to give
three days’ notice and make it very clear that customers can
cancel their
arrangement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:26:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000389" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000389">Alternatives
such as the credit unions have been mentioned. Credit unions are doing
fantastic work. In my constituency there is an incredibly popular one
that meets at the St Nicholas church on Canvey island, and I would
recommend it to any of my constituents. People in Essex can contact the
Essex Savers net credit union based in Chelmsford.</hs_Para>

can also ask their employers for an advance on their wages, which may
very well be met with a favourable response. When I was still running a
small business, I would have been very receptive towards staff who
wanted an advance. We must also constantly remind people that there is
free Government debt advice. It is still the case that few people who
use payday loan facilities and are therefore clearly in money
difficulties are aware of the Money Advice
Service—MA—debt advice or the fact that they can approach
a citizens advice bureau. We should not just do the headline-grabbing
thing of attacking the payday lenders, the names of which we all know;
we must also constantly push forward the alternatives to people who are
in difficulties, so they can get control of their finances without
handing over large amounts of cash in interest to companies that

interest in the Bill is sparked partly by the number of people in my

financial trouble and had to turn to local debt advice charities for
assistance. Two particular cases stand out for me, and in neither was
the person doing the wrong thing; both were in employment, trying to
bring up their families without relying on anyone else. But such is the

elder daughter, who was contributing to the household bills, left home

result Emma’s wages alone were no longer sufficient to cover
them all. Unable to get any help, Emma got behind on her rent and fuel
bills, and resorted to taking out payday loans. She took out five, with
five different companies, paying interest rates of between 1,700% and
2,900% APR.</hs_Para>

was no way in which she would have been able to repay these loans.
Interestingly, when the CAB got involved in discussions with her
landlord and the utility companies they were both willing to make
reasonable arrangements to help her clear her arrears with them over
time. The payday loan companies, however, were very different; they

other case involves a single mum who has two teenage girls at

has been squeezed by the combination of rising prices, notably those
for food and fuel in this case, and the fact that her wages have not
risen. She was managing okay until a couple of years ago, when she
began to fall behind with her rent. She took out a loan to help her pay
the rent but then got behind again and took out another one. Soon she
could not pay the rent because she was servicing some seven payday

too, benefited from the CAB’s support in negotiating repayments

But, again, when the CAB came to negotiate on her behalf with the
payday loan companies, even though it had her written authorisation for
this, initially they refused to negotiate until a complaint to the OFT
was threatened. Again, responsible lenders would have seen that she
could not afford extra payday loans and would not have advanced the
credit. Indeed, they would perhaps have pointed her

back on track with her finances, but it will be a long time before she

through roll-overs, additional interest and charges. The OFT seems to
be saying, albeit very politely, that £1 billion of the

action is needed to create viable alternatives to the payday lending

unions are the other key alternative. The cost of a single loan with a
credit union can be hundreds of pounds cheaper than a high-cost credit

interest. The same loan from a credit union for the same period at
their maximum 26% APR costs just £38 in interest. That is
dramatically cheaper. A £300 payday loan from Wonga at 4,214%

in this country credit unions are still too limited in their reach and
coverage. The Government, to be fair, have continued, like the last
Labour Government, to invest in credit unions and to make sensible
reforms, but a bolder set of measures is needed to reform the reach of
credit unions. In the UK, just over 1 million people are members of
credit unions, and I declare an interest as a member of the Rainbow

authorities, social housing landlords, and other parts of the public

25% of the population are credit union members. Indeed, I think the
biggest credit union in the world is Navy Federal in the US. It is the
credit union for the American armed forces, with more than 3 million US

Durkan:</Member></B> I speak as the Member of the House who has the
highest rate of credit union membership among his constituents. Is my
hon. Friend aware that credit unions are now reporting a concern that
some debt advisers are telling people to max the loan that they can get
from the credit union and use that to discharge their debt to payday
lenders? Then the credit 
<?notus-xml column=708?>union is quickly hit with an insolvency voluntary agreement. That is
having an effect now on lending decisions taken by credit unions. It is

when we get to Committee, I might tempt my hon. Friend the Member for
Sheffield Central
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:42:26"></hs_TimeCode> look again at
the wording of his clause 4 proposals for a levy on lenders to fund the
Money Advice Service. Good as that is, I wonder whether a levy to help
to fund the expansion of credit unions is equally urgent, particularly
those credit unions in areas of deprivation that have the capacity to
offer the equivalent of payday lending products, albeit with far lower
interest rates, and therefore much more affordably. Perhaps if we are
able to persuade the Friday wolves to allow the Bill to progress, we
might have a useful debate on that point. We certainly need to be far
more ambitious about the reach of credit
unions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:43:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000413">Lastly,
I gently suggest to my hon. Friend one further refinement to his Bill.
We need a culture of openness across financial services, as exists, for
example, in the United States. By that I mean that we need to get down
to local community level—postcode level—to find out what
financial services businesses are lending, how they are lending and to
whom they are lending. The data should be anonymised, to protect
individuals’ confidentiality. That would help us target much
better where investment in debt advice, credit unions, or community
banking services is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:43:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000414" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000414">In
Thamesmead in south-east London, not one  bank branch is open.
It is an area that serves some 55,000 people, and the nearest bank
branch is 30 to  40 minutes away by public transport. Lack of
access to bank branches limits access to mainstream credit and
increases the vulnerability of people and the demand for high-cost
credit products. To be fair to the Government, the banks have had some
pressure from Ministers, as well as from our ranks, finally to begin to
publish some of their lending data, although they are taking a long
time to do so. Inevitably, the data will need refining to be useful.
That openness is important. The FCA will need to be tough with the
financial services industry to get useful banking openness data. We
need to make sure that we include the payday lending industry within
the scope of that published data so that we have a proper sense of
access to financial services in each
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:45:12"></hs_TimeCode>. I
hope that if the Bill gets into Committee my hon. Friend might be open

credit unions pay towards the provision of debt advice services but
that payday lenders do not. This is a hangover from the regulatory
regime that existed under the last Government, and, given the growth of
the payday loan industry and other forms of high-cost credit, this

I would be inclined to go further than simply putting payday lenders on
the same level as lower-cost lenders. We have a responsibility to
ensure that consumers are properly informed, but much of the evidence
that we have heard today shows that they are not. We need to ensure
that every consumer—particularly the most vulnerable—has
access to free debt advice and an understanding of all their options

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:56:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow West illustrated very well in his speech. However, they do
not necessarily have the resources to advertise widely, and their
coverage of the country is patchy. I want to see a credit union
offering support to my constituents, but since the sad demise of the
Black Pear union, we do not have a local organisation in Worcester with
the capability to do so. We would welcome credit unions from elsewhere
coming in, and I am glad that the Six Towns credit union has entered
talks to do so, but it will take time for it to establish its presence

up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:56:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000446" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000446">In
previous debates, we have heard the argument that Governments do not
set caps for lending costs, and that it would be wrong to interfere in
the market by doing so. However, we have a good, recent example of the
Government setting out a cap for lending, which has attracted broad
support. The proposed 3% monthly APR limit for credit union lending has
allowed credit unions to increase the interest that they can charge on
loans, and thereby to reach a wider audience. That is still seen as a
reasonable rate, as it is far lower than that charged by many payday
lenders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T12:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000447" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000447">I
would advocate using that cap on credit union lending as the base for a
new levy. Organisations that lend above that rate should pay a levy
proportionate to 
<?notus-xml column=713?>the amount of interest and costs that they charge, beyond the level
charged by credit unions. That levy could then be used to fund free
financial advice services. If the levy were set at a percentage of all
interest above the 3% monthly rate, it could raise a substantial
amount, given some of the rates being charged by payday lenders. Just
5% of Wonga’s profits would equate to £3 million that
could be used to provide free financial advice.</hs_Para>

approach could create a virtuous circle whereby either the market share
of the high-cost lenders would be reduced by the prevalence of better
and more widely available free advice services, or the amount of free
advice to support the most vulnerable consumers would grow as the
industry did. It would also have the advantage of providing a financial
disincentive for lenders to set their rates too high, and a competitive
advantage to the credit unions. It could provide a valuable new source
of income for a sector that has faced many challenges in recent

is a precedent for such an approach in the voluntary support of major
players in the gambling industry for GamCare, but in this case, it is
important that any levy should be imposed by the regulator and backed
by legislation, rather than being put forward by the industry on a
voluntary basis. The industry has had plenty of time to consider making
a contribution to free financial advice, and so far it has largely
failed to do so. There is no evidence that the industry would act in
concert to provide the level of support that the financial advice
services needed, and I support the idea in the Bill that a levy should

used to fund credit union expansion, but I believe that a subsidy of
any sort would distort the business model of credit unions and could
risk making them less sustainable. I have discussed this point with
representatives of the credit unions, including Six Towns. It would be
better for the levy to provide them with a competitive advantage in
being set above their lending cap, and to fund the financial advice

However, it is disappointing that although the entire parliamentary

proceed to Committee, where  it can be amended, but I doubt
whether that will be achieved, because the Minister has said that the

the channels clear for the Bill that the Conservative party want to
proceed, which is the European Union (Referendum) Bill. It is

it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T13:03:50"></hs_TimeCode>. A ComRes

the heartache and misery that payday loans are causing in many

example. For no apparent reason, I will decide on Stockton in the
north-east—I am not sure whether
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T13:04:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stockton South (James Wharton) is here today. Let us look at the
number of payday lenders on Stockton high street: Cash Krazy, No. 1
Currency—Cash Generator, the Money Shop, Cash Converters, and
Ramsdens 4 Cash. Rates of APR—I checked the websites
last night—range from 2,400%, to the lowest rate of 897%. That
shows the scandal surrounding payday loans. Industry spin says that
such loans are for short periods, but as we have heard, and as I know
from my constituency, they are not. I will mention
roll-overs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T13:05:47"></hs_TimeCode> later

the payday lenders. Everyday Loans is owned by a friend of the Prime

Jones:</Member></B> Given the mess that the Chancellor is making of the
economy, I am not sure I agree with the hon. Gentleman. The point is
that the Conservative party can accept a cheap loan from a person
involved  in payday lending, at the same time as many of our
constituents and ordinary hard-working families are being charged 74%
interest. It goes further. Adrian Beecroft is a major stakeholder in
Wonga which, as has been mentioned, charges up to 4,000% interest. He
wants us to deregulate more—zero-hours contracts, the minimum
wage and all the other things that he wants put forward in a
deregulation Bill—but that will cause more of the problem. I am
not surprised that he is in favour of it, because it will lead more
people to payday loans at exorbitant rates from the likes of Wonga. I
am a bit baffled by the Government’s approach to the Bill. It
would be sensible to send it to Committee, debate it and if they want
to amend it, they can bring forward proposals.</hs_Para>

Canadian one, which can cap interest at 7%, as opposed the rate on

Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), who said that this
House should have control of those things. The de facto position under
this Government—and, I have to say, the previous
Government—is that the best way to do these things is to create
an arm’s length regulator, which will somehow sort the problem
out. I am not opposed to that—although the episode involving the
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority this week has shown that
it can backfire a little—but if we are to have a regulator,
Parliament has to set clear guidelines. I am therefore not opposed to
external regulation, as long as it operates according to a clear set of
guidelines, which this Bill would set out. Indeed, that is the

Jones:</Member></B> There are two issues about the situation the hon.
Gentleman describes. He asks, “Would it work?”, but he
should look at Canada, where there is already a limitation of, I think,
four months. First, I would ask the lender, “What credit checks
did you do on the individual in the first place to lend the
money?” Secondly, the company should try to work out how that
individual could pay—whether over a longer period or something
like that—but certainly not sucker them into another loan, which
is what happens now. The hon. Gentleman is being naive—he is
obviously not keen to crack down as hard on payday lenders as the
headline suggests. The point is that if someone cannot pay back the
first loan, how on earth are they going to pay back the second one?
These companies know that. I do not want to call the hon. Gentleman
naive—he is certainly not naive—but he is being naive in
arguing that payday lenders somehow do not know that once they have got
people hooked on that line of credit, it is in their interests to keep
them  on it.</hs_Para>

most ancient times. The Hittites, the Egyptians and the Phoenicians
were all lending each other food, substances, bits and pieces and
getting them back. It is always a pleasure to mention the Phoenicians
because it is believed that Joseph of Arimathea brought Jesus himself
to Somerset on a Phoenician trading vessel. It was quite
near Bristol, so we never know whether our lord might have gone there,
too. This is the ancient

does not send people round with baseball bats. There seems to be a

leads me on to the FCA and the normal laws. If I may, I will cite the
case of a constituent who came to me not because he had borrowed money
from Wonga but because it came after him saying that he had. Somebody
had used his name, had borrowed I think about £300, and had got
it deposited in a criminal bank account—a bank account not
belonging to my constituent. Wonga then came after him and said,
“You owe us this money. Please may we have it back?” He
is a wealthy man, so he would have had no difficulty paying this money
if he felt like it, but he was also not the sort of person who was
going to be fiddled around with and pay money that he did not owe. So
he said to Wonga, “I do not owe it. I never took out that loan.
That is not my bank account.” Wonga wrote back saying,
“That’s absolutely fine. We’ll write it
off.” He said, “No, that is not absolutely fine, thank
you very much. That is criminal activity and I should like it reported
to the police.” He reported it to the police, but he was not the
sufferer of the crime. It did not affect him. He was not short of
£300; merely his name had been used. The police therefore would
not do anything on his account and Wonga refused to report it to the
police. Therefore it was allowing a crime to be committed and in effect
rolling up the cost of that into the interest rate it charged to the 
<?notus-xml column=723?>people who borrow from it—in a payday loan at a very high rate,
as has been mentioned—and taking that as a cost of doing

That has been in the rule book of the FSA before and of the FCA now,
and of IMRO before them. It is a fundamental rule of financial services
that we should know the counter-party with whom we are dealing and we
should not deal with that counter-party if we do not, because we have a
regulatory obligation to ensure the product we are offering is suitable

second count is to do with an absolutely standard part of all financial
service regulation: money laundering. It is drummed into anybody who
works in the City that money laundering is one of the most dangerous
things they can be involved with, and that anything to do with money
laundering—any passive participation in money
laundering—is a very serious offence subject to high penalties.
The basic rule for an investment firm is, “If you hear about
money laundering or have the vaguest suspicion of money laundering, you
must inform the 
<?notus-xml column=724?>senior person—the money laundering officer—in your
business, who will then decide whether to report that to the

the money laundering laws that are already on the statute book,
however. We do not need more laws; we need existing laws to be

think that? Let me go back to the example of my constituent and the
£300. If the lender were paying it into a bank account of which
they had no real evidence—no proper knowledge—that was a
golden opportunity for money laundering. If someone can just ring up
and say, “I would like to borrow a few hundred pounds,”
and it is instantly put into an account in the name of someone who is
not necessarily the person who has rung up, and is then paid back with
a cash deposit, that is the most fantastic way of money laundering. Not
only that, but the price paid of a month’s interest is a modest
amount to pay to wash the money through the system. So this aspect of
payday lenders’ operations would allow money laundering to take
place—I have no evidence on whether or not it is taking
place—in a very easy and straightforward

Rees-Mogg:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right; there are aspects of
the money laundering regulations that set thresholds. For example,
someone can bring only £10,000 into the country in
cash—such a rule applies to many countries around the world in
their equivalent currencies—and certain sums have to be
reported, if they are cash transactions, by banks and so on. One part
of the rules also deals with aggregations. Using a succession of small
transactions is one way in which money launderers try to launder money,
because the rules on higher sums have become relatively effective.
Before legislating we should always want to look carefully at whether
regulations that are already available could improve the system. The
use of the two I have mentioned, relating to knowing one’s
client and money laundering, would put a strong burden on the payday
loan companies to ensure that they were lending to people they at least
knew really existed and about whose financial circumstances they knew
something. They would, thus, be able to lend to people who had a better
chance of paying back.</hs_Para>

issue of people having a better chance of paying a loan back is
important, because payday lenders have a cavalier approach to how they
lend and so they build into their interest rate a high level of
default, which means that people who can pay back, even though they may
not be the greatest debtors, pay a much higher interest rate than would
otherwise be necessary for them. If the business of the payday lenders
was more tightly regulated so that they knew their underlying client
and if the level of bad debt was brought down, the rate of interest
would come down and the problem would be reduced in that natural and
evolutionary way, rather than by trying to set caps and
controls.</hs_Para>

have great difficulties with caps on interest rates, for the
straightforward reason that no business is going to make a small loan
if the interest rate is capped, because 
<?notus-xml column=725?>the administration of that loan will simply be too expensive to make it
worth while. A £100 loan is likely to involve £5 to
£10 of administration, whether that loan lasts for a day, a week
or a month. So the rate for a week is extraordinarily high because it
is being compounded over the course of a year. Setting caps is
therefore not the right way to proceed, because it takes away the
ability to borrow from the people who are most in need of these smaller
sums at the bottom end of the scale.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T13:43:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Durham (Mr Jones) talked about the Conservative party
borrowing at 3.5%—of course it borrows at that rate. People who
are borrowing millions of pounds pay low rates of interest, because
usually there is some collateral against the loan, they are more likely
to have a track record on lending and the interest rate covers the
administrative cost. Where someone is paying 3.5% on a £5
million loan, the administrative costs are comparatively negligible. On
a £100 loan repayable within a week, the 3.5% is so negligible
that it would not begin to cover the administrative costs, and so what
does the holder of capital do? They do not make the loan to the
individual who needs it to get through that weekend. We must be careful
about what we seek to regulate. If we seek to regulate one aspect of
the system, we may well find that the unintended consequence is that
the people who are most in need of this source of borrowing are cut out
of the market altogether. In that case, they have no alternative but to
go to the loan

into the question of supply creating its own demand and demand creating
its own supply. There is an important quality about demand creating its
own supply and that is that it tends to reduce prices. If we regulate,
we find that we interrupt the natural creation of the supply that comes
through. Let us look at it this way: if more payday lenders come to the
market, they provide excess capital that is available. They want to
lend it out and they have it on their books. They then have to
advertise and build up the market. They produce the supply available,
but others are doing the same. There is then an excess supply in the
market and the demand will fill it up, but only if the price falls. If
we regulate in such a way as to reduce the supply that is coming on
board so that that excess of credit is not made available in the
market, the price will increase as there will be fewer people

be careful, therefore, about introducing new regulation, because new
regulation has a tendency to drive people out of the market, or, worse
still, favour the largest players, who find it easiest to deal with the
regulation, and will then create an oligopoly or ultimately a monopoly,
which of course produces the highest pricing possible. I would very
much not like us to legislate in such a way that it is hard for new
entrants to come in, that existing participants are able to
consolidate  
<?notus-xml column=727?>their positions, and that one or two of them are able to push their

competitive banking system, we might find that the banks were more
interested in making lower-level loans, but because they only need to
concentrate on the biggest business, which is the easiest—the
least risky—the major banks are not in this area. They leave it
to the payday loan companies, which are less well organised; they are
organised in a more aggressive way, and a relatively unattractive way

is an anomaly, but not all anomalies are corrected by adding people in
to the anomaly. It is much simpler to abolish the anomaly and say that
the right to levy taxation is a fundamental right of Parliament. I
quoted specifically from Magna Carta, which refers to a court, and we
are the High Court of Parliament. It is important to remember that
fines should only come through a proper judicial process or through the
will of Parliament extracting fees. As soon as we delegate that to
other bodies, over which there is no democratic control, we give up
something that is fundamental to this House and what it is for. The
consent to taxation is what this House has done since 1265. Perhaps the
last Labour Government passed it over in a fit of absent-mindedness;

I said, the problem, in essence, is one that has existed from time

against, and unfortunately it is not one to which there has ever been a
neat and easy solution. Caps have been tried again and again. A cap was
the idea of the Council of Nicaea in the 350s AD, and it was repeated
under Henry VIII in 1545. Those caps did not work and there is no
reason to suppose that new caps will work. Why? Because people
need  to borrow the money when they need to borrow it, and
therefore they will go out and find it one way or another. The more
they are pushed into an unregulated and almost criminal arena, the
worse it will be for them. It is therefore very important that this

regret to say that many people in my constituency find themselves in a
situation where they have to resort to payday loans and other
short-term, very expensive borrowing. Of course, in my part of east
London using short-term credit is nothing new. In years past, my family
used the pawn shop, as did many others in their communities. It helped
out when the week’s money would not go quite far enough to meet
the week’s outgoings.

precarious unemployment, falling wages, soaring house bills, the
bedroom tax, the benefits cap and rising food bills, along with heating

November 2012, Citizens Advice has run a survey to help people who have
payday loans check whether their lender is sticking to the charter. The

heard, money is often withdrawn by the lender with no consideration for
the borrower’s essential living costs. Indeed, an example given
today by 
<?notus-xml column=735?>Salford’s citizens advice bureau is of a borrower who fears he
will lose his home and his job because payday lenders have left him
with only £1.17 a week from his weekly wage. He does not have
enough money to travel to work, let alone pay for his other living
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:20:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

third area of concern, returning to the point made by

is the persistent and excessive advertising of payday loans. Citizens
Advice tells us that advertising for payday loans has reached
saturation point. The adverts are unclear on costs and the potential
impact of failure to repay a loan. Also worrying is the use of
celebrities and cartoon characters in adverts. How are we targeting a
market of responsible borrowing and lending by using cartoon
characters? Clearly, young families and vulnerable people
are being targeted with blanket advertising on daytime television. It
is when I exercise in the gym that I am confronted by this
constant advertising, and I find myself wanting to turn away
because I get so sick of seeing it. One 32-year-old worker
told Salfordonline that he had used Wonga to take
out eight short-term loans in one year. He
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13071272000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000680">“I

Advice feels that broadcast advertising for payday loans should be
limited to after the 9 o’clock watershed, and should be
prohibited from any programme likely to appeal to anyone under the age
of 18. It also feels that the measures in the Bill are needed to stop
marketing via text messages. The 32-year-old from Salford whom I just
quoted highlighted the fact that payday lenders would hold on to his
details for six years, and that he was expecting to be bombarded with
e-mails and texts offering him more loans. He

are around 3.7 million recorded crimes in this country every year. For
each of those crimes there is at least one direct victim, and in many
cases many direct victims. However, that should not mean that we
overlook what many refer to as the hidden victims: prisoners’
families. Approximately 160,000 children in this country currently have
one or both parents inside prison. That is approximately twice the
number of children in care and more than the number who suffer as a
consequence of the divorce of their parents in any one year. Those
children are three times as likely to suffer from mental health
problems as other children in society. More than 60% of young boys who
have one parent incarcerated are likely to go on to offend and go into
prison later in their
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:34:44"></hs_TimeCode> as a

on the outside often suffer the social stigma of the communities in
which they live. It is often assumed that families have brought these
problems on themselves. Children at school might suffer bullying and
many of these families might find more solace in the local criminal
fraternity than they do among their neighbours and the communities in
which they live. Many families suffer emotional problems, stresses and
financial problems, particularly where the individual in prison has
previously been the breadwinner. Families also suffer problems in
visiting their loved ones in prisons, especially when many of the
prisons are a long way from home. The Minister may be able to provide
some more recent information in a few moments, but I know that in 2003
some 11,000 prisoners were incarcerated at a distance greater than 100

Stride:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for his intervention and
congratulate him on the deep and detailed research he carried out for
the production of his book. I very much take his point: it is essential
that families are connected to prisoners for, among other reasons, the
reason he has just elaborated. It is not just the ability of 
<?notus-xml column=740?>families to connect with their loved ones in prisons that matters, as
the quality of the experience when they do is also important, as I
shall explain in a few
moments<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000628" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000628">The
issue is not just about the suffering of families, because it is the
value of the families in the rehabilitation process that really
matters. It is a fact that where a prisoner comes out of prison into a
family environment—gaining the support identified by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman)—they are 40% less likely to
reoffend than if there were no family there to support them. The
economic costs to our criminal justice system of reoffending are, of
course, absolutely immense, running in excess of £10 billion a
year. The beneficial effects are felt not only by those being released
but by their children, and we can see demonstrable reductions in
inter-generational crime resulting from the presence of families and
their support for prisoners on release.</hs_Para>

support from families comes while the prisoners are inside prison, and
I think one of the most important aspects of prison visits and
connections between families and prisoners is that they are there to
remind those inside what is happening outside so that when prisoners
leave they will have very real personal responsibilities and it will be
for them to tackle them. It is also known that where family visits and
contacts with prisoners are facilitated, the likelihood of self-harming
among prisoners is reduced, as indeed is the likelihood of
suicide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:38:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000630" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000630">Outside
prison, family contact helps, as my hon. Friend indicated, in the
provision of jobs and appropriate housing. It also leads to what some
describe as prisoners having “a stake in conformity”,
meaning that they have social pressure from the family network to
ensure that they do not reoffend, that they go straight and avoid
lapsing back into drug use or the misuse of alcohol.</hs_Para>

am very heartened by the direction of travel that Ministers have mapped
out for us on the criminal justice side. I believe that payment by
results, when it comes to involving voluntary or private organisations,
is a good way to help ensure rehabilitation, leading to an unleashing
of innovation, of entrepreneurial spirit, of creativity and to
solutions being suggested that are appropriate to local circumstances.
I also believe it is important that the Government have announced 70
resettlement prisons. Prisoners in the final three months of their
sentence will be closer to their families than would otherwise be the
case, with all the benefits I have
identified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:39:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000632" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0002.htm#13071272000632">As
a general point, it is extremely important that we ensure that the
level of contact I am describing exists throughout the criminal justice
process, from as close as possible to the point of arrest and charge
and certainly right the way through to prison and post-release. The
nature of that contact should be weighted towards mentoring for
families by individuals who have gone through the difficulties
associated with having a loved one in prison and who can therefore
share their experience, compassion and
insight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:40:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000633" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0003.htm#13071272000633">I
have a series of points and questions for the Minister, on which I ask
for his comments. The first question is how he and his colleagues see
the Government encouraging organisations that are involved in the
rehabilitation process, particularly the smaller and perhaps more
innovative ones. I think particularly of String of Pearls, the project
that Mary Stephenson and her colleagues have been operating in HMP
Channings Wood. We 
<?notus-xml column=741?>need to ensure that such projects are not crowded out by the likes of
G4S and Serco, about which we have heard less than flattering news

Friend cites in support of his argument. Does he agree that there is
potential in the years to come for one of those organisations, or a
group of them together, to take over a resettlement prison, so that
instead of having a state-run or privately run prison, we have a
community or charity-run prison that will work for the benefit of the

Stride:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that interesting idea.
That is the exciting part of the Government’s direction of
travel—all sorts of innovation, partnership arrangements and
possibilities may occur in the future, because we are not being too
prescriptive from the centre. We are allowing best practice to thrive
in a pluralistic market, allowing competition to drive up standards and

the Minister consider additional funding for some small providers, such
as String of Pearls, so that they are not crowded out by the bigger
players and so that, further down the line, we can have a more
pluralistic marketplace of providers and encourage the innovation and
nimble-footedness that we associate with smaller organisations in

also ask the Minister how we can ensure that prisoners’ families
are a major focus of rehabilitation organisations. I wonder whether the
fee mechanism might be a way of achieving that. I know that there are
three strands to the way in which providers will be paid. There is
payment by results, but there is also the fee-for-service strand, which
I understand is for providers meeting certain set criteria. I wonder
whether we may have a sharp focus in those criteria on the involvement
of families, so that organisations that are strong in that respect are
rewarded for it. As I understand it, the third strand of the payment
structure will be penalties for failure. I would like providers who
ignore the importance of families to be penalised in some
form<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:43:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000638" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0003.htm#13071272000638">The
other thought I would like to share with the Minister is that the
justice data lab, which we have set up to allow rehabilitation
providers to benchmark their performance against other providers and
against the norm, is also there to share best practice. I would like to

it is difficult for families to visit prisoners, perhaps because of the
distances involved, phone contact is often the only contact that is
available. Much of that contact is on a telephone in a prison corridor
under warder supervision. I do not think that is the best, or most
appropriate, environment. I would like prisoners to have phones in
cells. By that I do not mean we should go soft on prisoners by allowing
them to phone whoever they want, but they should be allowed some
element of privacy when they are making the call. I know there has been
a move towards that in private prisons, on the basis that it is cheaper
because there is less warder involvement.</hs_Para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Justice (Jeremy
Wright):</Member></B> May I first congratulate
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:48:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Central Devon (Mel Stride) on securing this debate, and
also return the compliment to him by thanking him for the considerable
interest he takes in this subject? He has highlighted one of several
important issues covered by the Government’s plans to transform
the criminal justice system. He is right to say that we must consider
such matters in the context of falling crime figures, which is good
news, but reoffending remains a serious challenge, and the ways to
achieve further reductions in crime and reoffending include taking bold
and effective steps to rehabilitate offenders by assisting, encouraging
and guiding them away from crime into new, worthwhile and productive
ways of life.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:48:54"></hs_TimeCode>The evidence
shows that support for prisoners’ families is an important part
of that, for two reasons. First, supporting offenders’ family
relationships can help to reduce reoffending. Secondly, supporting
offenders’ families can help to reduce the likelihood of
intergenerational offending. Both those things are important.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend pointed out, we announced on 4 July that a
total of 70 resettlement prisons have been identified for the adult
male prisoner estate, with more to be identified for the female and
young adult estates. 
<?notus-xml column=743?>Resettlement prisons are one strand of a comprehensive strategy of
reform that is seeking to tackle the problem of reoffending
in all its aspects. That should provide both better
opportunities to support contact with families, and links with local
partners and providers of support services. Providers will offer a
resettlement service for all offenders in custody before their release,
which may well include family support, where it is
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000647" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0003.htm#13071272000647">I
agree with my hon. Friend that positive family relationships can be an
important protective factor in helping offenders desist from future
offending. We understand that we can help to break the cycle of
offending by working to strengthen family ties, to improve family and
other relationships, to improve parenting behaviour and to increase
acceptance into communities and social networks. He was
right—my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:50:28"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) made this point,
too—to say that research has shown that ensuring a prisoner
keeps in contact with his or her family while in prison can help in
reducing the likelihood of reoffending. We know, too, that most
prisoners regard their families as important to them and want them to
be involved in their lives, and that they believe that support from
their family and seeing their children would be important in stopping
them reoffending in the future. It is therefore important that we
support and allow contact, and the involvement of families in
prisoners’
sentences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:51:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000648" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0003.htm#13071272000648">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:51:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Central Devon asked, in particular, about
phone contact. He will know that there are private prisons that
currently allow phone use in cells. Rochester prison, in the publicly
run estate, is also trialling the use of phones in cells. It is
important that we look at what the evidence is showing us about that.
He makes a fair point that if a prisoner is to be encouraged to make
more phone calls home and to speak to the children more often, they are
more likely  to do that if the phone is located in the cell
than if it is located on the landing. However, he will recognise that
we cannot allow unrestricted access to telephones, and whatever we do
there will still be a restricted list of numbers that prisoners are
able to
call<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:51:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Opperman:</Member></B> We all know that at least 8,000 mobile phones
are confiscated by the Prison Service every year, so by supposition
another 8,000 that are not confiscated are probably in the system. It
must be accepted that mobile phones are already in the system. Due
deference must be paid to security, but does the Minister accept the
broad principle that a greater degree of communication, whether by
phone, e-mail or computer, in whatever shape or form, must be the way
ahead if we are to have this family relationship encouraged, as we
would
like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:52:28"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> My hon. Friend rightly says that, sadly, mobile
phones find their way into prison, but that is an offence and we do not
tolerate it. It cannot be wise to allow for unrestricted access to
communications, be that telephone contact or e-mail contact. What is
sensible is that we consider ways in which, within the restrictions of
a limited amount of approved phone numbers or approved contacts that a
prisoner can have, we look at the best way of ensuring that that
contact can happen, for the reasons we have been discussing.</hs_Para>

debate is also important because of the effect that parental
imprisonment has on children. It is estimated that in any given year
approximately 200,000 children 
<?notus-xml column=744?>are affected by a parent being in or going to prison. Most children who
experience parental imprisonment are likely to experience it more than
once. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:53:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Central Devon referred to the figures, and we
know that children with parents in prison are more vulnerable than
other children. They are more likely to become offenders themselves and
to develop behavioural problems and poor psychological health than
children who have not had a parent in prison, and they may lose contact
with their imprisoned mother or father. So we do understand that by
supporting offenders’ families and children we can help to
reduce the likelihood of intergenerational crime.</hs_Para>

take that responsibility within the Prison Service very seriously.
Prison Service instructions on rehabilitation services outline
expectations on prisons to: help staff in recognising the impact of
imprisonment on prisoners’ families and to understand their role
in the maintenance of family relationships and supporting
offenders’ families; to provide advice, support, signposting and
to refer prisoners to services; and to reflect the involvement of
families in the offender management
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000653" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0003.htm#13071272000653">Prison
rules require prisons to encourage prisoners to maintain outside
contacts and meaningful family ties. Prison governors have duties under
the Children Act 2004, many of which are associated with either the
child’s right to contact with parents who are held in custody or
the safeguarding and well-being of children with whom they have
contact. There are also minimum standards relating to how prisons
support family visitors, including having visiting times that maximise
opportunities for prisoners and families to meet and ensuring
opportunities for reasonable physical contact. That goes to the point
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:54:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
made about the presence of glass screens and the like. He will
appreciate that there is always a balance to be struck between the
security of the prison and ensuring that contraband cannot be passed,
and the need to ensure that relationships with family members are
maintained with as much normality as can be managed in a custodial
environment.</hs_Para>

Friend <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:48:59"></hs_TimeCode>was right
to make the point early on in his remarks that in many ways the
families of prisoners are victims of what that prisoner has done, too.
In many ways, the prisoner’s family also undergoes a sentence.
There is a period of separation that cannot be helpful to domestic life
and that certainly is not helpful to the relationship a prisoner might
have with his or her children. When we can maintain physical contact
and where it is compatible with security to do so, my hon. Friend is
right that we should seek to do that. We can take practical measures
too, such as providing facilities for children to play while visiting
and providing decent, indoor facilities with toilets and baby changing
facilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:55:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
National Offender Management Service also encourages additional
activities such as enhanced children’s play facilities, family
support worker services, family days, child-centred visits and the
like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:56:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071272000655" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/debtext/130712-0003.htm#13071272000655">My
hon. Friend asked about what will happen in the future. As he knows, by
opening up probation to a wider range of providers, we can bring
additional skills and ideas into play, while the national probation
service will continue to have a key role in managing risk, including
the direct management of higher-risk offenders.</hs_Para>

Friend <hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>also
asked about smaller organisations and I understand his concern. We,
too, are concerned that we should ensure that those smaller
organisations, 
<?notus-xml column=745?>particularly those in the voluntary sector, can play their full part in
the new landscape. We need to do that in a number of ways. Let me give
him two of the most important. We must ensure that in the bid
assessment process we take full account of what the sustainability is
likely to be of the relationships between larger and smaller
organisations. We anticipate that many of the bids we will receive will
come from a group of organisations, some large, some small. It is
important that the smaller organisations are looked after in those
arrangements and we will assess bids with that in mind.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:57:08"></hs_TimeCode>We will also
need to ensure that over the duration of the contract period we have
robust processes of contract management in place to ensure that the
sustainable relationship between larger and smaller organisations is

Opperman:</Member></B> Does the Minister accept that there is a genuine
problem with the bid assessment process in that the smaller
providers—charities, community groups—are effectively
being frozen out of the process? We need to be very certain that there
is a flexible system rather than a one-size-fits-all system to
accommodate those small

but I think that many of the small organisations about which he, I and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-12T14:57:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Central Devon are concerned will be involved in the bid
process. The trick is to ensure that they are still involved on a
sustainable basis throughout the period of the contract. I can see the
attraction of those smaller organisations and we are all familiar with
excellent voluntary sector organisations that offer something special 
<?notus-xml column=746?>in a particular aspect of rehabilitation. I am confident that they will
be involved; we must ensure that they stay involved and that they can

of rehabilitation services will look to provide that. Similarly, on his

conciliation support officer model for conciliation, exemptions, limits

conciliation have not led to any substantial policy changes. They have

the procedures to be followed by public authorities when they wish to
procure goods, works and services. These include mechanisms by which a
company may be excluded from a tender exercise, for example where a
company has been convicted of a criminal offence in connection with
their business or profession, or has committed an act of grave
professional misconduct in the course of their business or profession.

increased media coverage, using case studies of successful students
from diverse backgrounds, carrying out research into online forums and
communities used by potential Access to HE students, and a variety of
marketing materials such as short films and animations to spread
information about Access to HE online. In addition a HE admissions fair
will be held exclusively for Access to HE students this autumn. QAA

State announced a new process by which we would be informed of visits
that may qualify for special mission status. The pilot process has
improved the process for communicating and decision making in respect
of visits that may qualify for special mission status. Since the
pilot's inception, we have received three such requests. There are no
requests outstanding. In view of the confidentiality of diplomatic
exchanges, we have no plans to publish decisions about special mission
status as they are made. But if those applying for special mission
status wish to announce the details of their visit to the UK, they are
of course at liberty to do so. Each application for special mission
status is considered carefully in view of both obligations incumbent
upon the UK under customary international law, and our policy of ending
impunity for the most serious of international crimes and a commitment
to the protection of human rights. Above this, it is for the courts to
decide on the legal consequences of any decision to grant special
mission
status.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13071276000372" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/text/130712w0001.htm#13071276000372"><B><Member PimsId="4804" UID="13071276001267" xid="837" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/text/130712w0001.htm#13071276001267">Mr

involving armed groups operating outside Government control and without

the integration of former revolutionary fighters into state structures.

continuing difficulty of the security environment, including the attack
on the French embassy on 23 April, shows the urgency of supporting
Libya at this time. The UK, along with our international partners,
remains firmly committed to supporting the Libyan people, Government

more than 7,000 troops to help the Libyan Government disarm and
integrate militias and improve security and stability. As part of this,
the UK has offered to train up to 2,000 Libyan armed forces personnel
in basic infantry skills. This assistance builds on the UK's existing

Soubry:</Member></B> Data on all in-patient admissions to national
health service hospitals in England, including following an accident or
injury, is produced by the Health and Social Care Information Centre
(HSCIC) from the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) system. Admissions
following an accident or injury can be identified in HES using the
ICD10 coding system. This admitted patient care data only covers
accidents and injuries serious enough to warrant admission to hospital
as an inpatient. Data on attendances at NHS accident and emergency
(A&amp;E) departments in England, including those following an accident
or injury, is also collected as part of the HES system dataset.
However, the A&amp;E information is less detailed than that collected
for hospital inpatients, and there are issues with the quality of the
data.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071276000417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/text/130712w0001.htm#13071276000417">The

Soubry:</Member></B> The total number of cases of laboratory confirmed
Lyme disease in England and Wales is as follows. England and Wales are
taken as a single unit for epidemiological purposes as are counties
which comprise the south-west of England. Since very little patient
information is sent with referrals, only a broad designation of cases
as south-west region is possible. Data for 2012 are still being
compiled. A significant number of cases are acquired abroad so the rate
for indigenous disease refers to those acquired in the United
Kingdom.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="1" Size="8"><table tabstyle="head"><tgroup cols="6"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="19*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="15*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="16*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="17*"></colspec><colspec colname="5" colwidth="17*"></colspec><colspec colname="6" colwidth="17*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="6" namest="1" rowsep="1"><hs_TableTitle Justify="centre"><I>Table

aviation safety, and I am satisfied that NATS has an excellent safety
and performance record achieved through a highly proactive approach to
risk management and mitigation in all processes and systems. I am also
satisfied that the current legislative and regulatory framework offers
robust assurance that those high standards will be maintained. Under
this framework, the independent Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) monitors
and regulates aviation safety. There is therefore no specific need to
meet with NATS at this
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071276000788" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/text/130712w0002.htm#13071276000788">On
9 July we understand that a small number of workstations at NATS
Swanwick air traffic control centre were affected by a rare and
complicated software sequencing error. I have been informed that this
did not affect air safety as NATS' operating procedure in such
circumstances is to reduce traffic movements so that air traffic
controllers are not faced with more flights than they can safely
handle. The incident did result in some minor but unavoidable air
traffic delays, but in just over two hours the workstations affected
were back to full capacity allowing the disruption to passengers and
airlines to be kept to a
minimum.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071276000789" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/text/130712w0002.htm#13071276000789">NATS
is required to provide a safe and efficient airspace that meets the
requirements set by its air traffic licence and by the CAA. The CAA is
aware of the incident at Swanwick on 9 July and is already in
discussions with NATS regarding NATS' ongoing investigations. In light
of NATS' internal investigation, and any further investigation the CAA
might require, the CAA will take any appropriate action it deems
necessary. The CAA will also advise me if there was any risk to either
aviation safety or to the continuity of UK air traffic services arising
from the
incident.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13071276000790" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130712/text/130712w0002.htm#13071276000790">I

impacts and implications to ensure that national interests, including
those related to health care, are protected. This will be the case
within the EU-US trade negotiations which started in the week
commencing 8 July. The UK has already undertaken some long-standing
commitments at the multilateral level in terms of access to the health
sector through the General Agreement in Trade in Services (GATS, 1995).
The European Commission regularly consults EU member states both in
writing and orally on all elements of trade negotiations. Furthermore,
UK consent will be required on the final package.</hs_Para>
