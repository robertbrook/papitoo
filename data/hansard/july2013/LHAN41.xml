friend is that the new review is the responsibility of NHS England. It
is not a piece of work that Ministers are in charge of. NHS
England’s advice to me is that it is too soon to describe what
the exact process will be. However, I can say that NHS England is
developing a process that is, in its words, “rigorous,
transparent and inclusive”, particularly in the use of evidence
and data. As I have said, there will be opportunities for all
stakeholders to participate in the review—including,
importantly, the current providers of children’s congenital
heart

of State wrote to NHS England as soon as the IRP’s report was
published to say that it will need to work with all interested parties
to ensure that progress on its new review of congenital heart services
is made as quickly as possible. NHS England’s aim is that by

is extremely important. I think that there were a number of people who,

evidence were parents. Presumably, they are the most important

finding clear and sometimes simple ways of helping parents at a time
when they are stressed, anxious, worried about the geography and not

we strongly supported the UN Security Council statement on 10 July

Staff visited Lebanon earlier this month and discussed our plans to
increase our assistance to the Lebanese armed forces. We have since

with the Lebanese Government. We do not think that it will affect the
EU and the UK relationship, but we feel that it sends out a clear
message that the EU is united against terrorism and that there are
consequences for terrorist attacks carried out on European soil. It is
important, as I am sure noble Lords are aware, that the designation is

that there has been a huge show of generosity and a real welcome from
the Lebanese people. Noble Lords may be aware that the population of
Lebanon is about 4 million. The number of registered refugees is
600,000 but it is estimated that the real number could be a lot
higher—somewhere around 1 million. That is the
equivalent of the whole of the Romanian population arriving on British
shores over a very short period. A huge amount of pressure has been put
on local resources, which has of course caused tensions. It is for that

It might be too early to spot green shoots but there are certainly a

rising and unemployment is falling. Confidence among consumers and
business is growing. However, many challenges still lie ahead. Does my

end of economic revival? How do he and his colleague intend to ensure

Deighton:</Member></B> I thank my noble friend for those observations
about the signs of good news that are beginning to be seen in the
economy. Based on my discussions with small businesses, they are most
concerned about access to finance, improved broadband and better roads.
The Government are addressing all of those through the Funding for
Lending scheme to get cheaper financing and through the business bank
to get about £1 billion of capital committed in non-bank
funding. We are rolling out broadband as fast as possible both
privately and through government intervention and we have committed a
record amount not only to building new roads but to improving and
repairing existing roads so that small businesses can get around. As
for the participation of small businesses themselves in these large
infrastructure projects, those businesses operate down the supply
chain, and giving them a long-term warning that these projects are
coming is extremely helpful. By way of example, I think that about 58%
of the businesses which benefit from Crossrail spend would be
classified as small and
medium-sized.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:04:36"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Barnett" PimsId="3885" UID="13072350000627" xid="1068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000627">Lord

Deighton:</Member></B> The actual expenditure on infrastructure is
difficult to predict because, of course, the predominant portion of
infrastructure is financed by the private sector. That is why we
focused on developing our energy policy, so that we can trigger
investments with offshore wind, with nuclear and with various gas
developments. We have laid out our expenditure plans and the proportion
of investment that is capital investment is laid out in the spending
round for this year and for future years. We have shifted, I believe,
£9.3 billion from current spending to capital spending during
the time of this Government. We have put an extra £18
billion into capital investment in Budget 2013. As a result of those
changes, public investment as a share of GDP will be higher on average
between 2010-11 and 2020-21 than it was under the previous Government.
We are trying to shift it into the more productive areas. Transport 
<?notus-xml column=1171?>investment in 2013-14 will be higher than at any point under the

question because in 2010 our plans for capital investment were broadly
similar. Since then, because of our ability to focus on government
efficiencies and the delivery of other programmes more cheaply, we have
been able to transfer, first, the £10 billion to which I
referred into capital spending within our fiscal envelope and, then, a
further £18 billion through 2020-21. These capital expenditure
investments are very focused on the most productive
areas—economic infrastructure—but they are also all fully

Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government welcome
HMIC’s report, which finds that police forces are rising to the
challenge of reduced budgets. Crime is down by more than 10%, victim
satisfaction is up and the proportion of police officers on the front
line has increased. This Government have introduced a range of new
measures to tackle community crimes and have empowered forces to
respond to the needs and priorities of local communities. Decisions on
how neighbourhood policing teams are resourced and deployed are now for
each chief constable and their
PCC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:11:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, that slightly complacent
Answer does not really address the Question I asked. The HMIC said that
neighbourhood policing is the cornerstone of British policing, not
something that it is simply nice to have. As police forces struggle
with a further £2.4 billion of cuts, the remaining police are
spending more time on paperwork and investigations and less in the
community. The Police Federation fears that this leads to crimes not
being prevented or reported. Do the Government value neighbourhood
policing? If they do, how will they deal with this
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:12:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000068"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Stowell of Beeston" PimsId="5900" UID="13072350000640" xid="2111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000640">Baroness
Stowell of Beeston:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said, neighbourhood
policing is indeed very important but it is right that police chiefs,
in consultation with their elected PCCs, decide on the priorities for
their area. Crime is down and satisfaction is up. Another thing that
this Government have done to ensure that the public are able to hold
their police forces to account is to give them greater information
about the performance of their local police forces so that they can
properly assess that performance and hold those police chiefs to
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:13:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000069"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hamwee" PimsId="3737" UID="13072350000641" xid="1741" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000641">Baroness
Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister welcome, as I do,
another item in the report—namely, that forces are making
greater efforts, as they have been doing over the years, but with
variable success, to reduce the amount of patrolling in pairs? Patrols
by single officers are more successful, not least because the public
are not deterred from approaching an officer, rather than thinking that
if there are two officers, they are interrupting a private

important example of how police chiefs are now in a position to
prioritise and make decisions in the way that they see best in order to
meet the Home Secretary’s strategic goal of cutting crime. The
survey shows that the public support some PCSOs patrolling on their own

continued interest in this Bill and for their insightful contributions
to the debate. The Government have listened to the points raised by
noble Lords and have given careful consideration to all aspects of the
Bill. Since Grand Committee, I have met representatives from the
International Chamber of Commerce, and have been working with my
officials to continue to engage with stakeholders to understand their
concerns and alleviate them where possible.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:14:59"></hs_TimeCode> officials

the Government today will reassure both noble Lords and industry
representatives that their concerns are taken very seriously. The

considered
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000085">I am

1 concerns Clause 8, which permits the UK to accede to the Hague

Amendments 2 and 3 relate to Clause 11, concerning the
introduction of an opinions service for designs. These amendments
ensure that the first time that regulations are introduced to implement
the opinions service they, too, must be subject to the
scrutiny and approval of both Houses. Noble Lords will note that the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee recommended that
thereafter the negative resolution procedure should apply. The

also take this opportunity to briefly set out why the Government have
tabled a further minor and technical amendment to Clause 21. As noble
Lords are aware, Clause 21 is intended to simplify the way in which the
UK currently meets its international obligations to extend copyright
protection to works from other countries and their citizens, delivering
clearer information for users. The need arises from the fact that the
UK is a signatory to a number of international copyright conventions
and treaties. This obliges the UK to extend copyright protection to
works and performances created by citizens of other member countries or
to works that originate in other member countries. These obligations
are reciprocal: UK copyright holders benefit from the same protection
in those countries.</hs_para>

11(1) inserts new Section 28A into the Registered Designs Act 1949 to

described in subsection (1)(a) and (b). The new section is purely
enabling in that the whole provision about the new opinions service is
to be set out in negative regulations. Subsections (2), (4), (5) and
(7) set out provisions that the regulations must contain—for
instance, about protecting the registrar from liability in respect of
an opinion and about appeals. BIS explains, in paragraph 13 of the
memorandum, that the intention is that the new opinions service will be
similar to the existing patents opinions service. That service is
provided for in Section 74A of the Patents Act 1977, but it is

service entirely by regulations, and recommended that the affirmative
procedure should apply on the first exercise of the powers under new
Section 28A, which is why we welcome the Government’s decision
in this regard. We also welcome the fact that the Government now make
it clear that Clause 21 incorporates countries signed up to any Act of
the Berne convention by bringing the language of the clause into line

is a real concern that the legislation, as currently drafted, will open
a Pandora’s box of unintended consequences, potentially
discouraging the very kind of legitimate, competitive risk-taking that
policymakers have been keen to encourage as a driver of growth. The
arguments that the Government have deployed until now are deeply
flawed. They say that the treatment of design rights needs to be
brought into line with existing copyright and trade mark legislation;
that there is an anomaly between the application of criminal sanctions
for copyright and trade mark infringement and the lack of equivalent
provisions to stop the copying of registered designs. However, there
are good reasons to treat design right infringements differently from
piracy and counterfeiting. This is because the scope and validity of
registered designs depends, as with patents, on prior art. As a result,
the scope and validity of a design registration are never black and
white but instead are open to a degree of interpretation. Indeed,
relevant prior art may not even come to light until years
later.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13072350000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000180">3.30

suggested that criminal sanctions would provide an additional layer of
protection to small designers, which would spur greater innovation and
investment in new design. While this line of reasoning is superficially
attractive, it ignores the potential unintended consequences of the
draft legislation, specifically the risk of significantly chilling
innovation and competitive design in the wider UK economy. Senior
executives advised us that even a very small risk of criminal action is
likely to discourage the launch of some innovative products in the UK
or significantly delay decisions on product launches, particularly
where a company has to escalate concerns to board level. In the
best-case scenario, this would entail additional costs for the
business; however, it is possible to envisage circumstances in which
executives might choose not to launch products on the UK market. It is
clear that this would have a significant knock-on effect on employment,
growth and consumer choice.</hs_para>

criminal sanctions for design rights are necessary to protect small
designers and to allow them to obtain redress for infringements. The
first point is that most small designers do not register their designs
and instead rely on the unregistered design right. There is a huge
imbalance here, and it  is odd—we will return to this
issue—that the focus  in this clause is only on the
registered design route. Secondly, it is important to recognise that
criminal sections are not the only tool that can be employed to address
some of the very real issues faced by small designers in obtaining
redress for design infringements. For example, the Patents County Court
allows for design cases to be heard under cheaper and more streamlined
procedures than in the High Court. As an alternative to criminal
sanctions, the Government’s strategy could have focused on
promoting access to the PCC so that it could continue to allow
independent and small designers to protect and enforce their ownership
of their products’ design.</hs_para>

reasons to avoid introducing highly technical cases into the criminal
court system. Most criminal judges lack the relevant expertise and
evidence that is required properly to evaluate infringement claims. It
is instructive in this case that the Government chose to exclude
registered designs from the small claims track of the PCC last year
because, as they said, disputes are likely to involve more complex
issues.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072350000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000102">There
is another danger: the risk of exposing small and independent designers
themselves to criminal prosecutions. Small companies will be less able
to afford expensive prior-art searches and legal support, leading to a
greater risk of wrongful conviction. Cases of this kind would be likely
to have a seriously chilling effect on the UK’s design industry.
UK enforcement agents would be compromised by the drain on resources
that would inevitably arise from extending criminal sanctions to the UK
design frameworks.</hs_para>

Bill will provide a competitive boost to the UK design industry, but
the introduction of criminal sanctions would have far-reaching
unintended consequences for the British business environment. The
uncertainty that would be created by criminal measures will discourage
large multinational companies from investing in and commissioning
design in the UK, given the legal risks. This deterrent to inward
investment in UK design may not only result in an innovation drought
but threaten the future employability of UK designers. It is telling
that no other leading common-law jurisdictions, such as the USA,
Australia, New Zealand or India, have introduced criminal measures for
design infringements.</hs_para>

reservations, we accept that criminal sanctions could play a part in
the fight against counterfeiting. We have therefore tried in
Amendment 4 to raise the bar to criminal proceedings by
making it clear that they would be commenced only if it was clear
beyond reasonable doubt that the action taken had been calculated and
motivated by a wish to exploit the original registered design. We feel
strongly about this issue, and believe that not only have the
Government failed to make their case on this point but that introducing
new criminal penalties should be the very last resort, and one on which
Parliament should expressly give an opinion—if necessary, by
voting.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072350000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000105">It

was intended to ensure the creation of an independent design so as to
avoid infringement was erroneously too prescriptive. We suggest,
therefore, that the offence should be limited to cases where a person
deliberately copies a registered design. I accept that the
phrasing—using the word “deliberately”—may
not be the best way of inserting that sensibility, but I hope that the
Minister will give serious consideration to the concerns that we have
expressed here and perhaps bring forward a more suitable phrasing at
Third Reading.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, in Grand Committee we had
some detailed debates about the introduction of criminal sanctions for
the deliberate copying of a registered design. This is a finely
balanced issue, and concerns were raised by a number of noble Lords.
On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:39:58"></hs_TimeCode> the one hand,
some felt that criminal sanctions should not be introduced as the
offence may inadvertently capture innocent infringement. On the other
hand, some noble Lords agreed that the offence was necessary, and
indeed some felt that its scope should be extended further.</hs_para>

today’s debate. However, as we consider this particular group of
amendments, I would like to speak first to government amendment 7 in
order to allay some of the concerns that noble Lords have expressed
regarding the application of the offence. This amendment to Clause 13
sets out more precisely the scope of the term “use”
within the context of business activities. The amendment will further
focus the offence with the aim of ensuring that innocent infringement
will not be
captured.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000117">Before
I comment further on this amendment, I remind noble Lords of the
purpose of this clause. As your Lordships know, Clause 13 introduces a
criminal sanction for the copying of a registered design. This will
create a more coherent approach to the protection and enforcement of
designs, trade marks and copyright in the UK, and should help to reduce
the scale of blatant copying of registered designs by acting as a
deterrent. Under the clause, it will be an offence to deliberately copy
a registered design without the consent of its owner. It will also be
an offence to knowingly market, import, export, stock or use the design
in the course of business
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000118">Concerns

the offence has been drafted to require an element of active knowledge
in order to be found guilty, it should be the case that accidental use
will  not be caught. However, the Government accept there may
be cases where incidental use could conceivably come within the scope
of the offence. For example, a business may lease a vending machine,
which is a copy of a registered design, for use by its employees. This
is completely ancillary to its main business but some have suggested
that because the business is “using” the machine, a
responsible person within that business who knew the machine was copied
but still tendered its lease would be liable for the offence. The
Government 
<?notus-xml column=1183?>believe that, in practice, such cases should not attract the criminal
offence. This is because the use of the registered design in this case
would be ancillary to the main purpose of the
business.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072350000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000119">I
reassure noble Lords that the Government have listened carefully to
their concerns, and believe that this amendment is the right way to
clarify the detail of the offence. By qualifying the word
“use”, it will ensure that the mere incidental use of a
copy of a registered design in the course of business will not be
subject to criminal proceedings.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072350000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000120">Amendment 4 in the
names of the noble Lords, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara and Lord Young of
Norwood Green, would add a qualification to proposed new Section
35ZA(1)(a) in Clause 13. The noble Lords have set out their position on
this amendment. This would mean a person would attract the criminal
offence contained in Clause 13 only if an act of copying was undertaken
deliberately. The Government are of the opinion that
“copying” refers to a deliberate “taking”
of the design in question. In crafting the offence of registered design
copying, the Government worked hard to ensure that it caught only cases
of intentional and deliberate copying. For example, the existing
test for whether, in civil law, design is
infringed, is to ask whether the product creates a “different
overall impression” on an “informed user”. This
was rejected for the proposed criminal offence because it left too
considerable a margin for subjective judgment within a criminal case.
The offence was purposefully drawn to be narrower than civil
infringement, and while it of course remains a subset of such
infringement, it will not be used in cases where there has been no
blatant copying of a design. This ensures that designers can continue
to be legitimately inspired by, and innovate around, existing designs
without fear of their actions being caught by criminal
sanctions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:45:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072350000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000181">3.45

Government do not think it is necessary to specify that the act of
copying is done deliberately, because the act of copying by its very
definition requires an active choice to have been made; that is to say,
a deliberate choice. Or, to put it another way, if a person comes up
with a design from independent and objective means then, by definition,
they cannot have copied it. Furthermore, the offence requires the
person to know, or have reason to believe, that the design they have
copied is a registered design. This is a high standard to achieve and
will capture only acts which have been carried out with
positive—that is to say, deliberate—intent. In view of
this, the Government believe that it is unnecessary to further qualify
that an act of copying must be carried out deliberately. To briefly
summarise my point, this amendment would insert an element of tautology
into the clause. As such, I suggest to noble Lords that it is
unnecessary.</hs_para>

introduce an additional requirement to the criminal sanction for
registered design copying. Broadly, a defendant would have to be found
guilty of civil infringement before they could be charged with the
criminal offence of design copying. I will reiterate why the Government
are seeking to introduce  
<?notus-xml column=1184?>criminal sanctions in the first place. Many businesses in the design
sector do not believe that the civil courts are a viable option when it
comes to protecting their rights as they find the cost of court action
prohibitive. They also argue that those who take their designs use
whatever means they can to delay proceedings when they are initiated,
increasing the costs for the smaller party in the hope that they will
be forced to give up or even go out of business.</hs_para>

particular, stakeholders tell us that deliberate copiers of designs
also use the fear of losing in court as a weapon against design owners.
It is also their belief, as set out during the consultation process
that preceded the introduction of the Bill, that a criminal sanction
would act as a deterrent against those who copied their designs. The
amendment would, therefore, in reality limit access to the criminal
offence from precisely those small businesses that were most vocal in
pressing for the offence, since they would be required to undertake the
civil procedure first. The amendment would also set designs apart from
other types of intellectual property to which a criminal sanction
provision applies. For example, the offences that apply to trade mark
and copyright infringement do not provide in the relevant legislation
that the civil route must be exhausted prior to the commencement of
criminal proceedings. There are good reasons for this, which relate to
the differences between criminal and civil law.</hs_para>

would fetter the prosecuting authorities’ ability to act when
there is the potential for public harm, such as in clear cases of
counterfeiting. It is worth remembering that the objective of criminal
law is to punish and protect society as a whole rather than to provide
redress for the individual. Secondly, the amendment requires there to
be a verdict through the civil procedure, which usually takes from 12
to 24 months, and for the appeal route to be exhausted.
Prosecuting authorities would have to wait until this process was
complete before charging an individual, who could be engaging in
practices that harm designers and society as a whole. In both cases
this would undermine the impact of the criminal offence and does not
seem to be in the public interest. Nor would it seem to be in the
interests of justice to require the additional hurdle of proving civil
infringement before criminal proceedings could
begin.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000125">Amendment
6 would effectively extend the defences relating to infringement which
apply in relation to criminal sanctions. The amendment would mean that
someone who had sufficient reason to believe that their activity was
not infringing would not be guilty of a criminal offence. I understand
that noble Lords are concerned with the potential chilling effect that
the criminal sanction may have, as the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson,
mentioned, and will recall that we had a very good debate on these
matters in Grand Committee. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, has

sanctions,

previously, the Government were mindful of this issue in constructing
the offence. They therefore built in several requirements which must be
fulfilled before a criminal act can be considered to have taken place.
These requirements include that copying—in other words, a
considered act—must take place, and therefore
“accidental” or independent activity will not be caught.
This also shows why Amendment 4, to which I have already
spoken, is not
necessary.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072350000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000127">The
requirements also include having knowledge or reason to believe that
the design in question was registered. Therefore, for example,
retailers who do business in good faith with a third party which has
itself wilfully copied somebody else’s design, will not fall
foul of the sanction provided that they do not know, or have reason to
believe, that the design is registered. The criminal sanction also
incorporates specific defences. Again, these are intended to eliminate
any likelihood of a chilling effect, and to prevent those who have
acted in a decent manner being unfairly caught by the
offence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000128">There
are two specific defences. One relates to infringement, which is

I said in Committee, the Government wanted to consider this point
further, and have consequently done so. Although the liability of

In addition, on conviction, any fine imposed on a partnership will be
paid out of the partnership’s assets. This will broadly reflect
the provision of the Trade Marks Act 1994, and will be consistent with

introduction of criminal sanctions. The noble Lord also asked for
criminal sanctions to be replaced by improved access to the PCC. The
Government recognise that improving access to the PCC is certainly also
important. For example, the UK Government’s series of reforms in
the patent county court have simplified and streamlined procedures. The
introduction of a small-claims track means that low-value claims
relating to unregistered designs can be dealt with quickly, informally
and cheaply. It ensures that SMEs in particular are not deterred from
innovation by the potential costs of litigation to safeguard their
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000133">The
noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, raised the question of whether small design
businesses would be intimidated. The Government do not believe that
criminal sanctions will lead to small designers being intimidated by
larger businesses. The CPS has powers to intervene in cases where a

to answer, or where the public interest factors against the prosecution

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> I begin by thanking the Minister
for his very full reply and his customary courtesy in dealing with all
the points, for which I am most grateful. He sets a high standard in
this House. However, let us be clear: we are talking about
approximately 4,000 designs which are registered  each year at
the Intellectual Property Office and  some 350,000 designers
who suggest that about 18,000 unregistered designs are lodged with the
asset database, so this is a very small proportion
of the designs with which we are involved. We are probably arguing
around a very narrow point but it is an important one. I want to come
back to it, but before I do so I thank the Minister for his comments
about Amendments 7 and 8, both of which we welcome, and which have gone
a long way to answering points raised in Committee, for which we are
grateful to
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:57:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

left with is the pleasing word “bafflement” which invaded
the otherwise normally sane and sober noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. I
am delighted to have struck a blow for those who believe in bafflement.
However, I must say that I am not at all baffled by this. The situation
is very clear: we are against criminalisation of this aspect of the
design world. We accept that there may be a case for having as a very
last stop a criminalisation process which would enable those who are
constantly engaging in this sort of behaviour, or are doing so on such
a scale, to be given appropriate penalties. The issue is whether or not
the clause that we are debating has sufficient safeguards. My argument
in Committee and today was that the Minister, on behalf of the
Government, did not adequately defend why it was necessary to move from
a very effective civil situation to criminalisation. However, I accept
that it is important to consider whether criminalisation would help the
design community. That is the question we have to
resolve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:58:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000137">It
is interesting that in his response in Committee and today, the
Minister kept saying that these criminal measures would apply only to
deliberate acts. I think he is using the mens rea argument, which is
that if somebody has gone to the point of copying, by definition it
must be intentional and deliberate. However, when discussing that, he
used the word “deliberate”, which is what I sought to
include in the Bill. Therefore, I am baffled in the sense that I do not
understand why it is possible to talk about a criminalisation which is
restricted to those who are deliberately engaging in this act, but not
accept that it would be helpful to have that in the Bill. That is the
important
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:59:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072350000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000138">If
we are talking about people who are blatantly ripping off individual
designers, taking their designs, using them and obtaining financial
reward from them without having paid for a licence, obviously there is
a point where that has to become a criminal act. I am prepared to go
along with that but the bar has to be set very high. I do not believe
that it has been set high enough in the present wording. Therefore, I
would like to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13072350000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072350000182">3.58

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend the Minister
correctly said that later in the proceedings we would be coming to the
issue of criminal penalties for infringement of unregistered design.
This is a rerun of an amendment that I moved in Grand Committee to
provide that criminal sanctions would also apply to the deliberate
infringement of unregistered designs. As I explained in Grand
Committee, design is of key importance to the UK economy. However, the
great majority of designers rely on unregistered rights, a point that
has already been made eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. The
introduction of criminal sanctions for the deliberate infringement of
registered designs is a progressive step, but for most lone and micro
designers the cost of registering every iteration of a design would be
prohibitive. The extension of criminal sanctions to unregistered design
rights for the majority of UK designers would be a deterrent to
persistent copying in much the same way as it is for copyright and
trademark
infringement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:13:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

been available for copyright infringement since 1862 and for trademark
infringement since 1994. Criminal prosecutions have been used
sparingly, sensibly and appropriately. Persistently copying designs,
however, is not a criminal offence at all, which is anomalous.
Persistently copying a two-dimensional drawing of a design or a design
document can give rise to criminal liability under Section 107 of the
CDPA, but when this two-dimensional work is converted into a 3D design,
unless it is protected as a work of artistic craftsmanship, which we
have previously discussed on the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act,
copying that 3D version would not be a criminal offence. Nearly all
designs, however, are copied from the 3D 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>original, not the 2D
drawings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:14:47"></hs_TimeCode>. How do

provision should be exactly parallel to that for copyright. I would say
that the Minister should have used these arguments in the copyright
case to change that provision so that it was in line with the
principles in this Bill—because I think that copyright is
probably overprotected—but that is a different argument.
However, I certainly think that the arrangements should be the same. At
some time in the future we can rationalise, if we need to, the two
arrangements so that they move together in the same direction. With the
advent of 3D printing it is now quite possible easily to make a
three-dimensional copy at not a huge cost, so I do not see the
rationale for distinguishing 2D from 3D copying. 3D copies were not
possible until very recently. Logically, the two principles should be
aligned, as the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, has just stated.
Whether we think that this should be dealt with differently, in
copyright or under this arrangement, is another
matter.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_23_PT_1/778DF56F24D6C6B65C0F1FCB7BD057FE6D559C72" __version__="1.16"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 July 2013">Tuesday,

hear how the Minister will respond. The noble Lord made a very good
case for taking the situation that we have currently, under which
copying registered designs will be subject to criminal penalties, and
asking why the very large number of unregistered designs that are
lodged in a different register from the registered designs—with
the IPO—cannot be given a similar sort of protection. I think

would be of having a register of unregistered designs, even if that is
perhaps a contradiction in terms. If it was possible to have within the
government machinery some system that allowed a way to evidence the
existence of the design right, and document its existence on a
particular date, that would go some way to giving us certainty about
cases, whether they were criminal or not, affecting the unregistered

moved by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, would be to extend the
proposed criminal sanctions to unregistered design rights. I thank my
noble friend once again for presenting the Government with his strong
views on unregistered design right protection. I can assure him that
the Government are absolutely convinced of the value of the
unregistered right and are very aware of its role in protecting small
design businesses. That is why, following consultation, the UK right
and its current term of protection was retained in the face of calls by
some to remove it as a means of simplifying design law.</hs_para>

a very successful design industry and we tinker with the success of the
industry at our peril. I am particularly concerned to ensure 
that any changes proposed in the Bill do not act as an additional
burden on industry but enhance its accomplishments. As with all
intellectual property systems, there is a delicate equilibrium between
a reasonable return for creators and, on the other hand, 
<?notus-xml column=1196?>access to the creation so that competitors can shape future innovation.
This is the balance the Government have to be mindful of in the changes
proposed. There is a real fear that extending criminal sanctions to
unregistered rights will distort this balance for the following
reasons.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072351000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072351000024">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>,
the existence of the register represents a public database, which can
be searched with relative ease. Third parties can quickly assess what
has been registered and what has not. This means that they can take due
notice of designs protected by registration with some degree of
certainty. In particular, they will know accurately when it will be
possible to copy a design with no degree of legal risk. With
unregistered designs, there is the problem of not knowing exactly when
the design right came into existence and the duration of its
protection. This means that it is more difficult for third parties to
discover when they can legally copy or exploit a design. Where
information about the design of an article is limited but copying it
attracts a criminal sanction, it is entirely possible that industry
will become risk-averse. As I stated in Grand Committee, against the
background of a threat of a criminal conviction, third parties are more
likely to wait longer than necessary to be sure that a design is in the
public domain before building on it, therefore extending the
unregistered design right beyond its term and delaying potential
innovation.</hs_para>

will give your Lordships an example. A furniture manufacturer is aware
of a rival’s design that is successful in the marketplace and
knows that it is not protected by registration. That is easily
discovered by a swift inspection of the registry. He is also aware that
the unregistered design right is now protected by a criminal sanction.
The manufacturer will have no ready knowledge of when the item was
first protected—for example, when it was in a design document,
made into an article or first marketed. These all affect the term of
protection. To be on the safe side, it is likely that the manufacturer
will avoid copying or even engaging in reasonable follow-on innovation
until he is certain that the product is out of its term of protection.
With registered designs, any potential chilling effect is much reduced
by the certainty of facts on duration, scope of protection and
ownership, which registration
creates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:27:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072351000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072351000026">Secondly,
the nature of the UK unregistered right magnifies the uncertainty
problem. Unregistered right in an article can relate not only to the
overall design but to the individual elements of the design. The
unregistered design right can therefore be seen as a basket of
individual rights. For example, a kettle may have design protection in
its overall shape and configuration but also in its individual parts,
such as the spout, the handle and the lid. The kettle may be one of a
series of kettles, so different design components may have different
timelines of protection. The handle may have 10 years of protection to
run because it is new, the spout may have three years as it was used in
an earlier version of the kettle, and the lid may be  out of
protection because it is an old design. None of this information will
be readily available to a business which wants to use the design or
aspects of the design itself. This creates a cumulative uncertainty
about the rights, which is not shared where a design appears on the
public

effect is likely to be more serious in particular industries. Some
designers, such as those in the fashion trade, thrive on novelty, speed
of change, imitation, and rapid turnover of seasonal ranges. It is in
these industries where the Government have real concerns that
criminalisation of unregistered designs, which are often relied on,
would have a freezing

inhibiting effect on innovation that has been identified is likely to
be a particular problem in relation to functional designs, which the UK
unregistered right also protects. This problem does not apply to

raises a number of questions. For example, would an official
government-run unregistered designs database be compulsory for

warrant further thought. However, the Government do not believe that it
is wise to legislate at this stage without more consideration,
particularly given the ways in which the UK IPO is already working hard
to ensure that designers are as informed as possible when making
business decisions 
<?notus-xml column=1198?>about their intellectual property. For example, the IPO will provide
training to the Design Council’s business advisers, to help
understand IP and the value of design rights, and to direct SMEs
towards the audit programme. On that basis, I am not persuaded of the
need for the noble Lord’s Amendment 20.</hs_para>

copyright protection vesting in the “work” that consists
of a design drawing, and there is no direct protection of the 2D
representation of the design per se. The protection arises as a
by-product of the copyright in the work. As noble Lords will know,
copyright will protect against the reproduction of the drawing where
the defendant knows or has reason to believe that the reproduction is

about magnifying the uncertainty where you have different elements

more risk-averse, in many ways people in the fashion industry would

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendments in this group
relate to the unified patent court. Amendment 10, tabled by the noble
Lords, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara and Lord Young of Norwood Green,
seeks to ensure that the Secretary of State will consider setting up
separate local divisions of the unified patent court in three parts of
the UK should there be enough case load to justify more than one local
division. As I highlighted in Committee, ensuring local access to
justice is a key element of the 
<?notus-xml column=1201?>unified patent court. That is why the agreement
makes provisions for local divisions. The agreement does not oblige
participating states to host a local division, which can be set up and
disbanded upon
request.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072358000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072358000012">It is
important that the unified patent court serves the needs of businesses
throughout the United Kingdom and the Government are committed to
ensuring that all areas of the United Kingdom will have access to the
court. I can assure noble Lords that the Government are already giving
careful consideration to the number and location of local divisions
that may be hosted in the UK. I cannot say at this time exactly how
many local divisions the UK may host because it is not yet clear
whether there will be enough cases to justify having more than one
local division. The reason for this uncertainty is that there is no
common agreement among the participating states on how the number of
cases in each jurisdiction will be counted. It is important that a
consistent approach is taken to assessing the case load in different
countries. The issue will be decided by the participating states before
the court comes into
being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072358000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072358000013">While
it is not possible to say for certain how many local divisions may be
hosted in the UK, I can give noble Lords every assurance that the
Government are open to locating local divisions in different parts of
the UK. The Government are working closely with the devolved
Administrations and the court services in Scotland and Northern Ireland
as well as England and Wales to ensure that the needs of businesses
throughout the United Kingdom are taken into account. Noble Lords may
be also interested to know that the Intellectual Property Office, in
partnership with the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys and the IP
Federation, is running a series of stakeholder events about the unified
patent court rules in early September. One of these events will be
hosted in Edinburgh. Given that the issue of UK-based local divisions
is already under consideration, it is neither necessary nor appropriate
to prescribe in primary legislation their number and
locations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072358000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072358000014">I
now turn to government Amendment 11. This technical amendment to Clause
16 is intended to provide certainty that the Government will
be able to establish fully the unified patent court. The amendment
introduces new Section 88B into the Patents Act 1977. It does not
extend the scope of the power conferred by Section 88A of
that Act. The necessity of tabling an amendment to this clause has only
recently come to light as a result of the ongoing legal analysis being
conducted as part of the implementation process. That analysis has
identified a potential uncertainty which could, if not addressed now,
result in a significant delay in bringing the unified patent court into

patent court agreement effectively sets up a new international
organisation, part of which will be based in the United Kingdom. It is
usual that any agreement which sets up an international organisation
would include limited provisions as necessary for the fulfilment of
that organisation’s purpose. The unified patent court agreement
does not make specific provisions for all the necessary privileges and
immunities that are likely to be required for the
court to fulfil its function. 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>For example, there are no provisions relating to the
terms and conditions of staff other than the judges of the court. As a
consequence, it is likely that the UK and the other participating
states will need to finalise a further set of detailed provisions on

an agreement would be given effect in UK law using an order under the
International Organisations Act 1968. However, due to the way the
unified patent court agreement is drafted, it is not clear
that the International Organisations Act 1968 applies to the court. To
avoid any doubt, it is prudent that we make this provision in primary
legislation now in order to clarify that the International
Organisations Act will apply to the unified patent court. A similar
approach was taken to give effect in the UK to the International
Tribunal for the Law of the Sea.</hs_para>

Intellectual property can be a very valuable thing. It creates monopoly

in relation to policy on intellectual property and, indeed, on specific
decisions. Officials working in this area effectively have the power to
enrich other people, and in that respect they are rather like planning
officers. It seems to me that procedures relating to intellectual

nothing happened for three years until scandals forced the Government

Secretaries and the chief executive of the IPO have met is palpably
inadequate. The lobbying consultancies sell their services on the basis
that they know how to get to the officials who are formulating policy
options and briefing Ministers. There is much agitation in the media
about the lobbying of politicians, but the lobbying of officials is at
least equally important. Therefore, my amendment would require much
fuller transparency than the Minister has so far been willing to

lobbying very seriously. This is the most transparent Government ever.
I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Howarth, while not necessarily
agreeing with that, certainly recognised it in his speech. We are the

is to be introduced by Clause 20, to include information on approaches

I committed to publish proactively a list of all meetings between the
chief executive of the IPO and external organisations. This
demonstrates the Government’s very real commitment to
transparency. I also remind the noble Lord that the IPO responds to
requests made by Parliamentary Question and through the Freedom of
Information Act. Since 1 July 2012, the IPO has received 184 FoI

publication of the level of information required by the amendment would
be highly resource-intensive. It would mean the documentation of
contact between external parties and some 1,000 IPO staff.
In the previous financial year, the IPO received
41,150 applications for trade marks and 22,818 patent
applications. Representations on these applications would be covered by
the amendment. Such a system would therefore be a highly bureaucratic
addition to many of the IPO’s statutory functions concerning the
administration of IP rights and applications, which quite properly
involve receiving many tens of thousands of representations from the
public concerning their IP. The vast majority of such contact would be
of no significance or interest to others. Furthermore, the amendment
would require in some cases a duplication of the work already carried
out in relation to transparency and under the draft lobbying
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072358000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0001.htm#13072358000039">The
Government’s approach therefore represents a proportionate
response to legitimate concerns about the influence of external
organisations on policy development. A balance needs to be struck
between the need for transparency and the resources required to
collect, maintain and, indeed, read through potentially large amounts
of information. My points about the Government’s approach
generally in this area, when taken with the additional reporting duty
in Clause 20 and the further commitment I made in Grand Committee with
respect to IPO meetings with external organisations, should, I believe,
reassure noble Lords about just how much the Government are

will be possible for the Government to hold their present line. Of

the practice of the IPO, as of the business department, to take minutes

easier 
<?notus-xml column=1208?>for potential users to find them by ensuring that they include key

an annual report. Policy on intellectual property is arcane and is
vigorously contested among specialists and between special interests.
It is very important—its effects are far-reaching—yet it
is not well understood, either by Parliament or the public. I therefore
hope that the annual report will be more ambitious than is
suggested by the terms of the clause in the Bill. I want it to range
rather more widely to help Parliament and the public better understand
the major policy issues and the principles which animate the Government

it that the role of government is to judge the balance of the public
interest in relation to intellectual property between affording

course we need to protect intellectual property in certain

is a strong public interest in 
<?notus-xml column=1209?>that—but not invariably. It should not be axiomatic that we grant
more and more intellectual property rights. Applications should be
judged on their merits. The Intellectual Property Office and the
Government should not be negative but should be sceptical about
applications, and should all the time be ready to question the
consensus. While it is desirable to achieve an alignment of
international regimes, for example through agreements at European Union
level, it is important not to rest on the achievement of those
agreements. As the noble Viscount reminded us, consistency is not

property is a form of monopoly. It leads to some rigging of the market

carry with them inefficiencies and opportunity costs. Others are
restrained from accessing or exploiting new knowledge as early as they
might do. Price competition is postponed. The holders of intellectual
property, being protected, may become complacent and less innovative.
That would be an ironic outcome of a policy intended to promote
innovation. The incumbent may try to use monopoly power to crush rivals

is needed to incentivise. Yet the tendency of policy has been to
lengthen protection, and Governments have been prone to brag about the
number of patents that are held in the UK, as if it was a measure of
success. It is a measure of inventiveness, but it is also an index of
economic rigidities. The Government should not simply equate maximising

Government’s vision should not just be of what is in the narrow
interest of the United Kingdom. They should not take the view
“my country right or wrong” in relation to intellectual

move towards a world with a population of perhaps
10 billion people and with vast migrations, it will be
enormously in the interests of the United Kingdom that the poorer
peoples of the world should be able to make rapid progress in
knowledge, education and the growth of their economies. Judgments about
intellectual property policy need to be economically farsighted,
humane, ethical and wise. They will be very difficult indeed
to make in, for example, the burgeoning field of the life
sciences and where bioethical issues are at stake. I very much welcome
the judgment by the US Supreme Court in relation to Myriad Genetics.
However, as the noble Lord reminded us in Committee, it poses a
significant challenge to the European Union. The EU biotechnology
patents directive may need to be reconsidered in the light of

effect of similar packaging could not be isolated from other influences

free-riding on the brand’s hard-won reputation. The copy is
essentially inferring that the product is similar in every respect.
Under comparative advertising rules, such a claim would not be
permitted as it is neither objective nor verifiable. Were such a
message to be conveyed through words in an advertisement, the
advertisement would be banned. Why should the principle differ when the
product packaging is the medium, especially as such imagery conveys the
false message far more

is certainly true that, as the noble Lord said, lookalikes are to a
large extent already unlawful in the United Kingdom because they are
contrary to a variety of measures introduced by previous
Governments—in particular, the Consumer Protection from Unfair
Trading Regulations 2008. The point that he made—and I think
that it is important—is that these regulations are of little
effect if the responsible authorities, such as trading standards, do
not have the resources to take action against those breaching the
regulations. Therefore, the point that the noble Lord makes, and I
support it, is that we need a bit more detail from the Minister when he

the Government recognise the importance of brands. In recent years the
Government have held two brands conferences and established the Brands
Industry Forum—a vehicle for brand owners to discuss directly
with the Government the policy issues that matter to them. The research
on lookalike packaging, which I spoke about when we discussed this
issue during Grand Committee, was commissioned by the Government in
response to concerns raised by brand owners. This demonstrates that the
Government are receptive to the needs of brand owners and willing to
explore their concerns. However, we also have a duty to the public and
wider economy. It is on this basis that the Government will be
resisting the amendment. We consider that it would impact on
competition and risk damaging future growth.</hs_para>

out the key issues in more detail. First, as I said during Committee,
protection for brands already exists through the IP rights of trade
marks and registered designs, and through the tort of passing off. A
trade mark is a very powerful monopoly right—the most important
identifying feature for any brand. It can last in perpetuity. The first
ever trade mark registered in the UK, the Bass red triangle and motif,
is still in use nearly 130 years later. If packaging is distinctive, it
can be protected as a trade
mark.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000008">Secondly,
registered design rights protect the appearance of a product if it is
novel, has individual character and is not dictated by technical
function, which I hope my noble friend agrees would be necessary
elements of distinctive packaging. Thirdly, passing off protects one
trader’s goods from being represented as those of another. An
act of passing off requires existing good will in the goods, a
misrepresentation causing confusion as to the origin of the goods and
likely damage to the good will from this misrepresentation. These three
aspects address the issues that lookalike packaging is suggested to
cause, so it is logical that redress is sought through this existing
mechanism.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072366000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000100">5.45

is an effective remedy when a competitor’s packaging has strayed
too close to an existing brand. An example is the Jif lemon case, where
highly distinctive packaging in the form of a plastic lemon was found
to indicate that specific brand of lemon juice to consumers. More
subtle imitation resulted in passing off in United Biscuits v Asda.
This case, which noble Lords may remember, concerned Puffin and Penguin
biscuits. The High Court found that packaging depicting seabirds of
similar physical appearance, and with names that were not very
different, amounted to passing off. More recently, the threat of a
passing off-action was used by Diageo to settle a dispute surrounding
its Pimm’s brand.</hs_para>

securing the evidence for a passing-off action is not always a
straightforward exercise—a point made by my noble friend Lord
Clement-Jones. However, from the successful cases that I have cited, it
is clear that it is possible to obtain redress. It is right, however,
that the courts set a testing evidential burden because the remedy is
so powerful. On this basis, I hope that my noble friend will agree that
the answer cannot be to side-step this evidential burden by creating a
new right that is less rigorous.</hs_para>

is founded on the difficulty encountered in defining a lookalike
product. Lookalikes are said to mimic the look and feel of the branded
product on a wide range of features such as colour, shape, wording,
logos, iconography and layout. The question is: how many features have
to be present or how strong do they have to be to form a lookalike?
This can often be a subjective judgment—something that brand
owners admitted when speaking to the researchers who conducted the

illustrates the uncertainty inherent in the identification of
lookalikes. Translating this into statute is likely to create a right
that is unfocused and too widely drawn. The challenge has
always been to find a remedy that is effective but also targeted, and I
do not believe that the amendment would meet these
requirements. It would create an ill-defined property
right—neither a trade mark, copyright nor a
registered design but appropriating elements of them all. The creation
of such an all-encompassing right, if it were deemed to be desirable,
would require extensive consultation with industry, given its potential
impact. However, even without a consultation, it is a reasonable
assumption that requiring businesses to add this opaque assessment to
product development would lead to increased costs, deterring
investment. The clear risk is that such a broad right would create
anti-competitive monopolies for brands.</hs_para>

concerns the currently available evidence surrounding lookalikes. It
does not point to a clear course of action. Much research has been
carried out but the economic impact of lookalikes remains unclear.
There is some evidence of consumer benefit through increased
innovation, greater choice and multiple price points, but balanced
against this is a slight suggestion that brand owners may
suffer lost sales, although the picture is mixed. Furthermore, while
brand owners may incur increased research and development costs, they
benefit from the resultant innovation. It is therefore difficult to
conclude that lookalikes harm the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000016">I

be taken as an indication that we do not have a real and continued

in the absence of a definitive answer, it is right that the Government
maintain the search for an appropriate policy response. My noble friend

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend the
Minister for a very careful and well crafted reply, which had resonance
in a number of areas. I particularly appreciated him saying that he and
his officials were committed to protecting IP, that the Government are
very receptive to the interests of brand owners, and that he
had a real interest in discussions with brand owners and in continuing
that dialogue. That is very important. I do not think that we are going
to get very far in debating equivocal versus unequivocal—that
seems to be a tomahto versus tomayto-type debate—but it will no
doubt continue nevertheless. That continuing discussion and dialogue is
extremely important and the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, put his finger
on it when he said that it could well be that enforcement of the CPRs
is absolutely at the root of this. They are not being enforced
currently. It may well be that there are some equivalent remedies to
the comparative advertising rules that the Minister mentioned and I
very much hope that, whichever way it goes, that continuing dialogue
bears fruit. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the

current regulatory regime governing the relationship between PSB
channels and TV platforms rests on three assumptions: that some of the
analogue terrestrial value enjoyed by the PSBs should be used to
encourage platform competition in the UK; that platforms effectively
offer audiences to commercial PSBs to sell to advertisers; and that
platforms do not inhibit the ability of commercial PSBs to exploit
content, originally delivered free to air, in secondary
markets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000029">The
first assumption no longer holds—there is no analogue spectrum
and there is a highly successful and well resourced pay-TV platform in
the UK. Increasingly, however, the second and third assumptions are
also in jeopardy, in particular as a result of the rise of
subscription-based, high-capacity personal video recorders. PVRs are
now in the vast majority of Sky and Virgin households and are key to
both platforms’ proposition to consumers. PVRs are rented or
sold by the main pay-TV platforms to their subscribers as added-value
services and enable pay-TV platform customers to record and
keep copies of very significant amounts of commercial PSB content. They
also allow viewers to skip the advertising in such content, as they are
doing in increasing volumes, particularly in genres such as
drama.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000030">For
example, the Sky+HD 2TB box is now capable of recording the entire ITV
peak-time schedule for 11 months of the year, and storage
space is expanding exponentially. The concern is not about PVRs per
se—they are a great enhancement to consumer choice—but
rather the fact that the regulatory regime now allows platform
operators to extract further value from PSB content, which is supplied
either for free or, worse still, following payment to the platform
operator in the first place. The PSBs are not able to capture any of
this value by renegotiating the original terms of supply to the
platform, as a result of the following components of the current
regulatory regime: Section 73, which this amendment attempts
to deal with; the Ofcom-regulated technical platform services regime,
under which PSBs have to provide content for free and have
to pay several million pounds to a platform operator for the technical
platform services that enable viewers to receive the PSB channels; and
thirdly, the time-shifting exception to copyright that allows customers
to record and keep TV content. Around 10% of all viewing is now
time-shifted, which is nearly five times greater than the highest level
of time-shifting in the VCR era. PSB content is the most
time-shifted—drama in particular, where levels of time-shifting
and advertising-skipping are far higher.</hs_para>

want to deal with some of the arguments made in Committee. The first is
that repealing Section 73 would unbalance a delicate equilibrium in the
UK broadcasting market. The market is evolving very rapidly as
technology changes and convergence continues. In no sense is the UK
market in equilibrium, whether technologically or economically. The
second argument is that Section 73 ensures that consumers who have
already paid for PSB content through the licence fee or indirect
taxation can access this content through a cable platform at no
additional cost. This is not the case for ITV, Five and, arguably,
Channel 4. These are commercial channels with no government funding.
The third argument is that Section 73 continues to provide cable
subscribers with access to the PSB channels without their having to pay
twice. Cable subscribers would not have to pay twice for ITV and
Channel 4. As I have described, they do not have to pay even once at
the moment. Watching advertisements is really the way that they pay,
and that is being undermined by
subscription<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:01:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000032">A
further argument is that the broader channel-platform relationship
should be on a level playing field —that is, zero fees either
way. Rather than repealing Section 73, a clause should be drafted to
ensure zero fees either way. This surely would not be the right
outcome. If platforms increasingly enable consumers to skip
advertisements, extracting more value from channels and reducing the
size of the secondary market for programme rights via subscription
PVRs, such as Virgin’s TiVo and Sky+, it will become impossible
for the free-to-air channels to sustain investment in high-value
content such as
drama<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:02:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000033">The
penultimate argument is that repealing Section 73 would be
contrary to the interests of 4 million cable customers who access PSB
content, at no cost to those broadcasters, through cable platforms.
There is an increasing cost to broadcasters as the TV market continues
to evolve. Subscription PVRs generate content for platforms and extract
increasing value from FTA content, reducing the opportunity for PSB
channels in secondary content markets.</hs_para>

that the Government believe that Section 73, properly interpreted, is
consistent with EU law. In that case, the UK Government are
substituting what they think is the proper interpretation of Section 73
for that of the UK High Court. It was the UK court’s
interpretation of Section 73 that the European Commission suggested was
in breach of the UK’s obligation under the 2001 copyright
directive. Therefore, I am unclear what the words “proper
interpretation” might mean. The fact is that the European Court
of Justice did not comment on compatibility in its recent judgment
because the UK court did not agree to the request by the
broadcasters to refer the question to the European Court of
Justice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:03:58"></hs_TimeCode> in the

Stevenson of Balmacara:</Member></B> My Lords, despite the points made
by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, Section 73 of the CDPA 1988 is
but one component of a complex web of regulations that provides
equilibrium in the UK broadcasting market. It is true that
Section 73 is relatively old, created when the cable
industry was in its infancy. It is also true that the cable industry is
in a different position now. I certainly acknowledge that the catch-up
TV case referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, raises
legitimate concerns about the use of Section 73 as a defence for the
retransmission of free-to-air channels
online<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000037">However,
the point surely is that this amendment points out the need to look
again at the objective of Section 73 and to ask whether the outcomes it
delivers today are still relevant to the Government's public policy
objectives. I understand that the Government are currently looking at
how Section 73 might be amended and tightened to ensure that the
beneficiaries of the clause are the intended platforms that are
acting within the law. Perhaps when he responds, the
Minister will let us know what progress is being made in that review
and indeed, as has been mentioned, what progress is being made on the
communications White Paper, which has been promised on a regular basis

the recent catch-up TV case may require an adjustment to the current
law, abolishing the clause entirely, as the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, proposes, seems entirely contrary to the interests of 4
million cable customers who access public service content, at no cost
to those broadcasters, through the cable platform. The right thing to
do is to ensure that this issue will be considered in some detail when
the Government eventually publish their communications White Paper. In
these circumstances, the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, I note the continuing
interest that my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones shows in this area.
The legislative framework that supports our vibrant and successful TV
industry is incredibly important and is deserving of our time and
attention. This amendment would repeal Section 73 of the
Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. This would remove
the copyright exemption for the retransmission by cable of certain
public service broadcasts, or PSBs. This issue will be addressed
shortly when the Department for Culture, Media and Sport sets out its
approach to digital connectivity, content and consumers. I reassure my
noble friend that we still anticipate publication of the strategy paper
by the end of this month.</hs_para>

is an area where many competing interests must be balanced. As such, it
is of vital importance that the Government proceed carefully, giving
each of the opposing views due consideration. I can assure my noble
friend that it will be consulted on fully to ensure that the views of
all those affected are taken into account. I hope that I might be able
to help the development of this debate by setting out some of the key
points of discussion and their relationship to key pieces of
legislation, including Section
73<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:07:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about Section 73 tend to focus on two key areas. First, they are
concerned with the impact on the relationship between PSBs and cable
platforms. Secondly, they relate to the use of the Section 73 exemption
by internet-based television streaming services. I will look at each of
these areas in

piece of legislation affects the relationship between PSBs and cable
platforms by providing cable platforms with an exemption for the
retransmission of certain PSBs. This means that PSBs are not able to
charge cable services for the inclusion of certain channels on their
services. However, this piece of legislation fits within a
much wider framework that supports the availability of TV
and investment in television programming in the UK. This framework
consists of a variety of rules and regulations that affect the
production, availability and ease of discovery of public sector
programming and its relationship with the services or platforms that
carry it. These include the obligations on PSBs to offer their content
to all relevant platforms, the rules governing payments by broadcasters
for technical platform services, and the powers for regulators to
compel these services to carry PSB
content<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000043">The
Government have been clear that their objective is to ensure that, for
the core PSB channels, there is an overall zero balance of payments
between the PSBs and the services or platforms, regardless of whether
these are based on cable or satellite. This is a fair and pragmatic
approach that ensures the wide availability of PSB content and allows
PSBs to continue their high level of investment in high-quality UK
content. The current framework, including Section 73, is delivering
this outcome for TV delivered by cable, and we want to see this
continue. However, there is still a way to go before we see net zero
fees on satellite, and we want to investigate how net zero fees can be
achieved across the main
platforms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:10:06"></hs_TimeCode>.

second issue at stake is the use of the Section 73 exemption
by internet-based television streaming services. This issue is the
subject of ongoing legal proceedings and, as such, it is not
appropriate for me to comment on the specifics. However, I can say that
the Government are concerned about the use of this exemption in this
way, and will address it when we set out our approach to connectivity,
content and consumers by the end of this month. This proposed amendment
to the CDPA would pre-empt the Government’s approach to this
area. A complex framework governs the balance of payments between
platforms and broadcasters, so we need to consider any changes in the
round or risk unintended consequences.</hs_para>

zero balance of payments. While that is very helpful in clarification,
it is not particularly welcome to the PSBs. The DCMS can expect some

Amendment 19, in responding to the Hargreaves review, the Government
committed to introducing a limited private copy exception to allow
copying of content lawfully owned by an individual for their own
personal use. The Intellectual Property Office has 
<?notus-xml column=1228?>recently issued the draft private copy statutory instrument, which can
be summarised as follows. First, an individual who has lawfully
acquired a work on a permanent basis can make a private copy for his or
her own personal, non-commercial use. Secondly, the
individual cannot circumvent technological protection measures
but—interestingly—will be able to appeal to the Secretary
of State to intervene to obtain a private copy if the work is protected
by technological protection measures. Thirdly, it does not allow
contract terms to override the
exception.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000061">Amendment
19 inserts a new clause in anticipation of this draft statutory
instrument. The draft SI has provoked considerable concern among the
audiovisual sector—indeed, across all the creative industries. I
strongly believe that copyright exceptions should be adopted only in
response to a well defined public policy objective and market failure.
In this regard, the Government’s draft statutory instrument
disregards altogether consumers’ ever-widening choice of
commercial offerings facilitated by a rapidly evolving technological
landscape, and risks jeopardising these market-led developments
altogether. The purpose of this amendment is to ensure that a private
copy exception should not apply where a commercially available
alternative already exists. This principle is entirely consistent with
European and international copyright norms and, indeed, is an existing
principle in UK
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000062">Historically,
private copy exceptions were established in an analogue environment
where business models and technology could not accommodate consumer
offerings that provide secure copies. With the rapid conversion to
digital business models in recent years, the technological and
therefore the commercial landscape has changed considerably. The
audiovisual sector has recognised the growing consumer demand for
additional copies and portable content, and already provides many
avenues for consumers to obtain legal digital copies of content they
buy for their own use. Most commonly, the purchase of a DVD or Blu-ray
Disc includes access to a digital copy. In addition, products such as
UltraViolet allow legal and secure access to that content through the
cloud among six family members for up to 12 personal devices such as
laptops, tablets, smart phones and televisions, thereby enabling format
shifting. Additional multicopy offerings are being brought to the
market, and none requires the consumer to pay twice for the same
content. At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:20:56"></hs_TimeCode> the
same time, an explosion of new digital audiovisual
services—currently there are more than 30 in the UK—has
occurred under the existing legal framework. There are an
increasing variety of means which put increased choice and
control in the hands of the consumer, and are made possible only
through industry-led investment and
innovation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000063">The
UK already leads Europe in its range of audiovisual services and
technologies, without any change being required to the current legal
framework. In proposing the introduction of any copyright exception in
the absence of a clear public interest, surely the burden of proof
should rest firmly with the Government to define and quantify the
extent of the market’s failure to meet consumer needs. It is
very questionable whether the Government have made a convincing
argument in support of a private copying exception. Indeed, far from
incentivising the market to continue 
<?notus-xml column=1229?>innovating in the interest of the consumer, it may
be that the private copy exception proposed will
fundamentally undermine the technologies and services that the market
is
developing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000064">There
are numerous other concerns expressed about the draft copying statutory
instrument, not least its apparent conflict on a number of points with
EU law. It needs to be strengthened to ensure that the exception
applies only for the sole personal use of an individual and not to be
used by commercial operators. It should not authorise the making of a
further copy by another person or entity, such as an electronic storage
provider, in relation to a further copy. Without such clarification,
the exception could seriously impact on the ability of the music
industry to license innovative value-added services, such as
“scan and match” services in the

the widespread concerns about the latest wording of the exception, I
hope the Minister can assure us that a further draft will be presented
before the formal publication of the SI. I had a letter today from the
Minister saying that the SI may be tabled later on in the year but that
it is not intended to bring it into force until 2014. So there is no
rush; there is ample time for another draft before proceeding with
implementation. However the purpose of the present amendment is to
ensure that, where private copying is permitted under the terms of the
original product purchase, the exception is not invocable. There is no
doubt in my mind that the absence of any commercial availability test
when applying a private copying exception would be incredibly damaging

the conclusion of the Committee stage the Minister offered—and
we gratefully accepted his invitation—to have a broader-based
debate around the sort of issues that the noble Lord, Lord
Clement-Jones, has been raising. We felt that the recourse to secondary
legislation for this important issue in itself makes it difficult for
the House to exercise a broader view on these matters. In particular,
as there are so many of these exceptions, there is a need for what
might be considered a more general debate around the overall balance
and overall approach which the Government could have taken in this
matter. The noble Lord made that offer and we look forward to hearing
whether he has had any success in finding time for that debate. It
would be helpful, for exactly the reasons that the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=1230?>Lord Clement-Jones, has given, to have a
broader-based discussion around some of the more far-reaching ends of
these 11 different exceptions so that when the time comes for both
Houses of Parliament to consider these matters—as they will in
the secondary legislation process—we are better informed and can
make better decisions about how to respond to them. I look forward to

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 18,
tabled by my noble friend, Lord Clement-Jones, would increase the
maximum penalty for online copyright infringement to 10 years. Under
the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act—CDPA—the current
maximum penalty that can be incurred by online copyright infringement
is two years, while for physical copyright infringement, the maximum
penalty available is 10 years. This is not a new proposition. A similar
recommendation was made by Andrew Gowers in the report he wrote for the
previous Government. At the
publication<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:26:45"></hs_TimeCode> of
the Gowers report, the previous Government indicated their intention to
implement all of its recommendations. However, after a consultation,
they decided to increase the financial penalties to £50,000 but
left the maximum custodial sentence untouched. I am sure that they did
not reach their conclusions on this matter lightly.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072366000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000070">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T18:27:10"></hs_TimeCode>
issue is sometimes presented as if there is a gap in the fabric of
criminal offences which apply in this area, and that this change will
plug that gap. I am not entirely convinced. The statute in question is
not the only way in which criminals can be charged for copyright
infringement. There is already a range of options for prosecutors
looking to obtain a conviction for such activities. Many of these
require a lower evidential burden than copyright offences, require less
specialist knowledge and offer the sort of sentencing options which my
noble friend seeks to add to this offence. Indeed, I am told that
prosecutors would usually prefer to charge under the Fraud Act 2006,
which carries a maximum penalty of 10 years, or use “conspiracy
to defraud”, which also carries a penalty of 10 years. The Fraud
Act in particular seems to have met the challenges posed by
developments in technology and internet crime, helping industry to
report crime as fraud, and has garnered praised from the City of London
Police, among
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000071">There
is another issue here of sentence length, by which I mean convictions
and sentences actually handed down, rather than those that are
theoretically available. The average custodial sentence given for
physical copyright infringement under CDPA offences in 2011 was
12.7 months, the highest for five years. So the questions
that occur to me are these: is this a necessary change? Is it a useful
change to make? I would like to reflect on this matter further, and
perhaps have the benefit of views from experts and practitioners in the
field. I therefore ask my noble friend if he would be prepared to
withdraw his amendment in return for an assurance that I will set in
hand a study of this question, the timing of which I will confirm
following the Summer Recess. If there is a need for a change to the law
then I will, of course, look for a suitable legislative
opportunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000072">I
turn now to the private copying exception, to which Amendment 19
relates. This is a measure that the Government are preparing to
introduce under

Lord, Lord Stevenson, pointed out. I remind noble Lords of the lengthy
Committee discussions which have already been held on copyright
exceptions, and of the detailed information already provided to this
House on the Government’s ongoing technical review process.
Noble Lords will recall my invitation for contributions to that process
from all interested parties. I am very grateful for the contributions
we have received to this review process so far. I also remain committed
to having further debate on these issues prior to the draft regulations
being laid before Parliament. The noble Lord, Lord Stevenson, asked
when the exceptions debates might take place and about the timing. I
believe that we agreed that the timing would need to be agreed through
the usual channels. I would like to await the results of these
discussions first before I commit to a particular

proposed changes to copyright exceptions.

introducing a copyright exception for private copying, it is the
Government’s aim to give consumers greater certainty over what
they can do with products they have bought. It will not allow people to
bypass commercial markets to acquire products for free. Instead it sets
out basic rules on how people can use copies that they have already
purchased lawfully. The new law will allow people to make further
copies for their own personal use but will not allow them to give any
such copies to other people. To that extent, the new exception will be
very narrow—the narrowest in Europe. It will only grant very
basic permissions that are necessary to allow reasonable consumer
use.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072366000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072366000075">Consumers
in other common law countries, such as Australia and Canada, already
benefit from similar laws, as do consumers in most of Europe. In many
ways, we are only playing catch-up by giving British consumers some of
the advantages people already enjoy in many countries around the world.
The proliferation of licences online has created even greater confusion
for consumers. Consumers deserve basic rights, set out in law, to use
the things they have bought without having to deal with
multiple and complex licences. The approach set out in this amendment,
which foresees a greater role for licences, risks undermining that
principle. The Government’s view is that this narrow private
copying exception will, first, make life easier and simpler for
ordinary people; secondly, remove unnecessary regulation from
businesses; and thirdly, help our copyright law catch up
with the rest of the world.</hs_para>

Clement-Jones asked why consultation would be necessary. It is
important that the Government take a proper look at what the impact

decision needs to be given the appropriate level of consideration and
be based on the right evidence. Making changes such as those

lead to a complex and confusing statute book that is unable to respond

replies, which were rather different in their tenor. I very much
welcome some of the points he made in his reply to Amendment 18. While
not necessarily agreeing that it is inappropriate to change the
penalties available for online infringement, the Minister said he would
reflect further, set in train a review and consult with experts on this
subject. That gives us a chink of light. He said that he would advise
later on the timing of that review. At this stage, with noble Lords

19 should be treated as a preliminary canter. I very much hope that
there will be a more extended debate on this. This is the
problem with secondary legislation: we may be faced with a debate
simply when the order comes and we will not be able to amend
it in any shape or form. The Minister should know that there
is very deep disquiet about the private copying exception among various
members of the creative industries. I hope that he will keep channels
open to them because there is basically a fundamental difference of
opinion here. Some members of those creative industries believe that
their interests are threatened by the private property exception as
proposed. They believe it is not narrow but actually quite broad and
not explicit about the cloud. They have considerable
interest in further discussion.</hs_para>

would perhaps help our deliberations if I begin the debate by providing
a little context. Between 1995 and 30 November 2009, some 130 measures
in the field of police and criminal justice measures were adopted in
Brussels under the so-called third pillar. These were not subject to
either Commission enforcement powers or the full jurisdiction of the
European Court of Justice. As a result, the Commission could not take
action where it considered measures had not been properly implemented.
There were no ECJ infringement rulings and unanimity was required to
pass decisions in Council. The Lisbon treaty changed the constitutional
structure of the European Union in police and criminal justice matters.
A five-year transitional period was negotiated to delay these
pre-Lisbon measures from becoming subject to Commission enforcement
powers and the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. This
transitional period applies to and will end for all member states on 1
December
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072372000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000004">However,
the previous Labour Government negotiated a provision that applies only
to the United Kingdom. Under the terms of the Lisbon treaty, the United
Kingdom has until 31 May 2014 to decide whether to opt out of around
130 justice and home affairs measures covered by the treaty. If the UK
so chooses, the opt-out will come into effect on 1 December
2014. An opt-out of individual measures may have been
preferable—I believe that was what the previous Government
initially tried to negotiate—but that is not an option. The
opt-out can be exercised only en masse. Only after we have opted out
can we seek to rejoin individual measures. That is subject to a
negotiation with the European Commission and other member
states.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072372000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000005">Two
weeks ago, I repeated in this House a Statement made by my right
honourable friend the Home Secretary to announce the list of 35
measures that the Government will seek to rejoin—those being in
the national interest to do so. Command Paper 8671 outlines this list
of measures and includes the Government’s Explanatory Memoranda
on the full set of measures. I want to make clear that the Government
are strongly committed to the set of 35 measures in the Command Paper
and to a successful negotiation of rejoining these
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072372000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000006">I am

more important measures. For example, it is clearly not in the interest
of any 
<?notus-xml column=1234?>parties to have operational gaps for those subject to a European arrest
warrant or any of the other measures that we seek to opt back into.
These matters will be discussed further with the Commission. It is our
intention to try to successfully resolve any issues in that regard but,
because there is much to consider and much at stake, the exercise of
the opt-out must be preceded by careful and intelligent analysis of the
130 or so measures covered by this
exercise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072372000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000007">The
Government have approached the question of the measures we should seek
to rejoin from the perspective that our citizens should not have fewer
protections after 2014 than they have now. We have listened to the
views of law enforcement and other agencies that operate on the front
line to keep our country safe. The piece of work we have put before
both Houses is the result of that careful analysis. We want to continue
to co-operate with our European partners where there is value in doing
so—where it is in the national interest to do so. That
commitment is reflected in the 35 measures listed in the
Command Paper that we ask the House to endorse today. As a package,
they enable co-operation over invaluable practical measures to aid our
police forces and criminal justice system. These measures are a crucial
tool in the fight against international crime and
terrorism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072372000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000008">However,
other measures in the original 130 are not so useful: they may be
obsolete, defunct or simply unused. That is why the Government’s
thinking on this issue has focused on the practical use of measures and
whether we consider them valuable in the fight against crime and
terrorism. This is why, for example, the Government wish to seek to
rejoin the European arrest warrant. With free movement through the
European Union, we clearly need strong extradition arrangements in
place to see that justice is done. The record shows that since 2009,
the arrest warrant has been used to extradite from the United Kingdom
57 suspects for child sex offences, 86 for rape and 105 for murder. In
the same period, 63 suspected child sex offenders, 27
suspected rapists and 44 suspected murderers were extradited back to
Britain to face charges. A number of these suspects would probably have
never been extradited back to Britain without the arrest
warrant.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072372000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000009">The
arrest warrant has transformed the extradition process within the EU
from one that typically took years to a system that now takes weeks. A
perfect example of this is the extradition of Hussein Osman, one of the
failed July 2005 bombers, from Italy to the UK in just eight weeks.
This is in contrast to the era before the arrest warrant, when it took
a decade to deport terrorist suspect Rachid Ramda to France. Such
success would have been unthinkable in the absence of EU police
co-operation. As noble Lords and others have said, the functioning of
the arrest warrant can be improved. The Government recognise this and
the Home Secretary has already announced a proposed list of changes in
the other
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072372000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000010">Another
measure that the Government have also expressed a wish to rejoin is the
European supervision order. This will improve the functioning of the
arrest warrant by allowing suspects, in the appropriate circumstances,
to serve their bail conditions in their country of residence, rather
than remaining locked up 
<?notus-xml column=1235?>in a foreign jail awaiting trial. Furthermore, we want our law
enforcement agencies to continue to be able to establish joint
investigation teams in order that offenders can be brought to justice
as effectively as possible. One example of this is Operation Fry. This
saw a joint investigation team with the Netherlands target the abuse of
free movement through sham marriages. To date, this has led to 122
arrests, with 77 convictions and sentences totalling more than 100
years, and allowed us to initiate action to remove non-EEA
beneficiaries of such sham marriages from the UK. That sort of
co-operation would be infinitely more difficult as part of bilateral
arrangements rather than as part of a wider EU framework of
agreements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072372000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072372000011">We
also want to rejoin Eurojust and measures aimed at fighting child
pornography and other crimes that occur across borders. These measures

sure all noble Lords want to see as many foreign national offenders as
possible removed from the UK. The prisoner transfer framework decision
provides for non-consent-based transfers throughout the EU. The
Government support both the principles underpinning this measure and
the measure itself, as an effective means of getting those who have
abused our hospitality out of Britain to serve their sentences back

there are measures such as the Naples II convention and the customs
information system, which allow us to co-operate and gain access to
information from across Europe that makes a real difference on the
ground, such as the seizure of 1.2 tonnes of cocaine with a street
value of up to £300 million that came from information received
under the convention. There is also the second generation of the
Schengen information system, a new way of sharing law enforcement

savings to our criminal justice system, as well as making it easier to
identify foreign criminals and terrorists. The Government have been
very open about their wish to connect to this database, which requires
us to rejoin the police and criminal justice parts of the Schengen
convention itself.</hs_para>

selection of the instruments that the Government believe it is vital to
opt back into. The Government have done a lot of work to prepare the

do we want a debate and vote, however, we also want consultation with
the committees. In inviting the committees both in this House and in

let me clarify the position on Europol: the Government fully support
our participation in Europol, the advantages of which self-evident. It
is led by a British director, Rob Wainwright, and in 2012 law
enforcement agencies of the UK were involved in more than 300 of the
600 major operations against serious and organised crime and terrorism
supported by Europol. These included a variety of serious crimes,
including Operation Golf, which broke up an international
child-trafficking gang operating in Ilford and led to more than 100
arrests.</hs_para>

Europol proposal, which is subject to a separate, individual opt-in
decision not related to Protocol 36, poses some challenges. It includes
a proposal to change the powers of Europol, potentially allowing it to
direct national police forces and to require intelligence crucial to
our national security to be shared with it. These powers are not
necessary and the Government would like to see them removed from the
new proposal. That is why we have chosen not to opt in at the beginning
of negotiations, but we are committed to opt in at the end, once our
concerns have been addressed. I reiterate that continued UK involvement
in Europol is vital to keeping our citizens safe and combating the
scourges of cross-border crime.</hs_para>

Hannay of Chiswick:</Member></B> My Lords, before I address the
procedural issues covered by the amendment to the
Government’s Motion that stands in my name on the Order Paper, I
would like to make some observations about the substantive issues
raised by the Home Secretary’s Statement of 9 July and the
introduction to this debate by the noble Lord, Lord McNally, which set
out the Government’s intention to trigger the block opt-out
under Protocol 36 of the Lisbon treaty and to seek to rejoin 35 of the
measures that fall within the scope of that opt-out. In doing so, I do
not speak in the name of the sub-committee on home affairs, health and
education that I chair since, lamentably, due to the
Government’s delay in replying to the recommendations in the EU
Select Committee’s report of 23 April, that report is not
formally part of today’s debate, so I speak in a
personal capacity.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072374000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000002">The subject matter of
our debate is, I fear, formidably complex and difficult to address in a
simple and straightforward way. Just in case anyone is inclined to
blame these complexities on the fearsome Brussels bureaucracy, though,
I should point out that the complications are entirely of our own
making. No other member state is in such a quandary. It is legitimate,
I think, to criticise the previous Government, who negotiated the
Lisbon treaty, for leaving such a cat’s cradle to their
successors. I suggest that the challenge we face in this debate is to
sort out the wood from the trees, tempting though it is to linger over
some of the individual trees—for example, the
Government’s decision to opt out irrevocably from the measure
dealing with xenophobia and racism, surely a bizarre choice that could
be considered sinister, just plain silly or a combination of both. It
is a trifle difficult to explain or defend.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1238?><hs_para UID="13072374000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000003">The first salient point
that I would make is that the Government clearly have no objection of
principle to the extension of the jurisdiction of the
European Court of Justice and the enforcement powers of the
Commission to cover justice and home affairs matters. Why otherwise
have they opted into a large number of the post-Lisbon measures adopted
in the past three years, as well as the 35 pre-Lisbon ones that they
now say they are seeking to rejoin? No doubt, as the Minister has said,
it is in our national interest to do so, but why then deny those
extensions to the European Court of Justice and the Commission in the
case of rather a large number of less significant measures? Presumably,
that is to placate their critics on the wilder shores of
Euroscepticism. However, they have obviously not succeeded in doing
that, since some of those critics want to rejoin nothing and quite a
few of them actually want to repatriate the post-Lisbon opt-ins as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000004">A second
salient point emerges from a study of the Explanatory Memorandums
provided in Command Paper 8671. In not a single instance is it
suggested that a measure currently in force is damaging to
the national interest, or would be damaging if the Court’s
jurisdiction were extended to cover it. The Explanatory Memorandums
also state that not a single one of them impairs the human rights of
British citizens. Why then do the Government want to opt out
irrevocably? The most that can be said is that it would not make much
difference. However, I suggest that that is a singularly feeble basis
on which to found negative decisions that could have far-reaching
implications for our wider relationship with the other member states. I
should add that in the course of taking evidence we asked all our
witnesses, some of whom were strongly in favour of the block opt-out,
whether they could identify a single measure that was damaging to the
national interest, and they could not do so.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072374000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000005">It is sometimes
suggested that to accept the European Court of Justice’s
jurisdiction would be to undermine fatally the basis of our common-law
system. Not one of our legally expert witnesses could substantiate
that, and most of them contested it vigorously. There are, after all,
three other member states that have common-law systems—Ireland,
Cyprus and Malta—and they do not seem to be feeling any stress.
Much is made of the so-called judicial activism of the European Court
of Justice, but an examination of its track record in the justice and
home affairs field provided no evidence at all for those assertions. In
fact, the treaty requires the Court to pay proper respect to national
jurisdiction in these criminal justice matters, so it is perhaps not
altogether surprising that it actually does so. However, that seems to
be overlooked by the Court’s
critics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000006">If so
far I have been rather critical of the Government’s position,
let me say how much I welcome their decision to seek to rejoin Europol,
Eurojust and the European arrest warrant. To have done less than that
would have been to have put at serious risk important aspects of our
national security—I was glad to hear the Minister recognising
that quite explicitly—not least those relating to our greatly
improved and crucial relationship on these matters with Ireland. We
looked carefully at the assertions that we could comfortably move to a
network of bilateral arrangements, in place particularly of the
European arrest warrant, but we found no merit in 
<?notus-xml column=1239?>that approach, which would in all likelihood be slower, more costly and
less effective than the European arrest
warrant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000007">The
Government’s intention to implement the European supervision
order is also very welcome. As the Minister said, that will enable
British citizens sought under an arrest warrant to be bailed
here rather than held abroad for long periods awaiting trial, one of
the most justified criticisms of the arrest warrant. The fact that this
country missed the deadline for implementing that European supervision
order, which expired last December, should be a cause of shame for
the Government, and the sooner that it now comes into force
the
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000008">Where
does that leave the debate over whether Britain should make use of the
block opt-out, which it is undoubtedly entitled to do under the
provisions of the Lisbon treaty? Nothing contained in the Home
Secretary’s Statement in the other place on 9 July, in the
Explanatory Memorandums published in Command Paper 8671 or in what the
Minister has said today seems to justify a change in the
judgment that your Lordships’ Select Committee reached last
April: that the Government have not yet made a convincing case for
triggering the opt-out. Indeed, the Government’s recent decision
to ignore the views expressed by this House on 1 July, and therefore
not to opt in from the outset to the negotiations on the new
post-Lisbon Europol regulation, further undermines the credibility of
the Government’s approach and further increases the potential
risks to our national
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000009">What
is new is that the Government have now, very belatedly, revealed the
list of 35 pre-Lisbon measures that they will seek to rejoin. That is
welcome, as is the content of that list—at least, so far as it
goes. It seems to cover most of the main pre-Lisbon measures that the
European Union Select Committee identified as being essential. Whether
it covers all that needs to be covered remains to be seen; I am afraid
that the period since the publication of Command Paper 8671
has been far too short to give the matter the detailed
consideration that it requires. That consideration will now be
undertaken by the two sub-committees working together as before, and
will form the object of a further report that will be provided to your
Lordships’ House before the end of October, as the Government
have invited us to do, with a new call for evidence issued on 18
July.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000010">That
brings me to the procedural issues covered by the amendment standing in
my name on the Order Paper. I placed that amendment on the Order Paper
when it seemed as though the Government were seeking authority to
trigger the block opt-out while doing no more than asking the House to
take note of the list of measures that they might seek to rejoin. In
this way, they were dividing in two the integrally linked parts of a
single set of decisions which our report to the House made very clear
had to be taken together. How could this House reasonably be asked to
endorse the block opt-out when it was not being asked to endorse the
list of measures we should seek to rejoin? The amendment to the
government Motion that was moved by the noble Lord last night has,
however, changed that position and has asked the House to endorse the
list of 35. That is a major step forward.</hs_para>

come along together. So on this occasion the Government have now, in
something close to a death-bed conversion, produced their response to
our report, which I spent the afternoon reading, but on which I will
certainly not attempt to comment now. Although I can do a bit of
speed reading, these matters require a little more care than
that. In any case, the result of this is that the two points in my

have to say with regret that the Explanatory Memoranda are
extraordinarily badly prepared—and even worse presented. It is
not clear on what basis the Government chose the 35. No clear reasons
are given, apart from the Prüm decisions where there are
concerns about costs. Some are stated to be defunct and so presumably
of no real concern; some are said not to be needed because we have
dealt with them administratively or in domestic legislation. As the

the Government had failed to make a convincing case in favour of the

are being asked to express a view about opting out without a proper

this Motion, we would lose the opportunity, which was lost in the other
place, of placing on record and binding in our belief that the 35

of discretion. It determines that the opt-out should be exercised, and
that is expressly the opinion of this House if it passes the Motion. At

reason for this extraordinary mix-up seems to have been the inability

looks at the 35, I do not think that one can objectively doubt that
they are in the national interest. Indeed, if one looks at the
Government’s response to the Select Committee’s report,
it is clear that they are quite warm towards these measures; I am
conscious of time and will not go into the details on that. The tone of
the Government’s response is favourable to the opt-back-in of
the 35 measures, but this brings us to the real difficulty. If we pass
this resolution, that, coupled with the Commons, will give the
Government parliamentary authority to exercise the opt-out. There is no
such parliamentary authority for the Government to exercise the 35
opt-ins, and there is certainly no obligation—only a declaration
of intent. Let us assume that we opt out and then nothing happens. What
are the consequences of that? The result is that the 35
measures will lapse. Moreover, the procedure now being used by the
Government in the other place—namely, giving Select Committees
opportunities to look at this matter in the way that they are—is
itself a recipe for delay and continued

Government position is to pretend that they are getting rid of
significant things in the hope that nobody will notice that what they
are doing is not getting rid of significant things but getting rid of
things which are defunct, unimportant or irrelevant. Then they will opt
back in, so it is said—if they can get the Commission and other

would have been not to opt out in the first place. There is absolutely
no reason why we should have taken that risk. Alternatively, if we did
opt out, the other way of doing it would be to do the two things
together, at least as far as Parliament is concerned. Why could we not
have had a vote on a Motion approving both the opt-out and the list of
measures to which the Government wish to opt back in? We do not have
that. It is not in this Motion. It was certainly not in the Motion that
was debated in the 
<?notus-xml column=1245?>House of Commons last week. If that had happened, it
would have been neater, crisper and more comprehensive. As it is, we
should not vote to approve one side of the equation without being in a

to proceed.</hs_para>

opt-out of 133 JHA measures. It also asks us to approve the rejoining
of measures that are in the national interest and now suggests, without
quite saying so in the Motion, that these are the 35 measures set out
in the Command Paper. The Motion also invites your Lordship’s EU
Select Committee to report on the matter before the end of October,
when negotiations with the EU institutions will start—which is,
perhaps, an unusual way for the Government to communicate with a Select
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000040">The
Government, or some parts of it, seem to have got themselves into
rather a tangle over all this. This tangle seems to have led them into,
at the very least, discourtesies to Select Committees here and in the
Commons and, by extension, perhaps to both Houses as a whole. The very
long delay in providing the promised Explanatory Memoranda is a case in
point, as is the failure to respond to the report of your
Lordships’ EU Committee in the agreed
timeframe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000041">Perhaps
the most important and straightforward interpretation of the events of
the past few months is the following. The Prime Minister seems to have
decided, on or before the date on which he made his now famous Rio
speech, that he would exercise the block opt-out. That was on 28
September last year, 10 months ago. There followed a series of not
wholly convincing denials that the Government had in fact made up their
mind to exercise the block opt-out, and not wholly convincing
assertions that they had an open mind on the issue. It seemed pretty
clear that the Prime Minister and, perhaps just a bit later, his
Conservative colleagues in the coalition had in fact decided to opt
out. The moment this became clear—and it was pretty immediately
clear—the real political task was not to try to prevent the
block opt-out but to agree a sensible, comprehensive and coherent
package of rejoin measures. I doubt that, despite the overwhelming
evidence against opting out, it was ever going to be possible to
persuade the Prime Minister not to do exactly that. The Prime Minister
had committed himself and his colleagues far too early and much too
clearly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000042">It is
easy to see that the Government were almost certainly not going to be
moved. They were going to exercise the block opt-out, come what may, as
it were. That meant that the real political debate would be over which
measures to apply to rejoin. I know that there has been very
extensive debate within the Government over exactly this. The
Government’s original Motion appeared to be coy about exactly
what these measures might be, but today’s version of the Motion
is pretty unambiguous. The rejoin measures for negotiation are the 35
set out in the Command Paper. These rejoin measures proposed in the
Command Paper represent the outcome of negotiations within the
coalition. On any objective reading, this list of proposed rejoins
seems to be entirely satisfactory. In fact, the Lib Dem 
<?notus-xml column=1246?>negotiators, and Danny Alexander in particular, should be congratulated
on what they have persuaded their Tory colleagues to accept. It may be,
of course, that to pass the Commission’s legal requirements for
coherence we will have to add to this list one or two other minor and
technical measures. However, this would not be difficult and would
certainly not be harmful to the national
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000043">One
of the oddest things about this whole imbroglio is that the Government
have not been able to demonstrate that any of the measures they do not
want to rejoin is harmful to the national interest or damaging at all.
I repeat that the list of proposed rejoins set out in Command Paper
8671 seems to be entirely satisfactory. We must acknowledge that we are
where we are but we must also acknowledge the time pressure. It is
critical that we get on with this so that we absolutely reduce the
chances of any interregnum where we are out of 133 measures and not yet

I will first speak about the opt-outs, it is the choice of the 35
opt-in measures and the conditions that we might wish to apply which

under the Lisbon treaty—Article 10.1 of Protocol
36—and infraction powers under Article 258 
<?notus-xml column=1247?>of the treaty do not currently apply. However, if we do not opt out, of
course all these measures will become subject to the European Court of
Justice and the enforcement powers of the Commission on 1 December
2014. Quite simply, if we do not want that, we must opt out. If we are

mountain of secondary legislation passes through this

dominantly of national origin and the proportion that is
Brussels-derived and under the European Communities Act is quite small.
However, in the area of justice and home affairs there are a lot of
regulations and legislative measures and the Government have decided
that they want to go for the full opt-out. We might say that whatever

turn to the opt-in proposal, which is intended to safeguard and
reinforce our national interest against organised crime and trafficking

are some quite important measures among the 35, but they are mainly
non-Schengen measures in the form of Council acts or decisions.

are the Council decisions strengthening Eurojust in the fight against
serious crime; the Council decision establishing Europol, whose
excellent work was specifically pointed out by the Home Secretary in
her Statement; and, of course, there is the decision on the European

common sense that we should stick with it in the interests of our

there being no power for Europol to initiate investigations. I hope

to avoid the complexity of negotiating extradition agreements with many
different countries. The Home Secretary has indicated the changes that

are in her Statement. They are all very sensible and we should

have been said on so many occasions about opt-outs that most people had
not heard about before the decision was taken to consider the
consequences of Protocol 35 of the treaty of Lisbon. We heard so many
contradictory statements. Today, we are not really having a debate
about what our relations should be. Our debate has nothing to do with
the improved governance of Britain. It has precious little to do with
our relations with the EU on police and criminal justice measures. Our
debate has everything to do with appeasing Eurosceptics on the
Conservative Benches in the House of Commons. So concerned are we about
appeasing them that we cannot even put the same Motion
before the two Houses. The Motion that they approved did not ask them
to endorse anything, and, as recently as yesterday, we were not asked
to endorse anything. It is all down to the process of changing your
mind as you go along to appease the Eurosceptics. I warn the Government
that what they are doing is not appeasing them but driving them to seek
ever greater
concessions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072374000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072374000065">Everywhere,
the tactic has failed. Their Motion to appease Euroscepticism differed
from the one we are dealing with here. They could not be asked to

<?notus-xml column=1250?>have controversial arguments about the measures for police and criminal
justice measures, I was somewhat reassured by a Written Ministerial
Statement made on 20 January 2011 by Mr David Lidington, the Minister
for Europe. He included references, for example, to consultation before
the Government make a formal decision. He also referred to consultation

Taverne:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, would have voted for the
amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, if the Motion had
remained in its original form. Now it is one which I can
support because it commits the Government to opting in as their
official policy to the measures which matter most. However, the history
of where we have got to needs to be borne in mind because it is a
reason for exercising a certain amount of caution. When the
negotiations started between Oliver Letwin and Danny
Alexander, the Government—at least the Conservatives—were
absolutely clear that certain red lines existed, including the European
arrest warrant and more jurisdiction for the European Court of Justice.
There was strong opposition from Open Europe and, naturally, from the
UKIP tendency inside the Conservative Party, but there was also
opposition from leading figures in the Conservatives such as Dominic
Raab, who kept on explaining that you did not need Brussels at all and
that you could organise a whole lot of separate bilateral negotiations.
Fresh Start said that it would not opt back into anything. However,
matters have changed and we are now in a position whereby, on the face
of it, the Government are committed to serious
opt-back-ins<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T19:45:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072375000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0002.htm#13072375000002">However,
the House of Commons debate was not exactly reassuring. In particular,
the speech by the Home Secretary was in my view pretty disgraceful,
reiterating the claim that this was the first step in the major
repatriation of powers because 100 measures would be left opted out of.
It was in fact one of the ablest of the Europhobes, Mr Jacob Rees-Mogg,
who completely exploded that idea by asking which were the important
measures that we were no longer going to opt back into. In addition,
the whole tone of the Home Secretary’s speech was one of trying
to appease the Europhobes. She assured them that they did not have to
worry too much because they always had the right to vote against the
opt-ins when they came to Parliament

want an assurance from the Government, which I believe the Minister
will give, having talked to him on this issue very recently. We need an
absolute assurance that the Government will not yield one further inch
towards the Europhobes. It is not a happy history. The Prime Minister
had made a number of pro-European remarks but when the going has got
tough he has always given in. That is why he bought peace with the
promise of a referendum in 2017, which is a ridiculous commitment
because by 2017 we will not yet know what sort of Europe—which
is in a state of flux—we will either have to stay in or leave.
Therefore we need an assurance that there will be no further surrender
and that there will be a strong Whip in the House of Commons and not be
endless speeches that would delay the whole procedure—because
every single opt-in measure will be challenged by the Europhobes, who
will not give up their opposition.</hs_para>

the Government stand firm, I think this is a good result. I am not as
worried as the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, about a legal challenge.
Having looked at this, I do not think that there are grounds for a
legal challenge. However, the tactic of judicial review could be used
to try to delay a decision. I am more worried 
<?notus-xml column=1252?>about that than about the merits of a challenge. If
the Government stick to it, this will be a good result. It will be the
first defeat for the UKIP tendency and for UKIP and I hope that there
will be many more. I hope that in the 2014 elections all the
parties—or at least those that support these opt-in
measures—will expose UKIP’s position as that of a party
which is soft on crime and does not want measures that can deal with
people traffickers, money launderers, porn merchants and all the rest.

Ireland was, frankly, baffled by the Government's stance. In
short, the weight of critical evidence was overwhelming and our judge

subject to the court and must therefore have no objection in principle

would set limits on the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice of the
European Union over our domestic affairs. I could understand that
argument—although I would not agree with it—if we were
going to get shot of the court of justice altogether. Of
course, that would be pure fancy. We would still be subject to the
jurisdiction of the court in respect of all the many police and
criminal justice measures we have signed up to since Lisbon,
and would also be subject to its jurisdiction in respect of the 35

myself in agreement with the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Smith
of Basildon, on 9 July. It is true that the Government could say that
they had repatriated, to use that great word, 95 powers taken from us
by the European Union, but what would that mean or be worth in
practice? How many of those powers have any importance for us today?
How many are even relevant today? I am, of course, not referring to the

and my noble friend on the Front Bench, judging by some of his opening
remarks, one of the fundamental problems that the Government faced in
addressing this opt-out decision is the nature of the wording of the
opt-out negotiated under Protocol 36 by the last Government. This is
its all-in or all-out nature. There is no picking and choosing; no
matter how futile, irrelevant or unnecessary a particular measure may
be, the totality has to be accepted or
rejected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072375000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072375000024">I

reflection he would not divide the House on his amendment. That would
have seemed an unwise course of action. First, it would have treated
the issue as black and white. As I said, while that construction is
placed on us by the wording of Protocol 36, within the areas
covered by the protocol the pluses and minuses of the policy issues are
much more nuanced. Secondly, while the Government should have responded
earlier to the joint sub-committees’ report—I entirely
share the view of other noble Lords that producing the response at noon
today is really not good enough—nevertheless Members of the
House not on those sub-committees should have the opportunity to
express their views this evening. That answers the point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Richard, about the rationale for this debate. It will
no doubt help to inform the Government’s thinking. Finally, as I
understand it, this is only the first time round the track, because we

the remainder of my remarks, I want to concentrate on just three
points. These are the different categorisations of the 130 opt-out
decisions that we are looking at. First, there are the 40 or so that
are considered redundant or inapplicable. Some noble Lords and some
members of the sub-committee have argued that there was no point in
disturbing these particular sleeping dogs. I am afraid that I take a
more fundamental approach than that. Where possible, one should remove
redundant provisions from the statute book. Leaving such provisions
extant, however innocuous they may seem at the time, can cause
unforeseen problems in the future, as to both applicability and
compliance. From my point of view, the Government were right to take
this opportunity to clean up the directives in this
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072375000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072375000030">The
second category is of those directives to which the Government seek to
opt back in. Primarily, they focus on enhancing the international
dimension of the fight against organised crime. It is more than ever a
self-evident truth that crime, along with many other activities, has
gone global. The European dimension to this global challenge has formed
important elements of many reports from your Lordships’ various
EU sub-committees. I strongly support decisions to continue with hard
and practical measures in this field: the joint investigation teams,
exchange of information under ECRIS, mutual recognition of confiscation
orders and so
forth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072375000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072375000031">Not all
the directives are perfectly formed. I am pleased that, while
recognising the value of the European arrest warrant—I entirely
share the views of noble Lords who have pointed to its particular
importance in the relationships between the UK and the Republic of
Ireland—nevertheless improvements can and should be made. These
should be in areas such as proportionality, not allowing people to be
held for long periods without trial overseas and using
videoconferencing to enable people not to have to travel, particularly
where the case against them is not as sure as it might be. For these
global security matters, we should opt back in and I am glad to see us
doing it. If it is in our interests to improve global security, I see
no reason why fellow European members should not wish to collaborate
with us to ensure
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072375000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072375000032">Finally,
I turn to the third category of directives, to which the Government
propose not to opt back in—the most challenging area of our
discussion. I am no lawyer, but my concerns as an external
viewer are threefold. First, how does one combine into one legal
framework cases that emerge from two different legal traditions: 
<?notus-xml column=1257?>the investigative approach, followed by most EU member states, and the
adversarial common law approach of the UK, Ireland, Cyprus and Malta?
Secondly, to what extent does any potential judicial activism of the
European Court of Justice represent a challenge to our established
legal procedures? Thirdly, what will be the long-term impact of the
European Convention on Human Rights, although an entirely separate
structure, on the first two? I do not pretend to have clear answers to
these questions and I am not sure that many other people do either. In
the circumstances, the Government are wise to proceed slowly, to watch
developments and to react accordingly. Joining in will surely represent
a one-way ticket and I am not yet convinced that the UK should be
embarking on that journey.</hs_para>

the restrictions imposed by the wording of Protocol 36, the Government
are taking a broadly sensible approach by, first, removing superfluous
and redundant legislation; secondly, by rejoining those directives that
help to increase the security of Europe as a whole; and, thirdly,
awaiting the clearing of the fog that still hangs over a number of
important public policy issues. That is why I shall be supporting the
Government tonight.</hs_para>

Foulkes of Cumnock:</Member></B> My Lords, my old friend the Minister
was right on one thing, anyway—the European Union Select
Committee’s report is an excellent one. That is why it was
deeply disappointing not only that we did not get the Government reply
until around lunchtime today but that it is such a flimsy response. It
is 22 and a half pages long, most of it just repeating the
recommendations of our Select Committee and making inadequate responses
to them. In apologising for the delay, the Government have said that it
arose to ensure as comprehensive and as detailed a response as
possible. Comprehensive and detailed—that is an unbelievable
description of this reply. Perhaps the Minister who is to reply could
tell the House what detail we had to wait for. What detail could not
have been provided many weeks ago?</hs_para>

matter. We are talking about the threats of terrorism and
organised crime. The Government, in moving in this direction, are
putting back the fight against terrorism and organised crime and thus
putting citizens in danger in a vain attempt to appease anti-European
Tory MPs and particularly the UKIP-ers, as my noble friend Lord
Tomlinson said. It is a vain attempt. The <I>Guardian</I> today

That is complete nonsense. Of course the balance of competences review
has a much wider remit, but reviewing justice and home affairs and not
completing that until 2014 means that these two exercises are related
to each other. Surely there must be some follow-through or cross-over
between one and the other.</hs_para>

the Lord Advocate and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice have grave
concerns about opting out of the European arrest warrant without any

of a guarantee of the ability to opt back in. They point out that the

spending time clearing them up or repealing them. If they are doing no
harm, why are we going through this huge exercise just to get rid of
things that are not causing any harm to anyone when we do not know
whether we will be able to opt back in to things that are absolutely
vital to everyone? The Government say that they are

the European Union Act 2011? Do we have to go through the
referendum procedure? The noble Lord, Lord McNally, did not have time
to consider it so I do not blame him for not replying, but the noble
Lord, Lord Taylor, has had a few hours to do so. He has officials,
around five of them, who no doubt are on the telephone to

not want to go on for too long so I shall make two last points. I must
say that I think that this is a very sad day for the Minister. As I
said, the noble Lord, Lord McNally, is a good friend of
mine. I ask him to remember the 1970s and early 1980s when he and I
were members together of the Labour Movement for Europe, arguing for
greater competence and more powers for the European Union.
Indeed, he went much further than I did; he went so
far as to leave the Labour Party 
<?notus-xml column=1259?>and set up a new party with the noble Baroness, Lady
Williams, and others so that he could fight for Europe. Where is he

that the one person who disappoints me even more than the noble Lord,
Lord McNally, is the noble Lord, Lord Hannay. The noble Lord, Lord
Hannay, knows more about this than anyone else. It reminds me of the
Schleswig-Holstein question. There were three people who knew about it:
one had subsequently died, one went mad and the other one was the noble
Lord, Lord Hannay of Chiswick, in this case. The noble Lord, Lord
Hannay, knows more about this issue than anyone else. He knows—I
have heard him say it in the committee—better than anyone the
dangers of opting out without any guarantee of being able to opt back
in on these vital issues. That is why I am very disappointed that he
has been conned by the Government. In all the machinations that have
taken place, the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, and his supporters have been
conned. The opt-out is bristling with problems. The only way to express
concern about it is to vote against the Government today. I urge any
Member—not just on this side and on the Cross Benches but on the
other side—who has real worries about opting out to take that
course of
action.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_23_PT_1/27ABDC65B5EDC0C81CABD05F46D5C352269BA845" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 July 2013">Tuesday,

right—whether it is 128 or 132—matters not. We are
dealing with a body of measures that essentially constitute a
potpourri. There is no family or monolithic consistency to them. They
spread over a huge range of possibilities. Some of them are vital to
the national interest. Some are highly relevant and useful. Others, at
the other end of the spectrum, have fallen into dissimilitude. Many of
them have never been relevant at all. Others had only a most minimal
and marginal impact upon our interests. If anybody therefore
concentrates upon one, two, three, five or 10 of those, one is doing
the whole issue a disservice. One can look at them only as a totality.
Looking at all of them together and asking where the United
Kingdom’s interest lies—whether it is a disbenefit or an
advantage to take course A or course B—is surely the only
possible way that reasonable, fair-minded and balanced people can look

were able to show that, I would gladly withdraw that serious
accusation. However, I do not think that there can be any question of
their having looked at the matter in an objective, cool and
statesmanlike way and having asked, “What is our duty towards
this kingdom in the circumstances?”.</hs_para>

fact, there is a howling fallacy in the government case and it is as
simple as this. If one looks at the Motion tonight or the matter that
was placed before the House of Commons, the Government’s
argument is on two levels. As far as 95 matters or thereabouts are
concerned, they say nothing in justification of their being ousted for
ever. As far as 35 matters are concerned —the ones to be
rejoined and readopted—they say that there is a test of the
national interest. The question that I very humbly ask the House is:
why should the test of national interest be applied to one group but
not the other? Why should the test of national interest not be applied
to each and every one of the 130? However, that is not the test. In so
far as the question of ousting some 95 or so is concerned, the test is
a knee-jerk one. It is Europe. We do not like Europe. One can almost
hear the words of Cato in the Roman Senate—not
“Carthago delenda est” but “Europa delenda
est”. That is the clarion call. Europe must be defeated and
challenged at every point. That is the real issue.</hs_para>

statements made by the Government over the past few years, it is
abundantly clear that there has never been any objective, open-minded
approach to the question. Mr David Lidington, the Minister for Europe,
in December 2011 made it quite clear that as far as he was concerned
all the evidence would be produced, all the discussions would be
reported and Parliament would be assisted in every way to come to the
most mature and objective conclusion with regard to this matter. Then,
on 15 October last year, we had the Home Secretary making clear that
there would be a general opt-out—it had to be en masse; there
was no other way—but that the 35 would be regarded in the light
of the national interest. However, three weeks previous to that, as we
have already heard, the Prime Minister had seen fit to speak to
journalists in Rio de Janeiro and had said that we would exercise the
opt-out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072380000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072380000007">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T20:25:14"></hs_TimeCode>
situation, therefore, is that the opt-out is a fact and a reality. It
is an irrevocable legal consequence once it occurs; but in so far as
rejoining is concerned, that is an aspiration. We may be able to
achieve that in respect of all 35, but we may not be able to, as there
may well be conditions that we will find impossible to accept. There
may well be a hiatus. I cannot remember now whether hiatus is a second
declension noun and therefore whether “hiati” is the
plural, but there may be several hiatuses and it may very well be
utterly destructive as far as many institutions are concerned,
including the European arrest warrant, Europol and Eurojust and so on.
Therefore, a high price may well have to be paid. What for? For nothing
at all. The Home Secretary made it clear on 15 October last year that
some of these 95 matters never applied to us in the first place. Many
were redundant and many were minimal in their effect. What earthly
motivation can there be to take a risk just in order to wipe the slate
clean of such irrelevant
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T20:26:47"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072380000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072380000008">I
believe that the Government are acting here with less than total

strong reason for opting out of all these measures. Maybe
there are reasons for opting back in to some of them, but there is a
strong reason for starting with the presumption that we should opt out.
The mistake that the committee, and I am afraid maybe the Government,
made was to look at each of these measures pragmatically, on the
marginal basis of whether there was some value in each particular

voting on all these measures once we have opted in. The UK will not
have a veto, and the UK Parliament will not be able to take a view on
whether those measures are just and appropriate treatment for UK
citizens because we will have opted in to something where the European
legislator can decide on changes to any of these measures by qualified
majority voting.</hs_para>

but about what future Governments may do. We have very little control
over the way in which future Governments in this country may operate,
and we have even less control over what may happen to Governments in
other parts of the European Union. This amounts, in effect, to a huge
Henry VIII transfer of powers out of this country to a body over which
this Parliament will no longer have control. This is happening in a
vital area of law affecting the criminal justice system and
the freedoms and rights of every UK citizen. I cannot see how the UK
Parliament can happily stand by and say that we should not opt out of

seems to me that many of these 35 measures go far beyond what one could
justify in terms of benefiting UK citizens without running the risk of
democratic deficit. The European arrest warrant has been mentioned many
times. Fundamentally, it allows courts outside the UK, by laws passed
outside the UK, to determine that a UK citizen should be deprived of
his rights and sent to another country to face justice and internment
without any UK court having the right to decide whether those laws were
just and whether the evidence justified it. I do not believe that any
of us can stand in front of a UK citizen and justify that as being in
their interest. It may be efficient—dictatorship is
efficient—but it is not democratic. The Government say that they
have some measures that will ameliorate the worst aspects of that. I am
not sure—and this House needs 
<?notus-xml column=1263?>to be sure—that those measures will actually stand up against the
European Court before we can be satisfied that the European arrest
warrant has been dealt with. The same is true of the measure on the
mutual recognition of confiscation of assets, where individuals in this
country can have their assets frozen and confiscated by order of a
court outside the UK without any UK court having the right to challenge
the evidence and interrogate whether or not those laws were being
applied
appropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072380000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072380000021">Europol

been enormously struck, as I imagine the whole House has
been, by three aspects of the Government’s nature and manner of
doing business, which have been thrown into relief by this whole
episode. The first is their extraordinary incompetence in evidently not
getting any legal advice before they proceeded down this road. Nobody
in the private sector would dream of going into a complicated
negotiation of a totally new kind, with new risks attached to it, with
important partners on an important matter, and not getting appropriate
legal advice.</hs_para>

under the Government’s own European Union Act. I hope that the

second aspect of the Government’s conduct that strikes me, and I
think would strike anybody, is the extraordinary way in
which they have treated Parliament. Not to reply at all to a very
weighty document produced by two sub-committees jointly,

few hours before the relevant debate arises, is either almost
unbelievable incompetence or discourtesy to the House that borders,

unparliamentary word so I certainly will not use it. It is quite clear

third aspect of the Government’s performance is the one that
most attention has quite rightly been focused on—the way in
which they reach policy decisions and their policy-making procedures.
When I was a Minister and was faced with difficult choices, I would
draw up a balance sheet of costs and benefits of any particular
measure. I would try to weight them to achieve a balance and use that
as an intellectual framework for discussions with officials or, where
necessary, with colleagues. I was never conscious that I was doing
anything remarkable or unusual; I assumed that most responsible
Ministers went through a similar kind of procedure either explicitly or
implicitly. Not so this
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072380000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#13072380000031">The
Motion mentions national interest, but it is quite clear that national
interest has not guided the Government in this matter at all. You might
assume that if you have 135 measures and you want to opt out of 100
definitively and opt back in to 35, those 35 were in the national
interest and the 100 were not, which is why you want to get rid of
them. The Government are even prepared to pay a significant price in
terms of uncertainty, use of good will on the continent with their
continental and Irish partners, and the administrative cost of going
through all sorts of elaborate renegotiations, no doubt having to cope
with the lacunae and lapses that arise. They are prepared to do all
that in order to save the country from being tied to the 100 measures
that they wish to opt out from.</hs_para>

fact, as has been said this evening, of those 100 measures

defunct or unnecessary, in which case they have a neutral significance.
They are neither positive nor negative. But some of them are useful,
although not dramatically vital in the way that the European arrest
warrant or Naples II are really vital to the national interest.
However, the Government’s own document, the White
Paper—which, believe it or not, I have read through—deals
with some of the measures that the Government propose to drop, to opt
out of and not to opt back in to. Take, for example, item number 2 on
judicial co-operation. The Government’s own document

decision. They incur the costs and risks of this complicated process of
opting out and opting back in not to protect this country from some
problems or costs but to deny it some additional benefits—if not
enormous ones. We all know why they have done so: to buy off the
Eurosceptics, and the cost of that is quite easily calculated. First,
there are the costs and risks associated with the opting back in

out to undermine the autonomy of member states’ criminal justice

We have to answer certain questions. Can we negotiate the opt-ins to
our satisfaction? Can we avoid a gap between the opting out and the
opting in? Are we using good time to renegotiate the opt-ins when we
could have used it to update and improve the existing provisions?
However, it is practical politics—it is foolish not to accept

be a compromise and we in this part of the coalition believe that this

Judd:</Member></B> My Lords, I have known the noble Lord, Lord
Stoneham, for a number of years and we have become good friends. I am
sure he will not mind my saying that it pains me to see Liberals whom I
have respected for their idealism and uncompromising stand on so many
things that are vital to our nation going through the process of
rationalising and trying to persuade themselves that compromises that
they would have condemned out of hand in their days of opposition are
somehow
acceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307243000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307243000002">I
should also like to draw attention to what my noble friend
Lord Foulkes said about the letter we received today with
the Government’s reply. He drew attention to the disingenuous
words about wishing “to ensure as comprehensive and detailed a
response as possible”. What the hell is the point of the reply?
The reply is there to inform the debate. How on earth can a
reply to a serious report, which has been prepared over many
months, be taken properly into account in a debate if it arrives just
hours before the debate begins? The Government ought to be ashamed of
themselves for behaving in this way. We quite understand the tangles
and difficulties with which the Government are faced within their own
ranks, but this amounts, in effect, to a wanton disregard of the
significance and dignity of Parliament
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307243000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307243000003">I want
to make a couple of points. We have been talking a great deal tonight
about the measures—what we will accept and what we will not
accept. The measures
are not the end in themselves: the measures are
means 
<?notus-xml column=1268?>to achieving certain objectives. The objectives that
I hope we are trying to achieve are the safety and security of the
British people in the sphere of crime and, very much, in the sphere of
terrorism. The reality with which we are confronted is both that crime
has become highly sophisticated on an international basis in our
lifetime and that terrorism is, almost without any doubt, where it is
most dangerous, involved in international
realities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307243000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307243000004">There
is no way that we can protect the well-being, the safety and the
interests of the British people by fooling ourselves into thinking that
we would be better at doing it on our own—that we may have to
make certain concessions to Europe but that we can pick and choose
those things that happen to suit us. If we are to tackle this mammoth
strategic task for the safety and well-being of the British people, we
have to create an understanding and culture in this country that their
interests and well-being are inseparably intertwined with the
well-being and interests of other people within Europe, and that we
must have institutions working within the realms of security and
policing that are effective at the international level. If they are not
effective at the international level, we shall be trying to
put our thumbs in the dyke that is crumbling all around us. It is
crucial that we give this leadership to the nation, and the trouble is
that the Government

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord, whom I
have known for many years, but he is making a totally false point. Does
he not know that there is the most intense and intimate co-operation,
for example, between this country and the United States in the
intelligence sphere and in other ways, against international terrorism?
That is very necessary. These sorts of protocols and directives are
totally unnecessary. There will be co-operation with the United States,
with Europe and with other countries around the world whatever happens,

Judd:</Member></B> Similarly, I respect the noble Lord who has just
intervened, but I ask him to read the reports to which we are referring
today. Under the distinguished chairmanship of the noble Lords, Lord
Hannay and Lord Bowness, we listened to witness after witness from the
front line of this operation saying how badly they needed this European
co-operation and how it would be very unfortunate in any way to
jeopardise it, because it would not make the work that they were trying
to do on behalf of the British people more effective. Read the reports:

one further point. What has been so sad in this debate—not the
debate today but the one that is going on all the time in
Britain—is the failure to distinguish between what is emotion,
what is prejudice and what is fact. Because I was so concerned about a
particular issue that was receiving a lot of attention about the way in
which European institutions made it difficult to repatriate prisoners
when they had completed their prison terms, I tabled a Question on the
issue. I asked the

would have thought that the answer to that Question would have been
pretty central to serious deliberation in a debate of this kind. It is
seven weeks since I tabled that Question. Do the Government not keep
records? Do they not do any analysis? Why have I had no
answer to that Question? It is part of the refusal to face facts that I
suspect will not be very helpful to the Government’s case or to
prejudice and the xenophobic cause. Why can we not have these facts
before us before we try to undertake serious consideration in
Parliament?</hs_parafo>

consequences of the opt-out, if matters proceed as indicated, may be
less than favourable for the United Kingdom. If the decision is made,
on 1 December 2014 the Court of Justice and the European Commission
will have no powers in respect of these matters over the UK, but the

centralised facilities for liaison in The Hague. Instead, we would have
to have bilateral arrangements with the judiciary in each member state.

debate. Although in some ways the opt-out/opt-in issue is complex, with
the Command Paper showing how technical and detailed each measure is,
it is also very simple. The first duty of any Government is to ensure
the security and safety of their citizens. Will opting out and
then—as the government Motion states—seeking to opt back
into the key measures fulfil the first duty of a Government to their
citizens? The key word is “seek”. There are no guarantees
and there is no definite confirmation that we will opt back into those
measures that are necessary to fight crime and terrorism: just an
assurance that we will seek to do so. That is not good
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000017">Until

the delay? Are those British citizens in foreign prisons
victims of the Government’s anti-Europe rhetoric? But now, the

Baroness’s unwillingness to support 
<?notus-xml column=1278?>the Government on this Motion. If people say that there is no passion or
conviction in British politics, they should have been listening to this
debate, because it has shown that there is indeed a lot of passion and
conviction on this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000032">Before I
address the points that have been made during the debate, I join my
noble friend Lord McNally in thanking the noble Lords, Lord Boswell,
Lord Hannay and Lord Bowness, for their chairmanship of the committee,
which produced a formidable body of work for the Government to
consider, and its ongoing role in scrutinising this matter. The
Government are appreciative of the committee’s high-quality and
thoughtful report, which has been integral to the decision-making
process behind our decision to table the Motion this evening. I look
forward to working with the noble Baroness, Lady Corston, as chairman
of Sub-Committee
E.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000033">The
Government have today replied. Noble Lords have said that it is plenty
late enough, but we have replied to the committee’s report on
the matter. Copies of the reply are available and I am sure that a
number of noble Lords have taken the opportunity to look at it. We
would like noble Lords to consider it alongside the letter of 18 July,
sent to the noble Lord, Lord Boswell, which can be found in
the Library of the

return to today’s business, I am grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord Hannay, and to my noble friend Lord Bowness for meeting me
yesterday. It was incredibly helpful to me personally, and the amended
Motion that we have tabled reflects the outcome of these
discussions. I hope that the whole House can support the government
Motion. I would regret it if that were not the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000035">On 9
July, the Home Secretary reaffirmed the Government’s intention
to exercise the opt-out. Noble Lords will be aware of the background to
the opt-out and there is no need to remind them of its origins.
However, as I listened to the speeches from the Benches opposite, I
wondered why, when they were in office, they negotiated the opt-out.
They must have believed in it once, so what has happened to that
belief? As my noble friend Lord Hodgson asked, why did they take such
care to ensure that the Lisbon treaty contained this protocol, the
provisions of which we now seek to exercise?</hs_para>

July, there was a debate on this issue and a vote to exercise the
opt-out and rejoin the measures where it is in the national interest to
do so. I am grateful to my noble friends Lord Sharkey, Lord Bowness,
Lord Eccles and Lord Hodgson—and many other noble
Lords—who said that they find the 35 measures that the
Government seek to rejoin sensible. The noble Lord, Lord Williamson,
also agreed that these were sensible measures for the Government to
seek to rejoin.</hs_para>

friend Lord Blackwell that the Government have made a considered
judgment on this issue. They are confident that, in using the test of
the national interest, they have properly identified those 35 measures
that they will seek to rejoin. These 35 measures listed in the Command
Paper represent government policy. My noble friend and I will have to
agree to differ about whether we are right to seek to rejoin those 35
measures.</hs_para>

if I explain what happens next. On that point, I must return to the
question of scrutiny and the work of the European Union Committee. I
think that all noble Lords accept that the European Union can play an
important role in tackling cross-border crime. This Government
understand that, but equally we understand that decisions taken at EU
level, or about the EU’s role in dealing with crime,
must be subject to rigorous scrutiny. That is only correct and the UK
Parliament must be sovereign in exercising this
scrutiny.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000039">Scrutiny
can be an iterative and long-running process, especially on a matter
such as this. That is why today’s Motion from the Government
invites the European Union Committee to give a further view on
what measures it believes we should rejoin. I hope that
Command Paper 8671, which sets out those measures that the Government
believe are in the national interest to rejoin, provides a useful
starting point. I hope sincerely that the House can endorse that list
today, but let me be clear that any endorsement cannot pre-empt the
work of either the committee here or the committees in the other place
in looking at all the measures. I expect that that is the point at
which the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Stamford, can apply his
scrutineering endeavours, since he went through various measures on
which he had comments to make. I expect our committee in this House to
come back with a thorough examination of the Government’s
decision and I look forward to receiving it.</hs_para>

the House to note that the Government have committed to not beginning

reports will be carefully considered by the Government. Further to

perhaps explain to me, if to no one else, the following? In the debate
in the other place, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary said
that the mandate that she was seeking that evening would lead to the UK
exercising the opt-out. Precisely when is it envisaged that we will

the rejoining of 35 measures. That is quite clear and it was the

Exactly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T21:40:45"></hs_TimeCode>. There
will be informal negotiations to start with because, until the reports
from the sub-committee are produced in November, the Government do not
intend to open up formal negotiations. The noble Lord is exactly right
and I am grateful. I should have given way to him earlier. It was a
very helpful intervention on his part.</hs_para>

and the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, repeated this. There is a very
clear answer and I will read it. The European Union Act sets clear
criteria for when a referendum would be necessary. These are set out in
Section 6 of the Act. This decision is not one of the areas where a
referendum is required. Changes to the Treaty on European Union, the
TEU, or the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, the TFEU,
or a decision made under Article 48(6) of the TEU potentially attract a
referendum under the European Union Act 2011. The 2014
decision is not a treaty change, nor a decision under Article 48(6) of
the TEU. Instead, it is something that flows from the existing treaty
and, as such, it is not subject to a referendum. I hope that that
categorical assurance reassures the House on this issue.</hs_para>

discussions about whether we are right to exercise the opt-out. The

whether this was a wise decision. My noble friend
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T21:42:53"></hs_TimeCode> Taverne
questioned whether we were doing the right thing and a number of noble
Lords have also done so. The Government are of the view that
we should exercise the opt-out for three reasons: principle,
policy and pragmatism. On principle, it is our view that the
UK’s international relations in the field of police and criminal
justice are a matter, first and foremost, for the Government. For
example, the Government believe that, if necessary, we should have the
option to amend our bilateral UK-US extradition and mutual legal
assistance treaties as we and the US wish. However, currently any
changes would need to be in conformity with the EU-US
agreements.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1307244000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000058">In
terms of policy, the UK has and will continue to have the ability to
choose whether it should opt in to any new proposal in the field of
justice and home affairs. It is therefore only right that we take the
opportunity to consider on a case-by-case basis whether we wish to
retain the pre-Lisbon measures and allow the CJEU to exercise
jurisdiction over them. The key question that the Government have asked
themselves in this regard is whether it is in the national interest to
rejoin a particular measure.</hs_para>

we are being pragmatic. We are not going to be in a position to
implement Prüm, for example, which requires member states to
allow reciprocal searching of their databases for DNA profiles, vehicle
registration and fingerprints, before December 2014. Implementation is
likely to take years and require substantial funding. By choosing to
remain bound by Prüm after 1 December 2014, we run the very
serious risk of being infracted 
<?notus-xml column=1282?>for failing to meet our obligations under the EU.
The Home Secretary and Justice Secretary set all this out in a letter
last Thursday. Others can disagree with it, but the case has been made
and that is the Government’s position.</hs_para>

which has been stressed again by noble Lords, about why we are having
this vote today. I think the nub of the question put to me by the noble
Lord, Lord Richard, was, “Why do we need a vote today?”.
We need, as I have said, to begin these informal discussions but we
need also to allow some time for scrutiny of the measures and the
decisions as they go along. The EU Committee has suggested in its
report that the Government should have started negotiations at a much
earlier stage. However, the Government would have been presumptive to
have done so without allowing Parliament to have a say on the matter.

lot of anxieties have been expressed, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Smith, repeated the point about the risk of a gap between our opting
out and our rejoining. Noble Lords will of course understand that there
will be a transitional arrangement. The timetable is that the actual
opt-out does not occur until 1 December 2014, so there is a
period for negotiations, which we believe will include transitional
arrangements. We do not see a gap as being a serious obstacle for us in
presenting to our European colleagues a proper case for renegotiation
in respect of those bodies that we want to opt in to. Indeed, all the
discussions that we have had with colleagues in Europe have given us
the feeling that we can be confident that they will be pleased that we
have actually made a decision on this matter and that we will be in a

After 31 May, not only will impact assessments be generated for each of

noble Lords on this issue but I hope that we can establish, on the
terms of the debate that we have had this evening, a proper dialogue so
that we can actually discuss these issues and give those people who
disagree with the Government a proper sense that they have an

The Government will make the decision but it will be up to Parliament
to endorse it in a vote after 31 May. This is a matter where the
Government and Parliament will be in constant dialogue. As I have said,
there will be a debate in this House, I hope, in November. I hope that
noble Lords will be furnished with arguments by the committee of this
House that will enable us to discuss this issue properly at
that

has been a good debate. This Government are not frightened of criticism
and are prepared to seek to answer it. The choice before us is whether
we exercise the opt-in and rejoin measures, where it is in the national
interest to do so, or we do nothing. I am firmly of the view
that we should opt out, but it is most certainly in the national
interest to seek to rejoin measures that help to combat cross-border
crime and keep our country safe. I hope that the House will also
endorse the measures in Command Paper 8671 and strengthen the
Government’s negotiating hand. I know that the European Union
Committee can further help the Government and this House by further
scrutinising the measures that it feels the Government should rejoin.
This can only enhance the debate. I am very pleased that the terms of
today’s Motion have encouraged the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, not
to press his amendment. I hope that I have also shown that the
Government are prepared to listen to these

Trimble:</Member></B> My Lords, the question is, “Why
Khodorkovsky?”. There are a number of reasons. First, he is a
successful businessman. He turned around a high-cost loss-making
company into profit and increased production so that by 2003 it
produced 20% of Russia’s oil and was Russia’s
second-largest taxpayer. The leading Russian business newspaper, a
joint <I>Financial Times</I>/<I>Wall Street Journal</I> venture called
<I>Vedomosti</I>, awarded Khodorkovsky its entrepreneur of the year
prize. Secondly, he challenged Putin. In a televised confrontation with
Putin he cited opinion polling showing, among other things, that half
the public believed that corruption had spread to a majority of state
officials—including at the highest levels—and that more
than 70% thought the use of the official justice system a waste of
time. He concluded, “Corruption is spreading in this country.
You could say that it started right here. And now is the time to end
it”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000074">Thirdly,
many feel that Putin’s response—arresting Khodorkovsky in
October 2003 and driving his company into bankruptcy—marked a
turning point in the development of the regime. The journalist Andrei
Kolesnikov, described by Ben Judah as “the only ever
defector” from Putin’s inner circle of St Petersburg
friends, recalled a conversation with Putin in 2005 when he said,
“I don’t like that after you arrested Khodorkovsky, I
lost the feeling that I lived in a free country. I have not started to
feel fear—”. Putin then interrupted him and said,
“And did you not think that this was what I was aiming
for”?</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1287?><hs_para UID="1307244000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000075">Kolesnikov recalls that
after Putin’s inauguration in 2000 he was approached by a senior
member of Putin’s inner circle to manage some funds for him. The
funds initially came as gifts from various oligarchs. Kolesnikov was
told that Putin wanted part of this money put into offshore funds. By
2005, $200 million had accumulated in this fund. In that year he was
told to build a small house by the Black Sea for Putin—just
1,000 square metres, costing just £14 million. The project
ballooned. The house became four times the size and was joined by a
casino, a church, swimming pools and helipads, a summer amphitheatre
and a winter theatre. Until the 2008 financial crisis, Kolesnikov
divided the special fund between the building project and investments
in a host of other businesses across Russia. Then he was told that all
the funds were to be spent on the Black Sea palace. Kolesnikov later
broke with Putin and fled the country. Ben Judah, in his book

the Kolesnikov documents seem to show us is that Putin never changes.
Instead, as he has grown more powerful, he grew ever more corrupt
… He cannot change—and as long as he is in power, neither
can Russia. Nor can the incestuous relationship of power and corruption
that spiralled out of control under Yeltsin ever
end”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="1307244000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000076">In
2007, after four years in detention, Khodorkovsky, whose trial had
concluded in 2005 with an eight-year sentence, would have been eligible
for release on parole, but in February of that year, new charges were
announced which led to another conviction in December 2010. In February
2004 Khodorkovsky made his first application to the European Court of
Human Rights, which concerned the circumstances of his arrest and
pre-trial detention. In May 2011 the court ruled that there had been
breaches of the convention and awarded the modest claim for $10,000 in
full.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000077">In March
2006 a second application was made to the ECHR concerning the first
trial. This was ruled admissible in 2011 and last week it became known
that judgment would be given on 25 July. A third application to the
ECHR remains pending as does a fourth. As to the substance of these
cases, I think it is sufficient to note that the International Bar
Association’s Human Rights Institute, which had an observer at
the second trial, concluded that the proceedings were unfair and had
not produced clear proof of guilt. Many others
agree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000078">Khodorkovsky
will become eligible for parole in a year’s time but there are
fears of a third trial. These fears are reinforced by current events.
Sergei Magnitsky, a young lawyer who exposed a huge tax fraud in which
many government officials were involved, was arrested and died in
prison in 2009. Last month he was posthumously tried and convicted of
tax offences. Bill Browder, a British citizen, was convicted in his
absence in the same trial. How do the Government view that conviction?
Last week Alexei Navalny was convicted of embezzlement in another sham
trial. Navalny came to prominence as a blogger exposing official
corruption. He coined the phrase, “United Russia is the party of
crooks and thieves”, and was prominent in the demonstrations
protesting the fraudulent elections in 2010 and 2012. Putin weathered
those protests, which were mainly confined to the emerging Moscow
middle class. This led Navalny’s wife, Julia, to say in despair,

<?notus-xml column=1288?>“Putin has decided to turn Russia into an authoritarian state
like Belarus. He is pushing, a bit here, a bit there, to find out how
far he can go. And there is only one thing that can stop him. A
gigantic protest, or the
West”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000079">Yet
Putin’s current policy is based on a huge gamble. In 2007 he
could balance the budget on an oil price of $40 a barrel. In 2012 he
needed a price of $110 a barrel and he cannot compensate by increasing
production. The technological changes pioneered by Khodorkovsky have
run their course and oil production is predicted to decline by 20% in
the coming decade, while shale and liquefied natural gas pose long-term
problems for Russia’s
gas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000080">What
should we do? First, we should be careful about the messages we send.
Sixty individuals have been identified as being involved in the tax
fraud Magnitsky uncovered and in his torture and death. In the USA,
legislation has been enacted banning them from entering the US. In
April, Dominic Raab tabled a Written Question asking if any of those

a few days later he wrote to <I>Hansard</I> with a different Answer,
this time saying in a letter that “applications for travel ...

disclose details of records of individuals and to reiterate that

best thing that I can say about this apparently craven response by the
Home Office is that it may be driven by a fear that in the absence of
legislation it could not defend the policy to deny entry, but I am sure
that the Kremlin will regard this as a fear of offending it.</hs_para>

true of last week’s decision by the Home Secretary to refuse a
request by Sir Robert Owen, the coroner conducting the inquest into
Litvinenko’s death. The coroner had requested a public inquiry
because he could not hear in public secret evidence that might show the
involvement of the Russian state in Litvinenko’s murder. Theresa
May’s letter to the coroner conceded that international
relations were a factor in the decision, and went on to say that
inquests were more readily explainable to foreigners than an inquiry
established by the Government under a chairman appointed by the
Government. I am sure that the reaction to that in the Kremlin can be
imagined. On this issue, I must ask the Minister: does this letter
indicate that the Government are intending to amend or even abandon the
Inquiries Act 2005, with the Home Secretary saying in effect that she
could not use that Act in this case for the reasons that she
gave?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307244000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307244000084">In
conclusion, we should have no illusions about the regime, and neither
avert our eyes nor appease. Russia’s legal system is an
extension of the ruling party, and the party and the Government as a
whole 
<?notus-xml column=1289?>are deep in corruption and will stop at nothing to preserve their power.
I hope that the European Court of Human Rights will indicate the
fundamental rights and freedoms of the convention in the cases that
come before it, but what do we say to such a member of the Council of
Europe? We should firmly oppose human rights abuses and the distortion
of democracy; we should remind the Russians of their obligations as a
member of the Council of Europe; we should press for a European law on
the Magnitsky case—I say European because the Russians are adept
at trying to divide the European countries on these issues—that
imposes visa bans and freezes assets; and we should address the
corruption that pervades the Russian system and, at the very least,
stop the laundering of the dirty money that flows from there to here.
That at least would hurt them in their
pockets.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_23_PT_1/5AE65293A20D56A5F0BDC18B2A4488E2B4503ABA" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 July 2013">Tuesday,

on record our appreciation of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on
Human Rights for the work that it does on this issue and the material
results of its research, which are made available to us.</hs_para>

serving prison terms in Russia for what are described as economic

symptomatic of the weak rule of law in Russia. Entrepreneurs are too
often jailed on trumped-up charges by manipulative investigators and
judges. Only 1% of cases in Russian courts result in acquittal. Indeed,
the workings of a court in Russia have been described as
“telephone justice”, with external pressure all too
evidently exerted on judges to produce a particular verdict.</hs_para>

spoken well about the case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky. The oligarch has
spent a decade in prison after two consecutive trials—the second

he is due to be released next year there are sinister hints that a
third case could be on the way. The heaviest hint came in the form of
the release of a documentary from the once independent but now wholly
tainted television channel NTV, alleging that the oligarch was behind
the murder of the mayor of Nefteyugansk in 1998. Putin himself has

already taken to court, five have lost administrative cases and have
been ordered to pay fines and register. At least one has been closed.
Another 15 organisations that received direct notices of violation from
the prosecutor’s office may face administrative charges if they
fail to register as foreign agents. Authorities have warned at least 38
groups to register as foreign agents if they receive foreign funding
and plan to carry out what are described as political activities, which

it against individuals engaged in routine discussions with foreign

dramatically increased the maximum penalty for violating rules
regulating protests and introduced new restrictions on public protests.
Russia’s constitutional court has ruled that several of the
law’s provisions were unconstitutional and the Venice

majority involving multiple violations of the European convention. The
lamentable inadequacy of official investigations in too many of these
cases has been on a scale that indicates a systemic and continuing
failure. Recently, Putin has certainly been shoring up his political

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, I also commend my noble friend Lord
Trimble for bringing this important matter to your Lordships’
House and presenting it with his usual methodical and forensic
accuracy. The timing of this debate is important, as he has pointed
out, given the legal cases in Russia and those coming up at the
European Court of Human Rights. However, the timing of the debate at
this hour of the evening means that I do not intend to repeat what he
has already said with such clarity about the case
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T22:27:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of this case, as the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, is its significance
regarding the deterioration of freedom and democracy in Russia. Since
Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s arrest, there has been an extraordinary
increase in the number of political prisoners in Russia; by most
estimates, there are now more than in Belarus. The arrest of
Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev in 2003 on fraud charges was probably
the first major such politically motivated case brought against Kremlin
opponents under Putin. Khodorkovsky was supporting the liberal
opposition Yabloko party of my old friend, Grigory Yavlinsky, and
challenging corruption and authoritarianism in Russia under Mr Putin,
as my noble friend has said. The Russia leader—not the first to
do so—saw the legal process as one that could be used to
intimidate dissenters. In the words of one of my Russian colleagues, he
almost killed off politics from 2003 until December 2011, when the
people, outraged by election fraud, came out en masse to
protest. In 2009, as my noble friend has pointed out, additional
charges of embezzlement were brought against Khodorkovsky and Lebedev
and, now, a third case against the defendants may effectively result in
life sentences for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000003">Then
there was the case of the Yukos executive and former company director,
Vasily Aleksanyan, who, according to the European Court of Human
Rights, was improperly imprisoned and treated in an inhuman and
degrading fashion, resulting in his premature death 
<?notus-xml column=1292?>in 2011, some time after he was released from prison as a result of
international pressure. In the Yukos case, Russia abused the European
Court of Human Rights by, for example, repeatedly replacing the ad hoc
Russian judge five times, so that every time a new judge came in, he or
she would have to familiarise themselves with all the papers, thus
delaying the whole process.</hs_para>

another example of manipulation of the court system to silence critics.
Here, three young women were convicted in August 2012 of hooliganism,
motivated by religious hatred, for an illicit performance of their rock
group in the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour in Moscow. Advised or
ill-advised as that may have been, these performance artists were
challenging the Kremlin’s increasingly close relationship with
the Russian Orthodox Church, which has, sadly, become a central player
in Putin’s strategy for national unity. Two of these women are
currently serving two-year prison
sentences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000005">The
Bolotnaya Square case, brought against 12 defendants for
allegedly rioting on Moscow’s Bolotnaya Square on 6 May, the eve
of Putin’s inauguration, was largely viewed as a provocation by
police to undermine the protest movement. Those 12 people, many of whom
had never before even participated in political demonstrations in their
lives, are now defendants in a show trial and face up to 10 years in
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T22:30:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000006">Therefore,
with Khodorkovsky, Lebedev, the pre-inaugural 6 May case and Pussy
Riot, Russia is now host to many political prisoners—and their
numbers are rising. For example, there is the recent case of the
opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, and that of Yabloko’s Pyotr
Ofitserov, whose only crime was knowing Navalny; Magnitsky’s
post-mortem conviction has already been mentioned; Yabloko’s
activists now in jail such as Maxim Petlin, on a trumped-up bribery
charge as he fought with a developer who tried to destroy a public
garden; and Ivan Bolshakov and Vasily Popov, who were convicted and
given sentences on fake evidence for their political activities.
Then<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T22:31:31"></hs_TimeCode> there are
the suspected murders of journalists and human rights activists. Anna
Politkovskaya was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and Yuri
Shchekochikhin investigated corruption in the KGB and died
mysteriously—like Litvinenko—a couple of months after the
first publication of his investigation; and there are many
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000007">Therefore,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T22:31:52"></hs_TimeCode> Khodorkovsky
case is important not just in itself but because it has paved the way
for politically motivated reprisals in Russia. Intimidation and
reprisals against political dissenters and opposition have turned into
daily practices for the Russian authorities—from intimidation,
searches and wiretapping to imprisonment and even, it is clear,
extrajudicial killings. In addition to human rights concerns, this
increase in political persecution is resulting in increased Russian
asylum cases in the European Union, which has a direct impact on the EU
economy and society. For example, one young man, Mr Dolmatov, was
implicated in the Bolotnaya case, fled, and then committed suicide in a
Dutch detention centre after being denied asylum in the Netherlands.
Other well known figures such as Garry Kasparov and Sergei Guriev have
left Russia for the US and France respectively due to their fear of
arrest.</hs_para>

these discouraging highlights, it is important to remember that there
are many Russians inside the country who are fighting for democracy and
human rights. They need our unwavering political and moral
support—from the whole of the international community. Thousands
of Russians are working steadily for peaceful democratic change in
Russia. Putin’s attempt to use the legal process and other
processes to frighten his citizens through the prosecutions we have
mentioned will not ultimately work. Dozens of new political parties
registered last year and are running candidates in the local elections
on 8 September. Thousands of civic activists are preparing to monitor
those elections. Those anonymous but courageous Russians want to change
their country for the better and they deserve our continuing attention

Hylton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Trimble,
for raising this matter tonight. After the end of the Soviet Union, I
had a long involvement in Russia with both churches and
organisations for disadvantaged children and young people. In the
course of this, I met Mr Khodorkovsky when he was a free man visiting
London. I was impressed by him and by his efforts to make Yukos Oil a
normal, responsible and transparent internationally quoted company. I
also admired the work of the Open Russia Foundation that he started,
which sought to make the young Russian generation full

that Mr Khodorkovsky may have breached an informal agreement with his
Government by taking a position in politics. However, it is worth
noting that he returned voluntarily to Russia in 2003 when he could
have stayed abroad and joined other exiled oligarchs. He went back to
prove his innocence, and in solidarity with his partner, Mr Platon
Lebedev, who had by then been arrested. In the same year, the then
chairman of the Russian President’s advisory commission on the
judiciary said of the
trial:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1307249000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000094">“There

is also true that his legal counsel was harassed and wrongly called as
a witness. In 2007, the European Court of Human Rights found that Mr

fate of Yukos Oil was also most unsatisfactory. Its assets were
compulsorily sold for less than full value to semi-state companies such
as Gazprom and Rosneft. It is likely that the treatment was a breach of
the Energy Charter Treaty 1994, to which Russia was a party. The fact
that Russia got away with this behaviour led naturally to BP’s
bad experience in its joint venture with TNK, and to Shell’s
serious problems over Sakhalin
Island.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000015">I turn
to the second trial, which took place over 21 months in
2009-10 and led to a prison sentence of 13 and a half years.
It is highly relevant that it was criticised by Russian institutions as
well as by the International Bar Association and Amnesty International.
More important critics were our Foreign Secretary and the noble
Baroness, Lady Ashton, on behalf of the EU. A
further point is that the location of Mr
Khodorkovsky’s imprisonment may have violated Russia’s
criminal executorial code, which states that convicted persons should
be held in their home region and not sent to Siberia. The implications
for visits from their family and others are
obvious.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000016">A wise

wrote that our two countries had many common interests and that it was
unwise to expect a rapid Russian evolution to the full rule of law and

stand by the European Convention on Human Rights and Russia’s
other international obligations, and should make clear their abhorrence

light of this advice and of this debate, what is the

Human Rights in Strasbourg to bring forward consideration of pending

British response, could prevent the holding of a third trial of the two
men. It could also lend some protection to Mr Alexei Navalny, who has
already been mentioned in the debate. He is a Russian anti-corruption
lawyer and opposition leader who faces a five-year sentence. I urge the

Baroness because I am sure that her remarks will be of greater interest
to the House than mine. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, I pay tribute
to the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, for securing this debate and, also
like him, I had the opportunity to meet Mr Khodorkovsky in 2003 at the
World Economic Forum annual meeting, where he spoke very passionately
and persuasively. He was the star of the show. At the time, he was
Russia’s richest man and chief executive 
<?notus-xml column=1295?>of Yukos and could seemingly do no wrong. He spoke of the importance of
corporate governance and independent oversight and was innovative in
bringing foreign investors on to the board of his company to improve
oversight. He was passionate about shareholder rights and issues of
that nature. We were all greatly impressed by this man. At that meeting
he invited us to attend the first annual corporate governance summit on
investment in Russia, which was to be held in Moscow later that
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T22:44:09"></hs_TimeCode>. We all
dutifully turned up in Moscow only to find that our host and
sponsor was in prison. That was a bit of a shock and did immense damage
to foreign perceptions, particularly as regards foreign investment as
many institutional investors had turned

do not think there is any doubt about how this situation came about. Mr
Khodorkovsky was a very rich and powerful man. In the period between
the January Davos summit and his own summit in Moscow he had declared
that he intended to stand down from the chief executive position at
Yukos in 2007.Given that President Putin’s term was to come to
an end in 2008, that was a very clear indication that Mr
Khodorkovsky’s intent was to pursue political office. It would
not be the first time that the lethal cocktail of oil, political
ambition and extraordinary wealth led to some pretty unpleasant
happenings. The mechanism by which the events happened became clear
afterwards. In an article in <I>Time</I><I> </I>magazine in January

this regard, we need to recall how, going back through history,
Russian-UK relations have been a strength. As far back as the
Napoleonic Wars, the Great War and the Second World War, we have been
on the same side; our interests have been aligned. When we are tempted
to engage in that rather simplified gesturing towards Russia, it does
little to improve our misconceptions. If we really want to understand
the Russian people, we need to start reading a little more of Pushkin,
Chekhov, Tolstoy and Dostoevsky and a little less of John le
Carré, because Russia is today an important point of reference
for us in foreign relations. If we want to do anything about the

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, I apologise to the noble
Lord, Lord Bates; I had not realised that he was there waiting to
speak. I join in his congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Trimble,
not only on embarking on this debate but on giving us an extremely
concise and excellent description of the whole of the Khodorkovsky
case. He did it in a brilliant
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T22:49:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000027">I
am rather like the noble Lord, Lord Hylton: I know Mr Khodorkovsky to
some extent. I have come across him when I have spoken or been
lecturing at various higher education institutions in Moscow and in
other parts of Russia. What I can say about him is that he is an
extremely direct man. He is not very good at the more gracious elements
of the language, but he cannot stop himself from speaking out honestly
about the things that concern him, the things that he thinks are wrong.
He is also a man of that rather rare Russian characteristic, an almost
crazy kind of courage. One can say to him and to other Russian
dissidents that perhaps it is unwise to speak out, that it may be
foolish to fall out with the authorities, but they are almost unable to
be stopped, in many ways. They have the kind of almost crazy kind of
courage that one associates with the work of Dostoevsky or Chekhov. It
is still there.</hs_para>

brings me to what the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said. Alongside the long
list of terrible misjudgments, unfairnesses and abuses, about which my
noble friends Lord Trimble and Lord Alderdice have already spoken, it
is also true of Russia that there is always an amazing new harvest of
attempts to get freedom going again. NGOs spring up like grass in the
spring. New parties spring up all over the place; they die and come
back again. What is very striking about Russia—and one can see
it slowly moving on—is the level of growing commitment among
young Russians to something resembling not so much the rule of law as
the rule of liberty, and their willingness to put themselves at risk in
order to achieve it.</hs_para>

Hylton, spoke about the efforts that Mr Khodorkovsky had
made to try to deal with the plight of disadvantaged and
abandoned children, for example. He supported them financially in
a courageous and not at all prejudiced way. It does not seem
to have done him any good, but there is no doubt that he went out of
his way to spend money for that purpose. He also went out of his way to
spend money on educating young Russians, and has been willing to take
part in quite risky episodes of opposition. One that I might refer to
involved Pussy Riot, which has been mentioned. In prison, Mr
Khodorkovsky suddenly made public statements about his support for
them, which seemed to many of us a rather extraordinary thing to
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000030">What can we
do about it? There is a real prospect of a new generation in Russia

itself as having a President who talks the language of the old Tsars,

their favourite way of silencing opposition and Mr Putin seems to be
following in that
tradition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000031">There
are three points to make. One was implied by my noble friend Lord
Bates. He is quite right to ask whether there might not be reactions in
the market to attempts to stop, for example, innovation and technical
and other relationships with other countries. That is something that we
have not explored sufficiently and is something that Mr Putin would
understand; perhaps much better than a great many other fine moral
statements about freedom, which all of us share but which appear to cut
little ice with the Russian
President.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000032">The
second area, which is extremely important, is where we can exercise
influence through the many other links we have with Russia:
educational, musical, artistic and so forth. The third
area—which I shall be quite blunt about—is something that
we as a country might want to consider rather more carefully: which
Russians we allow to come and rest in our country and which Russians we
might find not fully acceptable. There is something that, in a way,
grinds on one’s mind when we allow such a string of Russian
oligarchs with dodgy pasts in terms of their behaviour in the economic
world by seizing Russia’s resources and exploiting them, then to
come to Britain where they will be protected by the police in order to
pursue obscure rows with one another, which are then dealt with in the
British courts. There is something odd about the fact that it is not
Russian dissidents, asylum seekers and courageous, outspoken men and
women who come to this country, but increasingly people who 
<?notus-xml column=1298?>come here almost entirely because of the assets they hold and the money
they have. We will often find that those seeking asylum are likely to

again praise my noble friend Lord Trimble and thank him for bringing

what he had to say. It was important to speak about the long string of
Russian crimes, sentences and misjudgments, and to say loud and clear
that we need to exercise over a much wider range than we have so far
sought to do, steps that will make it very difficult for Russians to
continue to do what they are doing with Khodorkovsky.</hs_para>

something that we should look at, which might speak more loudly to

convictions and prison sentences. It would therefore be inappropriate
for me to comment at all on the merits of those applications and I will

the quite extraordinary delays by the European court in reaching its
judgments. Your Lordships know that Mr Khodorkovsky has been detained
and then imprisoned by the Russian authorities since October 2003. His
first application to the European court was filed in February 2004. It
complained about his arrest, his detention, the conditions in which he
was detained and a number of other matters. The European court took

subsequent trial, conviction and sentence. The second trial began in
March 2009. It ended with a further prison sentence in December 2010.

to touch on is the record of the Russian Federation in Strasbourg. Last
year, in 2012, the Strasbourg court gave 134 substantive judgments in
cases concerning the Russian Federation. In 122 of those, it found at
least one violation of human rights. Some 36 of the cases concerned
breaches of the right to a fair hearing, while 64 cases involved
breaches of the right to liberty or security of person. The year 2012
was typical of the appalling human rights record in Strasbourg of the
Russian
Federation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T23:00:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Minister will also know that from 2004 until 2010, the Russian
Federation, alone among all Council of Europe countries, refused to

Russian Federation about Russia’s appalling human rights record,

bringing this timely debate, coming as it does two days before an
important judgment by the European Court of Human Rights on whether Mr
Khodorkovsky’s rights to a fair trial under Article 6 of the
European convention have been violated.</hs_para>

detained and imprisoned by the Russian authorities since October 2003,
nearly 10 years ago. It is fair to say that he is a controversial
character in post-Soviet Russian history, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Williams, pointed out. Prior to his arrest in 2003, he
enjoyed an astonishing—and astonishingly rapid—rise to
economic success, and to cultural and political prominence. He had a
career ranging from internet trainer, philanthropist and funder of
political parties to Minister of Fuel and Energy and financial trade
magnate. If the proposed merger between Yukos and Sibneft had gone
through after 2003, he would have been at the helm of one of the
world’s largest oil
companies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000045">During
this period, however, he became the subject of a range of allegations
concerning fraudulent activity: allegations that he engaged in
asset-stripping of Yukos for private gain, and that he engineered
forced sales of oil within the holding company to transfer billions of
roubles to shell companies owned exclusively by him. Whatever
one’s view of these allegations, the concern, which
tonight’s debate has shown is shared by Members on all sides of
the House, centres on Mr Khodorkovsky’s experience of Russian
justice—the circumstances and process surrounding his arrest,
trial and continued detention. The central point is that expressed by
the Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly’s Committee on
Legal Affairs and Human Rights in November 2004, when it said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1307249000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000104">“the

about three aspects arising from the long and continuing saga of this
case: first, the circumstances surrounding Mr Khodorkovsky’s
arrest and charges; secondly, his treatment in the Russian judicial and
prison system since he was detained; and thirdly, wider lessons for the
state of justice in Russia today. Starting with his initial
detention in 2003, Mr Khodorkovsky was arrested after an
investigation into the tax and financial arrangements surrounding
Yukos’s purchase of a stake in a company called Apatit. He was
arrested to appear as a witness, but within hours of being in custody
he was charged with fraud. In 2011, the European Court of Human Rights
found that his arrest
was,</hs_para><hs_quote UID="1307249000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000099">“unlawful

has been widely thought that the motives for his arrest and prosecution
go well beyond the pursuit of justice. Many have noted, for example,
that in February 2003, just a few months before formal investigations
began, Mr Khodorkovsky accused the Russian Government of large-scale
corruption at a meeting with President Putin that was broadcast on
Russian television. The European Court of Human Rights found in 2011
that it did not have sufficient evidence to conclude that his first
trial was politically motivated and that the charges against him were
grounded in “reasonable suspicion”. However, Mr
Khodorkovsky’s family and supporters, as well as the Council of
Europe 
<?notus-xml column=1301?>committee that I referred to earlier, see his detention as motivated by
a desire to weaken an outspoken political
opponent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T23:06:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0003.htm#1307249000049">Whatever
one’s views on political motivation, two worrying aspects of Mr
Khodorkovsky’s initial prosecution seem clear. First, the arrest
furthered a widespread impression that the Russian authorities were
engaged in selective prosecutions against those oligarchs and senior
businesspeople who had come into conflict with the Putin regime. In the
words of the US State Department, the

it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that part of the motivation

turn now to the second set of issues: the way in which Mr Khodorkovsky
has been treated by the Russian judicial and penal system since his

I turn briefly to the wider set of concerns, of which this case is
merely a particular example, about access to justice in Russia. Other

Politkovskaya and Natalya Estemirova. This is not an isolated case.
Just last week we saw Alexei Navalny, an anti-corruption campaigner,
sentenced to five years’ imprisonment for embezzlement. The case
bore many familiar hallmarks: ambiguity about the charges; an admission
by investigators that the authorities’ inquiries were prompted
by political activities on the part of the defendant; and
near-universal condemnation of the verdict by Russian media and public
opinion, as well as NGOs abroad. Mikhail Gorbachev commented after the

his death has been dropped. The fact that

this is about more than just setting out our concerns. It is also about
offering support to both the Russian authorities and civil society in
their efforts to try to strengthen the rule of law in Russia. On a
Government-to-Government level, we signed a UK-Russia memorandum of
understanding on justice co-operation in 2010. In this, we undertook to
exchange information and expertise through contact between legal

high-level contact between our respective Ministries of Justice. My
noble friend Lord McNally attended the St Petersburg International
Legal Forum in May this year, which allowed the opportunity for us to
offer support and advice on the value of a strong and independent

delivering in this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0004.htm#1307249000074">We have
also offered practical support and shared UK best practice through a
series of projects, including working with the Supreme Commercial Court
of the Russian Federation and the Russian probation service. It is true
that these projects sometimes take place in a difficult environment but
we believe that they have had a direct impact on the rule of law

Lord Pannick, asked about our view of the European court’s delay
in dealing with these cases. We recognise the importance of the
European Court of Human Rights for the protection of human rights
across Europe, but we recognise that it needs to be more efficient and
to focus on cases where it really is needed. These were the two
priorities that we felt were needed for reform of the court. The
Brighton declaration agreed last April has gone some way towards
achieving these, and we will continue to push for further meaningful
reform when negotiations start later in the year.</hs_para>

broader question about the UK’s approach towards human rights

Government’s commitment to human rights is strong and clear.
Human rights contain many of the basic rights and freedoms
that have been fundamental to British law for centuries, such as the
right to a fair trial, freedom from torture and freedom of speech.
These rights are vital in Britain today, as they were in earlier years
and as they are throughout the world. The Government agreed in the

Convention on Human Rights will continue to be enshrined in British
law.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1307249000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0004.htm#1307249000078">My noble

President Putin. My noble friend Lord Trimble spoke about the
Litvinenko case. The Government remain committed to seeking justice in
this case. We want to see a trial in the United Kingdom of the suspects
named by the Crown Prosecution Service. The Russian Government are in
no doubt about the strength of our feeling on this case. We believe
that the coroner’s inquest can continue to investigate

conclusion, it is right that the UK continues to call Russia to account
for this situation and other cases. Khodorkovsky is due to be released
on 15 October 2014. We must continue to encourage Russia to
fulfil its commitments to strengthen the rule of law and promote the
independence of the judiciary. President Putin has publicly said he
wants Russia to move up the international “ease of doing
business” tables, and make Russia a more attractive destination
for foreign investment. For this to happen, his Government need
demonstrably to support the development of a strong civil society and
to demonstrate that the rule of law is respected in Russia. Business
leaders must see evidence of the fair application of law. It is that
climate that will bring foreign investment to Russia. The release of
Khodorkovsky and Lebedev would be seen as a huge step internationally
towards that
goal.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="1307249000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-0004.htm#1307249000129">House

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, one of the themes running
through our debates on the Bill has been the need to ensure that the UK
has sufficient generating capacity to meet
likely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:32:57"></hs_TimeCode> demands
and to avoid power cuts. It is what is meant by security of supply.
This concern has been sharpened by last month’s worrying 2013
report from Ofgem on electricity capacity and the forecast of margins
falling perhaps even by the middle of this decade to dangerously low
levels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
central purpose of this Bill, through EMR, which is  at its
heart, is to address this issue, and the capacity market is one of its
principal instruments.</hs_para>

must say at the outset that in the circumstances in which the nation
finds itself Ministers have been quite right to identify this as a
solution to the capacity problem—or at any rate to try to find a
solution. They were right, too, to bring forward the first auction for
the capacity market to 2014. But to retain 2018-19 as the earliest date
for any payment under the capacity market is a serious mistake. What
matters to potential investors is not the date of the auction, but the
date on which they can be sure of the first payment if they are
successful in the
auction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:34:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000005">What
I suspect lies behind this four-year gap between the auction and the
payment is an idée fixe—an idea somehow firmly held
within the corridors of DECC that what it is addressing is really
confined to building new plant, for instance to commissioning new
generating plant such as a combined cycle gas-fired plant. Yet what we
are faced with now is that the problem is on us sooner than anyone had
anticipated. The Ofgem report has aroused a great deal of concern,
which is not unjustified. The National Grid, supported as one 
<?notus-xml column=424?>might expect by Ofgem, has reacted by suggesting what I can only
describe as a couple of temporary expedients, aiming to tide the system
over until the EMR really begins to bite towards the end of the decade.
My impression from the welcome briefings we have had, not least that of
yesterday, is that these temporary expedients are what DECC is really
basing its hopes on: that we shall not in fact have any power cuts.
What is strange is that these temporary expedients had previously been
rejected by DECC because of their potential adverse impact.</hs_para>

electricity capacity assessment concludes that risks to security of
supply are likely as early as 2014-15, driven by further reductions in
electricity supplies from the withdrawal of installed generation
capacity. The report also highlights that future policy and price
uncertainty are continuing to limit investment in thermal generation.
The assessment bolsters the case for bringing forward a mechanism to
deal with the underlying issues contributing to generation inadequacy,
which some commentators have described as the “missing
money” as in a world of high renewables, thermal plant will run
less and less often at suppressed prices. There is also the uncertain
economic viability of conventional generation going forward.</hs_para>

a form of strategic reserve with last-resort despatch. As I intimated
earlier, the strategic reserve was rejected by DECC, while
acknowledging that such a mechanism does not address the missing money
in the energy market but could even make the problem worse, in that
investors might fear that the strategic reserve will be deployed before
it is envisaged it would be—that is, when other capacity is
available, albeit at very high prices. This would dampen the investment
signal for players outside the strategic reserve, leading to what one
might describe as a slippery-slope effect whereby no new investment is
viable without an SBR contract. More and more capacity would then have
to be procured within the strategic reserve. The result is that it
simply displaces the ever-dwindling part of the market, with no
intervention<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:40:37"></hs_TimeCode>.

noble Lords may well remember that I drew attention to the substantial
amount of mothballed plant held by some of the larger generators. They
were mothballed because it is simply not economic to run them at
current prices and in the light of uncertain futures. Some of this
capacity could well be brought into production over the next six to 18
months, provided—this is what has to be hoisted on
board—that capacity market payments can be made as soon as the
plant is available and commissioned. That would happen if this

noble Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding, for tabling his amendment. We
discussed the capacity mechanism in the previous session, when our
focus was on the interplay between existing generation, more supply
coming on and the demand side of the capacity mechanism. This amendment
gets to the heart of how the capacity mechanism is proposed to work.
One of my major concerns about the Bill relates to this mechanism
because it is quite a dramatic intervention into the market, yet we
still have very little in the way of detail as to how it is proposed to
operate. I urge the Minister to give us some reassurances that we will
see the draft statutory instruments pertaining to this part of the Bill
as early as possible. It is one of the most unworked-through parts of
the Bill and it is only when the SIs  are drafted that we will
be able to answer some of these important questions raised by the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin of Roding. Can we therefore have some reassurances

sympathy with those who ask why we are in the process of introducing
two capacity mechanisms, because that is what is happening. We have the
temporary transition arrangements being consulted on by National Grid,
as outlined by the noble Lord, and we have  the more permanent
capacity mechanism that we  are discussing today. As the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, mentioned, it has become an idée fixe that
the mechanism cannot operate any sooner than 2018-19. Can I ask 
<?notus-xml column=426?>why that is? Is it because the institutional framework cannot be set up
in time or are there other barriers? Can the Minister explain why
2018-19 seems to be the year? I suspect that one of the factors might
be that there is a desire somehow to give time for new CCGT to be
built. If that is the case, I do not think that that argument really
stands up to much scrutiny given that there does not appear to be a
great appetite for the building of new CCGT in that timeframe. It is
more likely that, if gas comes back into the money, the mothballed
plant will come back. As has been alluded to, there is a substantial
amount of mothballed gas now on the system. The reason for that is that
those plants are losing money. Once you add to the cost of gas the
carbon-floor-price effect, those plants operate at a loss. We may even
see—in fact, it is predicted—more mothballing between now
and the end of the decade. While it might be nice to think that the
mechanism in the Bill is going to bring forward a huge swathe of

noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, made no reference to those plants which are
either under construction or for which planning permission has been
granted, and which may well be up and available, if not running, in the
period between 2014 and 2018-19. I think that he is taking the long
overdue siren noises from Ofgem of June a bit too seriously. Most
people just said, “It’s typical of Ofgem”. It has
taken so much longer to waken up to the fact that all this capacity is
going out because of European directives and the like that there is
going to be a problem. So his new-found urgency here I find somewhat
unconvincing, because of his dependence on Ofgem's latest edict. I am
not sure whether we need to wait four years, but I do not think that
six months is necessary. It would be helpful if the Minister could give
us some idea; it would be nice if 
<?notus-xml column=427?>we could get what was going to be in the SIs in the autumn, but not
necessarily that. Perhaps she could give us some idea of
the estimates and what the nuancing is of the
information. As far as I can see, there is idle plant which, if the
price was to rise, would become attractive to operate. Furthermore,
there are a number of schemes which are either in the course of
construction or would be accelerated once the process started. You do
not build a power station in six months; you build it in about three
and a half years. I suspect that that is the reason for the four-year
timeline. So I am not sure that we need the amendment at all, but it
would be helpful if the Minister could give us a clearer idea of the
forecasts from DECC and others on the availability of plant, which
would allay some of the

Ridley:</Member></B> I had not intended to intervene on this point, but
I would like to make a similar point to the noble Lord, Lord
O’Neill, although coming at it from a rather different
direction. I agree with him that what we will see in terms of the
capacity squeeze are price spikes, and, therefore, capacity coming back
into use. In that context, it is very well worth noting that, at the
cost end of the spectrum for the generators, there is an increasing
view among markets—not a consensus, which would be the wrong
word—that gas prices are likely to fall over the next few years.
I do not know whether anybody saw the <I>FT</I> blog from Nick Butler
yesterday, but he made the point that for four reasons gas prices are
likely to fall. Not one of those reasons 
<?notus-xml column=428?>included shale gas; he was saying that, even outside the effect of shale
gas, we are likely to see huge new resources coming on stream in the
Mediterranean and East Africa and offshore in the Americas, that the
LNG market will produce a much more globalised market in gas and that
the Japanese uptick in gas demand following the closure of the
Fukushima nuclear plant is coming to an
end<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T15:54:27"></hs_TimeCode>. Combine
that with falling demand in India and China, and it is quite possible
that we will see falling gas prices. It is quite possible that, as the
noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, said, we will be able to see this
mothballed plant come back into operation because of rising prices for
electricity and falling prices for gas without having to, as it were,
bribe them. It is important that we are not in the business of making
life easy for producers but in that of making life as easy as possible

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Energy and
Climate Change (Baroness Verma):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all
noble Lords for this short debate, and I thank my noble friend Lord
Jenkin for his amendment. Amendment 53BA proposes that payments under
capacity agreements should be commenced by the settlement body within
six months after the national system operator has run a capacity
auction. The Government have confirmed their intention of running the
first capacity market for delivery of capacity in 2018-19, subject to
state aid approval. Capacity auctions will take place four years and
one year ahead of the delivery year. For example, for the delivery year
2018-19, capacity auctions will be held in 2014 and 2017. Successful
bidders at auction will be awarded capacity agreements which provide a
steady payment for capacity in return for a commitment to deliver
electricity when required in a delivery year or face a
penalty.</hs_para>

agreements will not occur until the delivery year. This is because we
believe that payment should not occur until the plant is providing
capacity. We do not want consumers to pay in advance for a service that
they have not yet received. In addition, providing payment in the
delivery year means that plant performance can be tested and, if
necessary, penalties can be applied if performance is not as promised.
If payments were made ahead of the delivery year, that would be
impossible and might provide an incentive to game the system. Our
position is therefore that capacity providers should be rewarded for
delivery in a delivery year only, rather than in advance.</hs_para>

questioned whether the capacity market’s first delivery year
could be brought forward, and I suspect that that is likely to be the
aim behind his amendment—in fact, he made it clear that it is.
However, we have chosen a four-year gap for a good reason. If we do not
have such a gap—for example, if we run a capacity audience in
2014 for delivery in 2015-16—new plant would not be able to
participate, given the time required to build the plant, which was the
point made by the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill. This would mean we
would risk an uncompetitive auction with only existing plant competing
in what could be a tight market. We believe that this would lead to a
potentially inefficient auction and would risk consumers’ value
for money, a point raised by my noble friend Lord Ridley.</hs_para>

about the security of supply. We recognise that Ofgem’s 2013
capacity assessment suggested that there may be a capacity problem in
the middle of the decade. That is why we support National Grid and
Ofgem’s current consultation on the need for and the design of a
new balancing service for this period. If needed, this would keep
existing plant on the system or get it back on if it had been
mothballed for the period before the capacity market was in operation.
This would be limited intervention and would mean that we do not have
to run a full capacity auction with only existing plant competing. As
such, the proposed measures offer a cost-effective means to ensure
security of supply in the middle of the decade before the capacity
market starts to deliver capacity in
2018-19.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000026">I

consultation will most likely focus on ensuring that some plant is held
in reserve. I know that my noble friend is concerned that there will
not be enough capacity in reserve. This is a short-term intervention to
bring back already mothballed plant. The capacity market is a

until we have details of the statutory instrument that will implement
it. I entirely endorse her demand that this must be available before

seeing more mothballed plants by 2020. That is an estimate that I am
not in a position to either endorse or deny. She is also absolutely

Minister said something with which I entirely agree: there must be no

before it actually happens. I never suggested that. If she looks at
<I>Hansard </I>eventually she will see that I indicated,
“provided the market payments can be made as soon as plant is
available and commissioned”. That disposes of that argument
entirely. I am not for a moment asking that payments should be made in
advance. That is not how the system is supposed to work as I understand
it. My noble friend also seemed to imply that we could not have
different auctions for different years. For the life of me I cannot
understand why it should not be possible to have an auction for people
who would be able to bring back mothballed plant within, say, 18
months. If that were the conditions of the auction, the firms that have
mothballed plant and could bring it back within 18 months would be able
to bid for it. That does not mean that there would not be another
auction, even perhaps operating in parallel. There will not be many
takers in the early years. We were told the other day that contracts
for CFD might be over a period—was it 60? That is the sort of
numbers we are talking about. It should be perfectly possible to have
different auctions for different periods with the payments made
appropriate to the date of the auction. This needs to be examined more
carefully and we should not just accept my noble friend’s
assertion that it would simply muddle up the whole auction process. I
do not believe that for a moment. We can be a great deal more subtle

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, this is very much a probing
amendment, designed to enable us to discuss again the detail of how the
proposed capacity mechanism might work. One of the biggest problems
with the mechanism is that, on the one hand, it purports to be
technologically neutral by somehow treating all capacity as if it were
equivalent; yet, on the other, interventions are proposed that go
against that principle—the debate that we have just had is an
example of that. Deciding to host the first auction in 2018-19 is not a
technologically neutral decision; it is a decision designed to enable
CCGTs to compete—so, already, we have a conflicting message
coming from
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:19:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000044">Another
aspect of that lack of technological neutrality is the proposed
differing lengths of contracts. Again, this is explicitly stated as a
way of trying to rig the market in favour of a certain outcome. In this
case, it is offering potentially 10-year contracts to CCGTs and is
designed as a kind of carrot to get those plants built. Similarly,
three-year contracts might be made available for plant which is seeking
significant refurbishment—again, another intervention to try to
achieve a certain outcome. Unfortunately, the proposals will not work.
The confusion between a desire to be technologically neutral and these
interventions is creating a great deal of uncertainty.</hs_para>

concern is that insufficient attention has been paid in the department
to what I would call scenario planning in relation to the current two
big market drivers, the cost of coal relative to the cost of gas. Here,
while I do not fully agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, on
everything, there is a real issue about the relative future prices of
fuel. They are an essential component regarding whether this capacity
mechanism will be
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>. At the
moment, gas prices are very high and gas plant is losing money, hence
it being mothballed. That is neither environmentally desirable, nor is
it desirable for security of supply. I can therefore see why the
Government have come to the conclusion that a capacity intervention is
needed. However, my concern is that the way that this is being done
will not achieve the desired
outcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

are multiple. One is that we are in a situation of oversupply. Even
though we have lost 7 gigawatts of old coal capacity, we were at
historically high levels before those closures. We are still in a
situation where the wholesale price is not sending  a signal to
either keep more expensive plant in the system or build new plant. That
signal is further diluted by the fact that we are about to intervene in
the market to create contracts for different for significant volumes of
new capacity. The net effect is that if you are sitting there with a
consented gas plant and deciding on whether to invest hundreds of
millions of pounds in it, there are significant, real-world hurdles
before 
<?notus-xml column=433?>you would say yes to that project. The way that the department is
approaching the capacity mechanism is not going to address that
real-world
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:22:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072353000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000047">My concern relates to
the fact that existing plant in a capacity auction that is pretending
to be technologically neutral, if we have an oversupplied market, will
always squeeze out new capacity because the existing capacity is
already on the bars and has none of the costs and risks associated with
new capacity. The legacy plant will be bidding in the intervening
period. While that legacy plant might be useful for keeping the lights
on, it creates an environmental problem. The technology-neutral
approach that the Government have chosen, although they are not
consistent in that, poses a problem. Coal plant is making an enormous
amount of money, far greater than the returns being made by gas plant.
These coal plants are capable of running for many, many decades and are
at a point when they are considering whether to continue operating
under tighter air-quality restrictions. These plants have the
capability of operating for many years to come and at high load factors
if they decide to fit new filters, new scrubbers, to make themselves
compliant with the requirements of the integrated emissions directive,
the
IED<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:23:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this capacity mechanism is not going to work because, in trying to
bring on CCGT and reach that Nirvana of new investment, you are
necessarily going to be paying a high price for capacity. That will
provide a windfall to existing coal operators, which, if it were not
for the carbon floor price, would certainly want to run for decades to
come. The carbon floor price is the only thing holding them back
because it is that which lowers their position in the merit

mechanism—you will not find this in any of the literature,
advice or information that has been provided—could provide in
the region of between £50 million and £75 million per
year, per plant as an up-front payment. If a plant that is considering
a life extension can win a three-year contract, it will then receive
between £150 million and £240 million in guaranteed
payments. I posit the problem—and I would like the Minister to
respond to this—that that might be enough to nudge them in
favour of investing in those air quality filters and would be
sufficient to give them comfort that they should upgrade the plant and
continue to operate. No one can predict the future, but the sums of
money involved in the capacity mechanism are such that it could well be
a material influence on decisions about what to do with those coal
plants.</hs_para> <hs_parafo UID="13072353000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000093">My
fear is that the Government have no back-up plan for if that happens.
Previously in Committee, we have discussed measures that could
apply—an emissions limit for carbon for coal plants seeking life
extensions—and they have been rejected. We have also tabled
suggestions that suppliers ought to have a decarbonisation obligation.
They have been rejected. It is almost as if the Government are not
really committed to decarbonisation. I am sure they are, but if you
look at the Bill at the moment, it is very possible that this will see
a large number of coal plants opting in to the ID, refurbishing and
staying on the system well into the 2020s. That is not compatible with
a strategy for building CCGT because it will simply squeeze out the
capacity that is expected to be brought on.</hs_parafo>

have a demand profile that is flat, or falling, and the peak is
falling, so not only are the demand profile and the whole not rising,
but the peak is softening as demand is shifting. If we had a rising
demand profile, one might be able to argue that that is where CCGTs
will bid in. We would still have all the old coal, we could bring back
the mothballed gas and there would still be room for CCGTs, but with a
flat or declining demand profile, there is simply not the room. What
scenario planning have the Government done for a situation where a
larger number of plants than expected opts into the ID, fits filters
and stays on the bars? What impact will that have on our emissions
profile, our carbon intensity and the cost efficiency of the whole EMR
package?</hs_parafo>

be about trying to transition to a low-carbon economy. We should be
seeking to do that in the most cost-efficient way. It is evident that
the most cost-efficient way is to switch from high-emissions coal to
low-emissions gas. That is what we did in the 1990s and it delivered
all our targets to date. We can obsess about tiny micromanagement of
renewables and try to get nuclear on the bars, but if we get the coal
to gas ratio wrong, we will be running to stand still. We will not see
emissions or carbon intensity coming down. In the interests of
consumers and the environment and security of supply, we have to get
the capacity mechanism right. At the moment, I am very worried that it
is not.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13072353000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000050">I
have one or two specific questions. I have been trying to dig down to
where the Government’s optimism about the closure of coal comes
from. It is obviously partly because they have great faith in the
carbon floor price. I do not share that faith. It is a highly political
policy with only two years of forward planning. For me, it is not a
politically bankable policy. There is also some analysis underpinning
this. There is a reference to research done by Redpoint. I can give the
reference. It is mentioned on page 30 of <I>National Grid EMR
</I><I>A</I><I>nalytical </I><I>R</I><I>eport</I>. I would like to see
that analysis. It seems to be the crux of the Government’s
assumptions about the impacts of ID. We should see that because it is
so crucial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000051">I
could go on and talk about the falling costs of the air scrubbing
equipment and the fact that there are flexible options now arriving in
the market which mean that you can fit a low-cost version of SCR and
still comply. There are lots of ways of trading once you are in TNP
that give you flexibility, but I do not want to bore the Committee with
the detail. The main point I am trying to make is that there is a great
possibility that the Government’s modelling does not match what

have sat in boardrooms with CEOs of power companies—or with one

are made not on pure economics but on a gut feeling, often with a
degree of sentiment—that they have a station that is making a
shed load of cash, and they take a hedge that they can continue to make
more money in future. That is what leads to them opting in rather than

Once people say yes to fitting the scrubbers, there will be no

to the amendment, I was interested by what the noble Baroness said
because that was not how I read her amendment at all. She said,
particularly when she intervened just now, that she did not want to
drive coal out. But the effect of her amendment would be to drive coal
and gas out and rely solely on renewables. The way that she phrased
things at the end was much more balanced. She is a great crusader for
renewable energy, but having read her amendment, I thought,
“Well that’s great: the nuclear industry has the best
advantage now. We can build a whole lot of nuclear plants because they
have no carbon and that would be extremely good”.</hs_para>

lowest-carbon providers should be involved. She has a very good point.
The amendment, as other noble Lords said, is not the answer, but it
does enable us to have a debate. Since most of the low-carbon providers
are probably the independents, which are not part of the big six, this
rather confirms the argument that I put in an earlier debate on
Amendment 55, I think, that it would be fairer if there was a
separation. There is a wonderful potential for the big six to keep many
of the low-carbon providers out that they do not own. I look forward to

take do not have a profound effect on consumers’ bills.
Currently, we are already seeing that there is a movement of will
against the green agenda simply because people believe that the green
agenda is putting extra on their bills. We are very careful in

will be made available. They give a broad outline of the analyses that
we are using. But I remind the noble Baroness that it was the
Conservative Party in opposition that in 2008 asked for the emissions
performance standard. It was this party that was pressing ahead to
ensure that we brought in decarbonisation and it was the noble
Baroness’s party that opposed every action we took at that time.

is about working together to make sure that  we not only see a
decarbonised energy sector, but we make sure that consumers are not
penalised heavily. The noble Baroness’s amendment seeks
low-carbon technologies to be given preferential treatment in capacity 
<?notus-xml column=438?>market auctions. We consider that the capacity market is not the right
means to deliver that objective. Decarbonisation is best achieved
through other provisions that we have put within the Bill, including
the introduction of contracts for difference and emissions performance
standard as well as other policy interventions such as the carbon price
floor and international carbon signals such as the EU Emissions Trading
Scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:42:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000070">These
measures are designed specifically to ensure that the economics of
low-carbon generation are transformed in comparison to traditional
thermal plant. The cumulative impact of these policies is such that we
expect only 3% of our electricity generation to be provided by unabated
coal in 2025 and none by 2030. Therefore, it is these policies that
will drive the decarbonisation of the electricity sector that I know
the noble Baroness wants to see, as do we all.</hs_para>

the other hand, has been designed to ensure security of electricity
supply at least cost to consumers. Again, I know that that is what the
noble Baroness wants to see as an outcome. It does this by providing
all forms of capacity with the right incentives to be on the system to
deliver electricity when needed.</hs_para>

designed to be technology neutral and all types of capacity will be
able to bid for capacity contracts, apart from those technologies
already receiving support from other mechanisms. This means that no
type of technology will be given preference in capacity auctions and
all eligible capacity will be compared on the basis of
cost.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000073">The
philosophy is one of humility and to use the power of markets. Sadly,
neither I nor anyone in my department is blessed with perfect
foresight. We do not know which technologies will be cheapest, what
fossil fuel prices will be in the future, or what myriad other factors
will determine the optimum path to decarbonisation. That is why we have
designed a framework that aims to capture the power of the markets to
achieve things at least cost.
Prioritising<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:43:56"></hs_TimeCode> the
lowest-carbon generators in the capacity market would force the market
to build capacity and commit capital when extending the life of an
existing plant might be a better bet—both economically through
lower costs to consumers and environmentally. A few years of a coal
plant cleaned up to meet the emissions limits in the IED, but operating
at low-load factors, while demand-side action, interconnection and CCS
develop and more low-carbon capacity comes on, could be a more
competitive outcome than committing capital to new gas
plants.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13072353000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000111">4.45

this risks adding unnecessary further complexity to the operation of
the capacity market and will duplicate the other policy measures to
which I have already referred. It is important to highlight that all
plant within the capacity market, including coal, will need to continue
to comply with the relevant environmental legislation. In addition, we
intend to establish transitional arrangements within the capacity
market to help develop the demand side sector in the period before the
mechanism starts to deliver capacity. This will help in the longer term
to enable the demand 
<?notus-xml column=439?>side industry to compete on more equal terms with generation plant,
leading to both lower costs and emissions. I hope that I can reassure
the noble Baroness that we are very conscious of the risk. As such, we
have employed international experts to help identify those
opportunities and have developed a series of mitigations in the design
of the capacity market to address her concerns. I and my officials
would be happy to work with her and other noble Lords over the summer
on the design, as it will be finalised in consultation in the
autumn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:45:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000075">In
summary, the Government consider that the measures we are putting in
place, designed specifically to drive the decarbonisation of the
electricity sector, will better deliver the intention behind the noble
Baroness’s amendment. The amendment would lead to significant
added complexity within the market, which in turn would be likely to
lead to significant additional costs to the consumer. I agree that it
is important that the market operates effectively and we have measures
in place to ensure that market participants do not abuse their powers.

that it will all be fine. We need to go out and talk to people in the
real world, as I have done, and see what they are projecting for coal
under the scenarios that we have in today’s market, the
flexibilities that enable them going forward and building in the
significant amount of money that is being redistributed to them through
this mechanism. That is what I am seeking to explore. I

conclusion, it is quite wrong of the Government to pray in aid least
cost to consumers. This Government introduced the carbon floor price,
which has disadvantaged the UK relative to the rest of Europe for
virtually no perceived outcome at the moment. We are already paying the
carbon floor price. It is already impacting on our businesses and
consumers. This is a Treasury money-raising exercise. If you are the
party interested in keeping costs low for consumers, that is the policy
you should be looking at, not the very sensible suggestion of trying to
ensure that the capacity mechanism does not have unintended
consequences in terms of carbon. It is absolutely clear that the
quickest and cheapest way to decarbonise the economy is to switch out
of coal and into gas. You can shake your head if you want to, but you
need to go back to history and look at what has happened. You can build
as many renewables as you like, but if you get coal and gas wrong, you
will not get to those low-carbon intensities. That is the issue I am
trying to get to, and for you to use least cost and cost to consumers
as excuses for doing that is really deplorable when you think of the
carbon floor price. I think you need to go back and think about that. I

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not for a moment suggest
that Clause 26 should not be in the Bill. I have adopted the device of
having a debate on it in order to explore its intention a little more.
I remind noble Lords that at one point we expected that we would reach
this point last week. We have been a little delayed. I could have
tabled an amendment. I would have been perfectly simple: “Page
17, line 1, leave out subsection (3)”. So I wish to ask my noble
friend some questions about subsection (3).</hs_para>

four powers which the Government are proposing to take to require
generating plants to operate differently? They relate to: the manner in
which functions are to be exercised; restricting the use of generating
plant; the way in which a plant may participate in a capacity auction;
and the inspection of plant or property. These are very broad points. I
am given to understand that some generators are increasingly
apprehensive that the becoming involved in the capacity market could
well have undesirable operational strings attached to it. There is no
indication that any of the powers would be limited even once they had
ceased to 
<?notus-xml column=442?>be part of the market. I have to warn my noble friend that I am told
that this could potentially undermine the appetite of generators to
become involved, which manifestly is not the Government’s
intention. Here again, we have a clause which is drafted in very broad
terms and we have to wait until we see the regulations and subordinate
legislation that will come from it. I do not want to repeat what has
been said so often, but in advance of our seeing the draft regulations,
it would be helpful if the Government could explain how they intend to
use the powers, especially those relating to the use of generating
plant or the manner of participating in an auction. They want to ensure
that generators which may be looking to participate in the capacity
market can understand and have confidence in what it may mean for them
in terms of plant operation once the Act comes into
force<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:56:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000088">We
have heard a great deal in these debates about the problem of
uncertainty and the need to engender confidence. That is hugely
important if you are going to attract the necessary investment. I
always come back to the meeting that we attended some weeks ago chaired
by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, when a lot was said by different
categories of potential investor. We have got to have the Bill
otherwise we will not get investment. At the end, the question was
asked: if we have the Bill, will we get the investment? That was
followed by a long silence. Nobody is able to guarantee this.
Therefore, we must do our very best to make sure that any cause of
uncertainty, any anxiety about the likely consequences, is treated as
very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:57:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000089">Clause
32 again gives the power by regulation to amend or repeal existing
legislation. I shall not read it all out because everybody can see what
is in it, but I am particularly worried about paragraph (d). Here again
we have regulations that will give very wide powers of direct
legislation—in a sense, Henry VIII provisions—if they are
connected to the development of a capacity market, including the annual
reports made by the authority on the security of electricity supplies
and the report on the security of energy supplies as a whole. As I
said, paragraph (d) provides for wide amendment of existing enactments.
It is very broad and, here again, concerns have been raised by the
industry—I am sure that it has made its views known to my noble
friend’s officials—that that it may take effect
unpredictably. Therefore, there is increasing uncertainty and, to that
extent, reducing
confidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T16:58:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072353000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072353000090">My
amendment is simply to ask my noble friend to give an explanation. What
are the likely uses of this power? How widely would it range, bearing
in mind that it includes amendments to primary legislation and is
consequential on provision which itself is made in secondary
legislation. I understand the desire of the Government to cover every
possibility, but the more they seek to cover with very wide powers of
this sort without adequate explanation of how they are going to be
used, the more they increase the uncertainty which undermines the
possibility of investment. I hope that my noble friend will be able to
give us some further information which may help to reduce that
uncertainty and increase
confidence.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_23_PT_1/E7FFBC77DAB621AF296352A1429B0204421B7520" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 July 2013">Tuesday,

redress the imbalance between the scarcity of provision on the face of

said about these clauses. Indeed, I am prompted to think that I must go
back to the Constitution Committee and make sure that before this comes
before the House at Report we will have had a look at the

make a wider point. I have been quite astonished, although I have been
a very long time in Parliament, in one House and the other. I do not
believe that I have ever heard a Bill come to this stage in its
proceedings with so much information still unavailable; after all, it
has been though the other place and been examined by countless
committees. Indeed, if this Committee stage had been held on the Floor
of the House, the Government would have been in deep trouble. In Grand
Committee, we go along with it—we probe and press questions and
so on—and say that we will bring things back at Report. The
House as a whole would have been far more impatient with the Government

at times my noble friend the Minister finds there are interventions
from both sides, including from the noble Baroness who speaks for the
Opposition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T17:06:46"></hs_TimeCode>, she
must not be entirely surprised. If the department has not yet addressed
many of the issues that one would have expected it to address at this
time or to have answers to and provide information to the Committee, it
must not be surprised if it gets into trouble. Therefore, as we go
through the final stages in Committee, my noble friend would be
extremely wise to understand the feeling of irritation and frustration
that is widespread in the Committee and tempers her remarks
accordingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T17:07:30"></hs_TimeCode>. I
am not suggesting that it is her fault; it is a nightmare for Ministers
in this House who have to handle Bills of 
<?notus-xml column=445?>this sort, since many key issues are decided elsewhere and by others.
But she must understand that, as a Committee, we face the most
extraordinary difficulties. We do not know half the regulations that

understand that my noble friend Lord Jenkin is concerned that the
provisions in this clause are too broad. However, the Government
consider that the ability to address this provision in secondary
legislation is needed as the requirements may change with time. The
need to consider certain matters when preparing advice regarding the
operation of the capacity market may also change as the market evolves,
as has been the experience in international capacity markets, such as
those in the United

regard to Clause 26(3)(b) about placing restrictions on the use of
generating plant, certain requirements may need to be imposed to ensure
a fair and transparent auction and to mitigate or close off gaming
opportunities that could otherwise drive up costs for consumers. In
particular, it is imperative that we know the range and type of
capacity, irrespective of whether the capacity operator intends to bid
at auction, and we need to ensure we can address gaming 
<?notus-xml column=446?>opportunities, such as a plant operator notifying its intention to close
in order to drive up the capacity price. Clause 26(3)(c) allows the
Secretary of State to impose requirements relating to participation in
a capacity auction. An example of how we envisage using this power is
that we may wish to require a plant to participate in a capacity
auction if it has notified the delivery body during the
pre-qualification process that it is its intention to do so.</hs_para>

place other requirements on those who have ceased to be capacity
providers—that is to say, they have assigned or traded their
capacity agreements—in order to determine whether they complied

certain sections of the Electricity Act 1989 and the Energy Act 2004

Secretary of State considers appropriate as a result of provisions made
by electricity capacity regulations or capacity market rules. I
recognise that my noble friend has particular concerns over the
provisions in paragraph (d), which allows the Secretary of State to
make consequential amendments to any other enactment that he considers
appropriate. I should emphasise  that our intention is to limit
the use of the power  in Clause 32(d) to making amendments that
are consequential on, or to avoid duplication and contradiction of,
existing primary or secondary legislation on implementing the capacity
market. For example, if we modify the standard conditions of licences
under the provisions of the Electricity Act, the powers for which are
set out in Clause 31, it may be necessary to make a consequential
amendment to Section 33 of the Utilities Act 2000. This contains
general provision about standard licence conditions and includes in
Section 33(1) a list of powers under which licence modifications have
been made. Furthermore, any provisions to amend primary legislation
through the powers in this clause will be subject to a proper level of
parliamentary scrutiny through the affirmative resolution

now turn to the amendments proposed by the noble Lord, Lord

regulations: information and advice and those under Clause 7(10) which
set out how long a person who has ceased to be a CFD counterparty is
continued to be treated as such. These would be subject to the negative

the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. As I have

Lord Crickhowell said. If we get to the Floor of the House and find
ourselves still having to make this kind of speech, the Minister will
find herself in considerable difficulty. That is the last thing I want

amendment would require the Government to introduce a strategy to
address the policy barriers to interconnection and the distortions
introduced by the proposed capacity market. I highlighted at Second
Reading the benefits of greater interconnection across Europe, so I
will be brief now. It makes a significant contribution to security of
supply as Ofgem's recent electricity capacity assessment demonstrates.
If the UK imports electricity from the continent at times when supply
is tight, capacity margins increase from 5% to nearly 9%. By making
more efficient use of renewable energy, it can have positive effects on
energy costs, as the Government have confirmed in their response to the
House of Lords EU Select Committee report, <I>No Country is an Energy
Island</I>, which is to be
debated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T17:21:28"></hs_TimeCode> in this

Government are 
<?notus-xml column=449?>supporting Ofgem’s integrated transmission planning and
regulation project to take it forward. But there is no denying that the
decision not to allow interconnected capacity to participate in a
capacity auction now will distort the internal market. Why? Because an
overseas power generator wishing to supply the UK market will receive
the wholesale electricity price alone, while generators in the UK will
receive a capacity payment and a wholesale electricity price. This
would mean that there would be less efficiency resulting from less
competition in the auction and, crucially, less incentive to build
additional interconnection

Government have said in very recent correspondence that they are keen
to find a way for interconnected capacity to participate in a capacity
market in future. This is to be welcomed, but we need a clear
commitment in the Bill that this Government prioritise interconnection
alongside the capacity market and demand-side reduction measures to
deliver the energy that we need. We need to know what other avenues
they are going to pursue for interconnection and by when. It is
legislation, not the sometimes contradictory comments within
government, that shows investors what government will do and creates
the necessary confidence to invest. Let us be clear: the European
Commission estimates that investment of more than €200 billion
is needed before 2020, two-thirds of that in the electricity market, in
cross-boarder infrastructure. Putting this amendment in the Bill would
help to give that investor confidence, requiring the Government and
this department actively to look at ways in which to develop
mechanisms, working with the regulators and European partners to
support cross-border energy trade. Doing so would show that, on energy,
just us on crime, trade and the environment, we are better working with
our European partners and neighbours. I beg to

the south, and nuclear power stations closing by

I understand it, Germany’s nuclear power stations enabled the
Danes to keep nice and green by exporting some of its surplus nuclear
supply to them. At this stage, we can probably discount Denmark and
Germany as potential sources of supply. We have been fortunate to have
had an interconnection arrangement with France. In some respects, it
has probably done the French more good than us, certainly commercially,
but it has enabled us to keep our lights on. On the other hand, one can
imagine that the parlous state  of not only the Italian economy
but that country’s interconnection may present problems. In this
little European tour, it is most unlikely that we could depend on Italy
as a source of much energy for the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T17:25:48"></hs_TimeCode>. It

issue that long undersea cables have significant transmission losses,
and I am not quite sure how much we would get out of Ireland

around  
<?notus-xml column=450?>Ireland and there have been useful discoveries there. However, the point
that I am trying to make is that we could conceivably get some hydro
power from Norway but my understanding is that global warming there has
created problems whereby hydro power is not quite as reliable as it
used to be because the glaciers  are getting smaller and there
is too much water at the wrong times.</hs_para>

would be nice to be reassured that someone in Europe at the other end
of our interconnections could provide us with a lot of electricity. If
we were to obtain 30 gigawatts of nuclear power, we might be able to
sell some to Ireland, although the Irish might not like nuclear power.
They do not seem to mind it when it comes from Scotland, so long as it
is under an agreement with a company that also owns gas-fired and
coal-fired power stations. Like the Danes, the Irish are able to remain
rather more environmentally acceptable to other people than perhaps
they

really trying to get at is that this will be very expensive, there will
be transmission losses because of the distances involved and I am not
sure which countries will have surplus capacity capable of providing us
with what might well turn out to be extremely expensive electricity. At
the moment, it has been useful and helpful to have received it from
France. I am pretty certain that the French will sell it to the highest
bidder and there will be people on the continent of Europe who will
probably need imported electricity to a far greater extent than we do
and will therefore probably be desperate enough to pay higher prices
for it. Before we embark on a strategy that implies great expense and
investment, given the parlous state of a lot of the energy companies in
terms of even their share value, increased interconnection is a wee bit
fanciful. I am happy to be convinced if there are power generators
across the North Sea desperate to sell to us but I am not quite sure
that they are. Even if they are keen now, will they be in 10
years’ time? Although we are having administrative difficulties
in getting this Bill into a shape that we can deal with on Report, we
will probably eventually get it right, but we do not get the impression
that our European partners are moving with even the glacial speed at
which we are travelling when trying to achieve solutions. A strategy
might be very nice but, at the end of the day, it might be wishful
thinking.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13072369000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072369000039">5.30

Perhaps there will in future be greater surplus capacity in France

directly or a mixture of the two, and perhaps it is worth investing in
a bigger interconnector. I think the present one is 2 gigawatts, so
perhaps it should be another 2 gigawatts. What about Scotland if it
chooses to become an independent country? This amendment is permissive.

may well be that the Finnish and the Flamanville experiences will be
such that all the problems will be ironed out and we will have EDF
building the first reactor at Hinckley on time and within budget. One
can only hope that. Companies ride learning curves. One hopes that
Arriva has ironed out all the kinks. The problems in Finland were
different from the problems in France, but the combination of the two
seems to suggest that they had not really done so, in Europe at least

capacity mechanism, except that it has the ability to incorporate
renewable technology and even intermittent power. I say to the noble

sharing surplus all over Europe. That is the whole point. It is very
unlikely that you will get a particular moment when there is no sun in
Italy, no wind in Germany or Ireland, no water behind the hydro dams of
Norway and no nuclear power coming out of France. There will always be
surplus here and there. For instance, at one moment last week in the
German market 33% of the power was being produced by PV. There was a
complete surplus in the marketplace. It was disastrous for the
coal-fired power stations of Germany because suddenly the price of
electricity went very cheap.</hs_para>

an interconnected Europe would be a secure Europe in that way. However,

<?notus-xml column=452?>we have a long way to go, and the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, is
correct to refer to the glacial speed. There are different regulations
in different countries and different ownership structures, including
some nationalised industries and old semi-nationalised industries,
which are very inefficient yet determined to fend off any possible
competition from abroad. There is also the question of different
voltages operating in different countries. Hovering over all these
uncertainties are the European public, who seem to want their power but
under no circumstances want to have more pylons.</hs_para>

the EU Commission has made £9.2 billion available for overall
connectivity, including gas, when the rough estimate for the

£23 billion for subsea cables alone. I ought to correct one
other thing that the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, said: with
high-voltage direct current there are almost nil losses in
transmission. Although the power stations at either end are obviously

rest of that money—the £104
billion —has to come from the marketplace but to get
even a proportion of that money, the market will need the certainty of
international commitment and the certainty of a plan. It will need an
EU plan set out by the Commission in a way that guarantees long-term
commitment and is signed up to by all the member states involved.
Eurelectric, the trade body representing the European electricity
sector, says that creating a predictable policy framework would help
utilities to finance their investment plans and attract the necessary
funds. Incidentally, Herman van Rompuy says that the implementation of
such a framework, which includes electricity and gas, could save the EU
consumer up to €30 billion per annum. My point is that in order
to get a firm and committed EU strategy, we need to start with a firm
UK strategy. That, in a nutshell, is why I support this

tedious meeting I sometimes flick to my iPhone if I succumb to the
temptation. The Energywatch organisation has a splendid app which tells
you exactly what electricity generation is going on at any particular
moment. I can tell your Lordships that at this moment we are depending
upon supplies from overseas of 7%, or 3 gigawatts. Wind is producing at
the moment less than one sixth of that. Over time, I am struck by just
what a significant proportion of our electricity already comes in that
way. Three gigawatts is not nothing; it is a very significant

the Minister responds, it would be helpful to give some indication as
to what security there is. I belong to those who have some anxieties
that in three or four years’ time, if economic activity picks up
and some outages occur at a couple of big stations that we are not
expecting, and if the weather is very cold and the wind is not blowing,
we are going to depend upon electricity coming from these
interconnectors. We can depend on it only if we know that they will be
available. If the weather is also inadvertent in other countries, what
security do we have that the electricity will be available from other
places? I am entirely with the 
<?notus-xml column=453?>view that we should have a European electricity market. That is
absolutely right but it has to be with certain guarantees for supply in

my noble friend Lady Parminter is proposing in this amendment. The
evidence that we got in Sub-Committee D was that interconnection
throughout Europe needed a great deal more money spent on it, as the
noble Lord, Lord Cameron, has told us. It needs to be improved, but
that is a two-way process. The noble Lord, Lord Cameron, referred to
some of the difficulties and I recall those being adduced to the

concern with this is therefore: what is the point of the UK producing a
strategy when nobody else is producing one? We can produce a strategy
and the Government can be questioned in the House about it, but if the
French are not altering their system so that we are compatible and one
can move the electricity to and fro, or if the problems have not been
resolved with Norway—as was highlighted, there was a problem
getting a connection with Norway or with the Danes—it seems a
little pointless us having a strategy. Surely this ought to be done
within the EU context. However, my noble friend Lady Parminter and the
noble Lords, Lord Cameron and Lord Whitty, have the advantage that
since I have left Sub-Committee D, they interviewed the Secretary of
State. Although I have read the transcript, I would hope that they can
enlighten us on what the Secretary of State had to say on our report,

Teverson:</Member></B> I rise to speak to my Amendments 55AA
and 55AD, as part of this group, but perhaps I can come to the
interconnection amendment of my noble friend Lady Parminter first. It
seems to me to be blindingly obvious that this is something that we
should do. I note the comments of the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill,
who may be asking the right questions but he is being slightly too
negative. A strategy does not cost billions; implementing it costs
billions. When talking about investment in electricity generation,
network costs, and so on of potentially £200 billion, looking
sensibly at a major part of the jigsaw of interconnection is very
important. We should remember that this amendment refers to the
capacity payment part of the Bill, so this bit is not saying that we
should run UK base load and rely all the time on interconnection. It is
a common-sense look at the fact that European energy markets and
individual national markets operate at different times, have their own
characteristics and different peaks. Therefore, it makes a huge amount
of sense to try to 
<?notus-xml column=454?>benefit from the synergies of capacity, weave them together and make the
system work better. There are all sorts of problems with the energy
market, but it does not stop the UK trying to make the best out of it,
and then fit that within a broader EU strategy. I, too, look forward to

who has a generating capacity outside the United Kingdom. I am not at
all clear about this. I know that the Government have had discussions.
We have mentioned Iceland and Ireland before but it would be useful to

would not entertain CFD contracts that were more than that. Of course,

some important issues which we need to cover. I declare a past interest
in the sense that I was involved in trying to get a particular
interconnection. My experience from that is that there are many
difficulties which are not systemic difficulties, as the noble Lord,
Lord O’Neill, might refer to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-07-23T17:45:19"></hs_TimeCode>, but simply
difficulties about the way in which we do things in this country which

are two different things, although I hope that they would run in
parallel. Manifestly, in the long-distant future, it would be quite
sensible to have a lot of windmills when there was wind and a lot of
solar when there was sun. Being able to pass that along would be very
good. Modern methods of transmission

therefore, there is a long-term interest in linking up the systems more
effectively. I do not know what the latest figure is, but it has been
estimated that if we made certain, not-very-difficult changes to the
northern European connections, we could save about 11% of our
emissions, simply because they are now wasted due to the connecting
arrangement. That may have been updated now, but there are clearly
savings to be made there. They are the sort of savings that we should
make before we do other things. It always seems to me that
wastage—I am glad that right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Chester came into this debate—is the least acceptable manner of
putting emissions into the atmosphere. It just does not seem to be a
right thing to

if it were not for that reason, we need to open up the opportunities
for people to invest. The noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, is right
that such investments are quite expensive, but if you open up the
opportunities for people to invest, the market will sort out which
investments are sensible and which are not. There will be an

purpose of the amendments, so far as I can see, is to ask my noble
friend the Minister, “Are we sure that we’ve looked at
this sufficiently well in the general panoply?”. The climate
change committee, of which I have the honour to be the chairman, has
always talked about a portfolio of energy supplies as being the basis
for energy sovereignty, for making sure that we do not become subject
to very high prices of gas and for making sure that we fight against
dangerous climate change—these three things come together. The
portfolio approach is the one that I am always looking at. I am very
keen that we should not write this Bill to exclude this. The noble
Lord, Lord O’Neill, would probably go along with the concept
that we should make sure that there is not an opportunity here. I am
not  sure that the Bill does that. If my noble friend could say
to the Committee that she will make sure there is not a lacuna here, it
would be a very helpful outcome of this

Two-way connectivity must be a way of bringing down costs across Europe
as a whole with the development of an internal market which at present
does not really exist, despite what the Commission claim on occasion.
That must be to the benefit of the costs of investment in energy as a

involved in negotiating, aims to accelerate the development of
cross-border energy infrastructure with a view to completing the
internal energy market.</hs_para>

due to be announced in early autumn, and will benefit from streamlined
planning procedures and, where necessary, a mechanism to agree
cross-border cost allocation. They will also be eligible to access
financial instruments such as loan finance, grants for feasibility
studies and, potentially, grants for works under the Connecting Europe
Facility—a pot of €5.1 billion over seven years. The
Government also continue to discuss interconnection with our
counterparts across Europe. My noble friend may be aware that the Prime
Minister committed last year to supporting the development of an
interconnector with Norway, and we have signed a memorandum of
understanding with Iceland to explore the possibility of linking our
markets.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072379000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000014">In
part, the large number of projects in development is due to work that
Ofgem has been doing to develop a new regulatory approach for
interconnection. This “cap and floor” model retains the
market incentives for interconnection but reduces some of the risks to 
<?notus-xml column=458?>revenue that merchant developers face. This regulatory model is
initially going to be applied to the project with Belgium, Project
Nemo. Cap and floor has real potential in driving forward
interconnector investment but, by its very nature, looks to consumers
to potentially take on some risk in return, which will need careful
consideration. Ofgem is taking this into account as part of its wider
integrated transmission planning and regulation project, in which it is
exploring whether there needs to be enhanced planning or strategic
evaluation of future interconnection.</hs_para>

highlight two further important developments that are taking place.
First, developers invest on the basis of price differentials on either
side of the link. Ofgem is working to ensure that Great
Britain’s electricity prices reflect scarcity to a greater
extent, thereby increasing the incentives for investing in
interconnection. Secondly, on 27 June, the Government committed to
continuing to explore ways in which interconnected capacity can
participate in the capacity market. This is not simple and no other
country has found a way to do this, but a solution could further
increase investment appetite. It is worth reflecting that the single
market is about not only the infrastructure between member states but
the way in which that infrastructure operates.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072379000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000016">The Government, with
the support of Ofgem and National Grid, are playing an active role in
the development of the European technical codes that will govern how
trading over interconnectors will work in practice. This is essential
if the full benefits of the infrastructure investments are to be
realised.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13072379000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000068">6

now turn to the amendments on generation located abroad, tabled by my
noble friend Lord Teverson. I thank my noble friend for the opportunity
to explain the Government’s thinking on this matter. Generation
outside the UK has the potential to contribute cheap, clean electricity
to the benefit of UK consumers. The department is currently examining
the technical requirements for making this happen and for ensuring that
any overseas projects are connected in a way that maximises the full
range of potential benefits while avoiding unnecessary cost.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072379000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000018">In recognition of the
promise held by overseas generation, the Bill already makes provision
for its integration into the CFD regime. Specifically, Clause 6(1) and
Clause 10(3) are constructed in a way that would allow overseas
generation to fall within the scope of CFDs. However, these clauses are
also drafted in a way that ensures we are not automatically committed
to that course of action in advance of fully understanding its
potential costs, including to consumers, and risks, both of which may
be significant if not managed properly.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072379000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000019">While I am sympathetic
to the intention of my noble friend’s amendments, there is a
risk that they could see us pursuing a course of action that has not
yet been proven to be in the interests of UK consumers before we are
even certain it can be made to work. I hope that noble Lords agree that
before we could begin connecting to, for example, an Irish wind farm 
<?notus-xml column=459?>or Icelandic geothermal power, we want to be absolutely sure that such
projects provide a net benefit to UK consumers.</hs_para>

make sure that our approach to such projects makes sense. That means
considering in detail a large number of practical and policy issues,
such as how best to meter the output for payment purposes, the costs
and benefits of additional or avoided grid reinforcement works and our
ability to manage risks associated with non-payment under the contract.
I hope that by outlining the existing provisions in the Bill I have
addressed my noble friend’s objective with Amendment 55AA, in
that the legislation will already provide for overseas generation if we
proceed down that route.</hs_para>

require the Secretary of State to bring forward an order setting out
targets for the allocation of CFDs to technologies outside the UK. My
department and the regulator, Ofgem, continue to work through the
detailed issues in connecting to overseas generation, with a particular
early focus on overseas generators of renewable energy. As with my
noble friend’s first amendment, we do not wish to prejudge the
outcome of that work. As I have outlined, contracting with overseas
projects would be new, innovative and potentially risky.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072379000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000022">Additionally, because
it requires the setting of new obligations, this amendment could limit
our ability to react to changing circumstances in the future. The
prospect of further targets on top of those related to carbon,
renewables and so on begins to reduce flexibility to the point where it
becomes quite difficult to ensure an efficient and responsive outcome.
I do not believe that there are overriding grounds for introducing new
targets, which risk reduced competition and distortion of the market
for CFDs, simply to ensure a set level of foreign generation.</hs_para>

friends agree that there are already many initiatives under way to
enhance our interconnection capacity and are reassured of our support
in principle for low-cost overseas generation, where it can be shown to
bring about benefits and value for money for UK consumers. On that
basis, I hope my noble friend will withdraw his

grateful to the Minister for outlining what are, in effect, the

were about interconnection. That is to be commended. I remain of the

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment would add a new
subsection to Clause 6. We now come to the meat of the Bill: the
contracts for difference, which it is proposed will restart investment
in low-carbon energy. I think that this is the bit of the Bill that we
all share a desire to see succeed and do exactly as we

reason for my tabling the amendment, which, again, is very much a
probing amendment, is for us to have a brief debate about the
transition from the current support mechanism for the renewables
obligation and the proposed contracts for difference. We will have an
opportunity to discuss this further when we come on to the parts of the
Bill that deal with the transition, but I have put the amendment here
because it is important to highlight how important the strike prices
will be in the new mechanism for supporting renewables.</hs_para>

obligation, which this replaces, had within it a mechanism that created
a demand for renewables—an obligation on suppliers to go out and
source renewable obligation certificates. That was seen as an essential
part of moving us into a low-carbon system at a time when we had a
perfectly well functioning system of high carbon. It was accepted that,
to create the space for these new sources of power, we needed there to
be an obligation to drive that market. We are moving away from that to
a system whereby the contracts will be offered and strike prices
published but there is no obligation on anybody to come forward and bid
for them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072373000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000016">I
am very grateful for the information that has been provided by the
Minister recently, showing that a number of applicants have come
forward for the financial investment early decision contracts. I think
that 50 projects have come forward, with 18 potential
gigawatts of 
<?notus-xml column=462?>capacity. So clearly the draft strike prices are driving interest and
have given people a reason to come forward with projects, which is very
encouraging. It would be useful to have something in the Bill that
ensures that that is the situation going forward. It has been mentioned
on a number of occasions that one problem we have is that, beyond 2020,
there does not appear to be very much certainty for investors in
renewables. There are a number of reasons or that. It is partly because
the legally binding renewables targets set at a European level stop in
2020. Let us be honest in saying that that is what drives the majority
of interest from the Government in seeking renewables, although I also
acknowledge that the benefits that renewables bring in diversity of
supply and potential cost reductions for consumers are also sought by
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000017">It
is true—and I do not think that it would be particularly
controversial to say—that there appears to be some mixed
messages coming from the Government that some parts of government are
less enamoured of the benefits of renewables than others. So there is
this potential issue post-2020. The levy control framework will dictate
a large part of how the contracts of difference work, and that, too,
only has a time horizon to 2020. So there is understandable nervousness
in the industry. I do not want to go over old ground, but we have had
lengthy debates about the need for decarbonisation targets post-2020 to
try to give back some confidence. In the absence of such targets, we
are reliant at the strike prices being set at a favourable level to
bring forward interest. That is why we have tabled this
amendment—on the off-chance that there should be a moment in
future when the Government are slightly less enamoured or, potentially,
more hostile to renewables, and that there will not be the ability to
kill off this market by simply offering very low and unattractive
strike prices. That was not possible within the RO, because it had an
inbuilt mechanism to keep demand growing for those technologies. Here
we are very much more reliant on a planned, administratively and
government-controlled mechanism. For that reason, we have sought to
clarify that the purpose of the strike prices is to ensure that they
are sufficiently attractive that investors will come
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000018">This
amendment also gives me an opportunity to comment on the strike prices.
Those that were published are subject to consultation, and I am sure
that the Government are busy receiving evidence from participants in
the market and potential investors. I have heard that the offshore
renewable community do not consider the proposal for offshore wind to
be sufficient. Again, I think that that highlights how important the
strike prices now are. The concern is that the length of contract is
too short, that the digression in prices kicks in too soon and that the
cost reductions expected are just not realistic. That further
underlines why we need to get the strike prices right.</hs_para>

sit alongside the amendment that we will come on to debate about an
expert panel. I know that an expert panel is already in existence and
has been helping the Government, which we acknowledge has been a useful
part of this process. We will come on to discuss how that could be
maintained and even enhanced by making it a more visible part of the
infrastructure of the Bill.</hs_para>

opportunity to say—this is slightly technical so
I apologise in advance—that the way in which
the supply obligation created in Clause 9 also interplays with the
strike prices is important. I am stretching the amendment a little too
far, maybe, to talk about this here, but it is worth noting that how
you construct the obligation on suppliers to pay towards the strike
prices could have quite an impact on the incentives that the suppliers
have to then go forward and seek CFDs. If you constrict the supplier
obligation in one way where the suppliers are directly exposed to the
prices set in CFDs, they will have a greater incentive to go forward
and seek those CFDs. If, however, it is a levelised, averaged-out cost
to which they are not able to hedge their position through their own
participation, it dilutes that signal.</hs_para>

is all wrapped up in our concern to get the strike prices right. We
will, I hope, soon discuss the technical expertise needed to make sure
that that happens. I have mentioned why I think something should be in
the Bill because it acknowledges the different system that we are
moving to from a situation where the RO had an in-built guarantee that
there would be demand for these projects to one where we are very
reliant now on getting the price right. I beg to

Hanworth:</Member></B> My Lords, we know that strike prices will differ
across various technologies but I query whether that degree of
flexibility is sufficient. There may be a case for varying the strike
prices to cater for the different components of the same technology. I
am thinking, for example, of the differences within the technology of
gas powered LGC generation between the base load CCGT plant and the
plant that is devoted to satisfying peak demand, which may
be OCGT.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000023">The
cost profiles of the two varieties may be very different as will the
wholesale prices commanded by their outputs. Should they be subject to
the same market reference price and the same strike price? I am asking
that question, in all innocence; it is not a tendentious question. But
I have observed that the Minister has indicated or implied that there
may be special accommodations within certain technologies for
interconnection. If I am making any assertion, it is that we need a lot
more detail and I am not sure that it has yet come forth. We need a lot
more detail that would address the realities of electricity

terms of trying to make sure that there is some commitment to this form

prices for CFDs. Amendment 55ZC  
<?notus-xml column=464?>raises the important point that the draft strike prices we published on
27 June must be set at a level capable of incentivising investment.
This is extremely important, and I am grateful for the opportunity to
reassure noble Lords. As they will be aware, the draft strike prices
were published on 27 June with their supporting detail for consultation

like to provide reassurance to the Committee that the Government have
put extensive effort into ensuring that strike prices are set to
balance the objectives of EMR stated in the Bill we are debating
currently. They are to drive the necessary investment to meet our
important targets while ensuring security of supply and value for money
for consumers. The Bill ensures that all the functions exercised under
it will take these important objectives into account. I therefore
reassure the noble Baroness that the intent of this amendment is being
achieved without the need for a further statutory

hard to ensure the process through which final strike prices are set is
transparent, robust and informed by a full range of expert input,

just now, there are, of course, technical advisory groups available to
the Secretary of State, the department and Ofgem on all sorts of
aspects of the Bill. They exist as energy policy is developed. The
importance of this role is that we would be putting it on a statutory
basis to ensure that there is some check on how the process that we are
setting up under the Bill is operated in practice and  to give
all parties some degree of reassurance and demystification about a
process which is very novel and not widely understood. It is
one where the Government are still working out the details and which
will undoubtedly encounter some hiccups, growing pains, difficulties

public are concerned, this is  a completely novel concept. They
sort of understand a market, but this is not a market. They understood
the old CEGB system, more or less, but this is not a centrally

by the regulator in the normal sense, which was how the market was for
the past couple of decades. It is, perhaps, a managed oligopoly but
with big companies—big oligopolists—which by and large
are not trusted. These are government deals which necessarily have to
be complex and negotiated 
<?notus-xml column=466?>behind closed doors, but the outcome will arouse misunderstanding and
suspicion unless there is  some assurance that
they have been properly audited in some form or
other.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000041">These
are contracts for a major part of our energy supply, which last for 15
or 25 years. We are locked into those contracts, and we therefore need
experts to look at how they will be operated by the department or
Ofgem, or possibly its successor under a different Government. The way
in which they deliver will determine a lot of our energy mix and,
effectively, determine what broad price business and domestic consumers
will face. Hence, they will have social, economic and competitiveness
implications and may have serious implications for our energy security,
as they are one of the main means of delivering it.</hs_para>

all this—even to me, who has tried to understand it through
these deliberations—is that the contracts will all be delivered
by a counterparty whose form has yet to be defined. We now know that
there will be a single counterparty, although that is not fully
reflected in the Bill. We know that it will be a private but
government-backed company. Apart from that, we do not know what its
responsibilities, accountability or structure are likely to be. It will
be responsible for the government side, or perhaps the societal side,
of these very important contracts. Over 15 or 25 years, the contracts
will go through periods of substantial change and may be required to be
reviewed or reassessed. In some cases, the contracts will probably not
last the full 25 years with the same company because the structure of
companies is likely to change, as it has over the past 25
years.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072373000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000043">We
need some reassurance. At the moment, the Secretary of State and the
rather shadowy counterparty are the responsible bodies, supported by
Ofgem and by advice from National Grid. Before we go on from this part
of the Bill, we need at the very least to have a formal system of
advice built into that process so that on each contract for difference
and each investment contract there is somebody looking at its financial
and legal structure and its value for money. That would not be for the
company or indeed for the strategy, but for the consumers and for the
security of supply to our businesses and householders. The advice that
will be given to the Secretary of State, the authority and the
counterparty needs to be seen to be neutral or non-interested in the
affairs of the various parties
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000044">The
first part of the amendment sets out the duties of such a group to
advise the Secretary of State and the counterparty on the development
of those contracts and to look contract by contract at their
effectiveness. The last part deals simply with the composition, but the
composition is important. Vitally, it has an independent chair
appointed for probably two terms of up to eight years in total, and
importantly has a consumer representative involved. At the end of the
day, as the Minister reminded us, and as her predecessor constantly
reminded us when discussing energy Bills, this is ultimately government
policy focused on benefit to the consumer, by which we mean both
business and domestic consumers. We need consumer representation and
technical, academic, economic and technological advice to the
counterparty and the Minister in drawing up these contracts. We are
looking at value for money for the consumer.</hs_para>

form of such a body. They may not approve of the wording of the

the face of it, there is no reason why this should not be extended to
capacity mechanism deals as well. I hope that the Government will see
the sense in having a body that is publicly accountable and will report
to Parliament. Certainly if the Secretary of State refuses to accept
its advice in relation to particular contracts, it will require the
Secretary of State to spell out why such advice has been rejected, and
there will be a report to Parliament.</hs_para>

O’Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> I express my support for
the amendment. A number of the utilities are doing something on their
own behalf to try to present themselves to the regulator as responsible
citizens, as it were. They tend to use expressions, such as stakeholder
engagement monitoring, which is a bit of a mouthful. If it is good
enough for the utilities to do it independently to try to present
themselves in a way that will meet the requirements of the regulator,
it is surely appropriate that this rather complex market system that we
are seeking to construct should have a degree of independence. I do not
think that it should be seen as anything other than sympathetic
monitoring. It is in everyone’s interests that the system works
and that those who monitor are credible and
independent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000048">The
manner in which it has been constructed here, as my noble friend said,
is not necessarily the final word, but the principle of having in the
Bill a monitoring mechanism that is seen to be independent—to
the extent that these things are possible—of government, the
utilities and other players is a highly desirable state of affairs.

Select Committee for many years, and it was quite clear that, worthy
though they are, Select Committees have severe limitations. They are
seen in many instances by the public to be part of bigger government as
it were, even though they try not to be. If a body was set up with
responsible leadership and credible membership it would be in
everyone’s interests. I do not think that we need to worry about
the final wording here, but were the Government to accept the principle
it would show their good intentions in saying, “We’re

certain that Select Committees in this House and the other place would

always worry when I see someone handing something to the Minister just
as you finish speaking. It usually says there is something else in the

legislation, and it is a gap that, were it to be filled in a credible
and consensual manner, would go some way to afford a degree of
credibility to what will be, for most of us, a very big leap in the
dark. No matter when we get the eventual SIs and the like, a wing and a
prayer are still involved in this whole process. This amendment would
give the public a degree of reassurance that we do not have the last

Ridley:</Member></B> My Lords, I sympathise with  a great deal
of what the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,  said, but I worry that
the amendment would be counterproductive and produce a worse result. We
had an interesting debate last week about the importance of competition
in keeping capitalists honest. We are all agreed about the danger of
setting up a system that will be extremely prone to crony capitalism,
which will be such an oligopolistic system that it will be easy to game
and to lobby the Government in ways that can be helpful. I am worried
that this panel of experts will probably make the problem worse and
will remove accountability from Parliament, which is ultimately where
we will be able to scrutinise this. As the scientist Richard Feynman
once said,</hs_para>

get the best deal for consumers of energy, whether they are pensioners,
single parents or indeed the owners of small businesses. We will not do
that by offering these extremely high strike prices and then leaving a
group of experts, who will be easily captured not just by the industry
but by other pressure groups, to monitor the system. We therefore have
to be careful when handing responsibility away from Parliament and the
Government to a panel of experts who, as I say, will be easily captured

Oxburgh:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the general thinking behind
the amendment, which is different from the amendment that we debated a
week ago about a higher-level advisory committee. I am not sure that I
agree with the noble Viscount, Lord Ridley, in 
<?notus-xml column=469?>his pessimistic approach to this. I do not see the amendment as taking
power away from Parliament or diverting interest in that way. It could
provide the kind of information and scrutiny that makes
Parliament’s role easier.</hs_para>

would make, which has not yet been made on the amendment, is that the
most important thing about a panel is not just its expertise but its
continuity. At the moment, there is very little corporate memory within
DECC, and bodies such as an expert panel can indeed provide continuity.
I agree that it has previously been very important to solve things in
this way. I therefore hope that the Government will take on board the
broad intention of the amendment.</hs_para>

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, my mind goes back to the group
set up last year under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, to look at the draft Energy Bill. My recollection is that as a
result of the evidence we received, which was very good and
knowledgeable, our main worry about the contents of the draft Bill was
the huge powers being given to Ministers. Some of that has now been
modified. For instance, there is now an infinitely better counterparty
arrangement than existed previously in the draft Bill, in which there
was almost nothing. There have also been other changes.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13072373000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000058">However, certainly in
the initial stages of the operation of this contract for difference,
one is going to be almost entirely in the hands of Ministers. They are
of course accountable to Parliament, and I entirely accept the point
made by my noble friend Lord Ridley that that is the main avenue of
accountability. What worries me is the question of whether the panel
that has been proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, would actually
make any difference. When you have so much power concentrated in the
hands of Ministers—and one has to say that there is not all that
much public faith in Parliament at the moment or in whether
parliamentary accountability would be effective—one is running
the risk of endless cases of judicial review. The growth of judicial
review in our system over the past 20 years has been absolutely
colossal. Everyone finds it possible in some way or another to take a
complaint against authority to judicial review. Some of it has no merit
at all but is enormously time consuming, very expensive for those who
have to defend it, and a great absorber of the judicial power of the
courts. I worry, given all these powers in the Bill, whether
accountability to Parliament will be
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000059">I
listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and there are
obviously some attractions in what he was saying. On the other hand,
the point made by my noble friend Lord Ridley about the way that any
panel such as this could be got at is not without substance. We are all
familiar with situations of that sort. In relation to another
amendment, which I may not be here to move because I shall not be here
in August and we will not reach it tonight, the power of very large
corporations such as the big six generators and distributors, when
contrasted with the power of very much smaller bodies that might be
affected by their activities, is something of which people are very
well  
<?notus-xml column=470?>aware. What is your remedy? You can go for judicial review, and a panel
of the sort suggested may be subject to the same
pressures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000060">All
this is inherent in the nature of the new electricity market reform,
which is the main purpose of this Bill. I agree with those who say that
there is a great deal of hope about it on the part of the Government
that it will work. I studied the paper sent to the Delegated Powers
Committee of this House, in response to its request for more
information, and wondered how anybody could make that system work. That
is my great anxiety on this issue—and I am not sure that a panel
would have any
impact.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000061">For
the remainder of the time we have to scrutinise the Bill, we must do as
much as we can to try to get the regulations in a form in which the
authorities can be made accountable to Parliament as to whether they
are in breach of regulations or not. Everybody has to do their best to
make it work, but I shall listen with great interest to what my noble
friend the Minister says in answer to the suggestion of a panel. I
think that we shall hear what we heard before—that there are a
great many advisers already in the department and they do not want any
more, thank you very much. I understand that argument. But the more I
hear about how the system is intended to work, the more we have these
huge volumes of paper that are churned out by the department, which is
doing its best to keep us informed. It fills me with great foreboding.
I hope that I am wrong, but I have a horrid suspicion that things are
not going to turn out quite as has been hoped for by everybody who has
expressed themselves, as I have, in favour of this

Berkeley:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to speak briefly in
support of the amendment. I see it as a way of advising the parties on
the details in the contracts, which are quite often unclear or not
there at all. As we have debated before, and many noble Lords have
said, we are dealing with some very large companies and very large
amounts of money are at stake. So I think there is a comfort in having
something like this, but the key is probably who will be on the expert
panel and what their background, experience and history will
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072373000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072373000065">The
Minister said in her response to the last amendment that the Government
took independent advice on the strike price and scrutiny from technical
experts. I would like to ask who they work for, or have worked for,
because I am afraid that that sometimes colours how one thinks about
these things and how they might like to think. If they are seconded
from the big six, as consultants or something, how independent are
they? It would be very helpful if the Minister could write to me and
say who these people are, and who they work 
<?notus-xml column=471?>for or have worked for. At this stage, it would give people a lot of
comfort to know that there was something like this—an expert
panel to look at these things and form an independent view on things
such as strike prices and all the other things in Clause 2. I do not
think that Members of either House, in the Chambers or the committees,
will want to look at those things in too much
detail.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-07-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_07_23_PT_1/C6FCBD568527283D854013C02BE7BB026D214E7E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 23 July 2013">Tuesday,

Liddell of Coatdyke:</Member></B> My Lords, I have great sympathy with
what my noble friend has said. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, drew
attention to the fact that we see in DECC no institutional memory. We
should put alongside that the fact that Ministers rotate regularly.
There needs to be somebody or some organisation in the middle that is
the honest broker. When I was the Energy Minister, I had a panel of
experts which was hugely valuable to me. It involved people such as
Dieter Helm and had real gravitas. It was really useful to be able to
bounce ideas off people, but this proposal takes it to another level.
My noble friend said that people in the very enclosed world of energy
policy have often had opportunities to work in the big six or for some
of the significant players in the field. It is useful to know who is
taking these decisions. To the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, I would say
that sometimes you have to spend a penny to save a penny. If you spend
your money on getting people who can stop you making mistakes, you will
avoid spending not just millions but perhaps billions of pounds making
mistakes just for the sake of a few ha’pennies to ensure that
you have proper advice. My goodness, government spends enough on
consultants. Why not put some of that money to good use getting some
expert
advice?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072379000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Verma" PimsId="5081" UID="13072379000076" xid="1929" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000076">Baroness
Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for
his amendments. Amendments 55ZF and 55ZG would set up an expert panel

or investment contracts. These are extremely important matters and I am

Government wholly agree with the noble Lord that independence, expert
scrutiny and engagement with a wide range of stakeholder views are
important principles. For the purposes of setting strike prices for
renewable technologies, we are ensuring that the process through which
those strike prices are set is transparent, robust and informed by a
full range of expert input and stakeholder consultation. On 17 July, we
launched a consultation on the proposed strike prices to allow industry
and all other stakeholders, including consumer groups, to scrutinise
the evidence and analysis that informed them. We are asking for their
feedback to inform the final strike

to ensure that the strike prices proposed by the Secretary of State in
the draft delivery plan were informed by independent advice, we asked
National Grid to conduct analysis to help to understand the potential
impacts of strike prices on government objectives. We also commissioned
an interim panel of technical experts to scrutinise that analysis
impartially. Both

process allows us to be confident that the strike prices are informed
by robust evidence in an appropriately transparent way. We have been
able to use existing powers to appoint the interim panel of technical
experts, so they are already performing their scrutiny role. Following
Royal Assent, we intend to establish an ad hoc advisory group, with
Clause 139(2)(c) providing the spending authorisation to support this
work. This, with the steps described above, will ensure that the
Secretary of State makes an informed decision having considered a full
range of views before setting the level of support in the final
delivery plan. However, I do not agree that these principles need to be

them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072379000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000029">On

Government have appointed external specialist advisers to help to
ensure that any investment represents value for money. We will publish
summaries of reports from these advisers alongside the contract, in the
event that agreement is reached, when it is laid before Parliament. In
addition, the Government made commitments and amendments in the Bill in
the other place to ensure that investment contracts are transparent.

raised concerns that the contract terms should be subject to scrutiny
and that there should be independent scrutiny before the counterparty
offered a contract. I strongly agree that the terms on which the CFD or
investment contracts are set need to be scrutinised. However, I
consider that this should be done not by a separate expert panel but by
the industry and consumer groups at large. This is why, over the past
year, we have been working with an expert group consisting of industry
and consumer group representatives in the development of key terms,
something that I am sure the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, will
welcome.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072379000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000031">We
have also had extensive discussions with industry, consumer groups and
others with regard to how contracts will be allocated. The allocation
process will be run by National Grid which will act within rules set
out in secondary legislation to allocate CFDs to eligible applicants.
The intention is that the allocation process will be rules-based and
relatively mechanistic to allow investors and developers to make an
informed decision about their chance of being allocated a contract. If
an applicant is successful, National Grid will direct the counterparty
to offer it a contract. Therefore, we do not think it appropriate to
include another process which would add considerable complexity to the
system.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072379000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0001.htm#13072379000032">We

possible accusations of conflict of interest in this because the energy
field is fairly esoteric. Nobody can be as pure as Caesar’s wife
in this area, as we have probably all found, but they would demonstrate
a degree of expertise. The Minister described it as an ad hoc technical
advisory group, which does not provide the confidence needed in the

process is being put on the best possible basis with the best possible
technical, consumer, economic and legal

“If you do this you will be subject to

that. The process in this proposed new clause would protect people
against frivolous attacks on judicial review. It would mean that the
Minister had to go through a process with a body embedded in statute,
had some responsibilities to Parliament and consisted of people with a
wide range of technical, legal and financial expertise. I am afraid
that reference to an ad hoc committee is not the same. It was also
argued that it is Parliament’s job. It would probably help
Parliament in the guise of select committees, as my noble friend Lord
O’Neill suggested, to do its job in relation to what are vital
contracts that will last for an enormously long time and have
tremendous implications for our future energy situation. At the very

terms if I were writing the proposal properly. The Government may have
views on that. Having that separate from the day-to-day
responsibilities of Ministers and officials, and the month-to-month
responsibilities of a regulator is an important part of the process
that we are putting into law. We are moving into unknown territory in

given the current uncertainties that are going on, not only around the
Bill, but a few others that I will mention. The sector says that that
is making it difficult to raise finance, which of course means that

risks and uncertainty are around the strike price and whether and how
much of their power these companies can sell. But in addition to that
there are other uncertainties such as planning. The planning system has
become better in recent years with the legislation that both
Governments have taken forward, but it is still uncertain. We still
sometimes see ministerial decisions that look a little odd. It takes
time and a lot of money, as we all know. But there is also the question
of political risk. However, it is not helpful when Ministers and, I am
sorry to say, Prince Charles, make statements about not liking
windmills or something. This does not apply only to windmills, but
these technologies should be developed and commissioned and permissions
sought for their planning on their merits, be they offshore
or onshore. We have even heard about how successful PV is in Germany

is a risk to these new developments. The renewables sector has said to

very badly. We have to take into account that a lot of these
technologies will turn out not to last as long as we thought and
deliver the benefits that we thought they would. In the case of
offshore wind, once again, it is becoming clearer by the day that the
carbon dioxide savings that offshore wind will deliver will be very
disappointing because of the need for backup power, the need for that
backup power to be open cycle, as has been mentioned, and because of

wind, other than to say that it is not a brand-new technology. I can
remember something like 20 years ago inaugurating the first offshore
wind farm at Blyth in Northumberland. The technology in its basic form
is tried and tested, and is another bit of our armoury. Those of us
who, like me, are in our prime, remember the six-day war and the
consequences of not having a wide basket of energy sources

am not 100% certain that I agree with my noble friend that we should be
talking about contracts of a length of 30 years. However, we are
talking here about a probing amendment and the uncertainties. We are
coming into a big part of the Bill, where we are going to talk about
uncertainty for investors. It is about how you secure a rate of return
and mitigate risk. That is what was in my noble friend’s mind
when he tabled his amendment, and on Thursday we will come to an
amendment from the noble Lord, Lord Roper, which also brings us back to
the issue of

support what my noble friend is trying to do. There is a bit of a
debate on the length of time, but the key to this aspect of the debate
is to remove uncertainty. When the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, was

take-off the pilot comes on and says, “Don’t worry,
I’ve never flown this plane before, but I’ll have read

it was unhelpful for anyone to say that they disliked windmills. I
dislike windmills; I happen to be able to count 11 wind farms out of my
window, which is probably more than anyone else can in the Committee,
and I would be very pleased if they were not there for 25 years. It
does not do tourism much good and, as a countryman, I think that it
spoils the country. If there were modern, different technologies that
could replace wind farms, which I agree are at the moment essential,
although perhaps not in that quantity and dispersal that I can see, I
would be only too pleased if they were

of the most interesting bits of evidence that we got in European
Sub-Committee D was how wrong everybody has been on energy in the past.
I see that the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is in agreement with me. For
those of us who were relatively new to this subject, it is fascinating
how wrong the forecasters have been time and again in the past 15
years. So for goodness’ sake let us not fall into the same
mistake of tying the Government down to a 25-year timescale when things
could change. I have absolutely no doubt that they will—and do
not let us give too much security to the producers of electricity.
Capitalism is about taking risks. In the past, people have taken
enormous risks. Some have fallen flat on their face and some have been
hugely successful. However, it should not be for us as the consumer or
the taxpayer to featherbed them; they must take a fair share of the

Verma:</Member></B> The amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, seeks to ensure that renewable technologies in receipt of a
CFD have a contract life of at least 25 years. As the noble Lord is no
doubt aware, we have recently published more detail on the contract
terms, building on the operational framework of November 2012. This
reconfirms our position that the appropriate contract length for
payments to renewable technologies receiving a generic CFD remains 15
years.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13072379000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0002.htm#13072379000058">In
determining the length of the CFD, we considered a number of factors.
The 15-year length is based on a trade-off between value for money for
consumers, affordability within the levy control framework and
bankability for investors. For the purpose of setting the contract
lifetime, we have assumed that investors will require debt to be repaid
within the CFD life. Therefore, having too short a contract length
could 
<?notus-xml column=478?>impact on the cost of debt finance, given the increased exposure to
wholesale price risk. Our analysis also indicates that investors
discount very heavily the last few years of revenue from a project,
particularly when compared to the social discount rate. Taking all
these factors into account, extending the length beyond 15
years would not necessarily be significantly valued by the investor,
but would come at a cost to consumers.</hs_para>

Lord may be aware that guidance from the European Commission states
that support must be less than the accounting life of the asset.
Extending the lifetime duration as the noble Lord proposes would extend
a CFD beyond the asset life of a number of renewables technologies,
which are generally less than 25 years. All these factors suggest to us
that a contract life of 15 years is still
appropriate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072379000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0002.htm#13072379000060">I
should also make clear that just because there is a generic contract
does not prevent the Secretary of State directing the counterparty to
issue a contract which differs on certain terms where that is
considered appropriate. We have retained the ability to do this and
would look to treat such occurrences on a case by case
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13072379000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723-gc0002.htm#13072379000061">The

mitigating them and ensuring appropriate rates of return. The strike

years, 20 years or whatever, I worked briefly on North Sea oil projects

declared her interest and I am sure that windmills will need regular

whether they will continue to operate, produce good electricity when we
want it and make a good return for their investors. We have had a

It is difficult to extrapolate with any reliability from such in vitro

suggest that the findings should be investigated further in animal
studies. We will review the findings of any such further work and then
consider appropriate action. Furthermore glyphosate is currently being

their leave may be curtailed under paragraph 323(ii) of the Immigration

and each case is considered on its merits. If the worker's leave is
curtailed, it will be reduced to expire after 60 days in

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member> The number of forfeiture cases agreed in
each of the years in question is five or fewer. It is not normal
practice to disclose exact numbers in such cases due to the risk of
identifying the individual involved. Forfeiture of pensions, in whole
or in part, may be considered following a conviction of a pension
scheme member in connection with their employment. Under the statutory
Civil Service pension scheme rules, a Minister must certify that the
individual’s offence brought the Civil Service into disrepute.
Once the Minister has issued a forfeiture certificate, Cabinet Office
officials then decide the extent to which the individuals pension
benefits should be withheld. Published guidance advises employing
departments to consult with the Cabinet Office at an early stage when
criminal proceedings are pending in relation to such
offences.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="13072356000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130723w0001.htm#13072356000248">Questions
